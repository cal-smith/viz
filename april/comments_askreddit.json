Over the next few years, the new sport developed a respectable following of a few hundred local socialites.  \n\nIt was Filipe\u2019s son, Andre Filipe Filipe, who developed what he called \u201cthe punching strategy\u201d in 1637 after seeing a schoolboy strike another in anger, causing him to fall down.  \n\nWhen Andre Filipe Filipe challenged the then-champion, British ex-patriate \u201cSleepless\u201d Bill Bishop to a match, Bishop was the odds-on favourite. You can imagine his surprise when while he was describing what he had had for breakfast that morning, Andre walked up and thumped him in the neck, sending him down \u201cfor the count\u201d in the parlance of our time.  \n\nWhile it was universally agreed that the boy had violated the spirit of the game, officials were unable to find any actual rule that punching violated, and were forced to let the victory stand.  \n\nThis upset caused an uproar in the boxing community large enough to spill over into local newspapers, and stirred the interest of many outsiders to come see what the fuss was about. The newcomers were enthralled to engage in these borderline barbaric displays of human strength and skill, and the rest is history \u2013 after a few spoilsport schoolmoms single-minded about safety added the padded gloves, of course.\n\nToday\u2019s boxing enthusiasts fantasise about the newcomer that would rock the ring the way Filipe did.  \n\nClassification of the modern ruleset has essentially locked the punching strategy into place; but it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the fantasy. Young scholars with big dreams often enter the ring with their crazy new trick, usually a variant of hypnosis. And though they\u2019ve achieved the occasional victory, none of the gimmicks have been robust enough to make it to the big-time.  \n\nThe real wonder, though, is that Andre Filipe\u2019s original vision of boxing is still around. Gentlemen\u2019s boxing clubs can be found in cities all over the world; you can visit one most any day of the week and see two erudite gentlemen exchanging pleasantries in the ring.  \n\nMost people only come to watch a few hours of a match, and then leave. But every once in a while you\u2019ll find amongst your elders a stout fellow, a die-hard fan, who perhaps witnessed that historic battle between Filipe and Bishop, who for love of the sport must stay to witness the last glorious seconds of wakefulness slip away, only to return to fight again another day.", "gilded": 0, "score": 815, "created": 1429920240.0},{"body": "Holy shit I thought you were just out of your mind.

If you like text-based games, this is the best one of its type out there. I found out about this company after playing their Dragon Age: The Last Court game prior to the release of DA3.\n\nThe game is 100% free but you can spend money for extra content storylines if you want, but what's there will keep you busy for months (possibly years), even if you play daily.\n\nBasically, it's an alternate reality story where London is somehow transported into a strange underground. It still connects to the surface, but the laws of reality down there are... peculiar. A big part of the fun is unraveling the lore and understanding what exactly has happened and who is responsible for it.\n\nBasically you get 1 action per 10 minutes, with a limit of 20 (or 40 if you donate). You increase your stats with time and you gain power and influence. The inventory system is complex and rewarding and things are fairly well balanced. I can't recommend this game enough.\n\nIf you play, you can look me up, my username in the game is SpBlue. I've been playing for months, but I'm not yet good enough to be a Patron, but we could drink coffee at Caligula's together or something.\n\nEdit : Also, if anyone would happen to have a *cough* Starveling Cat they don't need, I could really use one.

Once they merged servers you can tell how bad the communities really were on the servers that didn't have moderators. Then they came up with the idea of making servers dedicated to the language you speak, which solved part of the problem.\n\nI had invited my sister to that game back in 2010 as well, before the community was so bad. She had talked to so many bad people since then that I had to forcefully change her password and block her from playing that game, and I had looked through her PMs, which ultimately lead us to stop talking to eachother. She became so hostile to me and the things I were reading PMs from boys that were sent to her and they were absolutely outrageous and some were even illegal to say to someone at her age.

To be honest, I got tired of user-made levels pretty quickly after they were introduced, and I never was a fan of Racing rooms. Also, as much as I like the idea of hard mode and divine mode for shamans to challenge themselves, it kinda took away from everyone making creative/crazy contraptions.

As per my usual routine when I don't need to be anywhere at a particular time, I opted to go at it without the gps and go with only a map and detailed directions to my destination.  It was suppose to be a 6 hour drive from Johannesburg to the Mkhaya game reserve in Swaziland.  The story picks up a few hours into the drive.  At this point in the roadtrip, it had been three hours since I saw any sort of town or village, and although I didn't know it at the time, I was roughly 90 km past the turn I was suppose to have taken.  I gassed at every gas station I saw and had plenty of water and food in my car, so my only real concern was running out of daylight and running into hijackers who were notorious in the area.  I had less than 15 minutes left of daylight, by my estimates, and my level of concern was rising(mostly due to the fact that I was alone, without cellphone service, and not at all familiar with the area).  I came upon an unmarked exit, and it was either stay on a highway that literally hadn't taken me through anything in two hours or take my chance with an exit.  Exits tend to lead somewhere, right?  \n\nTo my relief, it was soon after that I started driving through a town; a very poor town with clay built houses and no real stores/banks/landmarks, but a town nevertheless.  It was at that point that I finally saw the sign I had been craving to see for the better part of two hours: \"lodging\".  \n\nJust to get to the lodge was a 10 minute drive on a deserted dirt path and no street lights of any kind(it was pitch dark at this point).  I finally did make it to the lodging area, and was greeted by an empty \"parking lot\" and an enthusiastic work staff.  The place was actually quite beautiful, it bordered on Kruger national park and the staff told me it gets quite busy in the summer months.  \n\nI ended up being the only guest that checked in there that night and was put up in a beautiful rondoval(name for a round hut in Africa).\n\nI went over to the bar area and proceeded to drink and socialize with the staff, who didn't really have much going on.  In the corner of this outdoor bar sat the most secluded vending machine I have ever seen or ever will see.  For a couple of beers, I sat there and pondered about how much of an effort it would be to just restock this machine.  I imagined the long journey the can of coke would have to make to find itself here, and wondered if it was even worth it to stock the machine.  Before I left that \"bar\" that night, I made my way over and clicked the button that would dispense me the bottle of coke.  \n\nI never did end up drinking that coke, I actually brought it all the way back to Seattle(USA) with me.  There is nothing really special about this bottle or any interesting or discerning characteristics.  But it will sit on my shelf for a while and every time I look at it, I'll think about where I got it from and what both it and I have been through ever since.\n\nEdit: quite a few of you thought I should create.

Typically the orange juice I stocked was the minute maid variety in the little plastic bottle. Unfortunately those won't work in a cans only bubble front. \n\nI explained to him that I can't stock this machine with this particular juice but I'd be happy to see about getting some canned oj to put in the machine for them. For some reason this was unacceptable. He started threatening me, telling me I'm racist (he was a black man), then told me he was calling my boss to get me fired. At which point I told him to go ahead and gave him my bosses number.\n\nI finished stocking the machines and left, with him still grumbling of the injustices I've done to him by refusing to stock a drink that won't fit into the machine....\n\nWhen I got back to my warehouse to restock I informed my boss of the incoming call, and went ahead and put an order in for canned oj for that machine. I restocked the truck and called it day. \n\nThe next morning when I went to service those machines there is a hand written out of order sign on the bubble front. It was roughed up pretty good too but wasn't real sure what the deal was. The machine was pulled away from the wall too. \n\nI thought maybe they moved it to clean behind or something and jammed it up. Bubble fronts like to jam up and then people tend to rough them up. I pulled the note off the machine and opened it up. As the latch released a wave of cans, broken and leaking as well as unopened undamaged, came pouring out on top of me. It was very obvious that this machine was past roughed up.\n\nSo now I'm laying on the floor surrounded by cans, soaked in soda and pretty damn mad. I called security, who I was in pretty good with for hooking them up with chocolate milk. They came and we went and pulled the camera footage. Wouldn't you know it. Shortly after I left the previous day the trucker that was upset with me, shook that machine, bounced it around and pretty much tried to body slam it. It was like this machine talked bad about his momma. I called my boss who came and once seeing the mess and damage decided both machines in the truckers lounge were being removed.\n\nSo an hour later the install techs were there with the big truck used to haul machines. They packed them up and hauled them back to our warehouse. So the truckers lost their machines and now had to travel a good 1/4 mile or more to one of the main break rooms to get food and drink.

They have some potential, but there's too many ifs. IF Jordan Clarkson keeps developing and IF Julius Randle enters the league as everything he's supposed to be and IF the Lakers draft well this year and IF they attract some good free agents on the cheap in this off-season, then maybe they can have a decent season next year, but IMO it'll be closer to what the Timberwolves looked like this year: not a lot of winning while their young talent starts to actually develop. But on top of all that, Lin is just clearly not happy there. Visibly clashed with Kobe and Byron Scott has all but said he doesn't want him back next year, which works out well for Lin since he'll be a free agent. I think potentially playing alongside young stars or potential stars like Davis, Antetokounmpo, and Parker in a fresh situation where he has some more ability to set expectations going in will appeal to him more than returning to a rebuilding team where he just had to endure a dumpster fire of a season with a head coach who doesn't want him and a living legend he can't play with.", "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "created": 1430061265.0},{"body": "I agree, the media kills slightly above average (but not superstar) level players.

As you know its not the cancer itself that kills you but how it impacts your other organs (for you most likely your lungs).\n\nRegarding pain: cancer can be extremely painful but make sure you advocate and get good pain medication and you can also get things to help that with anxiety. Maybe you won't have a lot of pain but if you don't be shy about asking for heavy duty pain meds. Of narcotics aren't enough there are other things that can help.\n\nThere is the possibility of dying suddenly in your sleep and I obviously don't know what that feels like. Otherwise Generally as you are dying you will become weaker and unable to get out of bed. Some people become confused or delirious. People tend to lose their appetite and stop drinking. \nMost people lose consciousness when they start getting pretty close (but maybe you will be able to hear). As you get closer your heart rate will probably speed up and then begin to slow down (dropping blood pressure). Breathing starts to get irregular (called Cheyenne stokes respirations) where you will irregular breathing with pauses. A lot of people have secretions in their lungs that they can't clear properly. This can cause a gurgling known as a death rattle which can be petty disturbing for families to hear. There are meds we can give to help dry up secretions. At some point your heart will stop beating or you may stop breathing first and then your heart will stop a bit afterwards.  I'll try to find you some good web resources \n\nHere are some issues and what can be done \n- anxiety: there are meds to help with. Support from loved ones. Talk with your nurse, we want to help. If you are spiritual or religious this can be a source of comfort. Music and a comfortable environment help \n- pain: talk to your doctors. If you have a lot see if there are pain specialists.\n- shortness of breath: this can be scary. Morphine can help with this, as can anti anxiety meds. A fan blowing air across your face can help. \n- death rattle: I'm told that this is more alarming for the family than the patient as they are usually not awake at this point. There are meds that help with this.\n\nAnother thing: make sure your family knows your wishes in regards to what kind of care you want. Do you want iv fluid if you stop drinking? Do you want oxygen? Eye donation? If you are very sick and have an infection do you want it treated (cancer patients may develop infections when they become quite sick). Hospice or palliative care at home? Does your family know if you want cpr or not? \n\nHere are online resources:\n\nhttps://www.hospicenet.org/html/preparing_for.html\n\nhttp://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/supportivecare/lasthours/healthprofessional/page2 \n(This is more geared at care givers but has good info)\n\nI did a palliative care course awhile ago and can probably find some more resources for you if you are interested.\n\nEdit:\nhttp://www.virtualhospice.ca/en_US/Main+Site+Navigation/Home/Topics/Topics/Final+Days/When+Death+Is+Near.aspx", "gilded": 2, "score": 348, "created": 1429507501.0},{"body": "I always wanted to know if I could get away with murder.\n\nNot because I want to murder someone, I want to know if I'm smart enough to outwit the police/cover my tracks well enough that I'd get away with it.\n\nPerhaps it's because I've seen a bunch of crime dramas that pull something out of their ass as a way to gather evidence and move the plot forward.", "gilded": 0, "score": 503, "created": 1429488181.0},{"body": "Here is the truth.

She even admitted that going through with the pregnancy and raising the child wasn't what was best for anyone, but didn't care.\n\nIt doesn't help that her issues were what caused the pregnancy in the first place (basically it was supposed to be safe, she lied. It wasn't. She was trying to get herself pregnant because she had \"baby fever\". She admitted that much). She's got major issues.\n\nShe isn't fit for parenthood. She suffers from auditory delusions and paranoia that she willingly indulges in (she talks to the voices) and either lies or deludes herself into thinking she's told the truth whenever she says anything. She's not stable enough to take care of herself, let alone a child. And the problem is her doctors (psychiatrist and therapist) only see her once every three months because she wanted to see them as little as possible. They seem to be only interested in taking her money instead of actually helping her, because no professional worth their salt would tell her that she's perfectly capable of raising a child and that her condition presents no problems whatsoever. She nearly *killed* her stepbrother when he was born because she got tired of being paranoid about his wellbeing and her voices talking about him all the time. She often takes things out on people when her voices are talking about them too often.\n\nAnd *I'm* not currently fit for parenthood. I'm not very good at taking care of myself. My depression is bad enough to where I can't even get the motivation to get help, *because* of my depression and related issues. It's not one of those \"I feel terrible so it motivates me to kill myself\" kinds of depression and suicidal tendency. My depression robs me of even that way out of it.\n\nAnd together? Geez. Her and I would be far worse for any child together than we would be separately. But now that it's been developing inside of her (it's still only a month or so in), she's convinced herself that that's what's happening. She fakes pregnancy symptoms (ones that can't happen that early on) and absolutely refuses to have any conversation about adoption options, or even at least considering what needs to be done to ensure any child she raises is getting what they need. She doesn't even want the child to go anywhere without her being there (in the future). And I'm not talking as a baby, she means to be attached to the hip of that child until they are nearly an adult. So if I wanted to be in this child's life, she made it clear I'd have no input as a parent. As anything.\n\nAnd all of this and so much more could have been avoided if she got an abortion after the first pregnancy test (which apparently was positive after only a week). The pregnancy already has made her go down a way worse road mentally than she already had been before it, and now she can't even take her medication. So it's going to get even worse.\n\nI want to be a parent someday. So bad. It's the one thing I've wanted more than anything.

If the baby has been handled by care workers before being given to the mother, sometimes they'll douse it with weird smelling soaps and shit and that can be a rather offensive smell (if you are a care worker or staff member reading this: please don't ever do this, ok? It really fucks up the grieving experience for mothers. We want our babies to smell like themselves). \n\nHowever, they can look very very different depending on how long it's been since the baby passed. A baby that has spent more than a few days inside the womb after passing will have what's called \"skin slippage\", which is exactly what it sounds like. It's not pretty. Often times nurses or other volunteers will help sort of push everything back into place before placing the baby in the parents arms to make it less jarring. Prolonged contact or rubbing of the skin will cause it to blister and slip more (I know of a mother who rubbed her baby's hand for some time, and after a blister and slippage formed, was very alarmed because no one had let her know this would happen ahead of time). Bruising also appears very quickly, especially around the lips and eyes. Out of all the stillborn and recently deceased babies I have worked with, I've seen one that still had pink-ish lips, and that was because it had been born alive and died only an hour or so before.\nBabies like that example, who died only recently after birth or died just shortly before it, honestly look the same as a regular living baby and to the untrained eye it can be rather jarring. My (dead) baby was born alive and died after a few hours, and when I held him I spent a long time just sort of waiting for him to take a breath because he truly looked no different than a living, sleeping infant. The bruising and colour shifts formed slowly over a period of hours.\n\nA stillborn baby coming out will feel the same to the mother giving birth, but very different to the care provider that's facilitating. For one, the skull bones feel very \"loose\"; at times it can literally feel like the top of the head is made of large puzzle pieces just sort of sitting inside loose skin. Whereas in a live baby they're much more firm. They move and give, yes, but they don't feel like they're just floating about.\nThe longer the baby has been \"out\" after dying, the squishier and more fluid their body starts to become. Eventually you'll start getting 'leakage' of bodily fluids (generally clear or slightly pink) from areas that have heavy slippage. The more the baby has been handled and repositioned, the faster this happens. This is also why, when a baby dies, it's put in a fridge to preserve it as much as possible so family members can say goodbye and have a chance to hold them if wanted.\nWhen my baby died, before I got into working with other parents suffering the same fate, I was really surprised to hear that part. I imagined my son all wrapped up in blankets sitting next to someone's sandwich and can of diet Coke in the staff room or something. And while they don't store lunches in the same area... it's actually a lot like that. At my local hospital they store the babies in the garbage room (which I personally really hate), and have a special sort of \"Bar fridge\" that they're put in.

From there it's just a matter of going with the \"feel\" of the room. 99% of the time it's as-is photos of parents just having their moments together, and I try very hard to be as unobtrusive to their process as humanely possible. I don't use big flashing lights (having a good camera with high ISO capability is key for this, as well as some nice fast prime lenses. My 60mm macro is excellent for this) or props or any of that because it starts to feel very invasive and cheap for many parents. I offer it, if the feel seems right, but no one has ever wanted it. About half the parents want photos with them, and the other half just want me by myself with the baby. I focus the most on detail shots (fingers, knuckles, ears, spiral of hair, etc) and those are the most appreciated.", "gilded": 0, "score": 23, "created": 1429493202.0},{"body": "That's incredible.

She did end up having a tear on her scalp. We held her for hours as did everyone in our family. We took tons if pictures. The hospital experience was sad. The door to my room had a black sign on it warning housekeeping and other workers this was not a normal delivery. She had a normal smell and looked just like a tiny baby.
