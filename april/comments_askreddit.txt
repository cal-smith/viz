 OH yes, this time-suck. I like to call it, "What language is that sign in?" or, "How brown are those pedestrians?" or, "Fuck Australia for looking like everything." Then you start recognizing license plates from Poland and you know you are in too deep.  "Mhmh, this church's style combined with that add ? it ought to Belarus."
 Me once: Latvian bus on a Russian highway? Must be the M9 to Moscow, *click*, 500 m out! Brazilian road ? it's nearly always the same one. Just follow it until you find matching city names. One time, I found myself stuck on this highway and I just kept going west for what was probably 30 minutes. Still couldn't figure out where I was. Turns out I was in Western Australia. Fuck whenever the game gives you Western Australia.

EDIT: Or remote Russia. Anything else I can figure out given enough time but not those two. Those are impossible unless you understand Russian or are a dingo. Nah.  Australia or other random highways, just go til you find a sign.  Then triangulate from where the sign is relative to your starting point.

Russia, I know some Cyrillic so it helps quite a bit with finding where I am.  Russian towns tend to have massive signs whereever the exit to a highway is (sometimes, anyway) or other useful landmarks.

The only thing that messes with me is the really low quality, grainy images you occasionally get.  Makes it really hard to read signs. [Frog Fractions](http://twinbeard.com/frog-fractions)

Just keep playing and you'll see what I mean.

Edit: we may have hugged the site to death. [You can also play it here](http://jayisgames.com/games/frog-fractions/) If you came back wondering what ZincHead was talking about, Just. Keep. Playing. No. Seriously, just... Christ, just keep going. Within the first 2 minutes, I was wonder what at all this had to do with fractions other than eating bugs and fractions appearing, and then... and then I was awakened. Can't stress this enough. We're not trolling. Without ruining it, just keep going till the end. And use all of your arrow keys :3 I am now in a text adventure game. All of my wat. i cant seem to go any further than here I'm too high for this shit. Hey thanks! I'm one of the people who made it, never in my wildest dreams did I expect it to take off like it did, let alone have fans and see it in threads like this! Thank you for your support! Now I gotta get back to working on the sequel... That is so awesome! Also, screw you. But also, you are awesome! As conceived in 1632 by Portuguese printing press operator Andre Filipe, boxing was a gentlemens game in which two men would square off and regale each other with stories monotonous for days on end until one of them fell to the ground from boredom or exhaustion. Over the next few years, the new sport developed a respectable following of a few hundred local socialites.  

It was Filipes son, Andre Filipe Filipe, who developed what he called the punching strategy in 1637 after seeing a schoolboy strike another in anger, causing him to fall down.  

When Andre Filipe Filipe challenged the then-champion, British ex-patriate Sleepless Bill Bishop to a match, Bishop was the odds-on favourite. You can imagine his surprise when while he was describing what he had had for breakfast that morning, Andre walked up and thumped him in the neck, sending him down for the count in the parlance of our time.  

While it was universally agreed that the boy had violated the spirit of the game, officials were unable to find any actual rule that punching violated, and were forced to let the victory stand.  

This upset caused an uproar in the boxing community large enough to spill over into local newspapers, and stirred the interest of many outsiders to come see what the fuss was about. The newcomers were enthralled to engage in these borderline barbaric displays of human strength and skill, and the rest is history  after a few spoilsport schoolmoms single-minded about safety added the padded gloves, of course.

Todays boxing enthusiasts fantasise about the newcomer that would rock the ring the way Filipe did.  

Classification of the modern ruleset has essentially locked the punching strategy into place; but its easy to get caught up in the fantasy. Young scholars with big dreams often enter the ring with their crazy new trick, usually a variant of hypnosis. And though theyve achieved the occasional victory, none of the gimmicks have been robust enough to make it to the big-time.  

The real wonder, though, is that Andre Filipes original vision of boxing is still around. Gentlemens boxing clubs can be found in cities all over the world; you can visit one most any day of the week and see two erudite gentlemen exchanging pleasantries in the ring.  

Most people only come to watch a few hours of a match, and then leave. But every once in a while youll find amongst your elders a stout fellow, a die-hard fan, who perhaps witnessed that historic battle between Filipe and Bishop, who for love of the sport must stay to witness the last glorious seconds of wakefulness slip away, only to return to fight again another day. Holy shit I thought you were just out of your mind. This game is great. I got lost in the water for 15 minutes going in circles. I clearly had no interest in the Bug Mars visa. Fuck that judge. This game is a depiction of how Saints Row evolved. What the fuck. And Frog Fractions 2 is coming at some point! It might even be out already (probably not yet though) This is the only correct answer. *Andr Felipe Felipe*. Frog Fractions is the red pill of the internet.  I wound up playing the first stage far longer than I care to admit before figuring out how to progress How in the world am I supposed to get enough fruit to get the warpdrive upgrade? I get 10 a round if I am lucky. I feel like I am doing it wrong.

EDIT: Right after I posted this I figured it out. Oops I have no fucking idea what I'm doing. What am I supposed to do? Why does his tongue get really long only sometimes? Is there something I'm missing? First off, you may want to try checking Kongregate. There's a lot of crap, but also a lot of good stuff there.

My personal favorites are Cursed Treasure: Don't Touch My Gems and its level pack and sequel. (Though I think the sequel isn't as good.)

There are also great ones there like Burrito Bison Revenge and The Company of Myself. I also highly suggest you play Burn the Rope.

But, really, if we're looking for the one best game to play, it's easily going to be Robot Unicorn Attack. Also: [Don't Shit Your Pants](http://www.kongregate.com/games/rete/dont-shit-your-pants) is on there if you want a *real* masterpiece.

The guys who made it went on to create Rogue Legacy. &gt; Robot Unicorn Attack.

Play it on mute or be prepared to sing Always, by Erasure, *all day long* for the rest of your miserable life.  &gt; Play it on mute

And nullify 9/10ths of the purpose of playing this game? 
 OPEN YOUR EYES I SEE YOUR EYES ARE OPEN... Wear no disguiiiiiiiise for meeeee, come into the opennnnnnn When it's cold (when it's cold)

Edit: HOLY BALLSACKS GOLD [deleted] HOW CAN YOU NOT MENTION LEARN TO FLY 2??!! Con-gratulations, you managed to kill that boss you see The Grinning Colossus.
You're the hero we all wish we could be! [deleted] I've got balloons TD up on the other tab BTD5 is seriously one of the best flash games out there. I've had hours of entertainment from it. 

Can't wait for TD6.  I don't think BTDVI is going to happen. BTDV came out like five years ago, I think it would be made by now if it was going to be made. Try btd battles or bloons monkey city if you havent. They both use the td5 engine but are really addictive and have a good small community.  Something I noticed about BTD online or versus or whatever it is, some kind of multiplayer, is that it's heavily unbalanced. Engineer monkey is OP as shit. Can literally generate money after a certain point and by that time it's over.

Unless you fight someone with the same strategy anyway.

Although I did make a vector of the graphic logo because I was bored and wanted a project to do... Think you mean Bloons TD Just write the goddamn paper. Fuck you, it's not due till Sunday! IT'S A POWERPOINT

AND FUCK YOU That's not a gentle correction at all. 
 NEITHER IS AN ACADEMIC DISMISSAL I was absolutely addicted to [A Dark Room](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/). Don't look up any FAQs or hints or anything. Just roll with it and discover every part of the game yourself. It's a unique gaming experience you can only do once.

Edit: If that's not your style, try out [CandyBox](http://candies.aniwey.net/)

Edit 2: Also, here's an [unique RPG](http://www.nekogames.jp/g.html?gid=PRM) that's stripped down to just numbers.

Edit 3: Posting about A Dark Room got me addicted again. I also just found the "lights off" button in the lower left. So pretty, it's easy on the eyes. the fire is roaring. ***stoking intensifies*** The room is warm. My fucking hut burned down, so yes the fire is roaring. I WANT ANOTHER CART SO I CAN GATHER MORE WOOD 
 Dedicate your whole population to wood gathering until you have a full village with maxed houses The huts keep burning down :( I'm still waiting for the "hold fire safety seminar" button to show up below "check traps". For an added effect, play A Dark Room with rainymood.com in the background! My villagers were really irresponsible. Kept burning their houses down and dying. Does the first have jumpscares? no, not at all.  That's *exactly* what someone would say if it *did* have jump scares. Don't fall for it. If I were jump scared by a text based game I wouldn't even be mad. Yeah. I would be _scared_. Winnie the Pooh's home run derby. Its like Dark Souls, but with baseball. how the fuck are you supposed to play this shit.

how is this a game for children. That's the joke; themed and hosted on a site for kids yet programmed poorly enough to make it stupid difficult. I don't see how it's programmed poorly. I think it's just intentionally difficult as fuck Not too difficult until you reach level 3. Motherfucker Piglet throws 'em like lightning. I beat piglet first try.

Kanga however. I frustration exited due to her. Don't... Don't you mean "rage quit"?  **Did I fucking stutter?** How long have you waited for that one? I laughed a lot.   This game is responsible for me saying sentences I've never thought I would say before.

LUMPY YOU MOTHERFUCKER I WILL SHOVE EEYORE'S TAIL UP YOUR ASS FOR THAT BULLSHIT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RD-O9zGv10 some dunk on it for ya [Dunk's the second thing i think of when WtPHRD is mentioned] (http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/472/295/70a.gif) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F3WyFYVj10 Enjoy. Think of how much worse our lives would be without Japan. That was impressively well done. Pooh slaying Titan Robin is not something I expected to see today, or ever, but here we are. After playing the game, this was thoroughly enjoyable to watch.  That game made me more beast than man. [LINK! For the lazy!](http://games.disney.com/winnie-the-pooh-home-run-derby) THIS SHIT IS FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE AND I'M ON STAGE 1 I passed the first level on the second try. This doesn't seem awful yet. I'll keep going and figure out what the fuss is about. 

EDIT: Stage two is already harder. This is going to consume my life.

EDIT2: Passed stage two on the second try. Just had to get used to Lumpy's throw.

EDIT3: YOU CAN LEVEL UP STATS! That'll help me beat this little bitch, piglet

EDIT4: after leveling stats the game got a lot easier. I think you may have overlooked the stats, which made it a lot harder. 

EDIT5: Nevermind...balls get curvy

EDIT6: Stuck on owl now, still dreading the legendary C Rob

EDIT7: FUCK THIS I CAN'T BEAT FUCKING OWL I'VE BEEN TRYING FOR A FUCKING HOUR NOW ON THIS STUPID FUCKING DISNEY GAME I HOPE THE CREATOR OF THIS GAME HAS A WONDERFUL MARRIAGE THAT IS CUT SHORT BY BOTH OF THEM GETTING SUPER-CANCER AND THEY DIE A HORRIFIC DEATH BY FIRE WHILE THEY BEGIN THE NEW TREATMENT THAT SHOULD FINALLY WORK

EDIT8: GOLD!!! Thanks kind stranger. Also, maybe super-cancer was too far. just regular cancer would be fine.  If I remember correctly, the japanese version is much more difficult. Could be wrong though.
 I've never played it or even of heard of it, but I can guarantee that's correct.  Kanga and Roo can eat my ass real balls have curves. I beat Tigger, but never beat Christopher Robin....

And you guys should definitely look up the fanart/videos that are probably all on [knowyourmeme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/winnie-the-poohs-home-run-derby) by now. Playing this game without immersing yourself in all that is the same as being apart of the original run of TPP and not knowing there's a lore.

PSYCHE! That's the wrong link! 

Edit: Of course I would get gold on a post like this. Thanks y'all.  Oooooooooooooooh OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH! My god that was well played. I was just playing this earlier and came here to suggest it. I also pre-ordered it awhile ago.  Town of Salem is a really fun game, check it out [Link for anyone interested](http://blankmediagames.com/TownOfSalem/). It's a mafia game with a load of different roles so every game is different.

It's tricky to start with, but it's not serious at all that it doesn't matter if you don't know what the hell you're doing, and it's a ton of fun.

edit: Here's [the wiki](http://town-of-salem.wikia.com/) if you want to know more Just don't help the opposite team really.  It pisses me off when a teammate of mine decides "fuck it, I'm helping the mafia/town/neutrals" and ruins the detective work of the game. What's your username so I can put you as my referrer?  Does anyone still play Kingdom of Loathing? I think I still have an account in there... Just got back in to it since they have a mobile interface now.

edit: Welcome back to the kingdom, n00bs :) Seriously? There goes my evening  There is a mobile interface now?!? Yes sir! We have a reddit clan too, Reddit united. I recommend checking the game out again, there's a lot of work done in the last year alone and community is quite active. They've even done a lot to make the game more newbie friendly [Quake 3](http://www.quakelive.com/)

Yes, you can play Quake 3 in a browser now. It's actually been around for a few years. Still amazes me. I remember when it came out in high school and I almost shit my pants. Had to buy a new graphics card to run it. Came here just to post Quakelive. This is not particularly casual though, online multiplayer is brutal. You can play with bots to practice your strafing before jumping in. Highly recommended if you're fed up with CoD and just want some Arena action. [Fallen London](http://fallenlondon.storynexus.com/). If you like text-based games, this is the best one of its type out there. I found out about this company after playing their Dragon Age: The Last Court game prior to the release of DA3.

The game is 100% free but you can spend money for extra content storylines if you want, but what's there will keep you busy for months (possibly years), even if you play daily.

Basically, it's an alternate reality story where London is somehow transported into a strange underground. It still connects to the surface, but the laws of reality down there are... peculiar. A big part of the fun is unraveling the lore and understanding what exactly has happened and who is responsible for it.

Basically you get 1 action per 10 minutes, with a limit of 20 (or 40 if you donate). You increase your stats with time and you gain power and influence. The inventory system is complex and rewarding and things are fairly well balanced. I can't recommend this game enough.

If you play, you can look me up, my username in the game is SpBlue. I've been playing for months, but I'm not yet good enough to be a Patron, but we could drink coffee at Caligula's together or something.

Edit : Also, if anyone would happen to have a *cough* Starveling Cat they don't need, I could really use one. The Starveling Cat! THE STARVELING CAT!

Edit 2: Thanks to EarthboundDevil, I now have the dubious honor of living with a hostile, unpettable, ugly and mangy Starveling Cat. Thanks a lot. I think.
 Anyone who likes this should absolutely look at A Sunless Sea by them which is a full priced release but also a full fleshed out game by them I have Sunless Sea, but it's hard to fully enjoy it if you haven't played Fallen London before. Also, there were some very huge balance issues last time I played, although it was shortly after release so I bet it's better now. 

I think Fallen London is the superior game between the two. I'd take a stab at QWOP. Especially if you're the kind of person who, after fucking up once, will play something for hours to prove to yourself that you can do it, while continuously acknowledging how stupid it is

Edit: now that I'm thinking about this game again, I really just picture it taking up like 3 years of Bush's presidency.  That kind of describes how I play most of the games on my phone. I don't even like angry birds but when I fail those stupid fucking pigs smile like they're better than me so I have to show them that they are not. [deleted] Pigs fuck their own kind. I usually just fall into a tripod stance with one leg stretched ahead of me with the other being knee against the ground, followed by inching myself forward for half an hour before reaching the end and getting a horrible score. GIRP is exactly the same but on the polar opposite end of the spectrum, similar controls but zen as *FUCK* The one you can play Chrome has no internet connection Uh? What?

"... K, pull up your Chrome and click the pixel-y dino that shows up, then press spacebar."

"WHAT THE HELL IS THAT GOING TO DO?! HOW IS THIS GOING TO FIX MY INTE- huh..." This is my go to game when I have time to kill. I still can't get past 1000. I went over a thousand and was genuinely disappointed when I was interrupted by the page actually loading.

TLDR of the story: I accidentally lost the mailing list that our company had acquired at a conference last summer (due to a bug in Google Docs offline mode). Reddit came to our rescue and gave us tens of thousands of signups, and thanks to that, a huge portion of Prismata's current players are redditors.

It's really cool that people remember and recognize us! Cheers to you all!

To answer a few of the questions people have asked below:

* **What's the status of the game?** Closed alpha.
* **Is Prismata a web game?** Yes and no. Prismata is a full PC game, but we have a browser-playable build of the game available. We just got approved on Steam Greenlight and we hope to be on Steam sometime later this year.
* **How can I play?** Sign up on [our site](http://prismata.net/) where it says "Alpha Key Signup" and we will send you a key when one is available.

You'll figure it out Still so happy to see this linked whenever this type of thread comes up... THANKS!

I hope to disgust everyone with the sequel. Thanks for making Happy Wheels! The user-made levels are always so shit, they keep making sword throw/matrix/bottle run/rope swings. But it's addicting in a way if you get what I'm saying Did someone say.... sequel? Was enjoying this thread until this total jerk face showed up. Just kidding! What's this you say about a sequel? You're responsible for so many awful sentences coming out of my mouth in HS.


"YOU STUPID SHITFUCKING BIKE RIDING MOTHERFUCK." Is a personal favourite. Came here to do the same. It's an awesome game! Oh man I remember playing that game in high school all the time. For some reason I checked the timestamp to see how old you were.  How long ago? I'm in high school now and Happy Wheels is still the shit. It was only 3 years ago but in internet time that's eons. Heh, I remember my freshman year of high school three years ago. That game pretty much dominated my life. 8th grade 5 years ago. All's we did was try to stab the baby on spikes while at high speed. While a junior and senior I took a videography class and played this so much. I got really good at that game.  I remember first playing this game in law school...

Christ, I feel old. How young are you? It's only been around for a couple years... A year is a millennium in internet time. Thank you for bringing that into my life. That game is my shit.  Pewdiepie ruined that game for me.  toby did it for me. Anyone play Renaissance ravager and prehistoric pilgrim on the featured? I made those. This really ought to be higher. Happy Wheels is such an awesome, hilarious game. The physics and the gore always has me burst out in belly laughs. Assuming OP's not at work, this would be my choice. Sword throwing = love There goes my night.  Pewdiepie killed that game for me. Back in my day we didn't have no fancy YouTubulars to discover games for us!

In all seriousness, although good levels are difficult to find these days, 9/10. True. All the featured levels are really good though. I love making levels just as much as playing them. played till i was on the drug lvl and a clown made me insecure about being alone. Thanks m8 How...Edit: Nm, it was a cruel joke to start on that combine level. My baby cousin (16 yrs old) introduced me to that game. We used to play that shit for hours.  Holy shit that still exists? ...yeah. That was fun in high school, until they blocked it. Even then we found ways around their security  Man, I spent so many hours in those sword throw levels. It's my absolute favorite browser game of all time Holy shit, I remember that! Be sure to look at the featured levels or top user levels of all time. Lots of the more recent ones are rehashes of various "sword/ball throw" levels [Transformice](http://www.transformice.com/) I love transformice but I hate some of the chat that goes on It's horrible when people on the English servers refused to speak anything but Portuguese.  They even made a whole new server for native English speakers who were especially racist, so that means no one calls out the brs on EN1 anymore, soooooo. It's basically just a br 2, lol.  You mean immaturity? I've never seen it that bad. Most people are really helpful to new shamans as well. See I was on it again for the first time in a while and because I couldn't sham properly on a level I'd never seen before I got all sorts of abuse :( Yeah, it sucked but I just ignored it, no point getting angry or upset. "GIVE ME BALLOONS YOU BITCH" As a guy who has been playing this game since a few months after the game's release (Back in 2010), I can tell you that the community has gone to shit ever since the server merging.

There used to be EN1, EN2, BR1-5 and a bunch of servers that has no moderators. Once they merged servers you can tell how bad the communities really were on the servers that didn't have moderators. Then they came up with the idea of making servers dedicated to the language you speak, which solved part of the problem.

I had invited my sister to that game back in 2010 as well, before the community was so bad. She had talked to so many bad people since then that I had to forcefully change her password and block her from playing that game, and I had looked through her PMs, which ultimately lead us to stop talking to eachother. She became so hostile to me and the things I were reading PMs from boys that were sent to her and they were absolutely outrageous and some were even illegal to say to someone at her age. I'd also like to tell you that she is older than me and she knows what she was doing.

The TFM community is the worst I have ever seen. There is NO chat filter (that filter they put only blocks bad words that you see, but if you send a bad word everyone else can see it if they have filter disabled) and there have been moderators abusing their power countless times, I've been banned for things I've never done simply because someone else told them to ban me.

TL;DR Community is bad. Do the right thing and do not play TFM. I have seen more things about that game than anyone else.

Edit: I don't care if you think what I did was wrong regarding changing the password to my sister's account. The only thing I did wrong was inviting her to the game, and that's that. You will not change my mind. &gt; I'd also like to tell you that she is older than me and she knows what she was doing.

uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Your sister must be a better person than I am; if my younger brother changed my password to a game I would quite possibly murder him. Yeah this is opposite of the normal double standard situation that you usually see on reddit.  If I had a little sister that was trying to cockblock me and/or police my online activities I would lose it. I have to agree with you. I've played the game starting sometime in the middle of 2010, and I don't really get the same enjoyment from it anymore on the rare occasion that I choose to play a couple rounds. A part of it has to do with the community and the server changes (I miss the Kongregate servers). Idk, maybe I'm just old now. 

I'm also a little turned off at how complicated the game has become. On rare occasions that I do decide to play a couple of rounds, I'm usually playing Vanilla mode. To be honest, I got tired of user-made levels pretty quickly after they were introduced, and I never was a fan of Racing rooms. Also, as much as I like the idea of hard mode and divine mode for shamans to challenge themselves, it kinda took away from everyone making creative/crazy contraptions. Because these two modes are harder, shamans are pigeonholed into using the same build in order to solve maps, because it's the only possibly build they can use given their restrictions. And i guess shaman skill trees are cool....?  If there were a version released without the sham trees and modes I'd start playing again. I'd even tolerate their dumbass events, but the sham trees are what killed it for me. :/ No one knows how to build anymore. Seriously, a complete vanilla version of the game would get me completely re-hooked onto it. No extra modes. No shaman skill trees. No divine mode (although I could tolerate hard mode). 

&amp;nbsp;
&gt; No one knows how to build anymore.

LMAO seriously. That's why when I play now, I'll usually show off and quickly build a nice set of stairs (still got the muscle memory to do it quickly), force everyone onto an airship, or make something else I remember from the early days of the game. IMO so much of the game's novelty was seeing how creative people could get with a limited set of tools. With all the shaman trees, everyone's just focused on saving all the mice so they could level up faster, so everyone uses the same stale build to solve maps. (I do like the shaman skills that increase casting range/speed though.) Personally I liked the user made levels more, they add variety. Of course the variety was good, but I just got tired of a whole lot of them, especially gimmicky levels and super hard platforming ones. Art levels were cool, but I'd rather have a gallery for them instead of having to play them. And of course there were levels that were just jumbled up messes of random blocks. There were some great user levels, but they were just too few and far between, IMO. I remember merging the Kong server with the EN server, that was bad enough. What the fuck? You changed your sisters password and forced her not to play the game .. And she's older than you?

Other than that, I've had none of the experiences you've had. I started playing in August 2010 and between the rage-y Brazilians and the annoying 11-year olds, people are super friendly. Do remember that there's an ignore button.

(edit: yeah, 2010, not 2008) Hey Dedax Hey Deet I invited her to the game, and I do not regret blocking her access to the game.

Also, the game began in 2010 not 2008. Don't be such a liar. That's a surprisingly fun game, but it honestly has a worse community than LoL or DotA. It's filled with tons of asshole kids that care way too much about being the first ones done. Just ignore the chat if you're going to give this game a try for the first time. It's only ever filled with whining and hypocritical accusations. That used to be great about four to five years ago. I spent like a thousand hours on it, like two whole semesters of college doing nothing but sitting in my little dorm room playing Transformice. And sometimes in class when I could get away with it. It makes me incredibly sad to say that it's gone down the toilet over time. It's still a nice game to play honestly, I personally like to play it as a 'loner', without a tribe or friends, just for the fun, it's cool. Also without all the cheated shaman stuff. Man, I don't blame you. The community is such shit. I had a tribe of a few friends I was very close with, and have some great memories with them, but now that it's disbanded... It's just still hard to comprehend how lucky I was to find them. It seems like everyone else is either 12 or an idiot, just people I generally *wouldn't* want to interact with.

^^^I ^^^miss ^^^my ^^^friends ^^^so ^^^much That was what was so great about the game, back then. I also had a really close group of friends, and now I couldn't find even one of them if I tried. And I've certainly tried.  Aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. :/ And sorry if this is suber obvious, but you've tried CFM, right? I reach out to my former tribe members on cfm sometimes, but it's awkward and they're not as receptive without the group dynamic. Oh god that game was addictive.  My friend and I once played Transformice daily for like three weeks straight and we could never figure out what the hell was happening/supposed to be happening. Once you learn to walljump, you have completed the game. More or less. Nothing afterwards is surprising. Played a bit in 2010, and in five years I failed to find a worse community My 12 year old little sister plays Transformice. I am getting worried if she's playing a same game with grown men. I once saw a glimpse of the chat and already saw that it's really not suitable for kids in so young age.  Man I used to love doing bootcamps back in the day I haven't played it in years though. RIP Outsiders.  Was wonderful upto around 2012. I still try to frequent room 4 on en, but alas there's almost no reason to. This should be higher on the list. People will probably be looking for more action or real-time suggestions, but I'll say:  
**Dominion**, probably the best deckbuilding game around. If you're not sure what deckbuilding is, but you like turn-based games with cards, you should just check it out, as you might be missing out on something you'll love. On mobile and haven't got a link, but just google "Play Dominion", I think...  
  
**Town of Salem**, great social deduction game with hidden roles (you may be familiar with Werewolf or Mafia, on which this is based). Each match can take some time, but it's really fun if you're into this kind of game.  Has Achievements, too, which is neat.  Dominion also gets my vote. It is a very addictive game and I have spent many many hours playing it. 

There is also a physical card game which you can buy to play with friends. That is how I started with dominion. It is a fun game with a lot of variety since you pick out ten types of cards from a deck if twenty or so, making every game different, as the way cards interact make the path to victory different each time. It is a very clever game. 

The bots on the website are very good and you can also play against humans, many of whom are experts, unfortunately for the new players. I was hoping they introduce a grading system so good players only play other good players. You can see people's rating so you could pick and choose who to play. 

There are many versions/decks for dominion. I suggest sticking to the basic game as there is a lot of chess-like skill in it alone. There is a learning curve to how you stack your deck, like in Magic. So practice in basic before moving to other decks.  Dominion is great.  Didn't need to know there's a browser version...bastard. It could be worse - you could have found out back when there was a better* version with all the expansions for free. dominion.isotropic.org is still bookmarked for me. RIP.

*I'm so biased. It was a cleaner, stabler, more lightweight implementation that would run on whatever phone or windows 95 computer you wanted to run it on. Town of Salem is a fun time killer. [Link to the game](https://www.playdominion.com/Dominion/gameClient.html) Man, playdominion is such garbage. It was so, so, so much better back in the days of isotropic... There it is, thanks :) Darn, at first I thought you meant "dominion", the web game by kamikaze games.  That was fun. Well, now that someone has told you about the existence of this other Dominion, you owe it to yourself to check it out! I play a lot of boardgames and this one stays tied for favorite so far. What's your other favorite? My top three are Dominion, Agricola, and Mage Knight.  Cosmic Encounter. Can't really decide on a third... at that point I'd have to categorize them by genre to be fair to them all. I feel like Imperial Assault is working on up there but I haven't played it enough.

Have you joined us on /r/boardgames? Yup, I read it a lot! I'll have to check out Imperial Assault at my next game night, I think they have it in the library at my local shop.  I used to be a big fan of Dominion but nowadays I think Ascension just does it better. Dunno if it has a web version though. Yes, Town of Salem :D As far as online ccgs go I'd also recommend elements the game. &gt;probably the best deckbuilding game around

Magic and Hearthstone would like a word. Those aren't really deck-building games. In deck-building games the central game mechanic is deck-building, where you're building a deck while you play. In Magic and Hearthstone you build a deck before you play and then tactically play your cards in game. For my money though, I prefer Dominion. There's a difference. MTG/HS are build before, draw and play. Dominion's gameplay is building the deck itself. Drafting in M:tG inspired Dominion. The closest thing in Magic would be something like starting with a deck that's just lands and then simultaneously drafting while playing the deck you're drafting, but what cards you can pick is effected by what you're able to do that turn (and then of course your picks effect what you can do in later turns and things snowball from there). Not the same my friend. As others have pointed out.  Besides Android:Netrunner is superior and more accessible budget wise to stay competitive.  No rng. 

Open your eyes. There is a whole nother world just beyond the veil. You have nearly reached it. I really like to play Fallen London. http://fallenlondon.storynexus.com/

It's a text-based storyline game set in a gothic, steampunky London. You basically start off with 4 core qualities that are useful for certain tasks and meeting certain people, and you just build your own storyline in this fictional London. Send me a card! Name's Marko Mezak. (might be a underscore in there, idk.) Me too! Name is Kingmudsy :) Not sure if we get benefits for card sending, though You Can't have dinners out unless you are aquaintances. Also, it increases making waves when you accept. how do i add friends :( Send me a card! Name's Marko Mezak. (might be a underscore in there, idk.) has nobody mentioned [Card Hunter](http://www.cardhunter.com/) yet? i find that hard to believe.

 Incredible game. Mix of RPG and turn based strategy Oh I love this game so much! &gt;Error establishing a database connection

Really? [Alternative link (Kongregate)](http://www.kongregate.com/games/bluemanchu/card-hunter) It looks really complicated.  I've never played the card kind of games...do you think it's something an amateur can enjoy? It's less a card game and more turn-based rpg.
It's fairly simple, so it shouldn't be too hard. Thanks, I think I'll give it a try! Great choice, one of my favorites as well. I juat wish my friends would give it a chance, too! How has nobody mentioned this yet? Great game. Lots of depth. not wrong there, feel like i am close to understanding what i am actually doing First thing I thought of, fantastic game. Lots of replayability. /f card hunter

my work is done here [Here's another link (Kongregate)](http://www.kongregate.com/games/bluemanchu/card-hunter), since yours is giving errors. Neptune's Pride (2)! MMO-Space-Risk Glad I saw this, feel like it should be muuuuch much higher. This game is insanely addicting after you learn the ropes.  Agreed! Very good game with an active and interactive developer.

Non players should be aware it's an HTML5 game, so any modern browser should play it just fine.

Also some games are TURN BASED so even though it's an MMO strategy game it's something that's easy to play when you have the time to spare. Even the real time games only tick every hour. Is the 1 or 2 that have mobile support? I'll guess 2. I had to run away from that game like you run away from meth. So addictive. Haha yeah altho its a beauty on a larger screen mobile is 'possible' on 2 but a little like that Simpsons episode where the operator tells him his fingers are too fat to dial the phone number...so many itsy-bitsy options! I am gonna go cold turkey after this one last game...:p There's few games where diplomacy really matters the way this one does. chess More fun over the board in my opinion. That way I can flip the board when I lose!
 [Have I got a non-web game for you](http://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/) Hell yeah, Table Top Simulator! Shout out to /r/tabletopsimulator as well, the game has come a long way. I actually kickstarted it with a 4-pack and haven't checked it since it hit steam. I feel like a chump. You should gift me one of those if you've still got any. I really want it but am a broke college student with no money to spare for things. Same for me, (not a college student) broke, can't get stuff i want. (although i can't really redeem it) [deleted] Time for all of you to jump on the "Get A Job" train! Mac? I like being able to to put my piece down with authority to intimidate my opponent. Especially when I capture a piece.  that's risk you're thinking of. I usually just point at a nonexistent naked woman and when the person turns to look I flip the board. Best friend has been trying to get me into chess.com for over a year, and, while I am interested in chess, I just suck at it way too much to keep at it for too long. 

Told me the whole reason he got into it (or back into it, to be proper) was due to this show called Code Geass, that he brought over the entirety of on thumb drive to download to my external media drive. So now I can disappoint him twice when it takes me six months to watch it all.  i can teach you to be good if you want

 If it consists of repeatedly beating my ass over and over again, then no thanks, the entirety of chess.com has beaten you to that already.  oh ok, well if you want to learn some things i teach beginners a lot. Alright, I'll give. Sure, you're on chess.com?  [Chess](http://www.sparkchess.com/) [gameknot](http://gameknot.com/) as someone who plays way too much chess online I highly reccomend two sites

lichess.org, for free fast online play, no advertisements, so good.

chess.com, for stronger players, similarly free but with some ads, biggest site When the top comment has 300+ replies and every single one of them is deleted you know some serious shit went down. Why were they deleted? There's a game I won't mention for obvious reasons that got most of its players from threads like these and has since been banned from askreddit for vote brigading and such.  you should pm me the name of the game just google "Capture The Flag game" ah. but that game is good.  :( Honestly, I've always disliked it. Honestly, you're a scrub. The game is amazing. Meh.  Different strokes for different folks. Why would they delete that? I saw the comment earlier and played the game. Pretty fun. It just seems weird to me that it's banned from askreddit haha.  Mention of the game has been banned due to vote brigading. Who was vote brigading? Players from that sub? Yeah. Apparently people would make posts there telling people to upvote the game whenever it appeared in an askreddit thread. can i get a confirmation on the game ? Oh right, now I get why it wasn't in the first results! 
Great game anyway but after a while I got bored of it (can't choose maps,for example) To be quite honest, I came here to see if that game had been mentioned. It's a fun game and I'm glad they "brigaded" these questions to let people know.

Askreddit is a silly place, every so often I forget it's a default sub but stuff like this reminds me. I should unsubscribe. I'm assuming it's hearthstone since it has a big following on reddit, I tried it once and it wasn't my type of game. No I would bet money it was ag-tay o-pray like a game of tag that you could go pro in That's it, now we're both shadowbanned! Why were the above two comments deleted? Ah, gotcha. That game is incredibly overrated. WE"LL NEVER KNOW!

Edit:  OK, NOW WE KNOW!!! Like Mikep98 said, every time a thread of this sort came up, a huge influx of players would flood the game, and lots of people who regularly play didn't like that. I personally think it's a little silly because after a week or so most of the players who found it on reddit would have quit and forgotten about it, and those who found it and loved it and kept playing are worth keeping around, yknow? There's a game I won't mention for obvious reasons that got most of its players from threads like these and has since been banned from askreddit for vote brigading and such.  I really wanna know now Sameeee [deleted] Geoguessr! You get five random google street view locations and have to pinpoint your location on a map. Very addictive!

(Shameless shoutout to /r/geoguessr, our small related sub) I once landed on the street I grew up in on that. 

Fun game! I find it's really easy if you can zoom in on Realty signs on houses for sale and google the number and find the exact location.   Yeh I love this, got super into it for a while. I got my grandfather super addicted to it.   Oh [Goddamnit](http://imgur.com/Y0SATwK)! I've lost hours to A Leaf On The Wind. Watch how I soar. Too soon. More like too late. Like, he was too late to dodge that spear. The spear that killed him in the chest. I just played it for the last 30 minutes. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. so Zen

http://anism.org/lotw/ Is it just me or is this hard as fuck on mobile All the games at orisinal.com!  Winter Bells is my favorite. Hello 1999! All of the games are good just for the music and the look. I like the one with the guy jumping down ledges underwater. 

edit: it's called [The Bottom of The Sea](http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/sea.htm) wonderfull game have spent so much time on it
whats your record mine is 600000000000
 In addition to being fun, these games are gorgeous!! It's hard to believe how long ago they were created. Simple and addictive game! I bought it for my phone a couple years back. Great time waster.

[Here is the game for the curious.](http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm) Popped into this thread just for this. These games still hold up, but I had to comb some pretty old bookmarks to remember the name. Winterbells is so good, it's a shame when you get too high your score sort of disappears! God damn I love that site. Surprised this didn't get more recognition! Beautifully designed mini games, such a relaxing way to pass the time. Brings back memories...  They're all so good!  I always loved Bubble Bees. http://www.dragonfable.com/

One of numerous RPGs the company has made, all mostly free to play (there are a few things limited to those who spend ~$20). All playable with the latest flash through your browser, no downloads necessary, with weekly-ish updates. Can confirm, am paladin Artix Kreiger Wait wait. Is this the actual Artix? Well, we can test it. Just get an undead here and lets see if he can avoid killing it. And making terrible puns at the same time! No, the real Artix actually has his name spelled correctly.

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vcbdj/we_are_the_game_masters_for_artix_entertainment/c53822y Heyo Artix! I've been an AE fan for eight years now, since I first got a Dragon Amulet back as a wee lad. I'm a Seal Clubber! Ayyo the original AdventureQuest is some good shit as well, while we're at it. For some reason I'm partial to AQ despite the efforts being *obviously* focused on DF. Probably dat seniority. MechQuest is a good one too! Takes a futuristic spin on their style of game. Really fun! Yeah AQ is my favorite, minus stats being way too pricey to upgrade. Also 12 year old me never saw them as important, which was silly. I don't know how into the game you are but there was huge gold re-balance. You won't struggle for it anymore.  Hollow and his team have done some really amazing stuff!

AQ and DF probably get about the same amount of focus from higher up, though. ;) DF is just slightly newer.  Fuck I was obsessed with AQW in like sixth grade. I had no idea what I was doing because I never played an mmo before Holy crap same here, I became a beta tester for AQ worlds in like 5th grade or something and was obsessed with it for the next couple years. I dropped so many hours on that game it was crazy.

Just logged back on a few mins ago and found out my account was still there :D

I have no idea whats going on though, everything is so different. Found my old AQ account info on an index card last week. I have a new lvl 40 werepyre now. I will second this, that game is awesome! Dragonman for Mayor! ... Oh, hi Geo!

Didn't really expect you to see this &gt;.&gt; I was hooked to AQ/DF/MQ and then AQ Worlds later, had a great time without spending any money.  They're all solid RPGs loaded with content with more added weekly. I still have a lot of catching up to do from my hiatus. &gt;.&lt; I'll sadly never 100% Dragonfable. Adventure Quest is impossible for now but I'll never be able to pick up where 10 year old me left off in DragonFable. 

There's like 3 ARCs in the game now. What? The Book of Lore should help with jumping back in, I hope! There's also a link in it to a great guide on the forums. The 2nd arc is rather small actually, and definitely my least favorite of the three. The third arc is rather interesting, and still seems to have a ways to go. And don't even mention the gazillion side quests. T_T Unfortunately, a bunch of the story in the second book got cut. :\ There were probably a good six months of releases that poofed. When Atrea comes back around in Book 3 some of the missing story stuff can hopefully get reintegrated. That would explain a lot actually. What lead to the cut? Super top secret reasons!!!!

(A couple different things. There was worry that after a five year story arc a two year arc would be too much. There were a few projects on the horizon that might require team/asset shifting (and Ghost did end up moving from DF to AQW), etc. So we were asked to streamline the story down. A lot of the Ateala story stuff, a lot of the elemental chaos stuff, some of the deeper character stuff ended up cut to just try to focus on the big bad.) Darn, guess I'll never know.

(Makes sense, but still a bit of a shame. Can't really say I mind though, because I do like book 3. Which speaks to the real reason long story arcs are bad: if they're not liked, it'll be forever before the next one, and even if that next one is awesome, less people would probably play it because they left during the previous one.

Hopefully you'll be able to dive into more Ateala stuff later, and maybe throw in some flashbacks about the elemental chaos. Sounds like something that could've made book 2 a lot better imo.) I used to spend so much time on AQ Worlds! I was a rank 10 barber, among other things. God damn the memories. I remember using Cheat Engine just so I could see what awesomeness laid beyond the early level stuff It was a bitch to level up in DragonFable. Its also harder to get rich there than in Adventure Quest which is bothersome. People still play this? Holy shite Ikr? I think as long as they keep updating there will be people playing. LOL HOLY SHIT THE MEMORIES I used to play this game all the time, I had a dragon amulet and everything, but it won't let me log in now for some reason. Aw, did you try to recover your password, however they let you do that? It might be that you're mistyping your password. Do you still use the email you made the account with? You should be able to use this [link](http://account.dragonfable.com/Forgot.aspx) to recover your password.

If you don't use/have that email anymore you can also try to contact [CS](http://www.dragonfable.com/help/df-account-recovery.asp) for help. i used to play this so much I know that I like it! Does this one have bullshit like Adventure Quest where only X amount of people can login unless you pay? I believe they removed that from AQ, and DF has never had that afaik. Good to know, thanks. They had to get money to operate. Not to mention the 20 dollars needed was paltry to how much you were already given pre pay-wall and all that you were given past it. AQ let me play for about 3 days before it became impossible to login due to only allowing brand new players and paid players online. This was probably back in its very early days, but it was not ethical practice for a "free to play" game. Back in like fourth grade a friend let me borrow his guardian account.

I moved away, changed the password on his account

i felt so bad for doing it, stealing his account. But fourth grade me was more happy he had a guardian account of his own. 

I still feel bad about doing that to him :C even though hes probably forgotten Wow. That's......just...wow. 

You aren't worth of the title Guardian. You're so evil the Devourer wouldn't work with you. This was literally my favorite game as a child.and last year. I just love it. DAAMN man. I still remember how my guy looked like. Days upon days of my middle school life must have gone on AQ,DF and MQ alone. Holy shit I played this when I was 11... I rememeber being like way overpowered level from grinding (I think level 50). This game was the shit [deleted] Gameplay is a simple turn-based RPG, you use your skills, they attack you, repeat.  My friend and I spent a while backpacking around Iceland a few years ago.  We would wander down empty roads for no particular reason, mostly just to see the scenery and what we would find.  One evening we'd been driving for about ten hours that day, and it had been an hour or more since we'd last been through a town.  It was gorgeous landscape, but definitely [the middle of nowhere](http://imgur.com/a5t6rKK).  After a while we saw this tiny little [green hut](http://imgur.com/eOmoEcq) off on the side of the road.  We pulled over and [took a look](http://imgur.com/uHffKvS). 

Inside, there was the world's most isolated [vending machine](http://imgur.com/HG5BQhO).  There was also a tiny table for a guestbook and where you could leave coins, but no apparent explanation for the little hut containing a vending machine. The machine itself was solar-powered, which makes sense, because there was fuck-all else for probably 50 miles in any direction.

I'm not sure you can appreciate how middle of nowhere this is.  It was [the middle of nowhere](http://imgur.com/rXc2Ebe).  Best soda I've ever tasted, though.    You're awesome for providing photos Can you google map us to where this is? I really want a sense of how middle in nowhere this was. Serious.  There is no street view of that road but it is somewhere around here 
https://www.google.se/maps/@65.5289473,-14.2822466,1452m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en

It is not totally isolated though, there are scattered farms around there. The guy that runs the vending machine lives in a town maybe 30 minutes drive away. I just scrolled down from there a bit and found photos!

http://www.ifitweremyhome.com/compare/CA/IS
 Let's build a town around it We'll call it Niceland. Several times I restocked vending machines in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. I was stationed on board the USS Enterprise (cvn 65). We had about 18 vending machines. I was the "vending supervisor"  for one 6 month deployment.  That's a cool Navy job! Eh. I was a ships serviceman (or SH in Navy terms). It was a pretty chill job but it was also really hard at times. Before I was the vending supervisor I was the laundry supervisor. So I was in charge of getting ~5000 people's dirty clothes washed. The laundry room was usually 115 degrees. Sometimes higher if we were in the Gulf.  Yeah, i'd rather stock vending machines.  haha. ya thats what i told my boss at the time. so he let me. Not a vending machine, but there's a lone ATM in Antarctica. Why?  Like, what are the scientists at the research stations even buying? Well, all scientists at the research stations in Antarctica pass through McMurdo Station on their way to/from the continent.  There's about 1,300 people there and apparently [there are restaurants and bars](http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Antarctica/Restaurants-Antarctica-MISC-BR-1.html).

Edit: Found a better link. TIL.  That's awesome, I assumed it was just scientists and no extra personnel. There's a couple thousand scientists, so they need a lot of support staff. Pilots, carpenters, cooks, engineers, janitors, doctors and nurses. [You can apply here](http://www.usap.gov/jobsAndOpportunities/).  I knew they needed support staff, I guess I just assumed they were all part of whatever research institution was funding them - I didn't realize there were "civilian"/private businesses too. Yeah, it used to all be through Raytheon, but I guess they lost the contract. I'm not really experienced with it much myself --- just sometimes when i daydream about really getting away from it all I check it out the job openings and see if there's anything I'm qualified for.  Hairstylist. Theres an antarctic job opening for a hairstylist.  Never in my life have I wanted so badly to be a hairstylist.  Scientist sex. This makes me think of SMBC comics There would be a graph explaining how scientist sex increases over time until everyone wants to be a scientists just to get laid at Antarctica.

Due to supply and demand, it ends up being mostly gay men. Uncle works in Antarctica. It's a bar.  Beer Where the hell else are Penguins gonna get their cash from? The snow bank! Oh boooo.  Upvote Technically there's two, but one was perpetually broken for all of last season.

MacMurdo is an American settlement. It gives dollars. I wonder how restocking that occurs.  [This is the Internet, wonder no longer](http://www.needcoffee.com/2010/01/12/antarctica-atm-interview/)

Looks like they just recycle the money on the station, as there aren't exactly large cashflows out of the place... 1. Go to Antarctica
2. Withdraw all cash from ATM
3. ???
4. Frolic amongst the Penguins as their godking.  The answer to "???" is buy a tuxedo.  I recall driving through the far reaches of northern Montana in the middle of winter and stopped at a rest area that had two toilets and two fully stocked vending machines.  Thought it rather peculiar as it was at least 50 miles to the nearest anything. One thing I noticed after taking some road trips out of California: some states have REALLY NICE rest areas. I'm in Oregon and our rest areas are generally decent.  California has some luxury rest areas, even the ones way out in the middle of nowhere. They're nice here in Ohio, too. Well, there was the one that got hit with a small tornado the night before we passed through. Most seem like parks, though! Ohio's new ones are awesome. Every summer I go from Illinois to Ohio and and stop once or twice long the way

Ohio - 10/10 will always hold it until I'm in Ohio if I can. 

Indiana - 6/10 should just be named the 'South Bend Chocolate Company' stops, kinda crappy. 

Illinois - 4/10 crappy and extremely unwelcoming when crossing the border. All it has is a green highway sign off to the side, while Indiana has a whole grand gateway. 

Edit: Illanoied??? (The shittiest tourism campaign ever) where they fully stocked because they were filled once and no one ever goes there? Good question.  They were on and functional, so either is possible. you should have bought something, just to check the expiration date  Wow, I didnt know they were making Crystal Pepsi again! *drinks it all in one go*  Haha well isn't that the point of a rest area? To provide restrooms and vending machines in areas some distance from any towns? Yes, but this was so far from anything it surprised me there was even electricity in the area. In Northern Canada a man chopped down a power line so the power company would come fix it, finding him so he wouldn't die.

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/stranded-man-cuts-power-poles-to-draw-attention-1.890115

There's power lines running for hundreds of kilometers. That's brilliant... I need to remember that. Power lines are fucking everywhere and you can usually see them from a ways away because of forest path clearing and because of their height.  There's a [mystery soda machine](http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mystery-soda-machine) in Seattle that no one knows who stocks and sells them for 75 a pop. And it also has a mystery button that dispenses random and sometimes obscure sodas.  I had a beer vending machine in college and it had a mystery button. Sometimes it was something nice like a black and tan. Sometimes it was natty ice. Sometimes it was seltzer. 

I charged 50 cents for soda, 75 cents for natty, $1 for yuengling, 1.25 for nicer stuff like Heineken or sagres. Bulk discounts available if you hunted me down. Kept many parties going after the kegs kicked.  We had one of these. My first time trying the mystery option I got a can of baked beans. It didn't do much to quench my thirst but hey, who doesn't love surprise baked beans I wouldn't even be mad. The sheer absurdity of a can of baked beans coming out of a soda machine would have made my day. $1 USD is still cheaper than the prices most grocery stores here in acanada chargevfor a can of baked beans too. &gt; acanada chargevfor

another drunk Canadian, guys...



Edit: Hey look, Karma... my ass, my ass does not love a surprise canned baked beans.  I've never seen a beer vending machine. How does age verification work?

Edit: I'm in the US. Only putting them in 21+ establishments makes sense, as suggested below.  I used one in Holland.  It required an age coin to work, in addition to your money.  You could get the age coin (had a square hole in the middle) from the lady behind the hotel front counter. That sounds like about as much work as just having the lady give you the drink. It doesn't.   They are usually installed in arts only venues,  or in cultures with a sane alcohol outlook 

Edit :Should have read adults only Its the fuckin' SCP coffee machine "A cup of something that can kill 682" Isn't it the vending machine? I think the coffee machine gave you whatever you typed in liquid form and the vending machine dispensed random stuff when you gave it yen. Been a while though since going down that rabbit hole Ahhhh yes, [SCP-261](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-261), one of my favorites.
Dark side cola sounds sooooo good. "Cup of joe" Motherfucker.  There goes my night, again.  Every fucking time someone mentions SCP, I lose hours of my life. That sounds like a fucking SCP. You'd better watch out, it might dispense a can full of super* bees. Just watch and you'll find who does it. Not a huge mystery. :D You mean, like stakeout the machine for days or weeks? I'm not sure exactly how often they get re-stocked, but that sounds like a pretty serious mission with no real payoff. People have tried this! None can figure out who collects the money or stocks the machine. (It's haunted) It's stocked from the other side :) The drinks are coming from INSIDE the machine!!!


Wait... they all do that http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2014/05/spoiler-alert-mystery-of-the-capitol-hill-mystery-coke-machines-mysteries-revealed/
 Not a stocker but I did buy a drink from [the vending machine at the top of Mount Fuji](https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6063/6085723577_cac8e2c415_b.jpg)

edit: [higher res for those who want to gawp at the prices](https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6063/6085723577_41a826636f_o.jpg) I'm not questioning that there is one up there because let's be honest Japan has a thing for vending machines ... But how is it powered?

I can also imagine someone having to pack several cases of soda in a backpack to stock that thing

Edit: didn't realize how much infrastructure is actually up there From what I've seen in videos, Japan has vending machines in rural areas in the middle of nowhere because they don't have to worry about people breaking into them. [deleted] Japanese people are honest like that. Seriously, once hiking in Japan I found on a trail a box with some vegetables (I think they were cucumbers, but my memory fails me now) and a box next to it with coins. They were supposed to be about 100yen (about $1). There was no one guarding it, and yet both money and veggies were still there. 

(Unless it was guarded by ninjas, because Japan)

*Edit: Seeing all the replies, I think I've betrayed myself as the total big-city dweller I am. It's been lovely to read all these nice stories though.* In rural areas you see honor system vegetable stands not infrequently. Still wouldn't work in a big city, because people are people no matter where you go, but a remarkable number of things basically run on honor system in Japan and it still works. Oh, absolutely. There were plenty of examples like that, but that one was perhaps the cutest I saw. It was such a nondescript little box in the middle of nowhere. 

Then again, even in Tokyo you'd see how honest people were in general. I do miss that quite a lot from Japan.  I could set a lemonade stand in my driveway with a pitcher/cup and a bowl for payment, walk away, and the whole damn table would be gone in 10 minutes.

I don't live in a bad, or really densely populated area, either. Those lemonade-stealing whores!!1! There are a lot of honor-system fruit stands along the Road to Hana on Maui. Always thought that was rad. Now I feel like I may live in Japan and not Michigan. Lol in the summer there is plenty of honor system vegetable stands and so on out here. People usually place them in there front yards or on the farm land.  We have fruit stalls like that in the uk too, and on Iona there's a few wooden boxes hanging on some houses gates with Iona's green marble stones smoothed into circles with a crucifix chipped into them alongside a sign saying "honesty box", it's a nice idea. I think we've got it backwards. They're right to assume people respect social norms like not breaking into a vending machine. Our society may be the fucked up one for normalizing the vandalization of property.

I mean, from a vending machine perspective anyway. People in Japan ask, "Why would someone vandalise/graffiti a vending machine?"

After all, what's the point? My cousin hangs around with a bunch of Japanese exchange students who thought it would be a really great "prank" to just drive through a drive-through at McD's.  They didn't want to order anything first to inconvenience the people working there, they just thought it would be badass/hilarious to *just drive on through.* 

Theirs is a pretty tame society, tentacle porn notwithstanding. &gt; There's is a pretty tame society, tentacle porn notwithstanding.

When you spend your days thinking simply driving through a drive through is an insane prank, the other shoe has to drop somewhere. To be fair, exchange students are usually not the most rebellious of the lot, especially if they have to compete or be selected for the exchange. There was a post here recently about teens jumping on car hoods. Many of the comments were along the lines of 'we all did this sort of thing as kids' and I couldn't believe so many people thought that was a normal thing to do. I suppose different communities have different expectations, set different standards for their members. 
 *Top of Mt. Fuji  
Buy Coke from vending machine  
I guess it's not snowing on Mt. Fuji after all* I used to live in Japan when I was younger, I was about 10 years old at the time.  To get to my school bus stop from my home I had to walk down a long stretch of road, not necessarily remote it had a car or two drive through periodically.  This road ran through a field that stretched far into the horizon, so it really was a road in the middle of nowhere even though it was only a mile or so until you hit civilization from my little neighborhood.  However, in the middle of the stretch of road on the side, just on the edge of the road and field was a soda machine.  110 yen for a soda.  Every now and then I would stop and get a grape soda, it was delicious.  It was always stocked and I never questioned its existence, the innocence of youth.  Years later as an adult I often ponder...WHO THE HELL PUT THAT MACHINE THERE?  HOW WAS IT STOCKED ALL THE TIME??  WHERE WAS ITS POWER SOURCE??? I swear, you're never more than a few hundred yards from a vending machine no matter where you go in Japan. This is the closest I'm ever gonna get to my story so fuck it. My dad was a "cracker stacker" for over 35 years. Not long before he retired he took someone's route at the county jail and I ride with him. We go in right after visitation so these things were bone dry and we empty two cart loads of food/drink. There are boxes everywhere and my dad looks over at the inmate moping the room and says "hey boy. You know where the dump is?" Inmate says "yeah."  He says "good, take care of these boxes." I thought the inmate was going to stab us and then dad  takes about $10 worth of chips and snacks and sticks them in one of the boxes. The inmates smile was one of pure joy. Never will forget that.  &gt; We go in right after visitation so these things were bone dry

That is so funny and strikes such a chord with me.  When my family would visit my dad in prison (3.5-4 hour drive which seemed like a lifetime as a kid), my dad always had my mom bring at least two rolls of quarters so my dad could go nuts with the vending machines.  We all did.  Ate a lot of ice cream sandwiches, Rice Krispie Treats and microwaved popcorn in a Federal Prison visiting room.  Looking back on it, that was a pretty fucking strange experience.   Your dad called an adult man boy? Maybe it's 1950s Mississippi. Yeah, stick to *garon*; if anything it's perhaps marginally worse, but people rarely seem to take offense.
 Well, French people take offense. OH OH! An ask reddit thread that I can actually participate in!

Alyeska Ski Resort in Girdwood, Alaska. I had to drive an hour and a half up a mountain to get to the building. At that elevation, the soda always went flat pretty quick though. Here's the view from the top. http://i.imgur.com/8GRxxrL.jpg I went to a camp in the Northwest Territories of Canada to work for a couple weeks, and they had a vending machine outside of the hotel I stayed in. The "town" consisted of a hotel, one strip of six houses, an airport, a restaurant/corner store and a few other buildings I didn't see much of.

Turned out the corner store owner stocked the vending machine. Fascinating. I would love to live in a place like that.  People always talk about how they want to live in remote places for long periods of time, and honestly what turns me off to that is no Mountain Dew or energy drinks.  I know it's pretty ridiculous.  But if you've got a vending machine or a convenience store, I'm sold. Or just hoard up before you leave. A couple of weeks ago, I was driving on a long stretch of road between South Africa and its small and mysterious neighboring country, Swaziland.  As per my usual routine when I don't need to be anywhere at a particular time, I opted to go at it without the gps and go with only a map and detailed directions to my destination.  It was suppose to be a 6 hour drive from Johannesburg to the Mkhaya game reserve in Swaziland.  The story picks up a few hours into the drive.  At this point in the roadtrip, it had been three hours since I saw any sort of town or village, and although I didn't know it at the time, I was roughly 90 km past the turn I was suppose to have taken.  I gassed at every gas station I saw and had plenty of water and food in my car, so my only real concern was running out of daylight and running into hijackers who were notorious in the area.  I had less than 15 minutes left of daylight, by my estimates, and my level of concern was rising(mostly due to the fact that I was alone, without cellphone service, and not at all familiar with the area).  I came upon an unmarked exit, and it was either stay on a highway that literally hadn't taken me through anything in two hours or take my chance with an exit.  Exits tend to lead somewhere, right?  

To my relief, it was soon after that I started driving through a town; a very poor town with clay built houses and no real stores/banks/landmarks, but a town nevertheless.  It was at that point that I finally saw the sign I had been craving to see for the better part of two hours: "lodging".  

Just to get to the lodge was a 10 minute drive on a deserted dirt path and no street lights of any kind(it was pitch dark at this point).  I finally did make it to the lodging area, and was greeted by an empty "parking lot" and an enthusiastic work staff.  The place was actually quite beautiful, it bordered on Kruger national park and the staff told me it gets quite busy in the summer months.  

I ended up being the only guest that checked in there that night and was put up in a beautiful rondoval(name for a round hut in Africa).

I went over to the bar area and proceeded to drink and socialize with the staff, who didn't really have much going on.  In the corner of this outdoor bar sat the most secluded vending machine I have ever seen or ever will see.  For a couple of beers, I sat there and pondered about how much of an effort it would be to just restock this machine.  I imagined the long journey the can of coke would have to make to find itself here, and wondered if it was even worth it to stock the machine.  Before I left that "bar" that night, I made my way over and clicked the button that would dispense me the bottle of coke.  

I never did end up drinking that coke, I actually brought it all the way back to Seattle(USA) with me.  There is nothing really special about this bottle or any interesting or discerning characteristics.  But it will sit on my shelf for a while and every time I look at it, I'll think about where I got it from and what both it and I have been through ever since.

Edit: quite a few of you thought I should create. Subreddit where I can easily share my stories with you, so here it is:

I honestly don't know what will become of it, but let's see how it goes! I must admit I thought at the end you were gonna be restocking the machine you bought the coke from.  This is one of the most beautiful accounts of a soda purchase I have ever heard. Should be a commercial or some shit. *Beautiful landscape shots of Swaziland. A silhouette of a jeep drives by as dramatic faux-African music plays.*

**VOICE-OVER:**  I was travelling through Swaziland when I found a lodge by an empty parking lot. 

*The jeep pulls into the lodge. A silhouette gets out and is greeted by a group.*

**VOICE-OVER:** It was a beautiful place, but totally empty. I was the only guest in the whole place. 

*A white man signs in. He notices a Coke machine. Slow zoom on it.*

**VOICE-OVER:** And that was when I saw it. A lonely Coke machine in the middle of nowhere. I wondered about the long, strange journey each can must have go through every time it was restocked. 

*The man buys a Coke. He holds it up and gazes it.*

**VOICE-OVER:** Every can has a story. From the people who made it, to the journey it made, to the moment it came into my hands. 

*He puts it in his backpack and walks away.*

**VOICE-OVER:** I never drank that Coke. But it will sit on my shelf, and every time I look at it, I'll think about how I got it and what we have been through ever since. 

*Cut to wait staff.*

**RECEPTIONIST:** Ngugi, why is that American kissing that bottle of Coca-Cola?

**MANAGER:** Who cares? I need you to restock the vending machine. Tourist season starts next week, and this place is going to be packed. The Coca-Cola is in the fridge. You know, the same place where we keep every single other beverage we sell. 

**RECEPTIONIST:** The fridge? What a long, strange journey that will be. 

**VOICE-OVER:** Coca-Cola: Every can tells a story.

Would have to be a Tupac style hologram though... **EDIT: Why do people keep telling me the name of the movie, isn't it implied that I know the name because I read it in the post directly above this one? The Gods must be crazy, yes, I heard it like 20 times.**

My father from time to time talks about a movie about an african  tribe, away from the rest of society, and one day a Coca Cola bottle randomly reached their tribe. They had never seen anything like this and it end ups causing all sort of trouble to the people of the tribe.

He uses it as a metaphor of sorts, of something, im not sure what. Well I never actually knew the name of the movie, neither did he. Your poster of the man with the coca cola bottle linked after a story about a small african village in the middle of nowhere made me wonder, maybe this is the movie.

So I looked the name up. And it is. So after all these years I finally get the first proof that my father didn't make the whole thing up heheh. I think I'll tell him. Maybe we could watch it. Thanks stranger. I'm a child of the 80's and it was pretty popular movie in Australia when I was growing up. Even though its a comedy I remember studying it in class for some social studies class because it tackles a bunch of serious themes, re: so called "uncivilised" tribes ways of dealing with the world and each other vs. White man modern thinking. It's a pretty good movie, too. You should watch it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMzcVizGUd8 Time is a flat Coke.  Username checks out.

Jesus Christ, dude. Have there been any moments in your life where you didn't stop and contemplate the universe in all of its mysteries? My "notes" folder in my phone has about 150 entries, each with a few dozen notes each.  3-4 times a day after something happens, I stop and reflect than write a note in my phone about it.  There are literally hundreds of stories I really want to tell at the moment, I'm just waiting for the right askreddit question to share them!   You should make a subreddit to share those stories! I've thought about it.  But I really love the feeling of logging onto to askreddit and seeing a question that relates to me, then sharing my story via that.  

I don't know.. Having my own subreddit would be like being that guy whose in love with their own stories and always telling them whenever they get a chance.  While posting on askreddit threads is like being the guy who joins in existing conversations.  I personally just like the latter.  But maybe one day!

Edit:  ok, so quite a few people asked, so I went ahead and created a subreddit:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Occasionallyoccupied/

I'm not sure what I will do it with yet, but creating it is good of a start as I can offer right now! Can we please have one more story? One that you've just been dying to share but has never come up in askreddit or anything? I just got home after a month of traveling so right now I'm lost in stories from the journey.  I'm dying to write about a man I met standing on the side of the road while driving.  I drove past him then couldn't stop thinking about how happy he looked here in the middle of nowhere, so I drove back and talked to him for a while.  A lot of my notes are just continuations of what I learned from talking to this man; it taught me so much about what happiness really means and how little we need in our life to obtain it.  I won't have my laptop until tomorrow morning, so maybe I can send you the story then?  It's far too much to type on my phone and Ive been thinking about writing this story down for weeks now.  You sound like an incredibly interesting person to know. You keep doing you.   Coca-Cola actually has its largest African manufacturing/bottling plant in Swaziland Wow, I thought you were making stuff up. [But apparently they contribute 40% of the country's GDP and are involved in pretty dirty politics there.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/02/coca-cola-accused-swaziland-dictator)

Now everytime I drink a coke, I'll feel like I'm contributing to the annual dance where a dictator picks a new bare-breasted virgin bride.

 I am enthralled by the tale of king mswati(king and dictator of Swaziland).  He's corrupt as fuck and not many people have ever heard of him.  I just got back to the states but I plan on learning more about him. There's an interesting documentary called [Without the King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_the_King) about him and his daughter, Princess something. It was on Netflix a while back; not sure if it's still on there or not.  Dear Coke, please make this into a commercial! they might leave out the part where the main reason he stops there is fear of running into high jackers
 I don't know, people smoking weed and masturbating in the middle of a road would be entertaining

EDIT- it's a U Send it to them I thought this was going to end with you accidentally dropping the empty coke bottle from a plane and thus resulting in a modern remake of The Gods Must Be Crazy... Pic of you and the can?  You say you were nervous about hijackers whilst you were on the road, yet had no problems staying at the lodging. This seems totally alien to me. How did you know that you will be safe? Oh, I totally didn't.  The thing about traveling alone is that you have to find the right balance of being aware of your surroundings/being safe and just simply enjoying your journey.  As I walked into the lodging office, I spent the time while booking to look at the pictures hanging on the wall(specifically the accreditation of the lodge, the owners permit,  and its legitimacy).  I also booked with my visa which gave me the comfort in the manner that if something was to happen, my family would be able to trace my whereabouts to this place and go from there.

I would be lying to you if I said I slept completely at peace that night; if someone was to come into my room, I would have had no defense against any potential theives, and would be at their mercy.  But sometimes you just can't allow those thoughts to eat you up, because trust me, they will.  You can destroy an evening or an entire trip by worrying too much.  

Always be aware and try to put yourself in the best situation that you can.  And from that point on, enjoy yourself and the fact that you found a way.   Sometimes when travelling you just have to make do, right? And odd places sometimes end up being the best. 
 Exactly.  The reason I never use a gps is because the story is much better when written yourself.  I've gotten lost in 7 countries while driving and those are some of the best stories I have.  As far as I'm concerned with driving in a foreign country: 

1)never let your gas tank go below half(you don't know when the next station will come) 2) always have enough water to last two days 3) always have some kind of food 4) have some small bills of local currency so you can ask a local to give you directions 5) never drive at night if you feel unsafe 6) rent a car with the best tires 7) always always have a map.

Everything else, just enjoy the experience.  Look around while driving, and stop and take in the sights as often as you can. Not a vending machine stocker and too late for this thread, but I've stocked a machine in a poor South African town near Cape Town. I was there doing a project for a large Search Engine involving hacked vending machines connected to the Internet. 

It was a really weird experience because people in the village/town had never interacted with computers and the kids were very intrigued by me carrying around a wireless keyboard(and the fact that I had leg hair but no one there did haha). Coke was more accessible to these people than clean water, and there were serious arguments over the free sodas. When our project started there was a line of 50+ people to try out the machines. Not a part of the project I'm particularly proud to have been involved with.

I'm a programmer but never in my life did I think I'd learn as much about vending machines as I eventually did over the course of the project. World travel was definitely a perk.  I used to work for a vending company. Pretty much any where you would expect a person to make a stop with their car would have at the very least a cola machine.  I've seen long-haul coke trucks all the way out in Fossil, OR. You'll see small towns with Pepsi and Coke signs above every shop. That means someone working for pepsi or coke goes out to these towns, some practically ghost towns, and delivers and stocks the product. Even working for a distributor it blows my mind.  A friend posted on Facebook a few weeks ago about one of those deliveries.

It was a small-town grocery store.  They asked to be re-stocked but when he arrived they had plenty.

It turns out what they had was expiring, because it sat there so long. pop machine, snack vending , and arcade game owner here

The remote beat up out on a country road machines aren't usually owned by a corp- they're usually privately owned and stocked by the nearest trustworthy human with a Costco card
(For a cut of course) - we always split profits with whoever would stock for us. Know how some chain fast food places contract to sell only Coca-Cola or Pepsi? My university was like that. All Pepsi, in every dining hall and dorm vending machine. For three years I yearned for sweet, diabetes-causing Coca-Cola, but none was to be found on campus. Until one day, when I had to venture into the one building that housed USDA offices and was federal, not university, property, unfettered by private contracts between the university and Pepsi. 

Out of the corner of my eye I saw a flash of red, and when I turned to look I thought I was seeing a mirage in this Pepsi-filled desert. But no, I had finally found it: the only Coke vending machine on campus. Ecstatic, I pulled a crisp $1 bill from my wallet and bought myself a can of Coca-Cola, which in that moment tasted like the nectar of the gods, squeezed from the forbidden fruit itself. 

To this day, I imagine there's one lone Coke employee that makes the journey to campus very rarely, under cover of darkness, to restock his employer's only vending machine that rests within those hallowed halls. And as he starts up his truck, wondering when he'll be called out here next, he thinks he can see Bob Woodruff's ghost sitting next to him in the passenger seat, whispering, "Well done." A few years ago, we went to the Knott's Berry Farm amusement park, and brought a few cans of soda since, in the past, they had been lax about bringing in outside food or drink. Like most places post-~~terrorists winning~~ 9/11, they check bags and stuff for contraband, which apparently now includes cans of Coke since they are contracted to sell Pepsi. They said if we had brought Pepsi or another non-Coke brand we would have been allowed to take it in. Corporate America is getting nuts. My university has a long standing contract with Coke, and probably will until the end of time. I don't even think Pepsi offers a bid whenever the contracts are up, simply because they know the university will never award them the contract while they own a sports drink named after our rival's mascot.  Panera stores almost always sell Pepsi products. But at the one near Emory's campus,  they sell all the Pepsi line... Plus coke and diet coke. 

Don't fuck with coke in Atlanta.  Oh atlanta, where all soda is coke and they even have the coca-cola museum.

Speaking of the museum, never drink that Italian abomination named Beverly if you go through it and do the soda tasting room. Adding "Has contract with Coca-Cola" to my college hunt wish list. Welcome to Georgia Tech. And if you don't like the options, you're half a mile from the World of Coke. &gt; Bob Woodruff's ghost

He's still alive. [Robert Woodruff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_W._Woodruff) (1889-1985), forever in our hearts. Okay, now it makes more sense. I felt like a complete idiot for a second, for not realizing that he was still alive. Then for forgetting about THAT Bob Woodruff. I feel like even more of an idiot for not knowing *any* Bob Woodruff. Read that as 1989-1985 I had so many questions.  He's as dead as Wade Boggs who smashes 20 something beers and eats a whole chicken on a cross country flight. then he goes 2 for 3 I think you mean 64 beers.  Penn State? Who knows about that coke machine that has the touch screen, and like hundreds of flavor options.... I usually get grape sprite... They have those in my local Burger King.


So many flavors to choose from, and the cup costs 1.50 or so, and the manager shouted at me for refilling it. :( Tell him to fuck off, it costs them pennies to make sure you are happy. I just refilled it anyway, I already had twice, and was halfway through when he shouted at me, I left after that anyway. It was pretty quiet at the time, only about 15 people in there. I've been back there since and they don't care when it's busier since there's so many people. You're **NOT** supposed to refill those? I always eat slowly so I can get more. Most places allow refills (Five Guys and Wendy's both do, for the select-a-drink thingys).    The wendy's in my area has the only soda fountain behind the register. Stingy bastards. You can almost certainly just go up there and ask for a refill.  Our Wendy's is the same, and you can definitely ask for a refill. I asked the manager about it once-- They put it behind the counter because it still saves them money. If people have to actually talk to someone for a refill, it seems they get refills less often. &gt; Tell him to fuck off

Fastest way to get kicked out of Burger King (while being dragged out kicking and screaming)

"This is bullshit! What about 'Have it your way', bitch?!" Nah order a Big Mac  Fuck those things!  I swear if I have to show one more old person how to pour a cup of water out of one of those again... Free refills are the norm in California My experience with the United States (of course I've only been on the relative west side and the only other country I've been to is the very southwestern part of Canada) is that if you're at a fast food place where you fill up your own cup, free refills are assumed. Even if the soda machine is behind the counter, you can ask an employee for a refill and it'll be free. Ah America. Try peach Mellow Yellow, I highly recommend it. I think all new Burger Kings have it. [I was playing with it a few days ago](http://imgur.com/iPABJQN,Xqi3EgD#1)  All I could focus on was the solemn looking WATER in the corner The water button is just the one loner in the group. Everybody else looks all colorful and nice and then there's just gray old WATER. I used to work in a cafe that had one of those! The bottom panel opens up something like a refrigerator door and has a bunch of plastic cartridges inside little shelves. It's like a normal soda fountain machine, just more compact and organized. This is the most original question I've seen in a long time. The deaf farting one was pretty good. This ones a lot better though. Ok I'm late to this but I do have a vending machine story. Mine takes place in Okinawa Japan. I was stationed there and went for a walk. I ended up getting lost and ended up walking through a field. I know Japan is infamous for its vending machines but this one still took me off guard. I was in the middle of nowhere and when I came to the edge of that particular field, there was a vending machine. Just in a field. I didn't have any yen on me so I couldn't try it out but it looked taken care of and working. I still to this day regret not trying to find its power source. 

It wouldn't have been hard to refill, because Okinawa is a pretty small island but it was really in the middle of nowhere.  I was on a cycling vacation, riding the Cabot Trail, in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia Canada. I was new to cycle camping, and those steep hills were daunting on a bike full of camping gear. But at the bottom of one massive, grinning, 7 kilometre descent, there was a closed restaurant - out of business - and a working Coke machine. I dropped a Loonie, got my Coke, snapped the lid, and just poured that carmel coloured nectar down my throat. It couldn't have been better if Cindy Crawford had showed up. 

God bless the man that kept that machine filled.  That machine probably made bank. This needs to win the original question award It's already over. Then how come the subreddit isn't closed down? I thought the point was to name a winner once and for all so we can all go home (/outside) OK, not a stocker, but the customer...

We had a coke machine where I worked. It was literally in the middle of an airfield on an Air Force base. Unless you worked there, you could only go out to our building if you had an escort. Had to be one PITA to stock our machine.  This American Life did a story on people tasked with [stocking machines on an aircraft carrier](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/206/somewhere-in-the-arabian-sea). We had vending machines inside of the abbey that I attended for school. The monastery was located in the middle of Indiana farm country in a town of 800. 

Even monks need mountain dew and cheetohs.  When I was 17 (1974), buddy and I rode our bicycles from San Jose to LA over spring break.

Outside of Taft/Maricopa, we climbed the pass to the west on CA 166, and, and turned south on CA 33.  We kept on going, but we needed some food for dinner and the following morning's breakfast.

We ended up camping at a Forest Service campground, and talked with one of the other campers about food supply.  They mentioned a little town back a couple of miles, if you take a certain turnoff.

So I went back, made the turnoff, and after a mile ended up at the top end of a small box canyon.  There was maybe 5-10 houses there, a store, and I got there in time to buy stuff.  There were little kids dancing to music on the jukebox, and the whole environment seemed otherworldly - no relationship to the outside world.  They seemed happy in their own little world.

I found the little hamlet on google earth, the hamlet is called [Scheideck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheideck,_California).  It was just so strange, being so remote within California - they never even got landline phone service. Liz: I don't wanna hear about your job, Dennis.

Dennis: One word: Coffee. One problem: Where do you get it? 

Liz: Anywhere. You get it anywhere.

Dennis:  Wrong. You get it at my coffee vending machine. 38th and 6th in the basement of the K-Mart. You just go downstairs, you get the key from David.  And boom, you plug in the machine... Japan has vending machines everywhere! Downtown Tokyo? Vending machine. Hiroshima Peace Memorial? Vending machine. Dirt road without civilization for 50 miles, fucking kid you not vending machine. Haven't seen any real responses in the top comments so I'll chime in.

I used to run a vending route. None of my machines were remote, but some were in pretty foul locations. My very first stop, every single morning, was a meat packing facility. It was not uncommon for my to have to shove my way through a wall of hanging sides of beef. One time saw a worker sitting outside the office, presumably waiting for EMS to arrive, with a foot long boning knife shoved through his thigh to the hilt. 

The foulest of the foul was a leather tannery. The smell is unlike anything you've ever smelled. It cannot be un-smelled. Every time I went there there were countless notes claiming the machine took so-and-so's money. Every time, the dollar validator would be jammed. Every time, the bill stacker was full of putrid, tanning chemical and sweat laced money. 

The most depressing place on my route was a nursing home. Not so much that it was a nursing home, although that's depressing in its own right, but the staff. I hope they aren't representative of the industry as a whole.

Mostly though it was just driving around a non air-conditioned box van filling machines in schools, hospitals, offices and factories.   I used to work at an smallish office with a coke machine in the lunch room. It was pretty old, a pop was 75 cents and it would only accept 3 old quarters- nothing newer. Apparently we owned the thing because it was my job to open it up and restock it and remove all the quarters! I would just buy cases of whatever people wanted, though I dont think I ever bothered to stock both coke and pepsi as very few people bought pops from it. I think gingerale and sprite were big sellers

and yes, I would sometimes steal a pop :) I used to load vending machines at Wright Patt Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. There was one building in area B that was always blocked off by construction, but we had one Pepsi machine in the basement of this building. I had to walk past these long hand painted B2 bomber and F-117 Nighthawks. I would have to pass doors with really nice locks that needed key cards and codes. I never found out what they did there, but its where they kept the aliens.  
Edit: Spelling    I lived in Vermont for a year and decided to hike part of The Long Trail. Generally regarded as the most difficult hike east of the rockies, my route would take me through a remote mountain wilderness called the sterling mountain range. The hike would take me two days with a overnight stop at a three wall shelter below the summit of Mount Sterling at 4,000 feet. That night it got down to 37F and it was late June! 

Ill never forget rounding the corner at dusk and seeing a small white light coming from a corner of the shelter. It was a vending machine! with trail mix and powerbars and sugary drinks to keep hikers going.I did the math and there is at least ten miles of remote Vermont mountain wilderness in every direction. So here was a vending machine 15 miles away from the nearest town or road sitting at 4,000 feet in the Vermont taiga wilderness. 

I slept like a log by the comforting artificial light of the machine. Its low hum helped to lull me to sleep. 

I later found out that green mountain forest rangers keep it stocked every month or so. Power comes from small solar panels mounted on the roof of the shelter. Pretty cool stuff! I'm tired and somehow combined the last couple of sentences and had to do a double take....I thought you said it was stocked by Green Mountain Power Rangers for some reason. Not associated with any vending machine companies, but I saw a(n upright) Pepsi machine in the middle of the Saudi Arabian desert once. Literally nothing around it, just sitting in the sand, glistening like a corn syrup-filled mirage. Are you *sure* you saw this? It probably saw him though. Are you sure it wasn't RC Cola? ahh man its just RC Cola 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:

Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare

The lone and level sands stretch far away." I worked vending for almost 15 years. Typical industrial parks &amp; hotels. But I filled machines at 13 different prisons, 1 nuclear power plant, a chicken farm &amp; a medical testing facility where they tested on puppies. The last 2 places were def pretty far from most areas &amp; all those places had armed guards. I haven't worked in 8 years &amp; my brother tells me I still have access badges at the prisons. 

Most prisons are pretty low key &amp; the visit rooms are more like a cafeteria than what you see in the movies. Though one prison I went to was a super max or similar. Had to go underground and walk forever to get there. This one had cages for the prisoners (a long row where 8 or so could sit all together). When I got there they were cleaning up the floor after a guy had shanked someone over the weekend. 

At most of the prisons it was relatively relaxed &amp; even at the high security you were around inmates often &amp; alone. Was never scary as Guards were bigger dicks than the inmates. I did contemplate many times how I could break anyone out at any instant. They never checked the truck or my stuff. Only ever a cursory glance. If anyone needs some help breaking them out, just put all the guns in the bottom of the boxes full of chips &amp; walk right in Spent like 2 minutes trying to decipher what your username meant. Have an upvote! &gt; cages for the prisoners

We call those "cells" now. No this wasn't an individual cell. It was a literal cage in the visit room (&amp; referred to as 'the cage' by guards). 4ft wide by about 20 feet long with a chair in each spot &amp; just enough table to rest arms/put a plate on. With a little opening slot to share food back &amp; forth with their visitors.   This was the only place to have inmates sealed off from general public in all the prisons I was in How is testing on puppies legal? That's just too cruel. Not really sure. Never saw any testing done, but always felt bad for the little guys-you always saw tons of Beagle puppies, never adult dogs. They used to move them between buildings in pickup trucks without cages. Every now &amp; then you'd get a quick chance to pat a few on the head. Poor things, didn't much like spending too much time at that place.  My uncle worked vending machines on Chicago. He talked about the vending machines at Cabrini Green and the armored ramps that came off the truck to allow them to remove money and restock without being shot and killed.  I was excited to comment, but the I realized it didn't say "vending machine stalkers."

One day there will be an Ask Reddit post relevant to my fetish...

Edit: their was a misuse of the word there, up their Go ahead, we'll wait. I used to go to a day program for people "with issues."  Quite often, we would stalk the vending machine stocker to tell him what kinds of snacks/drinks we would prefer (we had one soda machine and one snack machine).  I think he hated us.   You should start it! Women inexplicably caught in vending machines? LoL ur so randum One day my friend, one day I was the proud owner of 4 vending machines. They were just one town over. So I guess one town over to answer your question. 

Edit: I gave an honest answer and got down voted. Y'all don't want the truth! It never ceases to amaze me how the most mundane questions brings about some of the coolest stories, offering a glimpse into the lives of the diverse group of people that make up Reddit. Used to stock for my aunt's small vending machine company and the most remote one she had was wasn't really remote rather that only one employee had access to it. It was in a juvenile detention processing office but in a room that only one employee worked per day and that was the only employee with access for the entire work day, sans an emergency. That fat guy put down 2 cases of Big Texas Cinnamon Rolls a week and plenty of Corn Nuts too. It's definitely not as remote as most of these but the most random soda machine I've ever seen is on the top floor of the Stamford Town Center. The mall has about 8 floors and the soda machine is at the top. It's literally the only thing on the entire floor and has an escalator going right up to it and one going right back down. The first time I took the escalator up there while exploring the mall I couldn't stop laughing at the fact that the entire top floor seemed solely dedicated to being the home of this lone soda machine. Someone should put a snack vending machine beside it. Give it a friend. I did vending for almost two years. None of mine were remote. However with the people I've had to deal with I'd have rather them be remote. People have no issue robbing you blind 50c at a time. This.

our workplace had a vending machine that the boss installed on his own dime and stocked out of his own money.

eventually one staff member realised that the key he uses to open the shop works on the vending machine and was taking a can for himself every now and then. the boss realised this and in a moment of short sighted anger decided to break off a key in the lock to prevent this, and then realised that he was now unable to actually refill the machine.

he then drilled out the lock and everyone was taking free cans quite often until he fixed it.
 "I am not a smart man"- Your Boss My favorite was people asking for free stuff. I mean does anybody think to ask this to the guy stocking the grocery store? 

 Yeah those people are annoying. I had a Dollar General Distribution Center as one of my stops. There were a few there like that but actually I had more problems with them flat out stealing from me. They would wait until my head was in one of the machines to snatch snacks drinks or snacks from my hand truck. The craftier ones would double team me. One to distract me the other to snatch... I caught them pretty often. They'd play it off as "aw man I'm just playing".

Really most of my horror stories come from Dollar General. Please share those stories. I would love to hear them. Here is my favorite story from Dollar General. 

The truckers had their own area separate from the warehouses. In their area we had a standard glass front snack machine and a bubble front can only drink machine. I was in there restocking when a truck driver came up to me asking if I could put orange juice in the bubble front. Typically the orange juice I stocked was the minute maid variety in the little plastic bottle. Unfortunately those won't work in a cans only bubble front. 

I explained to him that I can't stock this machine with this particular juice but I'd be happy to see about getting some canned oj to put in the machine for them. For some reason this was unacceptable. He started threatening me, telling me I'm racist (he was a black man), then told me he was calling my boss to get me fired. At which point I told him to go ahead and gave him my bosses number.

I finished stocking the machines and left, with him still grumbling of the injustices I've done to him by refusing to stock a drink that won't fit into the machine....

When I got back to my warehouse to restock I informed my boss of the incoming call, and went ahead and put an order in for canned oj for that machine. I restocked the truck and called it day. 

The next morning when I went to service those machines there is a hand written out of order sign on the bubble front. It was roughed up pretty good too but wasn't real sure what the deal was. The machine was pulled away from the wall too. 

I thought maybe they moved it to clean behind or something and jammed it up. Bubble fronts like to jam up and then people tend to rough them up. I pulled the note off the machine and opened it up. As the latch released a wave of cans, broken and leaking as well as unopened undamaged, came pouring out on top of me. It was very obvious that this machine was past roughed up.

So now I'm laying on the floor surrounded by cans, soaked in soda and pretty damn mad. I called security, who I was in pretty good with for hooking them up with chocolate milk. They came and we went and pulled the camera footage. Wouldn't you know it. Shortly after I left the previous day the trucker that was upset with me, shook that machine, bounced it around and pretty much tried to body slam it. It was like this machine talked bad about his momma. I called my boss who came and once seeing the mess and damage decided both machines in the truckers lounge were being removed.

So an hour later the install techs were there with the big truck used to haul machines. They packed them up and hauled them back to our warehouse. So the truckers lost their machines and now had to travel a good 1/4 mile or more to one of the main break rooms to get food and drink. The offender was fired as well. As for me I got to finish my route a nasty sticky mess over some oj. You 'cracker stackers' are all the same, can't a black man just have a damn bottle of minute maid!!!???? At literally every machine someone says something "jokingly" about getting something for free.  Every. Fucking. Time. except for the ones so remote that you have to spend 2 days wondering who the hell travels to it to buy the product. I worked in a pretty big city, so none of the machines on my routes were remote at all. To be fair, we've all been robbed by the machines themselves plenty a time. The amount of people robbed by the machine pales in comparison to the amount of people who claim they were ripped off and get refunds. I had a guy who every day for almost two years claimed the same machine took his 50c. Every single day. He would wait for me with a smirk, "hey man, that machine took my money", knowing I had to give him a "refund". Company policy was to give a refund no matter what. I got paid a percentage of what the machines made so he was stealing from me as well as the company.  By my calculation, he stole over $150 worth of product and close to $20 out of my pay single handedly. When I was in Spain for the first time, my gf and I drove from our hotel to a nearby city to go for a stroll. From there we drove further north to see a couple of places and eventually found what apparently was the remains of a volcano in the middle of nowhere. Because we had plenty of time we decided to go and check it out as the landscape was pretty different from what you're used to see being a scandinavian and all. Little did I know that it was a 4 hour trip directly into the sun only loosely covered by the leaves and branches of the trees scarcely covering the path. It was literally like going directly into the sun because it was so steep. Me being a heavy out of shape guy, I was getting pretty exhausted but I decided that I reallly wanted to see this.

Eventually we came to the top and because we're ignorant fools, we didn't bring anything besides paper, as I had gotten a throat infection because of all the aircon they have, so I was pretty fucking thirsty and all. When we came to the top, we had to proceed for another hour to get literally into the volcano which was through a narrow path literally like walking a jungle.

We came into the volcano and BEHOLD a sight for sore eyes. It was getting late in the afternoon and it had started to get a little dark, so we heard all the sounds of the birds, bees and practically every other living thing here.

In the middle of the volcano there were two things. A chair and a fucking vending machine. I do realize this place obviously have some guests, but who decide to trek for 9 hours!!! to keep this unit filled to the brim with sodas??

I did look around the edges of the volcano to see if there was any other way in for a car of something, but nothing I could find. so I came to the conclusion that someone either walks 9 hours with a backpack of sodas to keep it stocked or aliens refill the vending machine.

I don't have to say it was the best soda I ever had and I made sure to stock my pockets well with the delicious nectars from the heavens.

I would go to see that place again and spend more time there it was amazing. Amazing echo and animal sounds a truly once in a lifetime experience that fueled my thirst for more adventures.

I am currently at work, otherwise I would've provided pictures of the volcano. (there would only be trees, but you'd get the picture.) It's been 11 hours, are you still at work? Can we see the photos please? http://imgur.com/a/ZijO5 Attached is a link to the album :) Cool!

You definitely see the curvature of the caldera in the tree growth, also that little church is creepy, I've seen too many horror movies to go in it I am sorry I actually forgot it and now I'm in bed :( I put a reminder in my calendar  for tomorrow afternoon with a specific reply to you! Hello. As promised, I am currently uploading the photos. I saw the pictures and remembered there was this tiny churchlike thing!! in the middle of nowhere as well, I had completely forgotten about that. It just adds to the whole bizarre thing.

 I expect the uploads to be finished within 30 minutes, then i'll drop you an imgur link. Oooooh, now I'm really curious. Also, thanks, an OP who delivers! I went for a wander around Okinawa when I was working there a few years ago . Right out in the middle of the countryside was a vending machine that did fifty pound sacks of rice. Incredibly, as I was staring at it, asking what kind of person needs a vending machine for sacks of rice, this car drew up, a man got out, stuffed the machine with money and it vended this huge sack with a THUMP. He gave me a stare like "And...?" got back in the car and drove off. My flabber was ghasted. I don't know why - the situation or your deadpan storytelling - but this gave me such a bad fit of the giggles Now imagine it in Lewis Black's voice. Just the facts, darktask, just the facts. Oh well its not remote in the sense it is out in the middle of nowhere, but i did stock vending machines for the nuclear power plant in southern NC just south of Wilmington. it was an all day job to hit all the machines (as the employees aren't allowed to bring food or drink in) but it took nearly 2 hours to stock the machine that was in the core room. Several checkpoints, radiation monitors, some kind of grounding station. was very surreal being there. Ahhh Brunswick, I have been there a few times.  Food isn't forbidden on the entire site, just consumption is prohibited in the radiologically controlled areas in which you have to pass to get to certain points (break area on top of the turban being one of them where they had several vending machines).  If I remember correctly you could bring food through to the clean areas (just couldn't eat in transit) but dear god so many stairs lugging anything up was a chore.  Not a vending machine, but my mom recounted encountering young boys wandering in the jungles of Guatemala selling bottles of Coke. I have a cousin who worked at the pentagon years back, and he was telling me that he was always fascinated that there was a coke employee who had higher security clearence than he did, just to stock the machines in the pentagon He had one job. And he did it well. Or so that's what he want's people to think... it's the perfect cover for a spy. Nobody would suspect the vending machine guy. I think in this case, everyone would suspect the vending machine guy. "Oh hey, it's that guy who doesn't work for our top secret spy organization but is always inside our headquarters. Better keep an eye on him!" I don't know, from reading this thread it sounds like being a vending machine guy opens a lot of doors. The Pentagon, Air Force bases, Nuclear Power plants, Prisons... Kind of like wearing a hardhat, bright orange vest and tool belt can get into a lot of places. I saw a guy loading up a small plane for the cargo run out to a remote Alaskan village. Included were a couple flats of sodas.   By my calculations, the sodas cost about $1 per can to ship like that. Used to fly for a small airline in Canada. Pop freighters were a thing...4000 pounds of Pepsi in one swing, and you'd do 3 of them a day sometimes. All the big pallets of pop were for the stores up in these communities, and we gave them a special rate, somewhere around 60 cents a pound. Loading and unloading it sucked hugely, because you had to break the pallet down into individual flats of 24 cans, load it in the plane, and unload it when you got there. You'd usually have help, but only one or two guys.

Sadly, pop is cheaper than clean, fresh water up in a lot of those isolated places, so the diabetes rates are off the charts. Budweiser powers the pacific.  Many of the isolated island atolls around Guam and the South Pacific have acres of shipping containers full of Budweiser in them on freighter day.  
Many islanders sit around outside the port waiting for the ships to arrive so they can spend their US govt. Welfare checks on beer. I won't upvote until you show your work.  I'm sorry, it's nothing personal.  The verbal estimate for shipping I'd heard was 1 dollar buck per pound. A can of soda is one pound, using the common mnenemonic of "a pint's a pound the world around" and rounding 12 ounces to one pint.

1 dollar buck per pound times divided by one pint per pound times (approximately) one pint per can equals... ... 1 dollar buck per can

Of course, those were in 1999 Alaska dollar bucks, which are equivalent to 1.35 2015 American dollar bucks each. Marion Bradford published a paper in 1976 that detailed a new procedure of quickly measuring protein concentration. The Bradford protein assay becomes standard in every biology lab in the world, and the paper is cited almost 200000 times over the next few decades, the third most cited article of all time. Bradford himself took a job in industry and never published anything noteworthy ever again. As a biology grad student myself, do you know what the first and second most cited papers are?  Genuine question cuz I have no idea at all. [They are almost all techniques, as they end up being cited ubiquitously](http://www.nature.com/news/the-top-100-papers-1.16224).  

Lowry method of protein quantification is top, Bradford method of protein quantification is third, Sanger sequencing (a method of sequencing DNA, still used for some applications today) is 4th... I'm assuming the Laemmli paper at number 2 contains a protocol that improved SDS-PAGE. The next papers describe crucial techniques or alterations in things like Western blotting (for determining the amounts of very specific proteins in samples), RNA isolation (to allow investigation of which genes are actively "turned on" in a sample), design of BLAST (a program for comparing DNA or RNA sequences), or analysis of PCR by delta delta Ct method (which is a method of comparing expression of one gene you're interested in with the expression of gene you know (or assume) to stay constant in all your samples)

edit: expansion, seeing as some people were asking what each of those specific methods were.  There is quite a bit of info in that Nature article though! The private sector pays better, doesn't have have insane requirements to shit out academic research, and you don't have to teach  (can be a plus or minus, depending).  You also don't have deal with weird tenure politics,though I doubt that was a factor here. That fits a lot of people better. 

Edit meant to say teach not reach  [Paul Brickman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001887/?ref_=tt_ov_dr) wrote and directed Risky Business, one of the [most iconic movies of the 1980s.](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-48650-tom-cruise-underwear-slide-gif-JWkQ.gif)

He's only directed only one more movie in the 30+ years since then: Men Don't Leave  in 1990 which grossed all of $6M. And not much writing or producing either.

 Chris Moneymaker.
He was working an average office job when he played a $39 online poker game which led him to winning a $10,000 World Series of Poker buyin. He then went on to win the World Series for $2.5 million. His story created the biggest boom in popularity for poker, but he didn't go on to win much more than that. Formula 1 driver Pastor Maldonado, won the Spanish Grand Prix in 2012. Since then he has scored a grand total of 19 points and has also earned himself the, rather unflattering, nickname 'Crashtor Maldonado'. Haha, was just thinking about him actually. One weekend he wins, during the Spanish gp 2012, the next, monaco gp 2012, he crashes an opponent in practice, crashes into a wall half a lap later, getting a penalty for crashing the opponent and a gearbox penalty for destroying the car, manages to qualify highly, but due to penalties starts last, crashes an opponent in the first 200 meters of the race, ending both of their races. A perfect example of from hero to zero.

The next weekend, Canadian grand prix 2012, crashes into a wall in qualifying, destroying his good chances of starting high up in the order, destroying the car, and ruining his teammates chances of a better result.

The next weekend,European Gp 2012, crashes with an opponent that is mad slow, only a matter of time before Maldonado passes him, is told to drive carefully, fighting for 3rd place with 1,5 lap to go, crashes opponent, destroys both of their races.

The next weekend, British Gp 2012, after boxing in the beginning of the race, crashes an opponent after a rookie mistake, ending the opponent's race.

Has multiple crashes until 2015, in 2012 scores point after 1/2 of a season after his win, his teammate fights for points regularly.

How could have I forgotten about this one, a crash in his home country in front of his home crowd during a fan run, an event for the fans: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTbOcIvTvko

And most importantly of a all: never admits mistakes, never apologizes, always claims he would do the same in the specific situation in the future ( and he does and he crashes again ). Edit: he has claimed I think a week ago that his crashes are caused by "his big balls to finding the limits of the car and the track". Funny other drivers do it with not even a single crash in many years.

His career can be summed up like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROz77788Uo
 [Has Maldonado Crashed Today?] (http://hasmaldonadocrashedtoday.com/) He's so problematic that even tho he hasn't crashed since Australia, he hasn't finished a single race this season, spinning 3 times in one of them.

EDIT: I forgot that he did finish Bahrain. In 15th. After getting a penalty for lining up in the wrong spot of the grid. Good for him. Don't forget he lined up *behind* where he was slated to start. That's Amazing There's even a Twitter account about it.

https://twitter.com/DidPastorCrash The cover photo is extremely surreal...those aren't supposed to be upside down over ANOTHER car! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MloelRAijzk

Maldonado was exiting the pits and didn't give Gutierrez room to turn into the corner. Gutierrez was fine, for what it's worth - you can probably tell by his reaction on the radio. Haha, [this is great.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCvKsPjWMAAyXd2.jpg) The Pastor of Disastor

From me:

Pastor the Disaster

I'm sure there's more, but please keep in mind Maldonado seems like a pretty nice guy, who just happens to be very crash prone. At this point the only thing keeping Chrashtor in F1 is his large amount of sponsorship money.  He can be quite quick on his day but yeah. He wouldn't be in the sport if it wasn't for the money. 2012 was a silly silly season, the tires somehow worked great for some teams and bad for others and that changed from track to track Pastor Maldonado has never finished the (insert race name here)

Or sing "Hey Pastor, Pastor Maldonado!"  Edmund Gettier wrote a three-page paper in 1963 mainly to satisfy the administration at his college. He thought it was so terrible that he had someone translate it into Spanish and published it in a single obscure South American philosophy journal, and never published anything else.

That paper revolutionised the entire theory of knowledge, which had been largely static for over two millennia. I had to search for this. It is the best example of this in Philosophy. 

More specifics: It was a 3 page paper! In three pages some nobody came in and completely blew an entire field out of the water. 2000 years of general agreement over what qualified as knowledge (Justified True Belief) all undermined in 3 pages!

 Could someone elaborate? You can have a belief that is justified, and which is true, but which clearly isn't a case of knowledge. E.g: you look out the window, and see what appears to be your dog. So you conclude that "my dog is out in the garden. However, what you see isn't a dog, but just a bundle of sticks and leaves that from a distance looks like your dog. However, your dog *is* actually in the garden behind some bushes, outside your perception, so your conclusion was true. So, you have a *true* *belief*, which is *justified* (by your perceptual evidence - your eyesight), but it would be wrong to say you *knew* that your dog was in the garden. 

This is a very basic example, and it is easy to find much more elaborate ones by a simple google search. But the general point is true, that justified true belief is insufficient for knowledge. You need something more, and ever since Gettier's infamous paper, a big part of epistemology has been concerned with finding this further condition.

edit: a gram'ar

edit2: Thanks for the gold kind sir/madam I just finished a semester of epistemology and you explained this concept better than my professor did. That might be my fault, though. Fascinating stuff, thanks for the writeup Yeah, this is crazy. I didn't know it was published in Spanish and think he was pressured to publish to get tenure.

For those not familiar, philosophers thought, since the time of Plato, that justified true belief is knowledge. Gettier's counterexamples - thought experiments - show that it isn't. This opened a can of worms and it's reached a point where some philosophers say non-Gettierized justified true belief is knowledge. There are many nuances to the study of knowledge and i'd like to say I'm not an expert about it.  Kary Mullis won the Nobel Prize for inventing a better method for amplifying DNA.  Prior to that he was a scientist who kept quitting science to write bad novels and run a bakery.  Since then he's mainly known for being, well, nuts.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kary_Mullis &gt; Mullis reported an encounter with a glowing green raccoon at his cabin in the woods of northern California around midnight one night in 1985. He denies the involvement of LSD in this encounter.


:) &gt; He denies the involvement of LSD in this encounter.

Think of how many weird stories could have that sentence appended. Today, I went to breakfast and had pancakes. I deny the involvement of LSD in this event. I like to imagine that nobody questioned whether he was on LSD in the first place, he just pointed out that he wasn't.  "Nobody said anything about LSD, sir.." So, I've actually seen glowing green animals before.  Not a raccoon, but a squirrel and opossum.  Apparently my neighbor had an emergency kit with food and glow sticks.  The glow stick chemical got on the animals and when their fur got a little dewy they would glow.  This effect lasted for weeks.

When I first saw the glowing opossum I was alone in an outhouse at 3:00 AM.  I literally though I was dying or about to die. You forgot to deny the involvement of LSD in this encounter. [deleted] &gt; a better method for amplifying DNA

While you're far from being wrong, that's one hell of an understatement. Yeah, it's like saying that using a lawnmower is a better method of cutting grass than using a pair of scissors.  Technically correct, but a huge understatement all the same.  I'd say it's more like using tweezers to cut grass rather than like...one of those ride-on quadruple bladed mowers...seriously it was one of the most well deserved Nobel prizes ever (for the process, not necessarily who it went to, because apparently there's some bullshit with that).

Edit: More details on [The Bullshit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_controversies#Chemistry). (1993)
 So would anybody like to explain why? If not, carry on... Kary Mullis got his Nobel prize for his polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, which allowed a single fragment of DNA to be copied up to millions of times.  Because the copies are made in such a high number and so quickly, the technique has become integral in the field of genetics and medicine, especially with regards to infectious disease and cancer. I had a professor tell me that Mullis was tripping on LSD when he first thought of PCR. He was heading home from a surfing trip and the lines on the road were annealing and separating like strands of DNA. I'm not sure how true the story is, though.  We were told that he was fed up with having to keep coming back to the lab so often as it was cutting into his surfing time so he built a PCR machine to let him surf longer. Science in general for this? So many times someone gets a great paper  (nature/science/cell etc) in their career, never to repeat it.  [Brian Josephson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Josephson) is very similar. Won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973 for the Josephson effect, now mostly goes around promoting parapsychology. haha i actually have one of his books, dancing naked in the mind field...in it he actually defends astrology, which basically tells you a lot about the guy The company Jagex that created Runescape. (Or Andrew Gower, I suppose.) They have other games, but I've never really heard of people playing then. They bought ace of spades and ran it into the ground. I've never seen anybody *so completely* miss the point of a game before.

It still blows my mind every time I'm reminded that it ever happened. To be fair, Jagex kinda has a history of having no clue about what their players want

cough cough removal of pvp never 5get [deleted] What did they do to it? It's just FPS minecraft right?  The original game is, in a nutshell, a game about trench warfare. Victory is just as much about using your spade effectively as it is about shooting the enemy. When you play it, you'll learn about different types of fortifications, trench layouts, sapping, etc.

Jagex bought the rights to the game, and one of the first things they did was add jetpacks.

***Jetpacks.***

That wasn't the only thing, either, but pretty much everything they did showed about the same level of understanding. Cool, I might try this original version out that a few of the guys here are going on about. If you do try it, be prepared to give it a second or third chance. It doesn't play like most FPSs, so it'll take some adjustment. Be prepared to not know where an attack came from most of the times you die. I played the original, I literally did not realise the two version were the same game until it was pointed out to me. RIP [Funorb.](http://www.funorb.com/) :(  
Arcanists was like Worms, but a lot better in my opinion. 
 Arcanists was so fun! I do miss that game.  I found Runescape from Games Domain. (pre-Runescape Jagex online game dungeon)

Andrew Gower came into the chats &amp; started telling people about his new game. I started playing when the player base was less than 300.

Lumbridge was the only city,  &amp; everything outside of it was PvP with no level control. People would sit outside of the city with Black armor &amp; just kill anyone who left the safety. Good times. Oleg Salenko.

Was picked for Russia at the 94 World Cup, with only one game and no goals to his name. He scored 5 goals in the one match against Cameroon, setting a new record for most goals scored in a WC match (by an individual). 
Russia were knocked out in the group, and he never played for them again. 

Edit: Due to demand, I would hereby like to give a shout out to the legendary Rodger Milla! 
 And he won the Golden Boot despite Russia not making it out of the group. That's just pure craziness  One hit wonder?! Excuse me, [he managed the Ukrainian beach football team!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg_Salenko#Beach_football) [Percy Howard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Howard) is a former NFL wide receiver. He only made one catch in his entire college and professional career. And it was a touchdown. In the Super Bowl. How does someone with such a poor record even make it to the super bowl? There's a ton of instances where low talent players are in a sense buried at the bottom of the depth chart on a championship team. It'll happen infrequently. It was David Tyree in 2008. I can't think of any other examples offhand

EDIT: alright I get it Malcolm Butler and Chris Matthews made a splash in the Super Bowl. I just couldn't think of their names.  Joseph Heller said he was ok with having never written another book as good as Catch-22, because no-one else had either. Wd-40,  up and coming company called rocket chemical set out to make a line of rust prevention solvents and degreasers for rockets. On their 40th attempt at a water displacing solution they came up with WD-40 which turned out to have many uses. As its popularity grew they went public and renamed the company after its now only product: WD-40

Source: http://wd40.com/cool-stuff/history There are so many products produced out of the space race that made people millions. They say necessity is the mother of invention, but war is the angry father who locks his kid in a room until they produce something incredible.  If you came up with that on your own, congrats.  That needs to be as wide known as the mother part.  I wonder where we would be tech wise without the last 100 years of war. Yeah they make other stuff too. They have a whole line of degreasers, lubricants, etc. Wd40 is what they're famous for though. There's this Brazillian footballer named [Grafite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8eLSpDa_1E), who for one season, emerged out of obscurity to become the top scorer in the German League, became a star in his own right then returned back to obscurity the following season. 

EDIT: Grafite is pronounce "gra-feech" That was a incredibly strange Bundesliga season. 

Hoffenheim, playing in the top flight for the first time, were playing great football but then Ibievi got injured halfway through the season and they fell apart.

Bayern had one of their worst teams in recent memory, but still came second. Guys like Kraft, Ottl and Lell were probably the worst Bayern defence ever.

Then you had the champions Wolfsburg. They were around 5th or 6th position whole season but they had a great second half of the season. They were led by the amazing triangle Misimovi-Deko-Grafite. If I remember correctly Grafite scored 28 goals in 26 games that season. To be fair the whole team came out of fuckin' nowhere. Wolfsburg was always regarded as a half-decent team with a shitton of money but that was never really a contender for anything except 'most generic team' maybe. And for the first leg of that season it was true, Wolfsburg finished 9th at the winter break.

But *then*, after the break, they came storming out of the gates and proceeded to stomp on literally everyone they came across. If I remember correctly they scored five goals in each of their last three or four games in the season, lead by the unholy trinity of Misimovic-Dzeko-Grafite. Absolutely deserved champion and probably one of the best team efforts I've ever witnessed.

Grafite and Dzeko set a Bundesliga record for most goals by a striker team that no one has even come close to beat yet. i think he moved to a league in Saudi Arabia [He moved to the UAE.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafite#Al-Ahli_Dubai) &gt; Grafite has had a great period in Al Ahli, as he has scored a total of 59 goals in 65 matches.

Doesn't sound like he lost it really. No, he went to go get paid which you can't blame him for since athletes have such short careers relative to society in general.  It's not that one hit wonder, he had a nice career in So Paulo, he won the Libertadores (and the club world Cup where we beat that 2005 Liverpool). He also saved our great rival from relegation by scoring two goals in a match that if we had lost, Corinthians would be relegated. I think he even got some national caps. 

Also he was involved in a incident in the Libertadores where an Argentinian player was arrested because an infield incident of racism.  shit. That was one hell of a goal It's pronounced "gra-feech-y" in Brazilian Portuguese.
It's pronounced "gra-phee-t" in European Portuguese What's the difference between "fee" and "phee" in your examples? None, I didn't even realize I wrote it differently.  Oh good, because in my head I was reading it like "Graphite"  Steven Bradbury. Australian Speed Skater who won a gold medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics. That was the first time most people had ever heard of him (even in Australia). Fluked a gold, then didn't achieve more in his sport (but has a successful media career since). You can't mention Bradbury without giving the full story! In the 1994 and 1998 Olympics he was a medal contender, but was taken out in crashes.

In 1994, his leg was sliced open, all 4 quads cup open, 111 stitches and 18 months recovery needed before he could even consider racing again.

In 2000 he broke his neck and was told he could never race again, but he was determined to at least compete in the next olympics.

In the 2002 Olympics he fluked much more than the last race. He only made it to the semi-finals due to a faster competitor being disqualified. Being one of the oldest racers, he knew he couldn't out-speed the others so his strategy was literally to cruise behind and hope everyone else crashed. This happened in both the semi-finals and then the finals, and he became the first person in any southern-hemisphere country to win any winter Olympic event. At first i was doubting his integrity by cheering and coming first without deserving it, after the whole story and shabang, man, poor other guys but it sure was a better gold medal.  You leave out the entire story! Bradbury was trailing behind the other four runners, set to end up dead last, when in the final corner one of the other runners slipped, taking the rest with him - except for Bradbury, who was so far behind that he could easily evade and make it across the finish line for gold. [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAADWfJO2qM)! It gets better... he did the same thing in the semi-final. It gets better, in the quarter final he came third and only qualified for the semis because the second was disqualified for obstructing another racer. Best Olympic story ever. Just look at [that face](http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/29489af07ad8822f543aa2109f891f9a805e9bb6.jpg) More like Apollo OH NO! For those that don't know, he was coming last when the leader tripped and fell causing everyone who was behind him to fall as well. Steven was so far behind that he managed to avoid the other skaters successfully and win the gold. 
 Not only that - didn't the same situation happen in the semi final too?  Yeah, a semi final he only got into because the guy who was meant to go through got disqualified.  Absolutely amazing stuff. He's got such a good attitude about the whole thing too. Great public speaking career because of it. The truth is, he worked just as hard as anyone else to make it to the Olympics, so good for him.  Peter Higgs. He basically has only a few papers and this just happened to be one. There was a great article somewhere that talked about how the theory ruined his life because he could never live up to the hype. He got a divorce and never wrote another paper. And the kicker is he wasn't even the only (particle) physicist to propose it. Some historians attribute his recognition for the theory due to a miss-citation from Steven Weinberg.  He just has the best name for boson. EnglertBroutHiggsGuralnikHagenKibble-Boson would really sound worse. If only people could keep a straight face while saying Kibble Boson I'm not sure your first point is fair. He is very vocal against the 'publish or perish' culture, and the fact it encourages relative spam in journals. He didn't publish much because he spent a lot of time on each of those papers. Clearly it paid off. Quality over quantity! Richard Kelly, Director of Donnie Darko.  Todd Kaye.  America History X.

The guys who did Blair Witch.

The guy who did City of God.

Did Billy Bob direct Slingblade?

Edit: Tony, not Todd. My bad.
Also, I didn't know the Constant Gardener was directed by the same person who did City of God. Both fantastic films. One hit wonder status rescinded. *mmmnmhmmmn i reckon billy bob did do some of that there direcing*

edit: i am so glad so many people have sling blade impressions. I saw [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYmpPkaMPEg) a few weeks ago and rewetted sling blade, and i can not stop doing his voice. *I reckon i like the way he tawks* No you don't, Oprah! Fernando Merielles isn't a one hit wonder he also made The Constant Gardner, and Blindness. He hasn't made many films though.

I was also under the impression that Edward Norton made American History X and Tony Kaye was director in credit only. &gt; I was also under the impression that Edward Norton made American History X and Tony Kaye was director in credit only.

Almost. Kaye directed the film but when he couldn't provide the studio a cut of the film that they liked, Norton stepped in to recut the film.

I would imagine his lack of big budget directing after this film, is a direct result of this.  Billy Bob wrote and directed Sling Blade. Yoshifumi Kondo, who directed Whisper of the Heart, was being set up to be the next Miyazaki.  He died of an aortic dissection three years after it came out, having never directed another movie.

I do find the writers at Golf.com needlessly snarky though. How quickly we all forget ['Go Ninja, Go Ninja GO!'](https://youtu.be/R_K6971WmAs)?

EDIT: Corrected golfer's name The Heart Break Kid? Flappy bird Deliberately a one hit wonder.

He removed the game from the store because he was sort of offput (even frightened) by the game's popularity. He was earning a ridiculous amount of money and getting a LOT of hatemail for it, so he pulled out. To be clear, he was getting death threats daily. His *family* was getting death threats, mailed to their home addresses! He legitimately feared for his safety.  But... why? Because someone only got a 5 when they wanted a 6? He had a ridiculous amount of money in a less than affluent area of Vietnam. That alone is a dangerous game. &gt; less than affluent area of Vietnam

 He could move out of that area with the kind of money he raked in. Well that's just bourgeoisie. He was also getting shitty game press for "copying" Mario graphics. It was ridiculous. I have a lot of feelings on the matter, but basically I honestly don't blame the guy for pulling out.  Speaking of which, if he pulled the game and ads still run on it when I play it (got the original removed game on my phone) where is all that ad money going to? His Google ad mob account. Just because there are no more downloads doesn't mean they can't keep making ad revenue. I'm glad that game died out because I seriously could not get more than 5... It is all about dedication. At first i wasnt able to do one single point. Now i have reached fourteen - just stick to it, one day you might even get thirteen. I once got 105. Although I was in a play were my character played the game, so I had a *lot* of practice. that sounds interesting. What kind of play was it? "life" "shitty life"  The Night Man Cometh  My high score is 455. And I didn't die, I got a phone call from my ex girlfriend which caused the game to end.

http://imgur.com/pMC688W Is that the reason she is your ex now? Markus "Notch" Persson, creator of minecraft. His first and only real game was Minecraft. Scrolls was released from Mojang but you don't hear anything about it, and he stated he wasn't an active developer on it. His other game, 0x10c, was canned back in '13. Probably the most successful "one hit" in gaming history  Isn't Tetris one as well? I know Pajitnov did some pretty okay games, but I'm not sure "hits". He did Hexic HD, which came pre-bundled with many Xbox 360s, leading to millions of copies sold. He's had a few minor hits, but I wouldn't call him a one hit wonder. It's just that his biggest hit far surpasses his others.

After Tetris, his work involved designing puzzles to be used in-game. I believe he had a hand in Yoshi's cookie. Hexic was also on all zunes, leading to 1000 more copies sold You have a few too many zeros in there There are literally dozens of us!  Let's not exaggerate here. I think a knew a guy who had a zune. I could also be making this up. &gt; I believe he had a hand in Yoshi's cookie.

Boy does that sound filthy. Yep. Though I'm sure the 1.5 Billion dollars he made will keep him from getting too fussed about it
 Man, can you imagine that. Waking up one day and having 1.5 Billion in your account. I'd flip out, not because of the money but because my account is only insured to $100,000. FDIC is now 250k. Oh good, guess I'm ok then.  And now I'm sad. I dunno, Cliffhorse was pretty good.  In Physics, [Ernst Ising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Ising) invented for his PhD thesis what came to be known as the [Ising model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model) to study the problem of phase transitions. Studied a simple case and came to a wrong conclusion. After that made no contributions to physics whatsoever. However, Ising-type models went on to become the de facto starting points for any study in phase transitions. The kid who played Charlie in Willy Wonka and the Cholocate Factory

Edit: seriously cannot believe how many people are saying bates motel. Sorry if this wasn't clear. Willy wonka and the chocolate factory is not the same movie as Charlie and the chocolate factory. I am talking about the gene wilder one not the Johnny depp one I wouldn't count child actors. Them not becoming successful actors when they grow up is pretty much the norm. Now a child actor growing up to be a big time actor is rare. 

Neil Patrick Harris, Drew Barrymore  (Maybe), Ryan Gosling (he was on a Canadian sitcom as a teen, Breaker High. No one else from that show did anything), among others. I'm not an expert in the industry but these are some examples off the top of my head. 

Edit: Stop saying Drake, He doesn't count. He's not an actor now. Also like 10 people have said it. Well maybe you have a point but here is my point, he LITERALLY only ever acted in ONE movie and that movie was a huge hit.  One  hit wonder baby lol.  Yeah I wouldn't have really considered a child actor as a one hit wonder otherwise but I think its fair to say he is a one hit wonder.  He acted as if to try it out and then just dipped and become a vetrinarean or something Harper Lee only wrote one book in her whole career, "To Kill A Mockingbird" Go Set A Watchman is due for release in July.  It's a sequel to TKAM. 

Edit: there seems to be some debate about whether the new novel is a sequel or prequel. While the book was written before TKAM (an original draft as many have pointed out) the events take place afterwards so in my mind it makes it a sequel. However, as u/VonSandwich says it's probably a matter of taste. 

I had a quick Google to see whether the new book is being touted as either and it was silent to the point, so maybe it is meant to stand alone.  I guess we'll find out in July! 

Edit 2: right, the football is finished so I was able to have a more in depth search.  Go Set A Watchman has been called a sequel and a prequel, but sequel is used slightly more.   It's possible it is technically neither according the dictionary definition of both words.   

Edit 3 (if anyone still cares): Thank you to u/ectish who has coined it a "geequel"  Psssh, I bet it tells you absolutely *nothing* about how to set a watch, man. I've lived through the disappointment of the first book already. "Sure, it taught me to not judge a man by the color of his skin, but what good will that do me?" The most efficient career in history Phil fish, Creator of Fez It was his own fault though.  The fucker DELETED Fez 2 from his computer because someone had the audacity to make fun of him on twitter I wouldn't be surprised if Fez 2 wasn't even there to begin with. Phil is the kinda person though who had a folder full of scrbbled- on napkins in some drawer somewhere, compiled them together, then tirelessly through the night built them on a new engine and then deleted the whole damn thing because fuck you From what I understand (I have not research this particularly thoroughly, but I did watch the indie game movie + a few other resources about the development of FEZ) he is not a programmer, so I don't think he would've had a new engine at that point, unless he had a bigger team involved. Now he's gone to play one hit wonders as a DJ at indie parties. Jeff Banister, had only one career at bat in the MLB and hit an infield single. Worked in baseball for almost 25 years. By definition a true one hit wonder. 

http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/12/sports/la-sp-moonlight-graham-20130312 Riot Games has only made one game: League of Legends. Imagine if they were just called "Riot Game" Riot game on point That would be more fitting. In their defense (which is weird because I don't care for League of Legends), LoL isn't so much a game they "made" as it is a game they "make". LoL is an ongoing commitment for them. They're continually rebalancing it and making new content. It's not like they made the most popular game in the world and then just left the industry. That's true. Also it's the biggest video game in the world with the most players, one of the biggest pro scenes, and is making them shit-tons of money, so I guess it makes sense they would choose to just focus on this one game. Yeah at this point it's like saying, why doesn't the nfl focus on other sports. Riot is pretty much the overseer and rulemaker of LoL. Grant Wood was a one hit wonder in the art world. People remember American Gothic by him and not much else. Another is Michael Cimino  the director of The Deer Hunter. Who won the oscar for best director, and hasn't really done much else of note.  I'd argue Michael Cimino is almost as famous for screwing the pooch on "Heaven's Gate" as he is for directing "The Deer Hunter." Though really, since the whole POINT is that "Heaven's Gate" flopped like a dying carp, you're correct. So I just typed this for nothing. ENJOY YOUR REPLY AND UPVOTE. :D And it's a shame because they finally released the full four-hour cut a few years ago and it was almost universally hailed as a neglected masterpiece.

David Tyree became an overnight sensation after [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XeNefwABw) incredible catch in the final seconds of the Super Bowl. It is the last catch he ever had in the NFL; he was placed on Injured Reserve in 2008, and then he played 10 games for the Baltimore Ravens in 2009 before retiring. 

EDIT: For people saying it's not too impressive, just remember that Tyree [literally pressed the ball to his helmet to maintain possession](http://thesportspost.com/content/blogs/icons/helmet_catch.jpg) as he was wrestled to the ground by Rodney Harrison.  How is Joe Buck not only a professional sportscaster, but elite enough to call the Super Bowl? There are countless examples of him calling amazing and exciting plays with the enthusiasm of a hospice patient. I'm a personal fan of the way he is always swooning over Troy Aikman and staring lovingly into his eyes.  I can't stand Joe Buck. I keep hearing about the "elite broadcast team" of Buck and Aikman...your'e dead on about Buck, and Aikman gives us "pro tips" a 4th grader already knows.  Also the indignation Buck displayed when Randy Moss fake mooned the audience was ridiculous.  From Buck's reaction you would've assumed Moss grabbed a handicapped child from the crowd, pulled down his pants, and shat on their face.

But it turned out fantastic. It *looks* fantastic. The acoustics are notoriously poor. Cause he tried to play hardball and got fired and they had another architect do the interior. He had an acoustically sound design for the interior based on wave patterns but it never got built That exterior tho had to be really expensive. One of those things you don't realize until you see it in person up close. I never knew it was completely covered in diamond shaped tiles. The time to lay those out in a smooth pattern had to be enormous. They probably made the money back on it though through tourism.  It's one of those buildings known the world over that people go to visit.  It was one of the main reasons I went to Australia as a tourist. The marketing value alone in creating an icon of the country was worth the cost, in a certain way. From Wikipedia, other notable buildings of his are [the Bagsvrd Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagsv%C3%A6rd_Church) and [Kuwait National Assembly Building.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait_National_Assembly_Building)

Sydney Opera House is definitely a one hit wonder though. Even if other architects say those buildings are amazing, I hadn't heard of them until looking the dude up.

[Here's his wiki page,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B8rn_Utzon) if anyone wants to read more. Tetris. The company never produced anything memorable since then. Wasn't the "company" that produced Tetris the Soviet Union? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tetris_Company

was one dude, got his rights back works with this. Their other games are "meh" at best. Well, Alexey Pajitnov (the man behind Tetris) also was the man behind Hexic, the game that was preloaded on a lot of Xbox 360. (if counted as a "sale", then it would be at least in the top 50 of best selling games in history, possibly even beating Tetris for the Game Boy)

So while he by all regards is a one-hit-wonder, he has produced at least 1 memorable game since then.

EDIT: Clarified which version of Tetris I meant. The inventor of the Crocs. It's quite an interesting success story turned into a nightmare. They were victims of their own success and it almost pushed them to bankruptcy.  Just for clarification, being a "one hit wonder" doesn't necessarily mean the person didn't do *anything* notable other than their "hit," at least not in the VH1 sense of the term. It simply means that that hit was so big it overshadowed pretty much everything else in their career before and after. 

Take Dexy's Midnight Runners, for example: they came on Eileen, wrote a song about it, and it was a hit. They had plenty of good songs and performances for years afterwards, I'm sure, but nothing they did was nearly as successful as when they came on Eileen.


 &gt;Dexy's Midnight Runners, for example: they came on Eileen, wrote a song about it

Too ra loo rai ay, eh?  Depends on where you live - in the UK they had several very successful hits. By the time they released Come On Eileen they had already had a number one. Pluto

80 years is a rather short career for a planet. 80 years on Earth is only 1/3 of a year on Pluto. didn't even make a full rotation. Pulled in the first season. The fun story I heard about Arthur Conan Doyle is the whole Reichenbach thing was supposed to be the end of Sherlock. Unfortunately for him, people didn't want to hear about anything else and so he was forced to write the next lot. The whole reason that it's never explained is because it was never meant to have an explanation. He was supposed to die.

 When the Queen of England asks you to write more, you write more, even if your character is "dead". "Mr. Doyle, do you know what hobbling is?  It's how they prevented slaves from running away..."

/kathy bates She probably called him Sir.  Dude, if the Queen wanted William Hartnell to come back to Doctor Who, the guy would jump out of his grave and report to BBC. Death can't stop the British Empire, so neither should it stop Sherlock Holmes. I imagine the effect is heightened if one is English. Arthur Conan Doyle was Scottish. Narcissism of small differences. Try saying that in Scotland and see how long you keep all of your teeth. Yes, they dislike each other because it's nearly impossible for an outsider to tell them apart.  The closer people are, the more important the small differences seem.  That's what the term means.

But if I do ever find myself transported to a small island on the other side of the planet, I hope it's Fiji.  If only for the sake of my teeth. It's really easy to tell Scottish people and English people apart, you just have no idea of what it's like in the UK. It's really easy to tell Cubans and Mexicans apart, but most British people I know can't manage it very well.  It's because we're not as different as we think (and that some of us would like to think). I'm sure it is but I've never been to Cuba or Mexico and they're not even in the same continent as me so I'm not sure what the people are like. I'm 100% sure though that anyone could find differences between them and the accent alone makes that extremely easy for Scotland and England. No,just factual accuracy. Since they both hold themselves subject to the same Queen, I'd say there's more precision than accuracy there.  Anyway, the comment wasn't about Doyle at all, but whom the Queen's directive would most influence.  If the Queen of England asked me to do something, I'd quite happily be able to say "no." I thought your statement was a little ambiguous.My mistake.

As a matter of pedanticism i should point out that there is no such thing as the Queen of England,she is the Queen of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland.

A more precise description of ACD would've been British. You don't seem to know much about the history of Britain.
The Scots are not particularly fond of the English, and they only joined the UK because they were conquered centuries earlier.   I suppose I know as much about the history of Britain as the average Scot knows about the history of Latin America. The Queen should have asked for more Walter White. Like a monarchy version of 'Misery'? I got all sorts of images! The queen hobbling Doyle is a sight to behold This. You did! I'm not sure if you do anymore, though! [deleted] She's most widely known for being queen of England, not queen of Canada. Stop being pedantic. At least say she is the Queen of the United Kingdom... The War of 1812 says otherwise. I don't really know what that means but the monarch was a king in 1812 The War of 1812 was the second war the Americans fought against the British. Technically speaking it was just a continuation of our Revolutionary War as peace (and recognition of the United States as a country) was never formally declared until the end of the War of 1812. Well obviously but what does that have to do with the queen writing to you for more That's not true at all. The Treaty of Paris (1783) formally ended the revolutionary war and recognized the US "to be free sovereign and independent states". Welp. Guess my high school history teacher was full of shit. I bet he or she taught you that the U.S. saved all of Europe during WWII. What do you mean it's never explained? He explains it as soon as he meets Watson again. Moriarty caught up with him there, they fight, Sherlock dodges and Moriarty falls. Sherlock hides and proceeds to dismantle the rest of Moriarty's network with much more ease because everyone now thinks he's dead and isn't on the lookout for him.

It's true he was supposed to have died, but there was at least an explanation. I sort of slouch over my computer corrected. For me its clear in the writing that Sherlock was supposed to die. The explanation is so half-assed. It's basically "fortunately I knew certain martial arts." Not that I blame Doyle, still freaking LOVE Sherlock.  That was in the TV show, not the books.
 Wrong, because Moriarty never fell in the TV show Maybe he's talking about the TV show with Jeremy Brett. That one does the fall and reappearance just as it is in the books. That could be the case, but then he'd still be wrong about the explanation not being present in the books I suppose Oh, absolutely. No that was definitely in the books. He climbs to a ledge and watches Watson and the investigators below, then one of Moriarty's helpers tries to drop rocks on him. Except it WAS explained thoroughly. by sherlock though. while he's not as unreliable in the original stories as most modern depictions make him out to be. he certainly has no problem lying. Everybody lies... The Adventure of the Empty House explains it completely. To my understanding he was sick of writing Holmes and wanted to spend more time being a physician, so he killed of Holmes in the manliest way possible...then he started receiving death threats. And he wanted to be known for his more "serious" works, as he basically thought of Sherlock Holmes as a potboiler. And to be fair he would probably be remembered as an important early fantasy/sci-fi author on the strength of Professor Challenger even without Holmes. &gt; Manliest way possible

I wasn't aware Sherlock Holmes died motorbiking off an exploding shark in space while the bike is burning and he's eating a steak. Thats called being killed off in the most insecure way possible. What would be the manliest way then? Facing your death without fuss and treating the grim spectre with nonchalance. You don't see it like that in many Hollywood movies. Hollywood aren't exactly known for their ability to show reality are they? While ~~being assfucked.~~ assfucking. Yep, and supposedly he was super fucking pissed about the whole thing. He was irritated with his fans for wanting more. It was explained. It's not a fantastic explanation because it wasn't planned originally, but was contrived afterwards.  Uh, it does have an explanation. You're right that he wanted to kill Holmes off but even in "The Final Problem"(that's the story Holmes gets killed) there's actually no confirmation of death i.e. his body is never found. There's a cliff, signs of struggle, and no returning footprints, so Watson assumes Holmes died fighting Moriarty. In "Empty House" it is explained that Holmes knew Moriarty's men would track him and kill him so he had to feign his own death until the time was right. He killed off Moriarty and climbed down the cliff, running away and traveling around the world. How is this "One hit wonder"? It was basically never intended that he would only be remembered for this. Can you name anything Conan Doyle did that wasn't Sherlock. Now I get it. ^But ^'The ^Lost ^World'? Michael Crichton? No, He's talking about the classic Conan Doyle novel *The Lost World*, where a bunch of explorers find a hard-to-reach plateau upon which contains a while lot of life previously unknown or extinct in all other areas on Earth.

He also wrote some weird short stories and [this one book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Land_of_Mist) that was basically propaganda for mysticism, his religion of choice, so it's a good thing most people only know him for Sherlock Holmes.

Still, calling Sir Conan Doyle a one-hit wonder because he really only got big by writing a fuck ton of books and short stories about one character is unfair. All those books and stories were hits. It's like saying Ian Flemming is a one-hit wonder because his one character, James Bond, is the star of his numerous hit novels. Ah, my mistake. I wasn't familiar with that Lost World. Massive numbers of hugely successful  books about the same character, including the Queen of England begging you to make more after you want to stop, doesn't qualify as "one hit." That's many hits in a series. That fairy photgraph hoax that he fell for, hook, line, and sinker? The only other thing I know is that he went bat shit insane over the loss of his son and pissed off Harry Houdini.  He was knighted for his brilliant historical volumes. I think some people noticed  What other works of him do you know besides Sherlock Holmes?? 50+ short stories and 4 novels over several years? That's not a one-hit wonder at all. That depends on what you do or do not classify as "1 hit". I argue that the entire franchise was his hit and nothing else he did gained notoriety.  Considering his work on historical volumes of the Boer War earned him his knighthood, your argument is a poor one.  He also had a hand in one of the biggest hoax in archaeological history with the Pilt Down Man. Conan Doyle wrote a lot of successful stories, they were just all with Sherlock Holmes. He's like a guy who is in a successful band, but is 100% convinced that his side project is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Like if Lil Wayne not only kept making rock albums, but also tried to quit rapping altogether.  Although you're correct in that ACD originally intended on killing off Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock DOES explain his faked death in the next story, The Empty House.  "The Final Problem" - "Write more, write more, write more!"

"Okay, okay, I'll write one more. This takes place before everything. Hound of the Baskervilles." - "THAT WAS THE BEST ONE YET, WRITE MORE." 

"No, no more, I told you, I'm done." 

*Cue ACD's house being egged for 10 months*

"FINE, JESUS CHRIST, I'LL KEEP WRITING MORE" Doyle's career with Sherlock Holmes basically consisted of him writing some stories, declaring that he wasn't going to write any more, then getting paid ludicrous amounts of money for another set. Later, he started getting lazy and doing a lot of copy-paste work - many of his later stories have the same basic plot as earlier ones. There are a few towards the end that are so inconsistent in tone and style that it's questionable whether he even wrote them. It's pretty established that he never wanted that to be his career though. He wrote a couple of books and they worked and then people were really only interested in that after.  I find it hard to call Arthur Conan Doyle a one hit wonder.  For starters, there are a lot of Sherlock Holmes stories, most of which were well received. That alone is the equivalent of a string of hits. 

He also wrote a bunch of things that were not Sherlock Holmes, like the Professor Challenger stories, the most famous of which is The Lost World. The White Company is also an excellent adventure story set in medieval England and France.  &gt; Unfortunately for him, people didn't want to hear about anything else

Except for that whole [*Jurassic Park* thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_World_(Conan_Doyle_novel)

tl,dr: Doyle's 1912 novel *The Lost World* has been as influential in subsequent culture (especially the kind of shit reddit likes) as his whole Holmes oeuvre.
 It wasn't a new concept when Conan Doyle got ahold of it. It might have had some sway but there's no way it was quite as big as SH. It's something that literally everyone knows and even without thinking a standard detective is largely taken from his portrait. Arthur Conan Doyle, however, also wrote *The Lost World*, creating the entire genre of "we found dinosaurs living deep in a jungle or on a lost island somewhere".

*The Lost World* was also part of a series of stories featuring Professor Challenger. Challenger, although little known today, was a huge success in his own right and influenced *a lot* of early pulp fiction.

So, IMO, Doyle cannot be accurately described as a one hit wonder. Doyle also believed in "garden fairies" and Sherlock was written as a parody of the hyper-logical mindset. [deleted] Parody is probably the wrong word (strawman?). But, the intention was to put up a character that was on the extreme fringes of logic; no one actually thinks like Sherlock.

That said, I can't actually find any sources for my claim. At best, I'm finding references that Doyle hated the character.

He did believe in fairies and other mystical ideas and was convinced Houdini, a long time friend, had magical powers even when Houdini himself explained that he didn't. Cavedog.  They made Total Annihilation, the disappointing TA: Kingdoms after Chris Taylor left, then they cancelled the rest of their games in progress and got broken up to work on kids' games. Big Berthas. Just build a lot of Big Berthas.  Good enough in TA, good enough in Supreme Commander Bomber rush That mechanic is so broken. You leave the berthas out to pasture on the enemy base, knowing that you will hit something, aquire lots of kills (even though they weren't the targets you were aiming at)  and it suddenly becomes a sniper rifle with pinpoint accuracy and massive damage.  well he later went to gaspowered games and made supreme commander which has a lot of the old total annihilation feel. I still play this game. The modding community is (or was) awesome. I think TA: Kingdoms is disappointing, but just different enough to be fun. I never saw anywhere saying Iron Plague was cancelled...I looked so hard for it. (Oh to be 11) It wasn't cancelled, was it? You can but it on places like gog.com if you want. Hey! This is the first time I saw TAK here. Did you finish the campaign? It came with 7 kingdoms when my dadgave me a pc years ago. I was 11 when I played it.

Any thoughts on why it is disappointing? Honestly, my mind was blown by that game, it was my first rts game along with 7 kingdoms. 7 kingdoms had a high learning curve for me so I didn't appreciate it until later years.

But TAK, hey, I was obsessed with that game. The problem is I haven't finished the campaign, and I really want closure. 

I was at stage 18 or 21? The one where I have rock golems in the middle of a low visibility forest where I am attacked from the west, southwest, and south of the map. 

I don't even remember what those things are now.

Do you know where I can get that game? I just want to finish it.

Goddamn nostalgia felt like a pressure washer's stream to my balls. Total Annihilation came free with a pre-built pc I got. Played that game till the disk was transparent! Big Bertha ftw! i enjoyed TA: kingdoms : / Hey! This is the first time I saw TAK here. Did you finish the campaign? It came with 7 kingdoms when my dadgave me a pc years ago. I was 11 when I played it.

Probably played it as much, if not more, than TA. In the NFL there is a running back named Peyton Hillis. In one season he was so good with the Cleveland Browns that he appeared on the cover of the video game Madden for the next season. He ended up holding out of his contract for more money and now he bounces around teams as a backup.  Ah the old Madden curse He got voted onto the Madden cover,  so it wasn't quite as "prestigious" as it was when the luminous Vince Young made it. He did pretty decent with the Broncos before doing to the Browns.  Greed seems to kill a lot of NFL careers... that and players murdering/raping people.  [deleted] He was making almost a million a year before he quit. I'd gladly get paid that to risk brain injury in a professional sport. [deleted] There are tons of jobs that are way more dangerous/demanding and don't pay 1/50th as much.   The average career is like 3.2 years. 

If you don't cash in when you get a chance, especially at running back, you are a fool. The game usually doesn't hand out second chances.  The reason the average is so low is because of the tons and tons of college signings each year that go no where and are gone after 1 year.  Most of the players you actually get to see play are in it much longer.  Yes, but even superstars see their career abruptly end. Terrell Davis, when he was 26, rushed for over 2,000 yards. The next season he rushed for 211 yards due to injuries. The following years saw 288 and 701 yards rushing in 14 games, less than a single season. 

He was the top running back in the world at 26 and his career was never close to as productive again. This is why NFL players so often hold out after a career year, if they don't, their career can easily be derailed and they will never get that earning potential back.  This is why running backs especially have seen a massive decline in their salaries. Unless you're Adrian Peterson or Marshawn Lynch, you are not good enough to justify a large salary. Running backs get injured all the time, and they're mostly interchangeable.

The money that the team saves, incidentally, goes where it belongs - the offensive line. True. Very good point. And sudden injury can stop a career in it's tracks as well. On top of that the Intensity of the sport combined with how much they train. That's why players only lasts 3-5 years.  I was going to say this one. He had a little spark as denvers kinda FB RB. I picked him up the next year in fantasy. OOOWEEE President James K. Polk. Purposefully served only 1 term as US president and achieved all of his goals including the annexation of Texas, Oregon Country, and the entire Southwestern USA (at the expense of war with Mexico of course). 

Considered to be the only president to fulfill all of his campaign goals, even though those goals were not concerned with human rights but rather greed.

1 term wonder. He was James K. Polk, Napoleon of the Stump! Austere, severe, he held few people dear! He built an independent treasury The song is going to be stuck in my head all day, but i'm not complaining. I love TMBG! You beautiful bastard for reminding of They Might Be Giants  Also, here's a reminder that their new album Glean just came out and it's pretty good! Erase and Unpronounceable are amazing songs, easily among the group's best. It's a good album. I gave it a listen and it didn't really do much for me. I will have to give it another shot though. I've loved this band for about 25 years. Nanobots was their first album in years that I really thought was great. Oh well Now that's a lyric I haven't heard in a era...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTiCU_fqCg For some reason when I clicked that link it showed me Nigerian advertisements. Are you in Nigeria? I clicked that just for the Nigerian ads and didn't get any.  Are *you* in Nigeria? Maybe I am. Where am I? Who am I?!?!?!? we'll polk 'em

then we pierce em I heard it last week, directly from John Linnell! They're a lot of fun to see live. Austere, severe, he held few people deeeeaaarrr Young Hickory, our 11th President! Just saw them play this in Boston a few days back, the Johns are the best! Reddit had always seemed to have a liking to Polk, but his presidency seems like reddit should hate it. 

Foreign conquest galore. He probably was the only president to pull an actual false flag attack as well.  But there's a They Might Be Giants song about him, so all is forgiven! I feel like he is far enough back in history that people don't really care about that.

Napoleon and Caesar are hailed leaders and they were both complete warmonger douchebags. *singing saw solo* Dank reference Austere, severe, he held few people dear.
 Also got a middle school in a TV Show named after him.

Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide for any poor souls who never watched it


EDIT: holy shit I get it, Al Bundy. Four Touchdowns. I know! "Do you think Lisa Zemo is hot?"
"I can't answer that because I'm 40" Gordy: Wow you guys grew a lot over the weekend.

Moze: Gordy, it's been a whole summer.

Gordy: That was one heck of a party. Al Bundy went to Polk High. four touchdowns in one game Then amounted to nothing afterwards, sells womens shoes.  
 The cheerleaders at Polk high were the Polk Dots. James K. polk wouldn't mind that his school was full of bullies, insane teachers and gross school lunches. That's me, Ned Bigby.  And my two best friends try to do the impossible... I watched that show and regularly applied the lessons in it to my life.. Did they work? Ned's Declassified was surprisingly helpful for me when I was in middle school (and even in high school too.) The fact that it was a genuinely funny show with a ton of entertaining, memorable characters solidifies it as my favorite sitcom Nick has ever put out.
 I really enjoyed it too. I remember using some of the tips irl and that they turned out to be really useful, although I can't remember that many off the top of my head. The one about the Nurse's office having a bathroom open 9 times out of 10 sticks out in my mind, though.  I'd have to say Drake and Josh beats Ned's by a good bit in my book. Glad I wasn't the only one to remember this. Same, literally the best show to hit Nickelodeon. Oh you poor soul. You forgot about Drake &amp; Josh. I think they are made by the same guy, Dan Schneider  He also made Zoey 101, Victorious, and iCarly. There's a well supported theory that all of those shows are in the same universe, especially with cameos like Drake in iCarly going "Oh, hey Meghan" to Carly (who is the same actress as Meghan on D&amp;J) Yeah there were a bunch of cameos in his other shows. So Drake + Josh = Spencer?  No, crazy Steve is Spencer. WHO ATE MY ENCHILADA? Wait, he does? Its like at the very end of one of the episodes its probably on youtube So he basically made my child hood good to know.  Scott Fellows was the creator actually, if Dan "Rough Rider" Schneider was involved you would have noticed a lot more closeups of bare feet and disturbing innuendo. And more "oh my god!" The Hollywood Creep. Why is he a creep? After reading this comment I googled "Dan Schneider creep" and all I got were other forum posters making up theories on how he must have touched Carly and Zoey just because he made kids shows. Well [this](http://i.minus.com/i0YJCenWEhgjD.gif) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/8hTmr.gif) (Both are probably NSFW) are from one or two of his shows. Both are pretty weird for Nickelodeon. Well you can't blame him for those 2, Ariana Grande is pretty amazing.


...jk, it's insanely creepy to imagine him sitting in the director's seat telling a teenage girl "yeah, now shake your butt while they spray water all over your bare torso! This is some great kids' television we're producing here!" Well, I don't know how true this is, but I heard someone once say that Schneider has a bit of a thing with feet. When either iCarly or Sam and Kat came out, to advertise the premier, he had this hashtag where people (mainly kids, of course) would post pictures of their feet with the words "iCarly" or something like that on their sole.  Avatar the Last Airbender. Stop mispronouncing Spongebob. Hell, I *still* enjoy watching it. I only wish they would have continued the series after middle school. Lol Spongebob would like to have a word with you. I'm not a big fan of much past Season 4, but I fully believe that it's not only the best show to hit Nick, but the greatest cartoon of all time. The Simpsons would like a word with you. Avatar: The Last Airbender would like a word with you. Garfield would like a word with you. The Boondocks is laughing it's ass off in your direction. I don't really watch The Simpsons, but I was thinking more children-aimed cartoons. The Simpons would probably take the cake for cartoons in general lolno Married with Children I thought that was a Canadian show? Family Channel bummed a few shows from Nickelodeon. It can't be, they have grade 6 in middle school  I'm from Canada and I was in middle school in grade 6. Oh, well I guess I was wrong, I always thought it was an American thing  It starts with sixth in some American middle schools, too.

Mine started with fifth. Yeah I just thought it was only American middle schools  I went to James K. Polk elementary school and found it really interesting that there was another school with that name in a TV show. Woahoahoah! Just curious, how does that show relate to Polk

Edit: didn't read it as a school IN a TV show I love that shit. Probably the main reason today's youth has heard of him.  I loved that show way back in the day! I was waiting for someone to say Polk. He was my high school AP US teacher's favorite president for this very reason. Dude had a James K. Polk  bobblehead on his desk. For our final project, we had to make an album cover and come up with historically themed song titles and lyrics. My buddies and I decided we'd replicate the cover of PULP FICTION but call it POLK FICTION. He saw it and burst out laughing - a rare sight for this particular teacher. That may have had more to do with the album cover than the title though.  They Might Be Giants wrote a song/ covered a song about Polk. It's a hit and I remember that song,


"In 1844 the democrats were split
The three nominees for presidential candidate
Were Martin Van Buren, a former president and an abolitionist, 
James Buchanan a moderate.
From Nashville came a dark horse riding out! It was James K Polk, something something something, MANIFEST DESTINY!" 

 I too have read TIL Yes. I saw that a few weeks ago. But I'm also a high school US history teacher, and I cover this material every year. 

Antebellum America, Civil War, and Reconstruction are my specialties.  I too am a fan of They Might Be Giants  I too have taken a history class. I, too, have listened to politicians rant about the good old days. I, too, have stayed at a holiday inn express. Or JoCo Are you going to see them on tour? It's a good tour this year, they got themselves as the opening band. I actually was just at their Chicago show! It was pretty great, of course! They even played my favorite song, "Man, It's So Loud In Here" which was a pleasant surprise!! They played a bunch of nice old tracks that I haven't heard in concert in years. It was a great show! All knowledge that ever was or ever will be originates from Reddit.com, amen. Or taken a history class...  I too have passed seventh grade Or listened to They Might Be Giants.  I too have attended American public schools. Nah, I went to highschool. you're not the op  and here is your one hit Have you also taken a U. S. History class? I don't.  I haven't. It's a good job people share things on reddit on reddit.  Ladies and gentlemen, [They Might Be Giants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9SvJMZs5Rs)! I play this song for my classes when I teach about him. Also worth noting that he CHOSE not to run again, he said at the start of his campaign that he would only be president for one term Right. That's what I meant when I said he purposefully served only one term. Oh sorry I glanced right over that line All cool I grew up in the town that he was born in (Pineville, NC). My Elementary School was right down the road from the James K Polk memorial. Which was all recreations of the town at the time he lived there. So cabins with straw mattresses, windows without glass. That's all my Kindergarten self remembers from that field trip. It was pretty cool as an elementary schooler knowing a president came from your town. Also my Kindergarten teacher told us that she was related to him in some way. She said cousin, but I'm sure she was just simplifying it so 5-6 kids would understand. She was a neat lady, kinda miss those days.. Mostly just nap time though.  &gt; even though those goals were not concerned with human rights but rather greed.

? Greed? Don't you mean freedom? Greedom He then died of illness almost immediately after.

Couldn't have taken that second term anyways! He died of cholera. In 1849 cholera killed hundreds of thousands in North America alone.  Perhaps up to 200,000 in Mexico, possibly 50-100,00 in the Mississippi-Ohio river areas. He may have been a one term wonder, but the amount of stuff he accomplished couldn't justifiably be called "one hit". He's my favorite president, and I hope to see another like him in the future.  Well except for him fabricating reasons for the war with mexico, "show me the spot" and all that. We already have too many presidents making up reasons to go to war I think.  Come on. You mean it's not admirable to repeatedly provoke your much weaker neighbor and force them into a war they have no chance of winning, all for the explicit purpose of taking half their land from them "legitimately?" It should be noted that most of the land taken was essentially worthless at the time. The big piece that the US wanted was San Francisco, since the Bay Area is probably the best location to launch ships from on the west coast.

And, for the record, Mexico and Texas were at war first; the US inherited the conflict when we (finally) annexed Texas.  Yeah, I'm aware of that. I also know that the land that was taken by the US is almost certainly in a better state than it would be if it had remained part of Mexico (The US started designating and protecting national parks much before Mexico, for example). 

But that doesn't erase the fact that James K. Polk  engaged in a brazen imperialist land grab against a peaceful neighbor with a similar enlightenment-inspired government. It was pretty reprehensible, considering it took place in the mid 19th century, not the 17th or 18th. I don't know if I'd call it Imperialism. That's a concept that was developed a bit later in the 19th century. I'd call it a traditional land seizure, as states have done, and will continue to do, throughout history. With the current climate in congress I don't think another president like him is possible.  There is so much gridlock and bullshit over nothing issues that I don't think anyone will be able to cross the political divide and unite the nation like Polk did.   Actually, Polk was very divisive. Many Northerners saw him as trying to enlarge the power of what they called the Slave Power.  The acquisition of new lands led directly to the Civil War.  He may have been divisive, but he was one of the most active presidents ever.  He had one of the strongest first(and last) terms of any president.  I agree that the world was different for him, so he didn't have to cross the divide as much.  Now though, any president who wants to get anything done has to go through a lot of shit.   Indeed But the person who does accomplish this would be quite admirable. I guess I'm more optimistic than most. An imperialist So was Caesar. At this point I'd probably be happy if any elected president did what they said they would do. So he was the only president honest about his goals. Pretty much. He didn't sugar coat his bellicosity regarding his diplomacy with either Britain or Mexico.  He also shit himself to death. As did many in 1849 from Cholera What about Buchanan, who was president to do absolutely nothing and serve only one term? He didn't achieve anything really though. He can't be considered a one-hit wonder. He just plain sucked, let the nation fall apart and left Lincoln to clean up the mess. That's my point. He did what he wanted (nothing) and left  I wouldn't say he achieved everything he wanted. He got much less of the Oregon territory than he promised his Whig supporters. This infuriated them and he most likely would not have won another election. You are correct. In stead of carrying on the banner of Midwestern Whigs who wanted Fifty-Four Forty or Fight, he agreed to the partitioning of Oregon at the 49th. This of course was better for the relations between the US and UK in the long run. Because all other politician's motives are guided by altruism, never greed! Hahahaha I agree with your sentiment. Just calling it as it is, not saying it was an exception.  I'm pretty sure John Tyler was the one who actually annexed Texas.  Yes the annexation was passed under Tyler. Polk was the one who pushed the issue over the disputed territory with Mexico. Isn't there a song about him.  It was either Weird Al or  They Might Be Giants or someone like that that sang it. Tmbg He also lowered the tariff, the more you know Yes and created a new Federal Treasury Beat me to it.  He also died 30 days into what would have been his second term, so kinda gave it all, achieved it all and died. This is why Polk is my second favorite president, after Lincoln. Tennessee pride! (Although he was born in North Carolina)  He saw the pinnacle of Jacksonian Democracy.  His campaign basically said "In one term, I will triple the size of this country." And he had a mullet.  Hahahaha yes!
James K. Polk
"The territories we want, the mullet we need" Considering how he got shit done, he's one of my favorites. He's one of my favorites too. Party because I'm a history teacher and most Americans don't know about him.  James K. Polk makes me feel special. What is not Oregon and Washington technically should have been Canadian :P 

The Province of Cascadia could have been a thing! With killer IPAs and mind bogglingly strong pot. Now I wish Cascadia existed. Shiiiit... So HW Bush except successful  Polk intentionally committed to one term as president. Other one term presidents didn't (they just lost their reelection campaign or died). That's what makes Polk unusual. Very much. Polk was a very good statesman though too. But he was also a part of the plantation aristocracy of the slave states looking to expand their influence into the west and perhaps even Cuba. Also died like 3 months after presidency. Ah. Great engineers. The only thing you need for a one turn wonder  He also invented the polka. ^^^^^^^^/s Is your username an Ave Ventura reference? Hahaha yes Awesome   
"Ventuuura"   
"yes Satan?"   
Great movie. Ah yes, [James "The Adonis" Polk.](https://youtu.be/aeHlVo__Gmk) The President who's wife brought in the tradition of "Hail to the Chief" as the song to note his arrival, since he was so short. I don't think it applies because it's not like he could have more than two terms and politicians usually cannot go higher than president of USA anyways so he peaked and then his peak just passed. Actually Tyler was much more responsible for the annexation of Texas. Polk ran on annexation, but Tyler being a lame duck, pushed for annexation before Polk's inauguration. By the time Polk took office, Texas was essentially annexed; however, it was Polk who signed the final Treaty. 

[Source](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_annexation) Sadly, greed is WAY easier to sell than human rights. He also scored 4 touchdowns in one day. In four short years he met his every goal:

* He seized the whole Southwest from Mexico 

* Made sure the tariffs fell 

* And made the English sell the Oregon Territory 

* He built an independent treasury 

**Having done all this he sought no second term!** I want to believe that as he made his farewell speech there was a mic drop...even though there probably wasn't a mic. I'll just leave this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTiCU_fqCg Also got a high school in a TV show named after him. 

Polk High. Where Al Bundy scored 4 touchdowns in a single game :) But more importantly, a UNC - Chapel Hill alum. Wasn't he also like 600 pounds? Or was that Taft? That was Taft. Polk was about 5'8", lean. Taft  always was big. Topped off at 338lbs by end of his presidency. It was a tough time for him though. That's how the stress wore on him during his presidency.  aah, thanks! There are 12 Presidents who have had only one term. Buchanan and Hayes also didn't seek second terms rather than being voted out, although they don't have very good legacies. Carter and Bush are a bit more controversial in terms of legacy, as they happened more recently and are still alive. &gt;including the annexation of Texas, Oregon Country, and the entire Southwestern USA (at the expense of war with Mexico of course)

Nice.
&gt;those goals were not concerned with human rights but rather greed.

Meh. He certainly wasn't a slow-Polk!  Mr. Polk's War Having done all this he sought no second term. I too saw the TIL post about that He then died shortly thereafter from the stress of trying to achieve everything he promised in one term as a mexican, fuck that guy.  Blame Santa Anna. Not Polk.  i blame santa anna for being a corrupt, cowardly, piece of shit. Polk deserves his fair share of blame as well. Provoking an unjustified war for whatever reason he had makes him another piece of shit I can understand that animosity. He picked a fight with Mexico by sending US troops into Mexican territory then conquered 51% of your country.  Federico Macheda. Scored an important goal against Aston Villa once, now plays for Cardiff. Football(Soccer) has plenty of those players who looked promising but only for a short period of time or for one match.
  
Here is an [X-post](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2unbwn/what_are_the_best_onehit_wonders_in_football_you/) Yep, I'd question how far you can extend the concept. Most players will have highs and lows, so I'd say there needs to be a large disparity between one purple patch/goal and the remainder of their career, before I'd consider them a 'one hit wonder'.

Kevin Davies and David Nugent have only had one cap each for England, but I wouldn't call them 'one hit wonders' because they've still had decent careers. Michael Ricketts meanwhile had a couple of top seasons before spending the rest of his career bouncing around the lower leagues- more of a 'one hit wonder' in my eyes. Macheda I think is fair enough, though, as he's done nothing much since. Interesting idea.  Matija Kezman was supposed to fire Chelsea to the Champions league, never done anything outside of Holland. Prolific strikers signed from the Eredivisie tend to be very hit and miss. You may end up with Suarez or Ibrahimovic, but you may end up with Kezman, Afonso Alves or Altidore. Hey, he had an okay career. He didn't have his prolific goalscoring record outside of Holland, but he has cult status amongst Partizan Belgrade supporters, and eventually played at some top clubs throughout Europe. He wasn't a bad player, just definitely not what Chelsea expected.  I'm old enough to remember Ra, in 93 he was the captain of Sao Paulo and the Brazilian national team, he got hired by Paris SG, but by the summer of 94 he didn't play a single minute in the whole World Cup that Brazil won. Every sport does. Chris "Red Pop" Shelton hit 9 home runs in the first 13 games of the 2006 season. He finished his 5 year career with 37 total home runs. Reminds me of Michu for Swansea two seasons ago. Rose from obscurity, scored 22 goals in a season, and then just disappeared off the face of the earth. Napoli's bench I believe. To be fair he was really good for Rayo Vallecano. And has been struggling with injuries recently. Oh we remember him very well, it was only because of him that Liverpool missed out on the league that year.  him and fucking Arshavin.  &gt;Liverpool missed out on the league that year.

Say that again, baby. Slowly. Ooooh.. You shouldn't kick people when they are down. Next year we'll be back..... Fuck it, who am I kidding, I'll be happy just getting 4th this year  You should be ecstatic if we get 4th this year, it's almost impossible for us right now. He scored two important goals in two consecutive appearances. I remember getting so hyped for this boy... Ah well :(  I remember when he called Rooney a chav. That was hilarious. This was my first thought, actually.

Still a fucking legend for that goal.

[Here is the video for anyone interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT8gIJ5_354)

Background: he came on for his first game ever as an 18 year old. United were drawing with Aston Villa, and really needed to score to help them win the league. Then he did this, and nothing else. Uhhhh no, in FM14 he was the Serie A top goalscorer for my Cittadella side 3 years running and won the European Golden Boot. Thank you very much. He scored a goal with his hand that nearly won Manchester United the title though. He scored twice against Villa! On November 13th 2010 he scored the first goal for United in a 2-2 draw against Villa. It hurts me to even mention that game over four and a half years later. 

I hope he never plays against Villa ever again! [deleted] I tried to get him signed up on FM10 or something, he always became the best player in the world.  Phenomenal realism. What a bastard he is for scoring against us as well, that was a hard loss to take.  Was that the season you looked like challenging the top 4? How times change. Iirc that was our last season with O'Neill, so it would've been one of the seasons we were pushing for top four. We had three sixth placed finishes in a row, the last one was probably our weakest push though. It's depressing being a Villa fan now, though the last few games have been very positive.  he may get to do the same two things at the same time next season I might be wrong, but I thought that he "plays" for Cardiff in the loosest possible sense of the word. Cardiff fan. Can confirm. Macheda is utter dog shit. Scored a few goals but his all round play, effort, ability is just terrible. Huge waste. Side note, how do you feel about the whole blue-red-blue thing? It sucks. 

Going back to when it first happened, it caused so much division. The club announced the red kit; then quickly backtracked and said it wouldn't happen and then did it anyway. And the fan base has never recovered.

I think most were happy to go along with it as long as Tan met the promises that he made. But he hasn't done that and we are slowly drowning in debt. 

Personally, it's ruined my love of Cardiff City. I've been very vocal about the problems the kit change caused; been on TV, radio and featured in the press about it and, when the kit went back to blue, I think I thought my love for the club would return. But now? I just don't care. I don't have the same enthusiasm for it, I don't want to go and watch games anymore and I know I'm not alone. The club is struggling. 18k season ticket holders at the start of this year; now we are down to 4k for next year. 

The red kit killed our club.  Tough times indeed.  Good for you for making a stand though.  I'm a Dundee fan myself, so over the last 15 years or so I've seen more farcical ownership than people get in a lifetime.  I've been where you are with it too, feeling fed up and drained. Trust me, something will happen and the love will come back.

PS. Gavin Rae was a decent player wasn't he. I never understood the fans who just sat back and let it happen, really. I feel without the fight, we would have still be in red.

Yeah, I hope so man. You guys have had a terrible time of it too and it's good to see you back in the Prem.

I loved Gavin Rae - we used to sing his name along to Happy Days. He was there during some great times - FA Cup Final and a Play Off Final. A fine footballer for us.  likely to be sold by us as well - damn it Ole Solskjaer IIRC he scored the winner vs Sunderland a week later! Kiko is still a hero. That goal is burned onto my brain, if he hadn't scored it Liverpool would have been champions that season.  i was at that match people where already leaving to beat traffic and missed it haha dumb fucks  You mean at least one United youth player every season? Wow.  I know none of those names. Cool. Macheda is a footballer. Aston Villa and Cardiff [City] are football clubs. Right...? Jeremy Lin.

We had the whole "Linsanity" thing a few years ago, he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated for a few weeks, and then he just fell out of the public view. he's a decent player with the lakers, averaging 11 ppg. not necessarily a one hit wonder, but just that the hype died down

edit: alright guys he's a shitty player my bad lol He's not like David Tyre where he is gone after another year. If you follow basketball he is definitely still on the radar as a decent player and does his job a a a point guard. It's just that he played 4-5 games averaging 30 pts, earns a huge contract based on that playing, gets injured, and now is doing waaaay worse. (Comparatively) To be fair. He wasn't the 1st 2nd or 3rd star in Houston he was a role Player. , he deserves to make more money because he was the starting pg and not a bench player like he was in NY. And now he's on the Lakers.  To add, he flourished in with the Knicks until Carmelo Anthony returned from injuries. Since then he's never had a good system or team for his play style.  He came back down to earth and then got hurt and missed the end of the regular season and the playoffs. Melo isn't responsible for the system Jeremy Lin played in. Iirc, Melo is the one who pushed for Lin to even get minutes for Linsanity to happen in the first place.  You can't say he is waayy worse. You got to understand his play style and what teams thought he could do. On the Knicks he was basically "the Man", ball in his hands, calling most of the plays, taking all the shots etc. Then he signs with Houston where he thought he would be "the man" again but Houston ends up trading for James Harden who is right now one of the best SGs in the league. and Jeremy has to play second to third Fiddle which isn't his style. He still drops 30 points here and there when he was with houston. Then he gets shipped to Lakers where they have Kobe and Steve  Nash and a very terrible coach in Byron Scott. So you can't say he's a one hit wonder, he's just not getting the ball and shots like he did in New York especially in Mike D'Antoni's system. Steve Nash and Kobe Bryant have been injured for more than half the season. Jeremy Lin is just not a starting point guard, hes a backup. 

also mike d'antoni's system inflates the value of any point guard, great players like what the linsanity hype suggested Lin was can play in other systems He is a backup because the lakers are tanking and he cares. He would be the starter for the team if they weren't in tank mode. Byron Scott doesn't play him on purpose. yeah he should be on the lakers but not many other teams he would be a starter on. out of all the playoff teams i would say maybe on Dallas he could be a starter. He went to the Rockets with a huge contract (poison pill provision that the Knicks couldn't match, similar to Chandler Parsons' contract this season), but then the Rockets picked up Harden, who has the *exact same* skill set as he does, but better. They couldn't play together in the starting lineup, so he was relegated to the bench, where he showed the same ability when Harden's out. His contract was too expensive, so he was traded to the Lakers, where he was supposed to start. Once Kobe went out, the Lakers decided to tank in order to keep their pick and Lin was *too good* to be played because he would definitely have won games, so they started tankmaster Ronnie Price, relegated to the bench again, and was *specifically told to not work inside his skill set*. 

Jeremy Lin isn't a one hit wonder, he's been moved around from unfortunate circumstance to unfortunate circumstance. 

 It's his own fault for signing with Houston though.
It's been pointed out time and time again that he had a chance to really build a lasting legacy with the Knicks, but he went for the money instead.   If I remember correctly, the Rockets structured the contract in a way that the Knicks couldn't match because of all of their contract obligations already. Playing for a coach who actively tells him to run fewer pick 'n' rolls, and if you watched the Knicks during Linsanity you would know that the pick 'n' roll is Lin's most effective weapon.

 Ha. Remember Freddie Mitchell? Receiver for the Eagles that benefitted from Terrell Owens drawing defenders away and Freddie also did well when TO got hurt. He got a HUGE ego, demanded a massive contract and was a free agent because no one would sign him, then he was out of football a short time later He had a huge ego well before TO was around.  "I'd like to thank my hands for being so great," comes to mind. As a non-eagles fan, I never heard of him before TO gave him the opportunity for so many open routes. Not surprised to hear he was a twat before that.  Yeah, he had an ego, and for no reason.  He had a grand total of 388 yards and 1 TD over the combined two years he played before TO came along...  Also, apparently he rushed twice for a combined -4 yards, and his longest rush was 12 yards, which leads me to believe that the other was -16 yards.... &gt; Also, apparently he rushed twice for a combined -4 yards, and his longest rush was 12 yards, which leads me to believe that the other was -16 yards....

This is one of the best anti-Mitchell things I've ever heard. I hate big egos from mediocre athletes and Mitchell is near the top of that list. 4th and 26! There was a interesting, in-depth essay on Jeremy Lin in ESPN or sports illustrated a couple weeks ago. The media really hyped him up and of course he had no say in that. The pressure to meet those expectations and the coach he is currently with have made it difficult for him to get back to that level of play.  You stutter when typing?

 Well, he and coach Byron Scott don't get along, so Lin isn't getting the playing time he deserves on a shit Lakers team. Jordan Clarkson is pretty awesome though  Exactly. He's still one of the best 500 basketball players in the world.  Definitely not a shitty player. I saw a post about the prototypical "average" NBA player, he fit the mold for it perfectly at the PG position. So, I wouldn't say shitty, totally average, the problem was that completely average was such a downgrade from the Linsanity hype that it seems like he's terrible.  Yeah, had him on my fantasy team this year. Dude can still ball. Clarkson just came outta nowhere this year and stole some minutes  They haven't been playing him that much this year. Can't really blame him for not getting higher points when he isn't getting any minutes. Granted, on a better team he would be riding the bench and scoring single digit PPG with most likely fewer than 20 minutes per game.  I personally don't even think the hype was well deserved. Sure he had a few stellar games for a rookie, but he got WAY more media coverage than he should've for what he "accomplished".

Edit: a word He came off the bench behind a worthless old fogey the first half of the season, and behind a rookie the second half. 

Now, I'm a Laker fan, so I'm happy about this. It helped the tank, and let Clarkson get a ton of quality development time. But from Lin's standpoint, probably not where he imagined his career at this point. I would definitely consider Linsanity a 'one-hit wonder' of sorts.  People decided to guard him.  &gt; he's a decent player with the lakers, averaging 11 ppg. not necessarily a one hit wonder, but just that the hype died down

Meh. Since the "Linsanity" season with the Knicks, he's averaging 15 points and 6 assists per 36 minutes of floor time, all on 43% shooting. From an "advanced" perspective, he's contributed .091 Win Shares per 48 minutes since that season, with the league average being .100. 

Those overall metrics are aided by his time with the Rockets, though. This season, he's been a bad player on an even worse team, contributing .068 WS/48, with a Value Over Replacement Player of 0.6.

Recently, he's *barely* a replacement-level player. Whatever the NBA equivalent of the Mendoza Line is, he's been courting it. He's still a good NBA player.  his comment should be down voted for inaccuracy   11ppg on a 21-win team desperate for offensive production isn't impressive at all, it's pretty miserable actually.  tank commander byron scott benched him and limited his minutes, allowing rookie jordan clarkson to average around 20 pts on 34 mpg Lin played the 2nd most minutes out of any Laker all season (after Wes Johnson) and averaged more minutes per game (though only barely) than Clarkson as well.

Everyone complained he was being held back by a team that was too good in Houston, and now the narrative is that he's being held back by a team that's too bad in LA? Doesn't really seem like that's what's actually going on here. When you get outplayed by a rookie who plays the same position as you, things certainly aren't looking up. 

He's a capable enough reserve, but he's clearly not a starting-caliber PG and he's light-years from being a star player. 

 Yeah but at only 25 mpg, and that's after being pulled out of the starting rotation in december. Since then hasn't been starting consistently. He actually did pretty well when he started, but couldn't really get it going coming off the bench in 5-6 minute spurts. Even on this team byron scott wasn't putting the ball in his hands, for tank reasons or not. Clarkson and Lin did not compete for the starting PG spot, this was by no means a very competitive team. Especially since we don't have our draft pick if it goes above 5 To be fair the hype died down because he's not very good at all anymore. It is probably 80% due to his coaches and teammates on the rockets and lakers and his play style of being a ball dominant guard not meshing well but averaging 11 ppg on one of the worst teams in the NBA isn't exactly something to be proud of, putting aside the fact that he's in the NBA  i wouldn't go as far to say "decent" That is literally the definition of a one-hit wonder.  He is not a decent player.  He would get zero playing time on a team like San Antonio, Golden State, Cleveland, ect

He is on a roster that is designed to tank.  His worth was in the massive expiring contract and that's why the Lakers got him.

Edit:  When I think of a "decent" player, I think of JJ Reddick, Iman Shumpert, Omer Asik not a fan of jeremy lin but i dont think hes trash. if decent is overrating him than perhaps average or mediocre is better? JJ Redick is not decent. He's the best basketball player in the NBA and the best thing that's ever happened to me. Fuckin fight me bro. I kind of feel bad for him. If he hadn't gone off in those ten or so days and inflated everyone's expectations, he could've developed into a valuable bench player, maybe a 6MOY and a legit contributor on a championship team. Instead, he's been stuck with loads of criticism from the fans of every team he's played on, brought on to be a starter before slowly being relegated to the bench, and just generally mired with things that distract from what he is - a capable guard, but probably not a starter and definitely not a superstar. Teams are going to keep taking chances, paying more than he's worth because of his international marketability and the chance that they can somehow reignite the player he was during Linsanity, but I honestly think the best thing he could do is turn down any offers for starting roles and seek a 20mpg situation as backup PG on a team like the Bucks or the Pelicans that are headed for first round exits this year but have young cores that will be contending seriously for the next few years. He got a contract for 25mil. Don't feel bad for him.  Completely agree. He got his payday and has his place in the history books. Even though he didn't blossom into a bonafide superstar, he had his run. I think/hope he's grateful for that. From what I've seen of his interviews he's a very humble guy who was really excited to have his shot at the limelight. Actually, if it weren't for Linsanity, he probably wouldn't even be in the NBA right now. No... That's not true at all. He averages 11ppg. Anyone who can do that will stick around for as long as they want. Provided they're healthy.  He averages that now... but back when Linsanity happened, he wasn't getting the minutes to do anything. I mean just look at his [game logs for that year](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/linje01/gamelog/2012/): until his break out game against New Jersey, he was getting fewer than 7 minutes of playing time and mostly in garbage time. Isn't that kind of the role he has with the Lakers now? He started 30 games for them this season, playing less than 30 minutes in 55 of the 74 games he played. Kind of, but IMO it's still not right for him for a few reasons. He's still being paid way too much and not doing the job he was supposedly brought in to do. He lost his starting job, initially, to freaking Ronnie Price, which is symptomatic of a larger issue - LA probably won't be in a position to seriously compete until Kobe retires. They have some potential, but there's too many ifs. IF Jordan Clarkson keeps developing and IF Julius Randle enters the league as everything he's supposed to be and IF the Lakers draft well this year and IF they attract some good free agents on the cheap in this off-season, then maybe they can have a decent season next year, but IMO it'll be closer to what the Timberwolves looked like this year: not a lot of winning while their young talent starts to actually develop. But on top of all that, Lin is just clearly not happy there. Visibly clashed with Kobe and Byron Scott has all but said he doesn't want him back next year, which works out well for Lin since he'll be a free agent. I think potentially playing alongside young stars or potential stars like Davis, Antetokounmpo, and Parker in a fresh situation where he has some more ability to set expectations going in will appeal to him more than returning to a rebuilding team where he just had to endure a dumpster fire of a season with a head coach who doesn't want him and a living legend he can't play with. I agree, the media kills slightly above average (but not superstar) level players. Especially if they are extra marketable. Jeremy Lin was never an extraordinary player. Even when he was on his 10 game tear and Linsanity started, he was "great" per se. I think he may have had the MOST turnovers in a 10 game span ever. 

That's not to say he didn't play well. And it's not to say that super star's don't make mistakes. I agree that he had (has) potential to be a great role player. Possible 6 MOY is a reality for him. Unfortunately, the media has convinced people that he is a starter and that he should be offered max contracts. Why? Because he's an Asian kid from Harvard that plays at a slightly above average level, which isn't common in the NBA. 

 Cavs could use a backup PG. We love Delly to death, but we also kinda need someone with better handles and scoring ability. With Haywood and Marion leaving next year I feel like Lin would be an awesome bench addition. I've thought he could do well there, or on the Bulls on place of Brooks or Hinrich. I feel like Lin, Shumpert, and Love could be the core of a legitimately threatening mostly bench lineup while Kyrie and LeBron rest. Sounds like he got ahold of that stuff from space jam and his dealer cut him off  He never would have been given the chance if not for Linsanity. He flat out sucked for Golden State. He got a 25 million dollar contract from those 10 days and he's established himself as an nba talent player.  Not sure there's much to feel bad for really. His next contract is gonna pay him around 6 mil or more for probably like 2 or 3 years.  If he didn't go off for the 10 days he wouldn't be in the league anymore. I believe it was the last game of his 10 day contract where he had his first good game. I think he was on an unguaranteed contract and the deadline for cutting players was looming. Pretty much the same thing, but it's not like they had to sign him to a new contract after he blew up, they just had to not fire him.

He had even asked his coach right before this game if he should register his car to NY, was told don't bother. well he (and/or his agent) was asking for a starting pg salary after he became big in ny. i don't blame him for doing it, you get yours when you can. if he wanted to develop his game some more he could've gone with bench player pay. there wouldn't have been that much expectation from the organization and the fans. too bad he couldn't really sustain his level of linsanity I think he's very underrated at this point (I hate that word underrated to). 

Defensively he's above average and offensively he's been good. Any player would love a career like that. I hope he gets a chance, like you said, on a good team. I think he'd be great with dallas who will be looking for a PG and I can't believe I'm saying this but I could easily see him going back to the knicks since they are desperate for any kind of talent. All this said I think he most likely stays in LA im sure he likes it there and the fans like him too  I also feel that putting him in LA with a young team that isn't well structured didn't help. 
He really needs to move into a protg role under a very solid point guard. 
You can't say he doesn't have flashes of the great player he used to be! 
But honestly, the lakers have a lot more problems than their point guard under performing.  Pelicans got two-time champion Norris Cole and that scrub Holiday. We don't need no Lin. Those 10 days earned him millions... I think he's cool with it I mean he's still getting a paycheck that is way more than he is worth, so I bet he's pretty happy still You feel bad for him? He was a dude who was a borderline nba player, like he was almost out of the league. He got a chance and parlayed it into a legitimate nba career and a shit ton of cash. He could easily be playing in Europe right now for a fraction of what he makes with never having any of that publicity. Hes definitely not a dude you need to feel bad for. you feel bad for him?! linsanity led to him getting a $25 million contract. I too feel bad that he's making more money than "he is worth." Yes he should be turning down millions of dollars Yeah, I feel bad for him and the contract he signed  But if he didn't go off in those games he was likely to be sent back to the DLeague or he might have quit and gotten a normal job.  I would probably not feel bad for him because those 10 games or so helped him earn a much bigger contract than he would have.  I don't feel too badly for anyone who can make an excellent living playing sports Yeah I kind of feel bad for him because teams are going to overpay him millions of dollars too. Oh wait, nevermind.  I don't feel bad for him at all. I can guarantee you he wouldn't trade it for a second. He makes millions of dollars, plays for a great historic franchise in a fun city...

I'm sure he doesn't stay awake at night thinking, "Man, if I wouldn't have had those games where I was unconscious on the court shooting the ball, my life would be so much easier. I inflated everyone's expectations!"

Hell no. He wouldn't trade those games for anything. They are probably the best moment in his life by far. Why the fuck would you feel bad for him? He made a lot of money off that two week hype. Way more than a guy who turns the ball over more than anyone else in the league should ever make. He also has a Harvard education and lives in an LA mansion. He deserves zero pity No. Lin was on a 10-Day NBA contract in his second year after already being cut by two teams. Without Linsanity he would not be playing NBA basketball today. He just finished making 25 million dollars in base salary because of those few weeks where he was a star. He never had a chance at being even a rotational bench player before Linsanity, let alone 6MOTY.  He is a 10th man that you would play limited minutes on the second night of a back-to-back but would see no playing time during the playoffs on a competent team.  

He is worth a contract because he appeals to the NBA's MASSIVE Asian fan base, is well-mannered without an ego problem, and won't make crucial mistakes to lose a game for a team.

Now that I think of it, he would probably be useful on a team like the Clippers right now instead of an Austin Rivers, but they are not a competent team.   Differing opinions, I guess, I think on the right roster or with the right coach he's a valuable piece. But you're right, as long as he's the only Asian player with name recognition, he'll continue to make bank, likely even if he deteriorated as a player. I think he could be a good 6man buuit it needs to be on a team that can let him handle the ball. He's a Dantoni player Other than playing for the Lakers professionally still and getting paid 15 million bucks in 2014 from them. I'd hate to think being a damned professional in an area makes you a one hit wonder. To be fair his contract was only really avg 8 mil a year but was structured to be 5m 5m and 15 mil just to fuck with the Knicks. Yeah, that's very true. yeah this is a terrible example. Lin had 6 games with 20+ points this season. nowhere near a "one-hit wonder". he could be the starting PG on a mediocre team and put up 15-20ppg, or a backup PG on a better team putting up ~10ppg. 

Was his NY run his career highpoint? Almost definitely yes. But he's still a worthy player in the NBA Especially considering how small NBA rosters are. Just making the team makes you one of the best players in the world. And starting makes it an even smaller number. and then there are players like a-rod, pujols, and hamilton. all making 9 digits when clearly they're all past their primes.  Yeah, they are worth money in other ways due to their names through jersey sales and just general fame though. But it's similar to a one-hit wonder musical act. They still record other albums, still tour, still live off the popularity of their past. 

Lin had a few weeks of AMAZING basketball and hasn't come close to that level since He's a starter, not a superstar. In other words, he's getting more than his one hit in, so no, I disagree. Sort of a nice recent article about him from ESPN here: http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/12561636/inside-jeremy-lin-life-linsanity-new-york-knicks Not even close to a one hit wonder. While he's not worth his contract, he's still a respectable player in terms of production. He probably plays too much DotA and doesn't focus on his training enough. Just kidding but he is known to be a big fan of DotA. Is he good? Probably. I often find that athletes can get very good at games they enjoy because of their quick decision making skills and being familiar with competition/clutch plays.

Plus, Dota has heroes that don't require daily hours of mechanical practice like Quake or Brood War. He's still a successful player in the league, though. I worked at a casino at the time.  So many of my co workers were STOKED!  I mean, we're talking like 90% Asian people.  Didn't matter if they were Vietnamese, Minh, Filipino, or whatever: Lin was representing.  Oh well, they still have Pacquiao. Lin was different. He was an American Asian. So for those of us in America, he represented us in a way that guys like Pacquiao and Yao Ming never could. Yeah they're all Asian, but for Asian Americans once you get to the 2nd or 3rd generation in America we're not all that connected to those on the other side of the world. That's why he got me and my friends excited even though even at the height of Linsanity we knew he was just a role player.  We're actual NBA fans, not just guys who started paying attention when Lin blew up, so he was pretty clearly overperforming to us, but we couldn't help but get excited. And as long as he's not playing against the Bulls, I still cheer for him because he's at least proven he's an NBA player and went through so much just to get even that far.  He's just not the superstar he was falsely hyped up to be in that one short period of his career. Plus he gets so much shit now for Linsanity and the contract he's actually become underrated. Believe it it not, white as I am, I think I get this. There are struggles for you guys that are tough to understand. Especially if you consider the reasons why so many parents and grandparents of those 2nd and 3rd generations came here in the first place. You ever asked an older Cambodian about how they came here? Not necessarily a great idea. Unless they are 2nd gen or more: in which case they tend to know so little (parents choice) that they have no reason to be uncomfortable about the fact that they have no knowledge of their extended families or why they came here. I ran into this only a couple times before I learned to avoid the topic, so perhaps this isn't as common as I think. But can you even imagine being in school, learning about your family's country from an American teacher, and suddenly they talk about the Khmer Rouge? Everyone looks at you (insensitively) for insight, but its the first you've ever heard about this stuff. Suddenly you wonder if you always had such a small family, and why your parents never speak of their families.  I guess similar stories are told by many non Asians too. It's a craziness that I, a middle class white dude from a small town, can never really appreciate. I feel ya man as an Asian American. Not a basketball fan, but man can I relate to that feeling of an Asian American rising to fame in America, representing us He wound up being a somewhat decent, if undoubtedly flawed, bench player. Dude has at least stuck in the league. A food truck at my alma mater named a burger after him. Not even in the city he played for. I have no idea what they were thinking.  They must be linsane. He's still in the league, playing decent on a garbage team. [deleted] Points per minute and PER are a better metric for skill since his minutes have gone down sharply.

 That happens to college kids all the time and it hurts more than it helps imo He still shows up in /r/dota2 every few months- mostly because he plays the game, but not completely obscure. He even had an interview in valves documentary Free to Play, which was recorded when he was still relevant! Jesus at first I was thinking you meant Jun Lin, whose murder was videotaped by Luka Magnotta. I was like, shit that's pretty dark/kind of obscure, how is this getting upvoted so much??! I wouldn't call someone who played multiple years in the NBA and makes 15 mil a year to be a one hit wonder.   He was all the rage in Taiwan at the time as well.
 He shouldn't have left New York.  He was a starter for like half this year and is still pretty good. Only reason he isn't in  the public eye is because the Lakers were so incredibly bad  He never fell out of the public view. He then went on to become a starter and bench player for the Rockets and then went to the Lakers. If you are in a LA team you don't simply 'fall out of public view', it's the biggest sports media city in the country. 

Reason why Linsanity became so big because he was practically unknown and bounced a lot thru the league, then he gets called up from the D-league and starts making amazing plays. He obviously hasn't met the success but that's also due to his coaches not giving him consistent time. He is not a 1 hit wonder. That's what you get for somehow managing a 3.0 at Harvard. 

How the fuck does that even happen? Aka, "that week my Asian lady co-worker suddenly got interested in basketball." This article seems to cover it well, but sadly I don't know how to hyperlink http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/12561636/inside-jeremy-lin-life-linsanity-new-york-knicks He is still an idol in Taiwan. Same with Jimmy Wang and Yani (the golf player). Granted they didn't maintain their role in the spotlight as long as most people would wish, they did the unthinkable and made it into the big game from an island of only 23 million people. Not to hijack a top level comment or anything (ok that's totally what I'm doing) but another NBA example would be Larry Sanders.  Has a couple unimpressive seasons, then comes into this league his 3rd year swatting shots all day long, blows away the analystics community with his rim protection numbers, only misses making the NBA's honorary All-Defensive Team on a technicality, and is, real talk, the most important piece on the Bucks' playoff team that year. Gets a $45 miillion contract, and everyone expects him to be one of the best defensive anchors in the league for years to come. 

Then he gets injured and plays poorly the next season, and after that decides he doesn't like basketball any more and retires from the sport at 25.  too busy playing dota 2 Lol what? He's a starter for the Lakers... Far from a one hit wonder.  Definitely the best example I've seen so far.  ESPN Magazine [just did a write up on him](espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/12561636/inside-jeremy-lin-life-linsanity-new-york-knicks) since then Similar to this, remember Peyton Hillis? He was on the cover of Madden. &gt; he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated for a few weeks, 

#HEY, MORE LIKE A MONTH. THAT'S FOUR WHOLE WEEKS BUDDY. "A FEW" MEANS LIKE THREE. IT WAS MORE THAN THAT 
 D: I sorry He had good games with the rockets.  I have a Knicks Lin T-shirt.   I now wear that shirt to bed and maybe when I have to paint.   Lets be honest, 90% of his fame was due to sports writers who were apparently dying to use the phrase "chink in the armor" and attempt to out casual racist each other. The NBA needed to sell jerseys in Asia after Yao Ming retired. Do you really think the hype was a coincidence? Jeremy Lin is a test case for the NBA and media to see if they can hype a terrible player. Has anyone ever been put on hold by the suicide hotline? I have, twice. Elevator music for half an hour. No one picked up, so I hanged up.

ETA: wow. I'm kinda embarrassed this is my top post. :\ Hung up the phone, right? I had a friend who told me about a time he tried to call, and was immediately put on hold. He's a fan of classical music, and they played part of one one of his favorite tunes on a loop. So, the story as he tells me, is that he decided to just hang up, because he needed to find the people who decided not to put the whole song on the hold music, and make them fix it. Oh man my psych 101 professor has a story about this. He was depressed after his wife left and he was contemplating suicide so he called a hotline. He was very drunk at the time. They said he had to be put on hold because of the other callers. He was put on hold and he just started laughing. He laughed at the morbid irony of the situation. He laughed and laughed and finally decided to hang up and go to bed. He lived to tell us about it so he got through it one way or another.  Why aren't we overrun by cemeteries? Old ones get forgotten. I've been to so many cemeteries where over half the grave markers are almost buried.  Reminds me of [this](http://i.imgur.com/GFmS6Zj.jpg).

EDIT: Okay apparently that text was photoshopped in, according to detective work by /u/Heisencock . I'll leave the picture anyway, because it's still cool. For most of human history most people werent buried like they are today 

And because cemetaries are eventually forgotten to become grazing land or be paved over and developed What is the cheapest way I can have my body taken care of when I die? Like, I'll be dead. I don't give a shit. If my family could take me out in a boat and just chuck me in the ocean for free that would be great. Donate it to science, free and a good cause. They are actually very picky about the bodies they choose. It is expensive for the institution to pay costs and they don't want to waste money on cadavers that don't give enough return.
Source: my father donated his body (thinking to cut funeral costs) but he died of cancer and they deemed it too emaciated/damaged to accept.

ETA: so many people have chimed in to say that that isn't the case where they are. That makes me feel bad because he really wanted it to happen and he chose the university that he did his Phd at, thinking he was contributing something of value. The funeral company that took away his body did warn us that they might not want it because of his emaciation so it was obviously a situation they had run up against previously. You can also choose to donate to a body farm for forensics, I studied archaeology and that seems like a pretty cool option. So, what?  Just wrap the body up in paper, put on a dozen stamps, and write "science" on it an wait for the mail truck to come? Take it to GoodWill and put it in the "science" pile.  Make sure to get a receipt if you want to claim it on your taxes.  What do hospitals do with amputated limbs?  I've wondered this since I was like 10 years old, but couldn't think of anyone who would know. incinerate them i believe Friend of mine worked for a crematorium.  They got shipments of frozen boxes from the university medical offices regularly.  One summer, they had a backlog and when they finally got to the boxes, one had melted a bit in the heat.  Picked up the box, cardboard gave out:  arms.  Lots of arms.   Ew. Think of it as someone waving back at you. From far away. A farewell to arms medical waste is disposed of by another company. they probably burn it.  I wanna ask astronauts how they deal with sexual urges. Not really so morbid, but I'm really curious how NASA deals with masturbation in space. Would be pretty cool to ejac into the vacuum of space.  

Like somehow shoot it straight out the window and watch it just sail away.  Hoping a couple million miles away it splashes onto some alien's windshield or something. And that, kids, is how life started on Earth. Don't ask don't tell, and don't gum up the instruments. How do conjoined twins masturbate and have sex?

I watched that TLC show and it provided no insight. &gt; Determined to live as normal a life they could, Chang and Eng settled on their small plantation and bought slaves to do the work they could not do themselves. Using their adopted name "Bunker", they married local women on April 13, 1843. Chang wed Adelaide Yates, while Eng married her sister, Sarah Anne. The twins also became naturalized American citizens.
&gt; 
&gt; The couples shared a bed built for four in their Traphill home. Chang and Adelaide would become the parents of eleven children. Eng and Sarah had ten. After a number of years, the wives began to dislike each other and separate households were set up west of Mount Airy, North Carolina in the town of White Plains. The brothers would alternately spend three days at each home. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang_and_Eng_Bunker#Life

Being a conjoined twin sounds hella complicated. Wow, they found two women to marry them, and the women started hating each other. Now that's just bad luck And they were sisters... "I don't like your brother, you need to get him removed!"
"But Honey, I'll die probably..."
"GET HIM REMOVED." "I'm right here, you know." Hey I actually had a chat with conjoined twins over omegle not too long ago they were really nice about all my questions including this!. What they told me was that hornyness is neurological so usually if one was horny the other could feel the physiological response but wouldn't be horny but masterbated and sometimes one would come without the other. They hadnt had actual intercourse yet and one expressed to me that she felt that they never would. And i assured them they were probably a fetish somewhere. But yeah most interesting omegle chat ever. For future reference, telling someone they're probably someone's fetish  isn't the best method of instilling confidence. Was this text only or video to prove they were real? It was video. it was actually really cool. One was asleep while we started talking and then the other woke up. What does a miscarriage feel like? Mine was extremely painful, like period pains x100. It felt like a very heavy period and I passed a huge clot. I had an infection in my Fallopian tube and had to have it removed after. But all in all very painful emotionally and physically. 

EDIT: Thank you for all the kind words of support. And to those asking if I ate it or telling me I am gross, grow the hell up. Miscarried on the 27th of last month. I started cramping. It got progressively worse until I almost couldn't take the pain anymore, blurry eyes, and excruciating pain. Then there was a pop, like a release. And all of a sudden my water broke. I was drenched in amniotic fluid, there was so much it was running down my legs and into my shoes. I ran to the bathroom and the bleeding had already begun. It isn't like a period. There were apple sized solid clots. It's like pooping blood and it continued to bleed until a few days ago. I hope no one ever has to go through this. I wish someone had told me what to expect though.  

Edit: Thank you so much for reaching out to me and being supportive. Seriously, thank you all so much.  Next time I hear about a woman having a miscarriage, I'll take a moment and remember what you described. Hopefully it will allow me to be even more compassionate than I would have otherwise. I know I was absolutely detached from the concept of miscarriage. I just took it a face value, an incomplete pregnancy. 

I didn't really think about any of the processes, or the *duration* of these processes. To me, how long a woman would have to endure that is the worst part. 

Not to mention, I guess it's also a complete change in plans. I thought I was rustled when my friends canceled their plans with me, but to cancel a child.. Heavy duty.  That's so recent...man, i'm sorry you lost your baby.  Thank you. I'm sure there's a life lesson somewhere in all this chaos I'm just still trying to figure out where.  I miscarried at 18 weeks, many years ago. I was astonished at how quickly people wanted me to move on, as if the baby never existed. I found a lot of help with a grief group at my local hospital. They encouraged me to recognize important dates (like when the baby's due date passed) and to talk as much as I wanted. It did help. I hope there is something like that available to you.  In early pregnancy, like a really heavy period. Emotionally it's devastating.  Miscarriages are essentially early labor. As such, a woman's symptoms will vary heavily, even when two women are at the same exact stage of pregnancy. The earlier the miscarriage happens, though, the less physical pain the miscarriage will be. Depends on how far into the pregnancy you are. If it's very early (first trimester) it's like deep, aching cramps. Sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. The bleeding starts off slow and gradually gets heavier and heavier, often with clots or clumps. The pain comes in waves of intensity, but you'll also feel a sort of "background ache" that can be very deep and intense. If you don't have a uterus to compare, it's rather like a very deep muscle injury that's then suffering a charlie horse. 

If you're later in the pregnancy (second trimester) it's virtually the same as a typical term labour, except generally not as long or quite as intense. Your cervix will still have to dilate, so you'll go into labour as you normally would and feel all the same pains, cramps and "shock" feelings of your cervix softening and thinning out - it just doesn't have to dilate all the way. Depending on where you are in the pregnancy, and the position of the baby, you may not feel a complete urge to push and instead you'll just feel a rather strange pressure and the fetus may actually just sort of expel (you'll still feel the sting of having your vulva stretch briefly, though - but it won't be like the "ring of fire" pain of a full term baby crowning).

Emotionally varies depending on the situation, of course, but you still have to keep in mind that even during the event of an unwanted pregnancy or unknown pregnancy... you're still dealing with massive amounts of hormones that are suddenly dropped. That has a significant impact on someone's emotional well being, regardless of their feelings for the lost baby/fetus. 
If you're later in the pregnancy you may also experience some breast swelling, tenderness and milk production following the miscarriage, but it generally goes away without too much issue. When a coffin is buried in a cemetery plot, the law (at least in my state) requires that it be placed within a sealed vault down in the grave. How long does the vault lid's seal last before water and the elements eventually begin penetrating the coffin? And why this required extra expense if it's all going to decay, in time, anyway? The vault isn't to protect from the elements, it's to stop the heavy construction machines from crushing the casket when they dig graves nearby and to stop the headstones from sinking. 

I'm a funeral director. I'm a grave digger.  Digging a hole and you find out a vault has either shifted or was set crooked is the worst.

But to answer his question.  A vault will last about 20 or 30 years.  Unless it's a vantage vault.

Edit:  It seems people have a lot of interest about what my job consists of.  If you all would like, I could do an AMA.  I'm sure a lot of people have interest in what all goes into a funeral service.

Edit #2:  It seems a lot of you all would like me to do an AMA.  I would be more that happy to.  I have never done one before.  What would you all need as proof that I do what I say I do?
I just won't be able to show what cemetary I work at and I can't answer who is buried there.

I may be able to do the AMA tomorrow if I'm not too busy. How long will it last if it's a vantage vault? It's kind of hard to say.  A vantage vault is plastic.  It's basically a huge Rubbermaid storage bin, maybe a little thicker.   I have heard stories of people probing the ground and poking through them not even knowing they did it.

My advice: If you are burying a loved one, DO NOT put them in a vantage vault. But they are dead anyways? That's why my instructions for my loved ones will be "do whatever the hell is cheapest". Then they can take the money saved on the funeral and have a kickass reception with an open bar and live DJ. My grandfather had an open bar at his funeral brunch.  Holy shit that was a shit show.  SO much tears.  That's why you also need the DJ. "HOW'S EVERYBODY DOIN TONIGHT?!?!" i'm a mortician in germany and here we rent out plots, since space is tight. usually between 10-25 years is mandatory but usually graveyard management offers open end. after the minimum time has passed the lot is getting cleared and will be rented again by another family.
that is because our deceased usually dont get embalmed, with a quick decomposition which wont harm nature in mind.
our caskets have to be wood by law and can easily withstand earths pressure for months or years if higher quality/thicker wood.
its not unusual to find bones or semi-intact bodies. usually they get boxed in a small remains-crate and get re-buried a bit deeper before the new occupant gets buried. there are a couple of different setups for graves but the most common ones are single row (2 coffins possible on top of each other) or family (2x2 on top of eachother) each deceased starting the 10-25 year 'timer' anew.

any questions? i'll gladly answer.

*EDIT***
i'm sorry if my wording cause confusion. clarification:
we do not DIG UP the bodies after the plot is being released. the whole idea is to have a self-clearing grave. the body decomposes in a certain time. this is estimated or tested by sending soil to the lab. if the soil is ideal it will take roughly 10 years for a body to decompose, only leaving bone fragments behind. those get reburied in case the grave is opened to place another body in this plot.

 keep in mind that one-sided graves fit two bodies. the first body usually gets buried at approximately 2 meter 40cm and the second coffin at about 1 meter 80 cm. on top of the first. you can easily place two bodies in a single sided grave. 4 people in a 2sided (family) grave. each body is on individual timers, so if you have person A) dead, and the  person B) placed on top 2 years later, the earliest you can access a cleared spot is when the 10 years of person B) have passed, resulting in 12 years since person A) has been placed. in this exact spot you can now place a coffin. and of course right on top, since that spot is now clear as well.

the only reasons we would remove a body from the grave is if there were: investigations or the grave would have  to be moved because of closing/relocation of the cemetery (suuuper rare) or if the soil is unable to decompose the body. then the plot is often closed for further burials or the body is removed and cremated, then placed in this or another grave. depends on the circumstances.
a typical graveyard and gardened plots: [Graves](http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/110499873.jpg) What about the headstones? Do they go too, or do you just add another line with "Here also lies..."? They go. The family can keep it if they want. My family has two headstones from some great-great-grandparents stashed in the shed. its definitely something I would say most Americans don't think about or realize. Some people know about this stuff, but typically it would really weird people out to think their dead relative will be moved in a couple decades. Here, the dead stay buried.

Unless a housing developer builds over an ancient Indian burial ground and/or dumps nuclear waste over graves, then we get poltergeists.  When there is a bloody car accident, do they clean all blood on the car or do they just take the car to pound including person bits inside? Father owned a towing company for years. Big chunks are picked out and bagged. Rest of the mess goes with the car in the rollback. When I was younger in the 5-8 range my dad would take me to these wrecks and leave me in the truck. Said if I wanted to get out I'd have to help the EMS folks pick up the remains. That kept me in the truck until we left.

Edit: He left me in the cab of the rollback, not the crashed vehicle. My old man was an ass most the time, but he wasn't a psychopath. First time I read this I thought he put you in the wrecked car and forced you to clean it up to get out... Jesus Career Medic here.  If there's a wreck with a dead body (or bodies) we'll extricate the bodies, and as many big pieces as possible if they're not intact, and bag them up.  

Pretty much as soon as that happens, as long as Law Enforcement has the pics they need for investigation, the vehicle hits the rollback of the rotation wrecker and goes to their lot. Confirming. Career FF/EMT. If it's an obvious fatal accident due to major trauma, we leave the person until police get their pictures and then we'll help bag up the body and as much of the parts as we can. Unfortunately, we don't get all of the brain matter all the time, nor can we always tell if an eye is missing. They've been known to be found in the back seat. 

If we think the person is viable, then we'll grab and go as fast as we can. Sometimes, parts get left behind then too. I work in a Total Loss Department for a major insurance company.  So maybe I can give some insight on what happens after they get to the impound.  We get quite a few in our salvage vendor that we have to decide what to do with.  Most of the time we just sell them on salvage auction and let the new owner deal with it.  Honestly accident's are not that bloody overall.  Worst we see are suicides where a gun is used.  On those rare occasions where the interior is completely destroyed we will order a car be crushed.  But that's maybe 1/1000 if even that.  Someone will always buy something at auction.   Where can I legally have a viking burial? How long would you live if you were decapitated and would you feel the injury or simply be in shock. I asked this question of a Doctor and she said that as soon as the brain loses blood pressure people will fall unconscious, then skoffed at the idea that a decapitated head could retain any awareness. 

Regardless, how do you test that? Step 1. Be either Imperial Japan or Nazi Germany.

Edit: I say those two simply because they had millions of "expendable" (in their eyes) people at their fingertips. French Revolution: I think someone did a thing where they asked the condemned to blink for as long as possible after the decapitation, I think they found it was like 5-10 seconds "alive" and slipping fast into, well, "dead".  Not sure about what it would feel but I bet it doesn't feel good Antione Lavassier.  He discovered hydrogen and oxygen.

http://www.strangehistory.net/2011/02/06/lavoisier-blinks/ Think about it this way:

It's possible that you would feel really light-headed, dizzy or even nauseous just from *standing up* too quickly after lying down, since the blood pressure in your brain is lower right after standing up, and your heart hasn't yet started to regulate. 

Now imagine how low your blood pressure is when your head is completely seperated from your body; pretty damn low. You have no heart to regulate the blood flow, and your blood is seeping out, so you *instantly* ~~feint~~ faint (thanks to /u/GrammarWehrmacht). You might not be dead for half a second or so, but you won't get to contemplate your life decisions, that's for damn sure. Why does this actually make me feel better? This isn't even a thing likely to happen. Because the thought of being conscious after a decapitation is pretty awful. What is it like to kill somebody? I asked a friend once. All he said was "you will always wonder if you really had to." If it is done out of necessity (i.e. a warzone) it doesn't bother you until much, much later when you have time to think about it.  In the moment it is surprisingly easy. I once had a private ask me this about 3 weeks before I ETSed from the Army. This is the gist of the conversation:

 "Do you know why murder is considered a crime by virtually every civilization ever?" 
"No, why?"
"Because, it's easy, and after you do it a few times you start to forget why it's was even hard in the first place. If you do it enough times it become a reflex like blinking or breathing."

It's a little over dramatic, but still fairly accurate. The part I left out when talking to him was that taking a life may be easy, but living with your actions sometimes aren't . I don't dwell on that stuff to much, but every once in a while something will catch me off guard.

Recently, my brother had a child, and as I held her for the first time I was overcome by a profound sense of sadness. As I looked at my niece I thought about the families out there that are incomplete, because of things I did. There might be a child who will never know the embrace of their father's arms or a father who will never again know the embrace of child( grown child not an actual kid), because I pulled the trigger. No matter how you look at it even the most vile and vicious people are bound to have someone who loves them. Hell, even Hitler had a woman who wanted to marry him. 

I don't regret the things I've done, but that doesn't mean I like them. 

Edit: spelling.
 Are there skin matching services?

If a person who lost a ton of weight can have extra skin removed, and burn victims need tons of grafts, would it be viable to match these people up? No, because they would have to be on immune suppressants to keep their body from rejecting the donor skin, which comes with a lot of health risks. That's why people who receive organs have such strict regimens of pills and doctor's appointments, and people get rejected from the wait list if they are at a high risk for non-compliance. There is so much work that goes into being a receiver of a donated organ, that it's really only worth it if the only other option is death. What does it feel like to intentionally stab someone? Or kill anyone in general? There's an awful video of two teenagers talking about the girl they just stabbed and it's really hard to watch. Guy's basically laughing as he says, "Holy shit! I witnessed her lifeless body just fall to the ground!" I'll link if I find it.

Edit: [this](http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/80018044) is the documentary in which I heard this. Thanks to u/mickeymouse4348 for finding it. i think ive seen that. im pretty sure it was a documentary on netflix about minors getting life sentences in prison

edit: is [this] (http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/80018044) what you were thinking of? the first 15 minutes or so talk about the kids Yes I think so! Good find. Some disturbing stuff in that. From Peter Jackson's commentary on the extended edition of Two Towers:

When I was shooting the stabbing shot with Christopher, as a director would I was explaining to him what he should do"... "And he says, 'Peter, have you ever heard the sound a man makes when hes stabbed in the back?' And I said, 'Um, no.' And he says 'Well, I have, and I know what to do.' "

Apparently the original script called for him to scream in pain, and Lee explained how that just wasn't accurate.

 I'm pretty sure Christopher Lee was in WW2, so that's probably what he's talking about. He was a part of the [SAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service) in WWII participating in their [Long Range Desert Group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Range_Desert_Group) And did stuff he won't talk about...ever. An interviewer asking Christopher Lee about his SAS days.

Christopher: [Leaning forward] Can you keep a secret?

Interviewer: [Excited] Yes!

Christopher: [Leans back in his chair] So can I. Ok so now I'm like 70% certain that Christopher Lee is the actual Highlander.  How many murderers have I made eye contact with? I work at a hotel close to the interstate and lots of swamps and marshland and I have thought about this a lot. "He worked in an old motel off the interstate down by the swamp"

Yep you match the description of a murderer.  Are there less disabled people in Germany due to the Final Solution? [I answered this!  Yay!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1mdr6r/as_absolutely_atrocious_as_the_holocaust_was_did/)

TL;DR: No.  The Nazis tended not to target heritable genetic conditions because they didn't really know what they were doing. After a little googling, 11.7% of the German population is disabled, while the global average is 19.4%. Very, very interesting, but no way to verify if it is due to the Final Solution. you'd probably want to only compare Germany's average to other wealthy countries to get a idea  Would wealthy countries have more or less disabled people? On one hand, the health care is better in wealthier countries, so there'd be less. On the other, poorer countries have less of an ability to maintain the health of the disabled, meaning there'd be less disabled people as well. I think they just wander the streets in poor countries. Humans are resilient, disabled or not. They do that in America, too. A respectable portion of the homeless population of America is disabled either mentally or physically. Wait wait wait... 1 in 5 people are disabled? Probably counts certain mental illnesses, as well as 'invisible' disabilities. 

I'm physically disabled, not that you can tell from looking at me. After a funeral, when the person is in the coffin and lowered into the ground, what does their body look like in 2 weeks? 6 months? A year? How long until they're just a skeleton with some clothes on them. 

I've anyone has any pictures or information, I'd love to see it. I'm talking bodies buried in coffins, not left out in the open or anything.  It depends where they're buried. If there's a lot of clay in the soil they don't really decompose too much - at least that's what an undertaker told me. Well my client, BRRRROCK LESSSNER would disagree https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetwood_Lindley

That's a guy who was the last person to see Abraham Lincoln's face, when they reburied him in 1901. Sounds like he looked almost the same except for a chalky-white face.

Reading about this some time ago led to try and find youtube videos of people exhuming bodies, which you can certainly find. 

Here's one of a family exhuming a family member after 15 years (NSFW, I guess, although the body isn't TOO bad looking): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dHpuwkDXMI Damn that's incredible. I figured after a few years they'd be a skeleton.  How would a child develop in near complete isolation? Say in one of those white-walled rooms. 

* Would they learn to walk? 
* How would they spend time? 

Now suppose you have two such children raised together in isolation

* What sort of dynamic would develop? 
* Would some sound-based communication eventually develop? 
* How would they handle being separated? 
* Would they eventually figure out sex? http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_%28feral_child%29

I know it's not exactly what you meant, but this might give you an idea of what happens when someone is raised in isolation  There was a sort of medieval experiment where they did roughly the same thing to figure out the language of god. The babies... didn't turn out well. Are astronauts trained to kill their colleagues in case they start going insane or have intent to harm others/the space station?

Answer: They restrain them with duct tape. I believe the actual protocol is to restrain them with duct tape, but I'm on mobile and don't feel like finding a source.

Edit: Finally home to give a [Source] (http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-has-plan-if-astronauts-lose-it/) They're trained to tie the person up with a roll of duct tape tape them up and send em for a spin in zero-g This sounds like some sort of astronaut hazing ritual. But wouldn't their colleague be using the exact same training to try and kill them? This should be a movie

Edit: Interstellar doesn't count I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't let you do that. They are taught to restrain them. The ISS has sedative injections and restraints (I believe they actually use duct tape for this) on board in case this happens.

It's easy enough to recognize the signs of "going crazy" before the person actually becomes seriously violent though. Killing would be the very, very last option. Do you really shit yourself when you die?

Edit: OK I know now, stop sending me all of these sad ass-stories It's a toss-up of how much fecal matter they had in their bowels.  It also depends on how much their body is manipulated; for example, if I'm working a code involving chest compressions and positive-pressure ventilations, there's a good chance there will be feces before it's all over.

Source:  Medic. So you're saying that when I'm on death row that I should pig the fuck out for my last meal, so they have to clean up a bunch of shit...kind of like one last "fuck you". When? What exactly do you have planned?  No, your muscles just relax. If there's fecal matter in there, it sometimes comes out. If the deceased went to the bathroom before they died, there won't be anything to come out.

I sure as hell hope it is MY poop.


 Selfish... So, I'll make sure to go to the bathroom before I die. Don't want to embarrass myself when everyone's attention is on me.

I wouldn't be caught dead with shit in my pants. Yes.. Its not like you actually take a crap though.. You just kinda like.. Release it Here's my question - does it all come out as a couple loosely formed turds or would look like lava slowly flowing out a volcano? It would look exactly like it would if you were still alive. It's not like the poop changes shape just because you died ~5 minutes ago. 

What the fuck am I doing with my life.  You're helping learn about poop after death, that's what you're doing! 

And I was just thinking like hours later, with the bodies digestive system shutting down, if the gasses released by decomposition would continue to push out poop that wasn't completely formed or digested.   Your presumptions totally correct, especially in a pt who has been sick for several days, the is nothing so disgusting as the pungent smell of shit from a dead, or soon to be dead person... Its this liquid dark green lava flow that I have seen fill a bed and run down to the floor. I'm seen some shit, literally. what if a pregnant woman laid on her stomach? Seesaw. Depends on how far along. 1st trimester, no problem. 2nd trimester gets a little uncomfortable, by 3rd, just adds a ton of pressure to your already squished organs.  Wait, so it's not even a threat for the baby, but the mom?
 The baby is suspended in amniotic fluid, so as long as there's no severe compression, I could see the fetus being totally fine

EDIT: GUYS, I don't look a fetuses. Jesus. Contrary to popular belief, not all women's stomachs get hard during pregnancy. My belly was pretty soft the whole time. If my son was in an uncomfortable position, I could lay on my belly and get him to move. There is plenty of liquid and cushion in there and it doesn't hurt the baby at all. My son is almost 4 and he's perfectly healthy. The fact that women's stomachs aren't rock-hard during pregnancy threw 14 year old me for a fucking loop. I'm the youngest in my family so had never been around kids/pregnant women until my teacher got pregnant. She let us all feel her belly and it freaked me out when it squished.

I always pictured pregnant bellies as being super solid, like touching a flexed muscle or something. Soft pregnant bellies just don't seem right. Reading through these made me think: This should have it's own reddit, so I took 30 seconds and made it and am posting it here right now with the unlikely hope that people see it and it catches on: /r/morbidquestions How often do you (non depressed) redditors think about suicide and how serious are these thoughts? I think about it when I'm having days where I feel like my life is pointless. Never in a case of depression or desparation but when I feel like nothing is going right or I'm just bored and frustrated with everything. They're not serious thoughts and I'd never actually do it but sometimes when I've had a bad day I'll go to sleep and pray that I won't wake up again. It's hard to explain because I never genuinely feel depressed, just frustrated and hopeless. I'd say I get those thoughts every few months, sometimes more frequently. If I see a cliff or something I think about jumping off, but never seriously, more of a what-if scenario.  "Could I survive?  How many bones would I break?" kind of thing /r/intrusivethoughts some dude was doing a speech at my uni the other day and I actually wondered what would happen if I just got up and slapped him in the face as hard as I could, I thought I was insane until now. When you see an ambulance going down the road with the lights inside on but no siren, is the person inside dead?  Usually when I see this the person on the gurney has their eyes closed/the paramedics aren't visible or aren't attending to the patient.  Thanks.

Edit - Thanks for the responses!  I feel so much better knowing I'm not seeing dead people in the back of amublances now :)  Paramedic here: Simple answer: No. Long answer is ambulances often transport very sick people that can't be transported any other way. It's not an emergency so no need for lights and sirens.  I've also seen ambulances transport sick/elderly people to the airport to get on a medical flight. We're in Arizona and its usually elderly Canadians who are here getting flown back to Canada because they had something happen to them while here. Not necessarily. Ambulances sometimes attend to situations which aren't as much of as emergency as you might think, and they're just taking whoever's inside to the hospital for whatever. Source: that was me once as a kid. Only maybe one in 50 calls warrent going lights and sirens to the hospital. Really, only things requiring rapid surgical intervention make the danger of driving in emergency mode worthwhile. At least half of the calls an ambulance responds to are straight bullshit. Source: 10+ years as a fire/medic. If a person dies a gruesome death, like shot in the head or something, and the family decides to bury them in a casket but it's closed, how is the body prepared? Are they dressed nice but just laying in there with a gaping head? Is it a bloody mess in the casket?  A friend if mine in high school shot him self in the head. The mortician rebuilt the back of his head,  I assume with modeling clay. The makeup matched his skin color well, bit the head shape was a tiny bit off so it was really creepy looking. If I jump on your chest, full force, would you cave in and splatter everywhere? Jumping on someone's chest can lead to an injury called [traumatic asphyxiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_asphyxia).  This happens in head-on car accidents where the driver doesn't wear their seat belt.  Their forward momentum launches them chest-first into the steering wheel.  The sudden impact squeezes their internal organs.  All the blood in their heart is forced out, making it hard to refill with blood to continue its pumping cycle.  The victim's jugular veins will become distended, their face will turn purple, and they will have a weak/nonexistent pulse.  

[Comotio Cordis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commotio_cordis) is another potential injury from this kind of trauma.  This is when a sudden, well-timed impact to the chest causes the heart to stop.  Most people have heard about a kid who was hit in the chest by a baseball, causing him to die on the spot.  This kind of injury is part of the impetus behind the movement to have automatic defibrillators at sporting events.

Jumping on someone's chest could kill them, but some people survive this kind of trauma because they were braced.  I've seen a video of a powerlifter bench pressing 545 pounds when the [bar slipped out of his hands and fell onto his chest](http://i.imgur.com/YgCAAx8.jpg).  He survived with only a few cracked ribs.  His core and diaphragm were braced because of how much he was lifting, allowing his body to survive.   I think it depends on how much you/something weights but most likely you'll just kill someone because of internal bleeding/damaging organs. When a transgender man undergoes a sex change, do they get to choose the size of their penis?  Or is it just based on how much skin they have? Would an animal predator choose to eat:

A: a baby

B: a grownup man

C: a pregnant woman

D: an elderly person

Or would it just be random ?



Edit: rip inbox i guess Probably in order of A, D, C, B - the weakest are the most attractive targets for a predatory animal, because they don't really fight back. Risk is much less than reward. Depends on the animal.  I'm pretty sure a dingo would go for a baby first though. Would a baby human be as tender/tasty as a baby cow?  They say human meat tastes like pork, so probably more like a piglet I'm guessing. *THAT which you have just eaten, which your taste buds have savored, which your teeth have just torn apart, THAT is human meat!* Is it racist if I don't eat the black guy? Well shit Charlie,  now it is You eaten piglet? Oh bother... This is probably oddly specific, but I have stage 4b cervical cancer with lung mets. I don't know anyone else in my situation to ask, but what will it be like when I die?  I've heard it's a relatively painful death. Any chance of going peacefully in my sleep, or will it be awful? This isn't some thing oncologists really like to talk about. 


Edit:  I appreciate everyone's responses more than you know.  I'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis and I sincerely hope someone who knows will answer you BUT, in my experience, the best person to ask about this or any unpleasant part of medical care, is a nurse. A nurse will tell you exactly how it is, because they are there for all of it. Great idea. I'm friends with several of the nurses who would give it to me straight. I always feel bad though, like it'll make them sad. I suppose I shouldn't worry about that.  Hey, I'm a nurse. I'm sorry you are going through this.  I'll answer as best I can but as other people have said ask your doctor and do not let them worm their way out of it. Also death is not the same for everyone and what exactly you die from impacts how much pain you have. As you know its not the cancer itself that kills you but how it impacts your other organs (for you most likely your lungs).

Regarding pain: cancer can be extremely painful but make sure you advocate and get good pain medication and you can also get things to help that with anxiety. Maybe you won't have a lot of pain but if you don't be shy about asking for heavy duty pain meds. Of narcotics aren't enough there are other things that can help.

There is the possibility of dying suddenly in your sleep and I obviously don't know what that feels like. Otherwise Generally as you are dying you will become weaker and unable to get out of bed. Some people become confused or delirious. People tend to lose their appetite and stop drinking. 
Most people lose consciousness when they start getting pretty close (but maybe you will be able to hear). As you get closer your heart rate will probably speed up and then begin to slow down (dropping blood pressure). Breathing starts to get irregular (called Cheyenne stokes respirations) where you will irregular breathing with pauses. A lot of people have secretions in their lungs that they can't clear properly. This can cause a gurgling known as a death rattle which can be petty disturbing for families to hear. There are meds we can give to help dry up secretions. At some point your heart will stop beating or you may stop breathing first and then your heart will stop a bit afterwards.  I'll try to find you some good web resources 

Here are some issues and what can be done 
- anxiety: there are meds to help with. Support from loved ones. Talk with your nurse, we want to help. If you are spiritual or religious this can be a source of comfort. Music and a comfortable environment help 
- pain: talk to your doctors. If you have a lot see if there are pain specialists.
- shortness of breath: this can be scary. Morphine can help with this, as can anti anxiety meds. A fan blowing air across your face can help. 
- death rattle: I'm told that this is more alarming for the family than the patient as they are usually not awake at this point. There are meds that help with this.

Another thing: make sure your family knows your wishes in regards to what kind of care you want. Do you want iv fluid if you stop drinking? Do you want oxygen? Eye donation? If you are very sick and have an infection do you want it treated (cancer patients may develop infections when they become quite sick). Hospice or palliative care at home? Does your family know if you want cpr or not? 

Here are online resources:

http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/supportivecare/lasthours/healthprofessional/page2 
(This is more geared at care givers but has good info)

I did a palliative care course awhile ago and can probably find some more resources for you if you are interested.

Edit:
http://www.virtualhospice.ca/en_US/Main+Site+Navigation/Home/Topics/Topics/Final+Days/When+Death+Is+Near.aspx I always wanted to know if I could get away with murder.

Not because I want to murder someone, I want to know if I'm smart enough to outwit the police/cover my tracks well enough that I'd get away with it.

Perhaps it's because I've seen a bunch of crime dramas that pull something out of their ass as a way to gather evidence and move the plot forward. Here is the truth.  If you have a reason to kill someone, there is a good chance that some basic detective work will identify you as a suspect, and probably the most likely suspect.  Human behavior operates in wide circular patterns, and detectives are basically people who are good at detecting patterns.   Whatever cause you have to kill someone is almost certainly enough to be noticed by someone else or something else, and that will lead police to you.

If you kill a person who you have no reason to kill, then you have a better than average chance, even with no forensic or other special measures, of getting away with it.  

So basically, the more sociopathic you are, the better your chances.  

As a happily married person (really!), one of my most dark fears is that something does happen to my wife, by a person who has no reason to harm her, (i.e. randomly), and I become the prime suspect.  The thought is terrifying because the odds of the murderer being the husband are so great that any detective who doesn't start there isn't doing a good job. When my Dad died at my house, the coroner had his body out of the building in about three hours. However there was a smell that lingered in the room for almost a year. Hard to describe, but quite chemically. 

Nobody else ever mentioned it, and I never brought it up as it was the kind of thing that would have made my wife want to sell up. 

Anyway - is this actually a thing or was it some psychological stuff going on with me. Does a corpse really give off odour so quickly that lingers for so long? (We changed the bed he died on within a week but the smell stayed)  Dead people do give off an odor within a couple hours, it's hard to explain it unless you have smelled it, it just smells like "death". Most likely attributed to skin cells breaking down. I had a patient pass away in the bathtub years ago at a nursing home I then worked at. It was my first month as a nursing assistant. We had to push him on the bath chair back to his room and use a mechanical lift to get him back to his bed. 

After a short prayer service with family, the mortician came to take him and probably 3 hours had passed. Having absolutely no experience touching dead people at that point I was nervous and the mild but heavy smell of his cold body hung in the air and was nauseating to me. I touched his skin in the transferring process and that odor seemed to hang onto my hands all day. 

So partially, yes it is probably psychological, but there is certainly an unforgettable smell and the association you have to it. Now after 6 years in the medical field I don't think twice about it. We used to wash up passed away patients with a bed bath before family arrived to say goodbye. That was always uncomfortable to younger or newer healthcare workers.  I'm a nurse and I feel like I can smell when my patient's switch from "mostly alive" to "actively dying".  Not very enlightening, but anyone who's smelled that knows what I mean. There is just a different smell in the room. I had a similar experience, except I smelled it when my dad was still alive. He had just entered in-home hospice care and I drove to his house to see him. Well he was given 5 weeks, but as soon as I stepped inside, I knew he would die that night. My mom had actually went to school to be a nurse to care for my dad in his final years (he had a kidney disease and did not qualify for a transplant) So when she came in the room I asked her if she could smell/feel it too. She said she could but there was nothing medically that showed that he might die soon. In other words, there was really no change from that night and all the nights before it. Nothing off with his body, everything seemed fine. Except the smell. So hard to describe. It was like an entity. You could feel it as well as smell it. It was like as soon as I stepped in the house, I was forcing my way through an invisible barrier and there was a physical weight added to my body. That lasted the entire time I was there. My dad died less than 7 hours later. 

I am not sure if something like a "death smell" has been 100% proven, but I would like to know how I could feel and smell what I could only describe as "death" while someone was still alive? how often in fatal accidents is someone actually killed instantly, and how often is that just what they tell the families to make them feel better? How would you hide a body? Mince it, freeze in blocks in old plastic containers that mince comes in from the supermarket. Throw one out every week with the ordinary rubbish so as not to raise suspicion. 

TIL: Sometimes I scare myself. How would you mince it though with all the bone that is in a body?

If you don't mince the bones as well, what would you do with them?

**EDIT:** Also wouldn't it be better to just eat the meat? You could probably grind the bones to dust somehow (this persumes that you would be killing someone healthy).

**EDIT 2:** I have no real personal interest in this, I don't eat people or even kill them a little bit. However I do enjoy writing stories, mostly dark comedies so knowing about stuff like this is useful for that. Bake the bones in the oven to make them brittle, then crush them.  Or dissolve them in bleach. Good to know... what the fuck am I saying? Do step daughters and step brothers have sexual fantasies about someone in the family that isn't blood?


Edit: I don't only mean between siblings. I mean fantasies or relationships with their step father's or step mother's as well

Answer: it's complicated .. Lol ehhmmm. yes. *Go on.* When I was 13 my parents adopted one of my sisters hot friends because some very not ok things were going on In her house. She was skinny tall blonde with big ol boobies. Needless to say this was a very different kind of weird. I had to refer to this girl as my sister which made it way worse. And on my mothers life!!! She always asked me to massage her back and at 13, boners are nothing less than obvious. 

TLDR: I like broken girls I met all my step sisters at a young age. If you grow up with them, then definitely not. They come to be like regular siblings. I've had a step-sister for 14 years now. More often than not I get the question "Dude, would you fuck your sister??"

When I reply no, it's "But dude, she's not blood."

Still no, we've formed a brother/sister bond. Would you fuck your real sister?

Edit: Holy shit. I compare step-sister and "real" sister because I've accepted her as my real sister. We've been pretty much best friends since our parents got married, and that was when I was 8 years old. I bet not as near as much as porn would have you believe. I would say it's heavily dependent on when they became step siblings. Is it possible for someone with clawed gloves to reach into a man's chest and pull out the heart in one piece like in Indiana Jones?'

Edit: Holy shit this blew up! Doubtful. The rib cage does a very good job of protecting your inner organs. Even if you were wearing clawed/sharpened gloves, you'd have to break through the bone - which would take a LOT of force. You mean that scene in Dumb and Dumber wasn't realistic? Damn. Do female undertakers ever look at a mans genitals and think "Holy shit" Dat rigor mortis *Die Hard* (   )

Holy shit gold what do I do with this

Thank you! I'm a gay funeral director if that helps. For me, the answer is no. They're no longer a sexual being and there is a grieving family that loves this person and has trusted me with caring for him. Your question is perfectly valid, and there might be a female funeral director who is constantly checking out genitals for all I know. 
Edit: I'm glad we've all seen Six Feet Under. What's it like being near a bomb exploding? It is loud, your ears ring and you don't know what just happened.  You look around and see a cloud of smoke, people laying on the ground - you can tell people are screaming but you can't hear about what (if you were close enough).

You try to make sense of what you're seeing but it doesn't quite register, you decide the best thing to do is start running but what happens if another one goes off? It did.  Farther away but now you are scared to move.

It isn't a happy experience, it sucks.

source: was at the boston marathon bombing. How are you dealing with it? Better now!  Actually headed to the marathon now. Wow. Way to get back on that horse. Have fun!  It was an awesome day, despite the cold and rain.   It is one of my favorite days of the year and **no one** will ever be able to take that from me! Yep this is exactly what my now girlfriend described. She passed the finish line 11 minutes before the first bomb went off.  Username checks out Username checks out Have you ever been punched or hit in the face when you weren't expecting it?  Like hit with a basketball or something.

I'd describe it as that, but your entire body is affected.  You don't really realize what happened, and time kind of slows down.  Sound goes out for a few seconds, and you're kind of trapped in a daze.

Source:  veteran, multiple IEDs have gone off around me. It's fucking loud. Your ears ring and you hurt everywhere. The body is amazingly resilient though and you don't feel it straight away. Sometimes you don't even notice excessive damage, like parts of a rifle butt sticking out of your leg. You get up to walk away and some guy grabs you and pulls you to cover while you wait for a medic. 

Source: I think it's clear.  I get that you farted but where did the rifle and medic come from? farted? wut? Reread his post as if it was a fart he was talking about. loud Depends but mostly dazing,, a swift hard knock on ones ass It depends how close you are and what type of bomb.

Generally it's very loud, then depending how close there will be a ringing in your ears. Your natural reaction is to look for the cause of the loud noise, and again depending on the explosion, you will see a lot of smoke and people either on the ground or fallen over. 

Then you will hear screaming, both male and female, but you will always hear a high pitch female scream, and a male yell. 

The next thing depends on what type of person you are/type of training you have received, so you will either start running as fast as you can towards the people or away from the explosion.

Regardless of what you have trained for/previous knowledge you will have a huge adrenaline spike. It's only once that wears off do you realise how fucked up the situation is. 

I would advise against experiencing one close up. How near? Those Conjoined Twins Abby and Brittany. I have a lot of questions about them. One would have to be if they have sex do they both feel an Orgasm.
 They share a vagina, but have two hearts, two sets of lungs, two spinal columns, they have 3 kidneys, each controls an arm. 

The better question would be who becomes the mother? Would hormones likely cause each to feel as though they are the 'true' mother against the other?  I was going to say "whoever's DNA matches with the eggs", then I realized it was stupid. But theeen I realized there is something called epigenetics. One could perhaps use that to see if the eggs "belong" to one or the other.  The one whose husband fathered the child. The one who chooses to become pregnant presumably. Right, but in sharing the vagina they will probably be subject to similar hormone stimulus. Chemical reactions in the body at the molecular level just happen. If both of their nervous pathways receive similar messages preparing them for motherhood, I question whether the hormonal impulses which also govern psychological behavior, can cause each to interpret the other as a false parent. Also if one says yes and the other says no, is it rape or consensual? Why not both? Brains give consent, not vaginas. Weirdest context for a "Por que no los dos?" I've ever seen.
Edit: terrible spelling Los*.. I've met them, very nice people but it definitely did make me wonder a lot of things.  So do they share a BF, and would it be a 3-way? Maybe a 2.5-way? How would that turn out ? It's not gay if it's a 2.5-way With part of a honey in the middle there's some leway  Half-*okay.* Brittany is engaged. We'll see how Abby feels on the weeding night. --on the weeding night.

So, it's tonight then? Since they seemingly only have one vagina, I would imagine that both would feel pleasure. What I want to know is what if two people are connected by the shoulders or something and they have two vaginas. Would the left person feel stuff happening to the right person's body? Do they kiss and touch each other during masturbation, if so is it still masturbation or sex?  &gt;  if so is it still masturbation or sex?

pretty much 50/50 at that point. Orgasm's a lot more common during masturbation than sex, and I'm sure they've masturbated.

I wonder how frustrating it would be if one was among the 5% or so of women who can't come and the other masturbated to orgasm frequently. Parents: how many of you wish you/your wife had actually had an abortion instead of having kids? 

Edit: obligatory thanks for the gold! My mom once told me that she wishes my brother, who has pretty profound Aspergers, had been stillborn. Kinda fucked me up for a while hearing that but I can see where she's coming from. He's 24 and still utterly dependent on my parents, jobless, and rapidly becoming more and more obese, so there will be health problems in the future to deal with. She just wishes parenting could have been easier for her and my dad, and that my brother didn't have the unhappy life he has now. Being that 24 yr old burden on my parents I totally agree with you, except I have a spinal cord injury and not Aspergers. 

Been 7 years now and I want to scream after I look at the lives of my parents now. They are trying their best to be there for me, but on a couple of bad days (and we have our unfair share of them) I've overheard my dad saying to mom that "it would have been a lot better if I died in that accident, it would have been easier to cope with". It's usually on the bad days that we break out from our masks and say what's deep inside our hearts, and my dad said it. Twice that I know of, maybe more when I wasn't around.

And I totally agree with him. If only they're wasn't so much social stigma around suicide, so many lives would have gotten rid of this suffering.

**Edit:** Thanks for all the replies, concerns, questions and the gold, stranger. I don't know what to say. Just be careful with your neck, its more delicate than you think. I'm really sorry...all I can put into words. I hope the situation gets better. Thanks, I guess. I only see it getting worse though, as my parents age and as my bother's marriage approaches us. They'll have a hard time deciding whether or not to take me to the wedding hall, because unlike west disability is still frowned upon in my part of the world. 100s of relatives with 200 questions. 

On one hand it's my only brother and he'd want me there but on the other hand they don't deserve the embarrassment.

Oh well there are other bigger issues in life, don't know why I'm bothering with this one &gt;they don't deserve the embarrassment.

What's embarrassing about an injury? It's not like you or your parents did anything wrong. if only people had that kind of rationality. It all boils down to my parents' "carelessness", because they sent me to a different city for higher education and I got injured over there. 

You get to hear things like:

&gt;Should have never sent him away. Should have kept him close. etc etc Is their social image really that important? Is this India/Pakistan? Is there a possibility that your injury could get better? Like with physical therapy or something?  physiotherapy in these cases is not a cure, it's a medium through which we can best utilize our physical abilities to maximize our potential and live an independent life. However, for quadriplegic it is kind of rare, because unlike paraplegic we don't have control over our upper limbs, so basic functions like shifting from bed to wheelchair, sanitation, etc become extremely difficult to accomplish alone. I was in rehab for six months, and got as far as I could. Now, I don't focus on that aspect of live. I have an IT job which kinda keeps me occupied (same reason parents agreed to me doing a job, else money was not a concern). I'm 2000kms away from home and dad travels to and fro every month to visit me. Takes him 40hrs one way.  Sorry to hear that. How do you manage to type for your job etc?  I type with my thumbs in both hands, they don't move individually so I move the whole hand. I can also play GTA, mostly drive around and mow people, shooting is tough with a touchpad so I stay away from fire fights . Also GTA V FTW Hey bro, hope to see you out there in Los Santos, your username the same? Hey, for what it's worth you explained that really well.  Hey man. Thanks for sharing, and thank your parents for being there with you. You've got wonderful parents and know that their grief is only in terms of the moment. Hey, just know that you may not feel the love all the time that you are always loved by someone some where. Keep rocking out, man!  :/ well at least you're able to do some work and live on your own, even though your dad visits you every month.  Dad visits, but mom stays with me. They're living thousands of miles apart because of me :/ Oh. This might sound like a dumb question but why doesn't your dad live with the two of you? I'm guessing because he works but if that's the case, I feel like there's *something* to make the situation better. They need Mech suits for disabled people it's actually a thing already being used for therapy. Couple that with the progress being made with stem cells, we'll get there. I like that attitude. I'm gonna remember this whenever I see situations like the ones mentioned above. I am a 31-year-old burden on my dad, and it is a terrible feeling. Without my expenses, he could 1.) retire, 2.) divorce the woman he's unhappily married to, 3.) get a lower-paying job with much less stress. Ever since I was approved for disability and it truly hit him that I am too sick to work and not getting better, it's like he's been handed a life sentence. And he has. I honestly wonder when the stress is gonna kill him. So your parents hate each other, that's even worse. 

&gt; Life sentence

Exactly, couldn't have found a better word for it.

If I may ask, what happened to you? I'm crazy. =/ But not all of the time! Which I think gives him all the false hope.

Edit: Very unexpected gold--thank you, gilder. I saw you post about BPD. I have it too and this is one of my big fears. It is really, really, really, hard for people to understand what it is like to live with BPD. I'm currently physically disabled as well. I just hope if I am able to stand and walk again that my mental illness won't hold me back.  Please explain? Words, more words please. Interested in your story. May I ask, do you want to die on your own terms, or would you prefer to continue living? Look I hope I don't sound dark, I'm really sorry that this has happened to you and your parents. Obviously the former, and I've tried looking for an easy way out, but certain drugs and chemicals are either not that easily accessible or will be impossible for me to handle given that I have limited control of my hands and none over fingers.

but who cares what I want. I confessed about these thoughts to my parents, said we'll all be better off this way. Same old drama ensued "how can you think like this. how can you hurt us".

so I stopped talking about it altogether Well I mean, even though life *would* be easier, your parents would still be crushed by the loss of you. They still love you and really, it's easier to accept the idea of a death that can't be controlled (like if you had died in your accident) rather than the thought of you offing yourself. The concept of that is much more painful, even if it *is* true.  Hi 200bhp.

I'm so sorry for your injury.  I just wanted to let you know that I'm glad you're alive.  Thank you for sharing your story.

I know you feel like a burden, but the truth is everyone feels like a burden to the ones they love some times.  You are not alone, and you are helping others in a similar situation by sharing your words.

I wish you the very best for the future.  Keep writing, keep sharing.

I'll share one piece of advice that has helped me.  "Say thank-you".  I know times are dark, and I know there is probably not a lot to be thankful about.  But, if you can find just one person or thing to be thankful for, make sure you start each day by saying thanks.  You'll be amazed at how such a small gesture can make a profound impact on your own mindset.

Good luck my friend.  And again, thank you for sharing your words. It strikes me as cruel to make someone exist like this when it is making them suffer so much. I don't want anyone to die, I don't want you to die, but to me everyone should ultimately have control over their own fate. If I was your family I think I'd help you find peace and die with dignity. I wouldn't want to do it, but what I want is irrelevant to what my family member needed, like give them Helium or something. I understand the feeling. Personally I am a firm believer in each person having the right to life/death. Currently any "suicide" method has high rates of failure, resulting in further disabilities, or is extremely painful, or messy. I think one should have access to safe, pain free, reliable, clean methods where they can say their goodbyes and be surrounded by loved ones when they die. Some places in the world do offer these options though, such as the Netherlands.

I do wish you the best though, I can't imagine how difficult life is for you. given you have some independent finance, have you considered talking to Dignitas?

I truly think spinal cord injuries are something we will see progress on, but a lack of agency due to injury may not be a barrier.

I wish the best for you. I believe in the the super power of stem cells.  There are a lot of clinical trials involving SCI.  You may want to look into them, if you haven't already.  https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01772810?term=NCT01772810&amp;rank=1 there are no sure shot promises just yet. It's still in a trial phase. Docs in my country aren't advising stem cell transplant and few others like me who wasted millions to get it done from foreign countries are still in the same place so there's that  I'm sorry to hear that you went through that. It's a shame even in the medical profession people are often selling dreams to keep the science going. It's highly unethical, and not remotely approaching informed consent. The science just isn't there (or anywhere) yet, it was irresponsible to give you that hope at such a high financial cost. At first I read it as you, that he spent millions. Reading it again with the other comments, I think he meant that other people in his situation spent millions. Wow I'm so sorry.  Ouch. I get that though.  My brother's in a similar position and I have Aspergers too, although I'm regarded as higher functioning. I'd never wish my brother away, but I do wish that our lives were unencumbered by this, which gave us a fucked up childhood, family life and adulthood. When I've expressed my discontent to my mother, she's just shut me down with things like "I love Joe just the way he is and I wouldn't want him any other way". I think that's horseshit she tells herself so that she can sleep better at night. What about what *he* wants? What *I* want? I'm pretty sure he wanted a life partner, a fulfilling job and independence - he's not stupid. I'd sacrifice a lot of things for a life more normal. She's accepting things the way they are, and that makes sense. Why wish for an alternate timeline that will never materialize? I get that...it's just the glibness of it that bugs me. Although I accept that she's suffered, she's not the one suffering the most and won't be the one suffering the longest. We'll be living with this long after she's dead. I just wish she'd listen, show a little compassion and quit pretending that diversity is awesomesauce and living with an ASD is candyfloss and unicorn farts.  If she admits what she really thinks and wants, it might open the flood gates to a despair from which she could never recover. People in distressing situations who rely heavily on cliche sentiments are often just doing whatever they can to keep from snapping. It might be inhuman to think that she could both emotionally support you in the ways that you need, and also keep herself and your sibling afloat in such a difficult situation. 

You can only control how you feel and how you live your life, so instead of waiting for your mom to give you validation, it might be more productive to accept that ship has sailed and find your own condolence. 

I think you'll find that once you are at peace with yourself, you will be the one making dismissive replies. Instead of despairingly arguing when she says everything is wonderful, you can just shrug and say you couldn't disagree more but you're glad that mindset seems to be working out for her, and move on. 
 Any community supports?  Perhaps a group home or workshop or job coaches available?  There is a lot to be said for parents continuing to parent, but parents deserve a life too. There's some "rehab" program based out of a different town that's supposed to be helping him find work but it's slow going, and they live in a very small rural town so jobs can be hard to come by for people who aren't disabled. On top of that he's...kind of extremely lazy and refuses to apply for any jobs that he sees as beneath him like working in food services or something. &gt; On top of that he's...kind of extremely lazy and refuses to apply for any jobs that he sees as beneath him like working in food services or something.

That part sounds like Ignatius Reilly in A Confederacy of Dunces. On this note... (I'm curious), what are the options, if any, once you find out your child has a mental disability? I'm talking about after they are born and are a few years old. When a woman is pregnant, she can get tests done and either abort or give the baby up for adoption if she knows she can't handle being a parent in that situation. But what about cases where the kid is already 3 - 5 years old?? Is there a (legal) way a parent can say "I can't do this" and give the child to the state? If there is, what are the future repercussions? I think you could feasibly give up the child for adoption, but there's the chance that the child will have an even harder time growing up than they would if you kept them. It's a hard decision to make. Yes. My 21 year old sister with Aspergers, depression, and now diabetes lives at home, entirely dependent on my parents for always and ever.

Their lives are absolutely miserable. My sister's life is miserable.

 How dare anyone judge me for saying if I had prior knowledge that's how my child would be, that I would abort it. This is another reason I don't want kids. I *know* I wouldn't be able to handle it if something went wrong. The thought completely terrifies me because you can do *everything* right during your pregnancy and they can still come out with severe problems :/ My exes brother had Aspergers. He was incredibly violent, obese, and very strong. I've seen him full on attack their dad, and say it was justified because 'he was mad'. He can never work, and cant manage money OR food.  That's terrifying, it's like having a pet gorilla. I don't know why I laughed at this. Having worked with kids with severe cases of Autism and behaviour on the violent side, a healthy pet Gorilla would probably be easier to manage. I can empathize with her feelings. 

I think when most people think about being a parent, it's only for the duration until your children are adults. Children with severe aspergers are essentially your children for life. One of my friends growing up has it pretty severe, and I don't expect he will ever be independent of his parents. 

Some parents with enough money can afford to pay for permanent assistance, but that is rare.  Look up compassion fatigue, thoughts like hers are a sign that she's fucking exhausted When people ask me about being a parent, I never say I wouldn't change it for the world or any of that bullshit. I don't want to sound like a heartless bastard. It's tough. If I could go back in time and have no memory of my son I'd think about it. Being a parent isn't for everybody and you'll never be ready. You lose a lot of freedom. 
Edit: won't to want There's a huge social stigma around actually talking about what it really feels like to be a parent - we're supposed to be 100% into it and anything less is a cause of shock and alarm.

I consider this an incredible disservice to potential parents and humanity in general. You might be getting downvotes, but I'm with you - it takes courage to even suggest that parenting isn't the best thing ever. To say it it isn't for everyone, and maybe a lot of people shouldn't have kids - dangerous, but something that needs to be said. 

Edit: And now my most popular reddit comment is about how parenting isn't that great. :/ I feel the same way. I'm not a parent nor do I plan to. I get a lot of shit from people asking how do I *really* know that I don't want to be a parent without trying. That is something I don't want to find out the hard way and it's not something you can take back. But, most importantly, I don't want to intrinsically hurt someone (the child) simply because I wasn't cut out to be a parent. 

I think it's an incredibly important discussion to have and to be honest with. I mean, we're human, not every parent can think that having kids was, in fact, the right decision.  I feel you. I was at my cousins 1st birthday yesterday and my grandmother mentioned something about me having kids. I told her "nope I don't want them" and she scoffed at me. I keep telling my mom over and over that while I like the *idea* of kids, I have no intention to have them myself. 

There are SO MANY children in my family. If I need a kid for a while, I can just take one or five for the day and be on my merry way afterwards. 

I just know that I personally can't handle kids. I had to babysit a lot for the majority of my childhood and teenage years. After helping raise my brothers (and some cousins), I know that I don't want kids. I get too stressed and impatient with little ones. I do my absolute best not to but I can't help it. 

I can't have kids when I know that while I would love them, I would not necessarily be the best parent even though I would try my hardest.  &gt; I had to babysit a lot for the majority of my childhood and teenage years. After helping raise my brothers (and some cousins), I know that I don't want kids

Interesting. A friend's wife had the same experience, lots of time spent helping raise a stepsister. 

Why don't you tell relatives that they ruined your desire to have kids by making you babysit so much? Hopefully the guilt will shut them up. I had to babysit my brothers. The two cousins I babysat because for a time they had to live with us due to their batshit insane bitch mother. 

Either way, my family doesn't really give a shit. I'm the oldest grandkid and for a very long time I was the only girl so I guess they feel entitled to have at least one kid from me. That's really twisted. 

I love my family though. The only one who doesn't criticize what I say is my uncle (the one with the cousins who lived with us) because as much as he loves and adores them more than anything, his life would have been much easier without them. At the same time though, they've made him grow up and be responsible which is a good thing.

I'm 22 which is why they keep blowing me off about it. "Oh I felt the *same way* when I was your age. Don't worry, you'll want them soon enough."

No, I fucking don't. I actually grew up wanting kids. It wasn't until these past couple of years, watching friends have surprise babies/more babies in the family/deep personal reflection that I've realized I don't want them.

I'm completely fine with my fur babies though. In fact, we have three kitties. The last one we got was a few weeks ago and he's 13 weeks. He stresses me out a lot because he constantly needs attention. Our first kitten was the same way. (The second was already a year when we got her so problems there). Being stressed out by *kittens* definitely put it in perspective for me.

That and constantly being in day care (not because we *needed* to be but my mom worked there so that's where we went after school) made me hate kids. And working at a coffee shop in a high school- entitled little shits. Not all of them but a lot of them.

Sorry, I keep going on a tangent. I didn't want them at your age and still don't nearly 12 years later.

Getting married in the fall so I'm sure my family will start hinting that "oooh, better get started since there's not much time left!"

Jokes on them.  I already shut that factory down faster than if Gordon Ramsey was running it. I'm glad it's not just me then. I feel really ostracized by a lot of my friends because even though they might not be dating or anything, they just *know* they want kids and can't understand my reasoning for not wanting them.

Luckily my SO/best friend in the whole world completely understands and feels the same way.

Congrats on getting married! And good luck dealing with the "when are you getting knocked up" talks.

^Gordon ^Ramsey ^joke ^cracks ^me ^up. ^Even ^though ^he ^didn't ^answer ^my ^question ^on ^the ^AMA ^earlier ^:C If you ever feel like you want/need some support, /r/childfree is here for you. I wanted kids growing up. I wanted 3! I was dead set on it. When I was 20 I had the idea of being a preschool teacher and it made me feel like I would need to chose either to have kids of my own or be a teacher. Being around kids 24/7 would probably drive me insane. And then at 24 I realized there is no way I could handle having kids of my own. Seeing my friends have kids and how stressful they are and everything they are going through...the things you don't see your parents go through because they try to hide it.. But I know if I did have kids they would most likely be bipolar, like me and 10 of my immediate family members (father and his brothers, my sister and her kids). I would never want my kids to go through what I have gone through and feel the things I have. It scares me and would also kill me to know that my child could hate me like I do my father. 
 &gt;I get a lot of shit from people asking how do I *really* know that I don't want to be a parent without trying.

I love this. Like parenting is something you can dip your toes into. Your "trial period" is about twenty years. 

 Yeah you can't just go a few months/years and then put it on Craigslist as "lightly used." I don't know how people have the nerve to give anyone shit for not having kids. I can only think it's because they're jealous.
 Whether or not you'd be good at something isn't a good reason to do it. I could be the best at getting shot and surviving - but I'd rather not find out. 

Having kids for the sake of having kids is more selfish than not having them because you enjoy your life as it is!  I'm right there with you. I have my whole family pushing for grandkids ( mom and nana) and I'm so greedy with my time as it is that I don't think kids will be in my future. I even had a coworker bring it up all the time, his prime reasoning being who was going to take care of me when I got older. I figured I would set enough money aside to check myself and my husband into a nursing home.

If it happens it happens but the little sucker would be pretty lucky with all the overtime I put in on not getting pregnant. &gt;If it happens it happens but the little sucker would be pretty lucky with all the overtime I put in on not getting pregnant.

Put your money where your mouth is and get a vasectomy; raw sex feels good.  Its better to regret not having kids then regret having them. Kids will always know if they weren't wanted by one or both parents. *Always*. I can personally vouch for that.

I knew as a kid. That's the worst of both worlds, unless you meant "than".  Your right ,but I'm going to leave it, because now it's funny. On some emotional level, I really don't want to have kids. I'm not interested in anything it entails. I feel like the amount of money and time I would need to spend on raising a child would stress me out across a lifetime and cause a rift between me and my child - a sentiment I feel a lot of fathers go through and realize only after the fact. I also don't want to risk being a largely absentee father due to work - something my dad worried about (since it happened to him) then he had kids and ended up doing it anyway.

When I tell people this, they think I'm selfish. That my thoughts and feelings on the subject are based on my perspective and that a child means adding more to the world and being intrinsically tied to something more than myself.  That I should 'get over myself'. 

I get asked all the time when I'm gonna have kids because me and my girl have been together for nearly a decade. We've even had both sides of the family try to push us into it and say they would help us if we struggled with money and raising them.

Then I sigh and start listing all the medical conditions me and my fiancee have in our families combined. Our kid would win the opposite of the genetic lottery when it comes to cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental and physical deficiencies. Either one of us would be bad but together we're a total mess.

And then they say 'I hadn't thought of that' and start thinking about their own medical history.  Dude, you totally nailed how I feel about this subject. My response to that is always how do they know dying sucks when they haven't tried it. Go jump off a building sometime. Topic ends after that. It's immensely better to regret not having children than regretting having them.  Thank you.  You're welcome, although now my highest-rated comment is about how maybe parenthood isn't all that great. :/ One of my closest friends just wanted to do the wife/mum thing. She regrets it so much, she would never say it, but she's so stressed out and miserable all the time. She actually went back to work to get time away from home and took back up smoking.. 
 This "story" she was sold is what I rail against. I don't know where people get it in their heads that it's going to be all sunshine and rainbows, but propagating that story is plainly a disservice to everyone. 

Balance is important - being a parent can be, sometimes, incredible. But as they say - "The only reason people become parents is because they've never had a child before." I think what happens is that some people *do* absolutely find themselves in parenthood and love everything about it and those people tend to be the most vocal.   I think that even if you love being a parent it's still such an exhausting thing. My sister is an amazing mother, she took to motherhood the instant my nephew was born and recently she's started a job and she loves it, she loves being out of the house and away from the children for a bit.

I think people should be more honest about i, because lets be honest it's no big deal if people decide not to have kids, there is plenty of people on this planet already. My mum had 5 babies, loved every minute of it so she says; says labour wasn't that bad and still mothers us even though her oldest baby is now past 40. She is that person. 

I used to believe her when she said labour isn't that bad, not now, I've seen One Born Every Minute... I knew guys in the Navy who loved being at sea because they didn't have to deal with their kids for a while. I was working the Register at one of my jobs and a family of four walked in and I went through the usual "How's you day going" business. The parents answer was this: "Every parent in your life will tell you how awesome having kids is and you should do it, don't. They're lying and want you to be as miserable as they are."....

It just isn't for everyone. This. A lot of people berated me for answering all the usual questions people ask honestly. Frankly, I think if you aren't prepared to hear something real, don't ask such invasive fucking questions.

Of course I was excited, and of course I was also petrified at the same time. I mean how many people can say with 100% certainty that from the moment they know they were going to potentially be a parent, that they knew everything was going to be alright? Birth defects, stillbirth, post-partum depression (for women AND men), birthing complications, tragic accidents, and lets not forget that some kids do just grow into horrible people - these are all things that happen. It isn't right to necessarily *expect* something to go wrong, but I think it's negligent to walk into parenthood without at least a little mental fortification in case something does go wrong.

Parenthood is fucking scary.

That said, while I don't use the usual clichs like "I wouldn't change it for teh werld!11!!", I do hold the belief that if I could reverse time, I would only go back far enough so as to not interrupt the conception of my child. She's too beautiful to deny life. I felt that way then and I still feel that way now. had something gone wrong, well, I'm sure I would feel differently. I made a long comment about how awesome my son is, but I think I forgot to mention that it's fucking hard. I'm a single mom, and his dad isn't in the picture. Everything rests on me. That's so hard, and scary, and sometimes it's lonely. But I wouldn't trade this life for anything. I feel that if I could trade this for the "American dream" life with a wonderful husband and 2.5 kids and a dog, I would probably not appreciate it. 

I always knew I was strong, but I would never have believed I would be okay with this situation; much less happy with it! I totally agree that maybe I'd feel differently if something had gone wrong with him, and there's lots I'd change about his early life, but there's no goddamn way I'd go back and make it so he was never conceived.  man, despite the blunt honesty, you just ooze parental love. it's beautiful These dumb kids can't even let us resent them! Winning us over with all that love and whatnot! It won't be long before the children take over the planet and we'll be dead! 

In seriousness, though, I'm glad my son is here - and I agree, he's too awesome to deny life. My major problems are mostly with my lack of money and available babysitters. Thanks.  As someone who wanted kids up until around a year or so ago, this makes my choice seem a little less controversial.    There are a lot of kids (and parents) probably pretty close to you who could all use help, time, and attention. If you ever feel the need to support a child, just ask your friends if there's something you can do - I think that might work out well for everyone. :) Well, funnily enough, I kind of have.  I was old enough as a child to have watched my sister born and grow up as I'm the oldest of three.  I have a very good friend with three girls and stayed at his house for a few months while being homeless.  This made me realise kids are harder work than you can comprehend without children.  Lastly , my younger brother has two kids, and, although they are by far the easiest to deal with and love, I am glad I can hand them over to their parents and leave to some quiet.  

I might sound harsh, but I honestly don't think I would have the patience to deal with kids.  It's just something I've learned about myself over the last few years.   Everyone is getting judged left and right here, and some will think my support for your decision means I hate my child, but for what it's worth, you have my support AND I love my son! I can completely understand that and really respect the fact you can be so open about it whilst giving this kind of advice.  I believe kids aren't for everyone, but I can see how they would bring happiness to people who have the right mindset for them.  Personally, I think I would be a detriment to my own child's upbringing and would ultimately regret it.  

I don't get the impression you hate your child though, if anything, I get the inkling that you have learned a great deal about who you are and what you're capable of.  Fair play.   Children are people first, and like anyone you're with all the time, you can feel the full range of emotions in response to their behavior. 

In the end, under all those moment-to-moment responses... I love him more than I care to discuss. That love helps all the time - when he's being awesome, or when he's being shitty. And in those processes I have found out a lot more about myself, too - you're right. More people should not be parents. This generation loves green energy and recycling.

There is nothing greener than population reduction. Do your part, and I thank you. Everyone knows overpopulation is a problem, it just doesn't apply to me or my children, because we're special.  Folks need not sacrifice: having two children reduces the population, even if everyone does it (not everyone reaches breeding age, chooses to breed, etc.). Two kids is a lot of kids already. Crazy folks out there with four and five. I think it's actually a more complex moral question than that.  What responsibility exactly does an individual have to sacrifice for the planet or the human speceis?

I mean, you, me, and everyone in this thread could sell our computers and feed starving people all over the world.  But none of us are.  Does that make us all monsters? Less about sacrifice, more about making the option to not have children far more socially acceptable (making sterilization far more accessible for those who want it, for instance). There are many who want to remain childfree and are so incredibly pressured by family and friends. now i feel even better about choosing to never have kids. 

people think im weird, but in reality, i just don't want any.

if i wanted to do any form of parenting, i might consider picking up a career as a teacher or something... Most of North American has a negative birthrate already. Same with Europe. And Japan. And China. Having 2 or 3 children, at best, offsets the numerous childless or single children families. 

The way to fix it, is to stop allowing immigration. "No, stay back where you came from and fix the shithole you're trying to flee". Its cruel, and yes it definitely reeks of 'we were here first', but frankly I'd like to see North America find balance in its population, and address local inequities instead (e.g. native population, disenfranchised groups, improve healthcare, etc).

Immigration in the 21st century is almost immoral when you think about it -- you're allowing the most driven people to leave their home country to aspire to something better in the 1st world. Yes, this is GREAT for the 1st world...but you've deprived the origin country of its best and most motivated local talent. The talent that might help them fix their problem. And I suddenly feel much better for deciding not to have kids.  Yup.

I'll be cliche, and say I wouldn't change having my daughter for anything in the world. Wouldn't do it any differently.

HOWEVER. I'm sure as hell not having any more kids. As much as I love my little girl, that baby and toddler stage? Never again. "You'll look back on this time as the best time."

Can't wait to look back with nostalgia on wiping all that shit off his butt, pants, the carpet, the carseat, the stroller, his bedsheets, other kids... plus all those tantrums? I miss them already, and he's still a toddler.  Haha. Yuuup.

We had a LOT of fun. But I'm never going to look back at that shits, and times when she transformed into screaming ball of rage as "the best." I wish I could have children but altogether skip the baby/toddler/puke/shit stage ... but then it also occurs to me that teenagers are the biggest fucking idiots imaginable. I wish I could adopt a well-read, polite, successful 25 year old Although I think most would admit that there's plenty of room for discussing this between the positions of thinking being a parent was the best thing that ever happened to you and wishing your children had been aborted. Which is fucking stupid. It's like society is saying "hey, you know that thing you feel like you'll probably be no good at but will have an effect on countless people for decades to come? Yeah, you should do it anyway. In fact, we are going to look down on you if you don't" I'm currently in a situation where I got my ex pregnant. She absolutely refused to get an abortion after only a few weeks in. Ultimately it was the best thing for all parties, but she was mostly concerned about what she wanted, and not what was best. She even admitted that going through with the pregnancy and raising the child wasn't what was best for anyone, but didn't care.

It doesn't help that her issues were what caused the pregnancy in the first place (basically it was supposed to be safe, she lied. It wasn't. She was trying to get herself pregnant because she had "baby fever". She admitted that much). She's got major issues.

She isn't fit for parenthood. She suffers from auditory delusions and paranoia that she willingly indulges in (she talks to the voices) and either lies or deludes herself into thinking she's told the truth whenever she says anything. She's not stable enough to take care of herself, let alone a child. And the problem is her doctors (psychiatrist and therapist) only see her once every three months because she wanted to see them as little as possible. They seem to be only interested in taking her money instead of actually helping her, because no professional worth their salt would tell her that she's perfectly capable of raising a child and that her condition presents no problems whatsoever. She nearly *killed* her stepbrother when he was born because she got tired of being paranoid about his wellbeing and her voices talking about him all the time. She often takes things out on people when her voices are talking about them too often.

And *I'm* not currently fit for parenthood. I'm not very good at taking care of myself. My depression is bad enough to where I can't even get the motivation to get help, *because* of my depression and related issues. It's not one of those "I feel terrible so it motivates me to kill myself" kinds of depression and suicidal tendency. My depression robs me of even that way out of it.

And together? Geez. Her and I would be far worse for any child together than we would be separately. But now that it's been developing inside of her (it's still only a month or so in), she's convinced herself that that's what's happening. She fakes pregnancy symptoms (ones that can't happen that early on) and absolutely refuses to have any conversation about adoption options, or even at least considering what needs to be done to ensure any child she raises is getting what they need. She doesn't even want the child to go anywhere without her being there (in the future). And I'm not talking as a baby, she means to be attached to the hip of that child until they are nearly an adult. So if I wanted to be in this child's life, she made it clear I'd have no input as a parent. As anything.

And all of this and so much more could have been avoided if she got an abortion after the first pregnancy test (which apparently was positive after only a week). The pregnancy already has made her go down a way worse road mentally than she already had been before it, and now she can't even take her medication. So it's going to get even worse.

I want to be a parent someday. So bad. It's the one thing I've wanted more than anything. But this entire situation is exactly what I never wanted.

Sometimes, abortion really is the best option. It'll be a miracle if she survives long enough to be pregnant, and be even more of a miracle if that child ends up being raised healthy. &gt;(it's still only a month or so in)

&gt;She fakes pregnancy symptoms (ones that can't happen that early on)

&gt;And all of this and so much more could have been avoided if she got an abortion after the first pregnancy test (which apparently was positive after only a week).

I'm sure this has already crossed your mind but just in case it hasn't: Are you absolutely sure she's pregnant and not just faking the whole thing for attention? Oh I wish that were the case. If it is, well then she's making the most committed performance possible. Her family believes her, her sister was there when my ex took the pregnancy test and I've spoken with her directly about it. So she'd be risking a lot if she were lying.

One fucked up thing she did though was not too long after she told me the news, she mentioned that since she was pregnant, we could have sex however we wanted. There were so many reasons why that was inappropriate, but the fact that her being pregnant was very recent and very bad news was the biggest one.

So maybe she is. But she's got an appointment with her OBGYN soon, so she'll figure that out.

Another detail to add to the "faking pregnancy symptoms" thing: You know how pregnant women place their hands on their back, since it's so sore from having a HUGE bulge in the front? She was doing that three weeks in. And you know the thing they say about being super aware of the life inside of them? She said that immediately after her mother talked about it... Only a week and a day after the moment of conception.

So whether she's lying or not, the entire situation is completely fucked. That future child doesn't stand a chance. Oh dear lord. Yeah. She's definitely faking at least some of those symptoms. Definitely wait until after the OBGYN appointment. If you are there in the doctors office and actually see, with your own eyes, the OBGYN confirm that she is pregnant, I highly recommend you talk to a lawyer and see what kind of rights you will have after the kid is born. Including paternity tests.

&gt;she mentioned that since she was pregnant, we could have sex however we wanted. 

Yeah that's real convenient, you don't have to worry about condoms now, yeah? So if she isn't really pregnant now, she definitely will be eventually. How nice. (/s) I asked my buddy that had a child 2 months before we had ours why he didn't prepare me on how having a kid sucked so badly, his reply was "I told you it was hard." to my reply "Hard my ass, it f'ing sucks.", his reply, "Yeah, that's what I meant." The first few months of having your first child is such a life change it basically throws you into shock because you have no idea what to expect. I told another friend of mine that was having a child when mine was maybe 1.5 years that he's going to hate it for at least the first 3 months (maybe more), flat out, it sucks, you'll not get much sleep, your life is basically upside down, etc. He took what I told him in stride. I saw him after they had their baby and told me (in front of a bunch of friends) "OK man, I thought that when you told me that it sucks that your kid was just really bad and you were still exaggerating...but now I know that you were just trying to prepare me, and you were right."

Now, please don't get me wrong, I love my little girl more than anything in the world, BUT, the birth of your first child is, as they say, a life changer (understatement). Which to those who haven't been through it, it doesn't sound like much but when you experience it, you totally understand, it's hard, it's hard to completely make the sacrifice of your time, your sleep, your patience, and give it to a newborn child. 

I'm starting to feel bad about writing this and please don't think I'm some heartless person because that's definitely not the case, I'm just honest about the process of having a child. I think people think they have to tell everyone it's great because they think they're not allowed to speak "badly" about their child or parenthood, but me, I'm just honest about it. And for those that didn't experience this with their first child, congratulations to you and please understand that you're quite lucky. My point was that - just opening up and being honest about your experience  makes your feel bad? That isn't an reaction we should have. 

I've spend the last hour defending myself from internet strangers, a lot of whom seem to think I'm a shitty dad for suggesting parenthood isn't all it's cracked up to be. 

The best I can do is give an upvote and some support for further a conversation that everyone should have - parents, people thinking about being a parent, and even (eventually) our own children.  Same thing with dog ownership. I love my dog but most of the time I think it'd be cool to go back before I met him and just not buy him. Just keep being able to do anything I want.

Dogs aren't nearly as restrictive as kids, but still. My son turns one this week...I love him more than anything, but being a parent is fucking ROUGH. Definitely not for everyone. I'm so glad I chose not to have children.  I would have been a disaster as a parent and it would have been unfair to everyone involved. Fellow parent - how old is your kid? I know the first several years are really rough. At one point I said to my wife "It's no wonder so many dudes just take off" (wrong thing to say by the way) but now that my kids can wipe their own asses and bathe themselves I'm in the "I wouldn't change a thing" stage.  My son is 21 months. I love him greatly. I would hurt anyone who'd ever think of hurting him. I just didn't want to lie to everyone and tell them it was the greatest thing ever. I just want people to think hard about it because it's not always easy.  Yeah, I'm with ya. It's rarely easy at that age. My wife and I did it (twice) without parents to help us or money for sitters and we were both on the brink a lot.  It still has challenges but it gets easier. somewhat.  My son is almost 3 - I can feel things getting less rough by the day, and we're working on the toilet usage/independence thing. Nowadays I can see how much easier things will be - also how the challenges will be, but the day I no longer have to worry about his poop will be an incredible day. I, unfortunately, don't have a wife or partner in this, but as far as my son goes, I wouldn't change a thing about him. As an 18 year old this is heartbreaking and eye opening. My parents and I have a great relationship but recently my mom said "son, when you have kids, your life is over."  So I understand why you feel this way.  I think she just wants you to live a little before you start thinking about kids. Make no mistake about it your parents love you. They wouldn't change a thing now.  Supporting this comment. My life (as it was) was over, but a new one began, and I was still me. Honestly, handing in a old life for a new one may not be a bad thing - but it is still life-changing, no doubts. My grandfather was an asshole, but I loved him.  One of his favorite sayings was "You can never miss what you never had".  
 This is why I don't want kids. I like my freedom too much I'm a nanny. I grew up always being told "being a parent is the hardest job ever" and I always thought, yeah ok, it's probably pretty challenging. 

Now I'm not a parent, but I started working with a 10 month old baby earlier this year and god damn it is SO much work. I'm physically exhausted every day from picking him up/catching him/running when he falls/running to stop him killing himself and I'm emotionally exhausted from hearing crying whenever he's hungry/tired/falls/wants mom. At the end of the day I just collapse into bed. 

A baby changes absolutely every aspect of your life. When you wake up, when you eat, what you can leave on the floor, if your dogs can bark, if you can leave that thing on the stove if baby wakes up, what things are now choking/strangulation hazards, etc. 

I only work 7 to 4 and I get weekends off. I get a full nights sleep every night. I cannot imagine having to do this 24/7/365 for more than one baby. It's really rewarding but parenting is definitely not for me, not yet at least. 

Don't rush into it, folks.  &gt; running to stop him killing himself

It's amazing humans have survived this long.  Unless you can afford a nanny. (I hope they pay you well.) I think parenting is the hardest thing you've ever done if its the hardest thing you've ever done.

Train up on some hard shit and then be a parent. Then parenting is easy. It can quite literally be a walk in the park.

 Its like watching the dog whisperer. Shitty parents (and dog owners) have to work so much harder than good ones because they are reacting, not pro-acting. Calm assertive energy, consistency.  You got this shit. My gf has a young son and it's seriously making me rethink my position on wanting kids. Great kid, but the loss of so many freedoms for such a long time... It's really makes me think that I just want to travel the world instead. I'm not trying to say no one should ever have kids. It's just not always great. Thank you for dating a women with a child, it's hard for some people to get past them already having kid.  I wish more people would talk about this. I love kids. *Love* them. I teach first graders and work kids birthday parties. I can't imagine having a life where my Monday through Friday was not devoted to kids. I'm kid obsessed.

But I'm still not sure I want my own. Yes I want a cute little 0-7 year old, but do I really want a 16 year old taking up my space? Not so much. But so many people don't consider what it actually means and have kids because it's the normal and correct thing to do and then they don't actually parent. Ignore the hell out of their kids, all the while swearing up and down they *love* being a parent and everyone else should do it too. I listened to some story on NPR about when people find out their kid is going to need lifelong care.  They were interviewing the folks years later.  Those who chose to go ahead with the pregnancy were happy with their choice -- we couldn't imagine our life without him/her, etc.  Those who chose to terminate the pregnancy were also happy with their choice. 

It sounds to me like, given something as monumental as this, most people are programmed to be happy with your choice regardless.  
 Thanks for being honest. I knew parents were full of shit. This is nearly exactly my sentiment. I tell people that if I had the chance to go back and knew about parenthood I wouldnt have a kid but at the same time I wouldnt change anything now that I have that awesome little fucker.  Good thing time machines don't exist, civilization would probably end.  One of my mates has a kid about 18mo old, and he's adorable. we get along so well. And despite how much joy that kid has brought into my friend's life and by extension mine, I don't know if I could make that plunge.

But there are a bunch of other things that need to happen before that anyway - having a partner is one of them. My husband had a child in high school. He literally got down on his knees and begged her to abort, and she didn't. Their relationship ended, but he was there for the birth and has been a pretty good dad ever since. She ended up meeting her husband soon after the baby was born and my husband met me. The kid calls my husband and his step dad both "daddy" and we all get along great. No hard feelings in the situation and the "baby" turns 10 this year! He adores my husband and says how lucky he is to have 4 parents instead of 2 like normal people.

Even though the situation turned out okay, my husband has told me (and only me, he'd NEVER risk his kid finding out) that if he could have his memory totally erased so that he couldn't miss the child, and it were possible to go back and get the abortion, he would.

He loves his son, but he doesnt feel like his life is *better* by having had a child with someone he didn't love at a young age.. He could never just walk away from the kid because he loves him too much now and would miss him, but if there were a magical way to go back in time and erase memories, he said he'd go back and wear a condom for sure because it wasn't the life he pictured (in fact we don't want kids ourselves..like at all)

Edit: Id like to point out that I don't for a second think he would actually take it back... If it weren't hupothetical and he really had to make that choice, he'd feel a rush of emotion and leave things just the same. Human emotions are simply complex and thinking about a life you could have had makes you think odd things. His girlfriend gave him the option to walk away, completely free, many years ago. He chose to be a father, because for some weird reason, love makes us do things that aren't in our best interest... But in the best interest of the people we love. I'm a child that grew up in this situation, be careful, i picked up a lot of these feelings that you're expressing now at a young age that i only fully put together with i was around 18. Kids are not as oblivious as adults think, when you mature you tend to forget that.   I have a son in this situation. Me and the mom were never together. I love my son more than anything but for reasons i dont want to get into, I dont live in the same city. I see him every 3 weeks and I cherish our time together.

He is 3 years old. Sometimes I feel like he doesnt need me and maybe better off if i stay out of his life. But on the other hand I can see our bond growing stronger. But am I harming him by not being there for him all the time? Better to stay away?

Id like if you could share your story or give advice. It is a hard situation. As someone with divorced parents, my personal experience is that being involved in your kid's life is a good thing as long as there are no bad feelings. My dad is intermittently involved in our lives too but since he is a selfish man I know he only comes back when he wants something, and that messes me up. I would be happy if he would either just stay out of our lives or actually love us. But not being around all the time isn't a bad thing in itself. &gt; Sometimes I feel like he doesnt need me and maybe better off if i stay out of his life. But on the other hand I can see our bond growing stronger. But am I harming him by not being there for him all the time? Better to stay away?

Child of divorced parents here.

Never speak of the ex in bad terms, don't try to manipulate your child into feeling a certain way about the other parent, and make sure they know that while you may not always be there, you WILL be there if they need you.

My dad set the first two rules up himself, and we have a fairly strong bond even if we go a long time without seeing each other.  The third part is just how he is, but I think it is also pretty integral in our relationship.  I know that no matter what happens, I can always fall back on my dad for help.  He's not always there, but he'll be there when it counts. I think you should stay, because if you leave it will always bother him, those years of what if, what could have been with his real father. I appreciated that my dad stuck around, even though my life is very complicated as a result. I love him and I known he loves me and I wouldn't give up ny memories of our short times together. BUT, it was also very obvious that he often saw me as a burden, and in adult life I  can see how this has affected me. I'm constantly trying not to be a burden on anyone in my life. It's hard to deal with, it was harder as a child because you feel unwanted. In a way you are. Just don't let on if you feel like that, its okay to feel like that, but it can really break a child and the adult they grow up to be Another kid with a dad who was around off and on, apparently dying to chime in here! 
My parents weren't together since before I was born. 

Stay involved as much as is realistic for you. 
Never make promises you can't keep. 
Never expect your kid to be the one to maintain contact, it's your job. 
Never shit talk the mom. 
Help the mom out in any way that makes sense for you. Being a single parent is super hard and one of the main things I resent my dad for was seeing my mom struggle with doing everything by herself. 

edit- comma He isn't picking up on these feelings, his dad isn't sitting there thinking about it constantly. They are normal father and son. Very much amazed with each other and full of love. I'm in no way implying that he does, it is the little absences and subtle  distance in some activities and anything difficult in their life and what not that can picked up on. I'm not saying that this is the case with with you two, it is purely my experience.  Sorry you had a negative experience.

Alternatively, my mom has straight up said being a teen mother was the hardest thing she ever did, she wouldn't wish it on anyone, and she would never have chose that life... I'm her kid and knowing that doesn't bother me at all. It makes sense. 

I know she loves me, that's all that matters. At least he (and you) both stepped up for the kid. That's a lot more than most would.  Gotta do what you gotta do. We enjoy our weekends with him. Luckily he's a pretty easy kid to love so it's not hard. Not ideal, but hey, if this is the most complicated our lives ever get, Id say we got away pretty easy.  That seems better than raising a kid as a couple. Free babysitting! (my sister babysits and it isn't cheap. Good for her though.)  I have a 6 year old little girl who I had young. I accidentally got a girl pregnant (she lied about being on the pill) and then the psycho in her came out. We had been dating for only a month at the time. I wanted her to abort but she wouldnt. It had been a crazy 6-7 years going in and out of Family Court. She hadn't had custody in over 5 years because she gave it up. Now I have sole custody.


I wish I could've lead a normal life without her. My early and mid twenties have been and still are dominated by her presence. This is esecially true since the mother has done practically nothing to contribute. But now she wants her spot back in as "Mommy"... but that's another story. 


I love my daughter to pieces. She's a great kid. But I wish, well... I could've put her on hold for like 8 years or so. I wish I could've had those years to myself and not feel like a burden to my family. On the other hand, she did stabilize me. I wasn't taking life very seriously, but when she was born I got more serious,  finished my Associates, got a decent job,  etc.


Now I'm engaged to another woman (whom my daughter adores, but at times I wish that my daughter could've been later so my relationship would be easier. Now every weekday I work, come home, get her off of the bus, babysit her and have no time to myself... or minimally. 


And saying all of that kills me. I feel selfish for even thinking it. But at least I'm blessed with her as my child. I've seen so many demon kids out there lately. She's an angel. Don't feel guilty.

Love isn't black and white and you can feel exhausted and resentment and love your child at the same times.

Humans are cool like that we can feel 384739 different emotions at the same time.. (Unless you're like Ron and have the emotional range of a teaspoon-- do you like Harry potter? Hope so or ignore that reference.) If I got to live my life over, after living it completely now, I wpuld have gone on birth control to avoid having my son. 

He is my favourite person in the whole world, but I wonder what my life woukd be like if I hadn't gotten pregnant (I was only 20). I was poised to go to a university, but I didn't because of my baby.

I am happy where we are now, but I will always be curious. I understand. My mom had twins at 15 so when she says she would not have ever "chose" this life it's not because she doesn't love us it's because we made her life 2484% harder.

Mostly, she tells us that because she doesn't want us to make the same mistakes she did. It's hard having a child when you're young. I can't even imagine having twins!

I never got that advice from my mother or grandmother, because they were at least 28 when they started having kids :) [deleted] This is perfect. I had a son at 18 with a man I didn't love. I'm in a perfect relationship now, and he actually has two kids as well. We love our little family. But I agree with you, our lives are not better because of our kids. We could have way more accomplished by now if we didn't have them.

That said, and I've thought about this a lot since I've become a parent, if I didn't have my son, I think I would have gone down a bad path if I didn't have someone keeping me responsible. It's so easy to think that I would have gone to college and experienced everything the way others my age have. But honestly, I wouldn't have gone to college. I probably wouldn't have even finished high school. Becoming a parent really does change everything.  wow kudos for being great parents (&amp; humans) though. that's tough, but it's great to hear that mature adults can get along well in that situation! mad props. especially to you  - I'm sure that was a tough one to swallow when you found out.  It was hard but I think if things were different, we would all be different people. Like what if that girl never got pregnant, and their little teen relationship hadn't been strained, and then they actually stayed together? Maybe I'd have never met my husband, maybe she would have never met her husband  and created the rest of her kids (they have several between them, so my stepson does have siblings even if they won't come from me).. Maybe this is how things needed to be for us to all end up here.

Honestly my life is so happy.. and being teen parents and step parents was hard but we all have really good lives now so Id never risk changing anything cause then the outcome could be totally different as well. I get it, I love my blended family, but its just fucking awful at times dealing with exes. You dont feel like you are enriching a childs life by having two conflicting family needs competing to have that childs time.  Its hard not to feel guilty that you will never do enough to make everything completely smooth and painless for everyone involved  I'm lucky that I really don't relate to that aspect. Her and I get along so well! The part of a blended family that sucks to me is that my family will always be working around this other families schedule.

What we do on holidays is completely dependent upon what they do and vice versa. Having to base life decisions on another family sucks, and we really want to move away because my husband can make way more money in a different town but we can't because we have to live close to wherever they decide to live in order to be close to the child (and we do want to be close.)

So until he's an adult- which  actually won't the that long, just another 8 years till he's 18 and I won't even be 30 yet! (I'm years younger than my husband)- we will be tied to his moms family.

However, like I said we all really do try our best to be accommodating towards each other and we compromise quite easily. His mom and I talk waaay more than my husband talks to her. She prefers to schedule with me cause she finds me more organized about planning (which is true lol) He confided this in you and only you, and yet you don't use a throwaway? People regret parenthood more than you might think. However, the stigma against coming out is just overwhelming. Probably because it could fuck the son/daughter up to hear such a thing.  This just hits me hard, this question, because my mom just told me she wishes my sister was never born. 
My sister was born a product of an abusive highschool relationship. The dad has been in/out of jail because of rape, drugs, etc. 
My sister has a severe mental illness that is uncontrollable. Her behavior is hard to describe, but lets just say she is overly sensitive, not open to criticism, is delusional, and cant hold relationships. 
She started showing signs as a young child- wetting the bed, manipulating, and trying to hurt me(I am younger). She hated me the day I was born and she hated my dad who ended up legally adopting her at the age of 3. She always felt as if she wasnt loved, but recently she has publicly been claiming that my parents abused and neglected her. 
None of which is true. If anything, she was abused(sexually, physically, and mentally) by her biodad. Yet, she still claims it was my dad who hit her. Which he never, ever did. The only time was when she tried to kill me(threatening me with a knife and herself). My dad tackled her and she was sent to a mental hospital at 13 where she was diagnosed with bipolar, and a personality disorder. 
Anyway, she put on facebook all this shit about my parents and how I have had everything handed to me in life and havent worked for any of it. She claims that she was never loved. It makes no sense because my parents broke their back over her. I can remember them going out Christmas Eve to make sure she had the most presents and they spent the most money on her. She chose the movies and the things we did on vacation. Yet, she still claims this and is garnering support on facebook. It is dividing the whole family. My grandma doesnt talk to me or my parents anymore. 
Oh, she also has kids and lord only knows how she treats them. She is honestly delusional.

My mom just visited me and she sat there for 3 hours crying. It was my sisters birthday. My sister claimed she was going to kill herself because she has been so abused and neglected. It is really frustrating and I am right in the middle with no where to turn. Ugh. Even if no one reads this, it is nice to write it all out. 
 Glad it helped to write it. 

That sounds rough. Obviously it's not entirely your sisters fault, since she is suffering from mental illness, but that doesn't make it any easier on you.  Borderline personality disorder? There was a study published not to long ago asking mothers exactly that question, and it is amazing that many women actually feel like they got pressured by society or their husbands to have children. Many of these women were divorced though, so I feel like it depends a lot on how your marriage is going Short answer yes. I had my kid right out of high school starting college. The main issue is I wasn't ready for a kid and they are special needs. I love them to death but just the fact that I know there's no future for them and they will require medical care and totally reliant on someone else to even eat, I just don't want them to suffer anymore. In all realness its the equivalent of having a 3 month old that stays in that state, but gets bigger as time goes on. If they didn't have any complications I would easily say no to their abortion. This feels messed up to say, but I think my mom should have aborted me and probably my siblings too. She got married for terrible reasons and just kept popping us out until the inevitable divorce occurred. She was a shitty parent and blamed us for everything wrong in her life. I'm a mom now with beautiful children, but I wouldn't miss it if I never happened. Parents can really screw up a childhood. :( Oh I have no problem admitting that my parents should have never had me. They were extremely irresponsible and my mother still is. They had no business bringing a child into this world and what gets me the most is that they did it on purpose! I wish I could go back in time and slap them both in the face. 

I always get irritated when pro-life people say, "No one wishes they were aborted"..... uh yeah, some people do. There are times I wish I was for sure. Growing up in poverty to two terribly irresponsible and selfish parents is not ok. No one should have to grow up like that and it leaves permanent scars on you as an adult. Physically and mentally.  EXACTLY holy shit, and I feel so bad and want to point out the mistakes they are still making but I feel like it won't help. My mother was a single mother but married my step father when I was 10. She has no idea how to save any money and it's going to screw her. She was unemployed for a brief time and they were usually $200 short for rent so my mother would ask my grandparents to cover it. Now, instead of saving the money they would have paid they blow it and ruin any chances of getting ahead. Sorry for the long drawn out speech but I feel the same as you. My mother was also in college when I was born(dropped out) and I feel like if I wasn't born she would have been better off, also being poor from bring born to 18 wasn't the greatest thing ever. Sorry you had a rough childhood. Some parents can be so selfish. A couple down the street from me kept popping out kids even though they were all mentally retarded. Five kids in all who will never be able to live on their own and the couple never thought "maybe there's something wrong with us and we should get tested before having more kids" Yeah, I'd retroactively abort myself if I could. I made the mistake of telling my husband that and he got really upset. I tried to explain that it wasn't about him or the kids, but about undoing a mistake.  My mom said she had a miscarriage when carrying my twin brothers before my 3rd sister and me, while most people would like feel sympathy; I've been thinking: what if they were born successfully? Would I exist then? They'll all justify their misery by saying, "And if we had to do if all over again we would!" Nah, thats just the shit we say to coworkers and people we think are overly judgmental.


In reality, I think /u/gonxthegreat said it best. 


In my opinion as a parent you do lose a lot, but it would be hard to even consider going back once you know your kids. That's not quite what he said though. 

&gt;I never say I wouldn't change it for the world

and

&gt;If I could go back in time and have no memory of my son I'd think about it.

 Not every parent is miserable. Everyone has a different opinion on it. There are far to many successful people that were parents before they became successful for me to believe that having children can drastically alter the course of your life's goals. 


If your miserable with a kid, you'd be miserable without one.  If I'm completely honest I'll say there have been times during pregnancy when I have been so stressed out by financial or life situation that I've thought, "This was a mistake" and allowed myself to wonder... but the reality is that these moments are fleeting and in response to great stress.

Every mother I knew, when speaking honestly and among peers, admits there have been extremely challenging and emotionally draining days where you wonder, "Would my life be better if I had no kids?" but it's the same thing: it's like there's some sort of mental block in place that stops you from actually considering it seriously, and instead keeps it as a "haha, yeah" thought at arm's length. Kind of like if you work a good job, but had a horrible week and thought, "God I could just QUIT tomorrow!" but the reality is you love your job and you know this is just a hard time. I'm dating a girl (fairly seriously) and she has a daughter. I've been there for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th birthdays. I feel like I've been there for this girl more than the actual father (probably because he was distant and almost never there for the first few years of this time). 

I don't have to be here, and sometimes I don't WANT to be here. But I'll tell you what, as exhausting as a kid can be, it's all worth it. This is a mind that you are teaching all your knowledge to. You try your best to un-fuck their mind from what the world may do in the future, but really you just watch them grow. They have their own personality that you can't control, and they have their own interests that base off a lot from what you do around them. It helps me to be a better person, because I want her to be a better person than I ever was. 

My girlfriend, having a poor health situation, would probably be better off right now without the stress of a child, but she loves this girl more than anything. She gets pissed off, and snaps at the kid, of course, like any parent. But no matter how much this kid is annoying, or selfish, or plain rude, she would never say she would have rather not had her. In that sense, she is grateful to have known the father, but wishes she could have had this same kid without him being the one in the picture. 

There's nothing as deep rooted that I've felt like having fatherly love for someone. My girlfriend told me that she wants to break up, and I handled it pretty calmly  (having seen signs in our relationship for months) but the moment that I mentioned how I will have no rights to see that girl, having raised her for 4 years of her young life, is where I broke down. Crying like a fucking baby. The realization that I may never see that kid again is the worst feeling I've ever had. The fact that my relationship might be over (this discussion happened 2 weeks ago), is one of the saddest things to ever happen to me BECAUSE of the possible loss of this child. If I could go back and not date this girl, I wouldn't feel this pain, I wouldn't feel this sadness. 

but...

I can honestly say that it's been worth it. I'm glad that (one) my girlfriend didn't get an abortion, and (two) that I got this chance to date this girl and help raise her kid. I can say that after this, my outlook on fatherhood has changed. I may never have a kid, or raise a kid again, and I'd be fine, because it's hard as fuck. But I'm glad I have had this chance, and will gladly continue to father this kid until either she moves out, or my girlfriend and I make the break-up official. 

tl;dr: No, I wouldn't. (just giving a sort of different perspective) This is incredibly sweet. Good luck. I hope you have a great life. You just know most of those that got pregnant completely by accident would try to prevent it in a heartbeat if they could go back with no recollection of it. Do I wish I had an abortion? Nah, I love my kids. But if I went back in time I would probably not have kids.
Some of that might be because of my age. I had them young. I'm not saying being a parent is horrible. It's just not a walk in the park. Yes I love my son and I wouldn't want anything to happen to him. /r/childfree if you want an idea of what your life can be if not marriage/house/kid/retire/travel/die My life could instead be marriage/house/complain endlessly about other people's kids/retire/travel/die?

Don't get me wrong, I hate kids as much as the next person, but /r/childfree is kind of like the /r/atheism of non-parenting.  Not me, not once. Being a parent has been easier so far than I expected it to be. Hope my luck holds out. And I thought there would be less sex. It's the same as before though, you have as much sex as the least interested party desires. Does your partner decline sex after a long day at work? If yes, expect sex to decline if you have children. If they prioritize sex, don't worry about it. I see all these responses where people have doubts, they would consider it, etc...  not judging them at all.  It is a tough, and sometimes thankless job.

But just to give another perspective.  NO.  I wouldn't consider it.  I have 3 teenagers and I love them more than anything (except their mother).

Wouldn't trade it for anything. My wife gave birth to our son nearly 3 months ago. I couldn't imagine my life without him. 

So to answer your question, no, I do not wish my wife had an abortion. When I found out I was pregnant, it was a complete shock. And I was no longer with the father. The first thing I asked was whether it was too late for an abortion. That feeling lasted a few hours, but I was an adult, and I could afford to support a child, so I really didn't consider abortion after that initial shock wore off.

I was extremely lucky, and my kid is awesome in so many ways. Mostly, he made me grow up. I'm not perfect, and I haven't created a perfect life for him, but we're learning together. He immediately became the center of my universe, and I think we've been equally good for each other. Life is so much fuller for me now. 

 I regret not being able to give him the happy, normal life (with mom and dad and younger siblings) that he deserves, and I regret not being able to share him with a partner that I love. I hate that his life hasn't been completely stable, sheltered and safe within a white picket fence. I worry about the time when he's old enough to contact his father, and the anger, stress, or frustration and disappointment that will inevitably accompany that day. 

 I am sad that I'm getting too old to have another kid, and I'll never be able to share something like this with a true partner. But it turns out that my son prompted me to make a giant change in my life, so that I could enjoy it with him instead of constantly struggling to make ends meet for him. He gets to see me work really hard for a life that will make us both happy, and I hope that the struggle he's sharing with me now will stay with him, and ultimately make life easier for him.


I don't know how I would feel if he wasn't such a great kid, but I definitely have him to thank for pulling me out of a serious depression and for giving me the kick in the ass I needed to get my life back on track. Also helps that I wasn't 18 when I got pregnant; I was too old to be a party girl, and I was just embarrassing myself trying to pretend I was young and beautiful and knew how to dance. Mother's who've had a stillbirth and a normal birth:

- Does it smell the same?
- Does it feel the same coming out? (texture, squishyness, etc..) They smell the same, yes. The "smell" of death doesn't happen for some time. If the baby has been handled by care workers before being given to the mother, sometimes they'll douse it with weird smelling soaps and shit and that can be a rather offensive smell (if you are a care worker or staff member reading this: please don't ever do this, ok? It really fucks up the grieving experience for mothers. We want our babies to smell like themselves). 

However, they can look very very different depending on how long it's been since the baby passed. A baby that has spent more than a few days inside the womb after passing will have what's called "skin slippage", which is exactly what it sounds like. It's not pretty. Often times nurses or other volunteers will help sort of push everything back into place before placing the baby in the parents arms to make it less jarring. Prolonged contact or rubbing of the skin will cause it to blister and slip more (I know of a mother who rubbed her baby's hand for some time, and after a blister and slippage formed, was very alarmed because no one had let her know this would happen ahead of time). Bruising also appears very quickly, especially around the lips and eyes. Out of all the stillborn and recently deceased babies I have worked with, I've seen one that still had pink-ish lips, and that was because it had been born alive and died only an hour or so before.
Babies like that example, who died only recently after birth or died just shortly before it, honestly look the same as a regular living baby and to the untrained eye it can be rather jarring. My (dead) baby was born alive and died after a few hours, and when I held him I spent a long time just sort of waiting for him to take a breath because he truly looked no different than a living, sleeping infant. The bruising and colour shifts formed slowly over a period of hours.

A stillborn baby coming out will feel the same to the mother giving birth, but very different to the care provider that's facilitating. For one, the skull bones feel very "loose"; at times it can literally feel like the top of the head is made of large puzzle pieces just sort of sitting inside loose skin. Whereas in a live baby they're much more firm. They move and give, yes, but they don't feel like they're just floating about.
The longer the baby has been "out" after dying, the squishier and more fluid their body starts to become. Eventually you'll start getting 'leakage' of bodily fluids (generally clear or slightly pink) from areas that have heavy slippage. The more the baby has been handled and repositioned, the faster this happens. This is also why, when a baby dies, it's put in a fridge to preserve it as much as possible so family members can say goodbye and have a chance to hold them if wanted.
When my baby died, before I got into working with other parents suffering the same fate, I was really surprised to hear that part. I imagined my son all wrapped up in blankets sitting next to someone's sandwich and can of diet Coke in the staff room or something. And while they don't store lunches in the same area... it's actually a lot like that. At my local hospital they store the babies in the garbage room (which I personally really hate), and have a special sort of "Bar fridge" that they're put in. After 3 days they're moved to the morgue, and then the funeral home (if applicable). I'm so sorry for your loss, but thank you for the insight. As morbid and callous as it is, it's a question I've wondered, too. I also wonder what labor must feel like if you've been informed of the death ahead of time - would you just resign yourself to the futility of it all? 

Stillbirth and neonatal death are among the top of my "things to fear about pregnancy and labor" list.

Edit: thank you to everybody who has shared their experiences and thoughts. I don't mean to undermine any of your grief and suffering but this has been an eye-opening, moving thread for me and I really appreciate your perspectives. I didn't know ahead of time, personally, so I can't give an answer from my own experience... but I can say after working with/being present for/etc many cases where moms knew ahead of time, it really varies. Many feel like they'd rather be put to sleep and have the baby cut out, just to "get it over with", but the reality is there's no medical reason to put the mother through the excess risk of a cesarean section and recovery (not to mention the risk it applies to future pregnancies and births) and, to be really cold, the risk of birth complications to the baby is nonexistent... so you have to think of the risk to the mother instead. I think it's a completely natural reaction; fight or flight. You want to run as far away from the pain of grief as possible, prolong your contact with it. It's terrifying. Grieving the loss of your child feels like drowning in a dark ocean: you want to breach the surface and you're running out of air, but you don't know which way is up.

Many other moms either resign themselves to the pain of birth, or have even felt empowered by it: this was a chance to give birth and experience a life-affirming act, to truly bring your baby through this world and into the next with your own body. The whole circle opens and closes within the safety of your womb, surrounded by your love and your need for them. For a lot of women, this was a healing experience and it helped them greatly to have a foothold to move forward.
Grief is a very intimately personal thing, and if I've learned one important thing from working with parents all these years it's that there's no wrong way to grieve your loss. I've seen parents laughing with family and celebrating life. I've seen parents so lost they couldn't even speak for days, or weeks. Nowadays it really bothers me when I see others, or especially media, nitpicking someone's grief... like they didn't look "sad enough", or laughed too hard at a joke too quickly, etc. Grief isn't a straight line, it's wibbly-wobbly-griefy-weify and all over the place and no one comes into it knowing what to do with themselves, so criticizing how someone is muddling through is a really shit thing to do. I'm so sorry for your loss. You sound like an incredible person -- very kind and empathetic. Thank you for sharing your experience and for being there for the people who also went through it.  wibbly-wobbly-griefy-weify

This made me giggle in the midst of your emotional post. Thank you for the information. You made me cry, and then sort of fixed it with a Doctor Who reference. Fantastic. My spouse and I lost a baby a few days after it was born and everything you said is very true and accurate, especially the grieving period that people may live very differently. &gt; or have even felt empowered by it: this was a chance to give birth and experience a life-affirming act, to truly bring your baby through this world and into the next with your own body. The whole circle opens and closes within the safety of your womb, surrounded by your love and your need for them. For a lot of women, this was a healing experience and it helped them greatly to have a foothold to move forward.

This is one of the most beautiful things I've ever read. This is beautiful. This was so moving and so kind. Thank you for this. God, rip my heart out. I am so sorry you (and any mother ever) had to go through that. I admire that you work with others in a similar position, I'm sure it helps to have someone on their side who knows. Sending hugs. I agree totally about that grieving part. When I had my grandmother die, even though I was close to her, I didn't cry at all, and had to force myself to look sad. 
Btw, I'm really sorry for your loss, can't even imagine. I know a few people to go through stillbirths, and one that had to have a  termination at around 6 months. My first thoughts, were that I would never want to give birth naturally and that I'd want to have a c-section, even if awake and just anaesthetised. In the UK, elective c-sections aren't the done thing for live births, let alone anything else, unless you're Victoria Beckham or have private coverage. So I guess my question is, if someone were adamant enough that they wanted a section, would they be permitted by the doctors? I imagine so, yes - because elective cesareans are very very common in North America, particularly the US, regardless of the risk. I had a stillborn too and the way you have described it brought tears to my eyes. Thank you. I agree with this other commenter- you sound like a great person. Beautifully put. It was shitty, for me. I laboured in a room where I could hear other mothers screaming down the hallway, and tried to hide my bump under a puffy jacket so that no one would see and comment. I demanded all the drugs, then vomited everywhere, got the shakes and regretted it. I made sort of black jokes throughout it all to cope. I think, in a way, I appreciated the physical pain as it resonated with what was going on inside. Giving birth was my goodbye to him. I was afraid of what he'd look like, though. Thankfully, other than a small rubbed patch on his wrist caused by rough lace on his crappy gown, he looked perfect. I was young - three weeks before my 21st birthday - and hadn't had a lot of time to think about what a 29-week dead baby would look like, and I briefly wondered whether I'd be birthing a monster. It wasn't a great entry into motherhood. I was also put in a room next to a bunch of other moms. Their "dead baby room" was being renovated, so instead of being in a private area I was smack-dab in the middle of the nursery ward. To be honest I'm still not totally sure how I feel about it: sometimes it felt ok and other times it felt like a slap in the face. The worst was having all these nurses come into the room all bright and happy, then glancing at the chart and watching their faces fall every time like, "Oh shit, it's THAT one". 

Don't feel bad about how you felt. Really. I've yet to meet a mom who *wasn't* scared to see their baby. I was too. One of the most intense memories I have of that night is seeing his little cot rolled into my room (I was unconscious for the birth) and seeing the little blue cap and having this instant panic attack. I wanted to run and hide but I was sore, drugged up and tied to the walls with what seemed like hundreds of wires. I was absolutely terrified I would look at my baby - this dead body - and see only death and decay. When the nurse lifted him up and handed him to me my mind was absolutely screaming in terror and yet at the same time I was reaching out for him and then when I realized he just looked... normal, it was both relieving and somehow even scarier. I expected to be able to recognize death, you somehow want it to be horrible and disgusting so you can separate yourself from it, but it isn't like that at all. It's an odd thing, isn't it? I kept expecting my son to wake up. I had him beside my bed that night and thought it must all have been a bad dream. I was in the dead baby room, the one with the print of one of Raphael's angels on the wall, which was at the end of the hallway...walls were pretty thin, though. I was young and hadn't had time to process any of it - I don't feel bad for thinking as I did, just a bit silly, but understandable in the circumstances. 

What *does* make me angry, all these years later, is that they refused to let us take our tiny wrapped bundle through the main doors of maternity and the hospital, using the justification that it 'might upset other mothers'. They bundled us out a back door by the laundry where an elderly relative tripped and fell on the stairs. Everyone I've spoken to since then has thought that their decision was justified, but fuck them, and every fucked up aspect of our culture that enabled that decision. It just goes to show what pariahs grief makes of people in Western society. Any new mother, on the remote chance that they saw us and realised what was going on, should have felt relieved that it wasn't her.

Before taking him to the funeral home, we put him in a Moses basket in the car and drove him around the city - to 'see' the sea for the first and last time and the ducks in the pond at the park. While we were there, this woman saw us standing by the lake. She looked at our baby and remarked on how beautiful he was. I don't believe in angels, but she's the closest I've ever seen to one. There I was, a few weeks shy of 21, eyes red from sobbing and carrying a basket with a dead premature infant, and she stops to admire him, like it's just what anyone would do. 

I wish everyone had been so kind. The treatment I received then - and after my subsequent baby was born - was the reason I birthed my next two children at home.   Wow, I'm with you, fuck those guys. I've been with two separate families who had premature babies who were going to be taken off life support, and they wanted to let their babies see the outside world before they died and the staff absolutely fascilitated that. One time it was cold, miserable, windy, and they didn't bat an eye. We all went out together with their baby after she'd been unhooked, went out front, sat on benches and cried together while she passed away. There are sick and dying people in hospitals every single day and no one seems to mind as much if the terminal cancer patient goes outside to be with family during their final hours?... If it helps make someone more comfortable, and it harms no one, what is really the problem here? Jesus.

Unfortunately I also had a very, very negative experience with my loss at the hospital... and like you I also chose home birth for my subsequent children. Two home VBACs after a traumatic cesarean and loss, and they were very healing experiences for me. I hope yours were, too. &lt;3 I wish my hospital had been like that. I'm no longer with the father of my first two children, and he's keen to get a headstone to put on our son's grave, and honestly I don't care anymore - I've moved away and it's just a shell; just a hole in the ground. I never thought I'd feel that way, but I do. If there's one thing I'd really like to do for him it would be to change the culture.

I'm glad you had healing experiences afterwards! Mine were too, ultimately - I had two unassisted births following the two negative hospital experiences. My favourite was with my middle child - I felt so ready and I knew he was coming, even though I was only 38 weeks to the day. Rocked him out to Underworld's 'Born Slippy'. I had a wonderfully supportive midwife, she just got there about four minutes too late, through no fault of her own. I was surrounded by family and friends. 

My last child's birth was more difficult - I went to her due date after a lot of false starts. She was born when my middle one was only 16 months old, which was pretty stressful. Family were fighting, and I think the atmosphere was such that I held her in for longer. I'd moved out to a small country town, so my sister and close friend couldn't be there and I couldn't have the midwife I'd loved so much with my son. Despite wanting the support (and medical attention on hand if needed) I made the decision late in pregnancy to not call my midwife to the birth, as I had an intense dislike/distrust of her. The placenta got stuck for a good couple of hours which interfered with newborn cuddles. I got a severe cold right after she was born and I couldn't smell her newborn smell and kept feeling like I was going to pass out. She was colicky (which I later realised was due to a pretty decent tongue-tie and gulping air). So it was disappointing and less than ideal - but it was my experience, I chose it within the limited options I had, I own it and I've made my peace with it.    In a strange coincidence, my first birth after loss was *also* an unassisted birth! Though I chose a midwife for the next one, and really lucked out with an amazing one that I developed a very deep friendship with. 

I get what you're saying about the shell. We had our son cremated, and I have most of his ashes in a little silver box, and some in the original cardboard box it came in because they couldn't quite all fit and I had no idea what to do with them. I felt, and continue to feel, strangely detached about it. The day I picked up the ashes and picked them out the box in a little ziploc bag it was a weird emptiness. I absolutely could not parse how THAT was my son. 
Though some months ago my toddler managed to get to the box while I was in the bathroom and somehow tear through the four layers of packing tape and open it up... onto the carpet. Having to collect it all back up and seeing little bones and recognizing what parts they belonged to was probably one of the worst moments I've had since his death. All I wanted to do was have all his bones so I could put them in order and ... I don't even know... look at them or something? It's the only time I felt any sort of attachment to his ashes. I was a mess for days and days after that. Fuck! Oh fuck. That's awful :/ I can't imagine dealing with that. I always believed that human ashes were fine, like those in the fireplace. When we scattered my grandma, they were coarser than I'd imagined, but no discernible bones. I just can't even imagine what I'd do - nothing seems 'right'. Probably vacuum after I'd picked most of it up and then have some ceremony involving planting a rose bush on the vacuum cleaner bag, but even that just sounds wrong. What an unholy nightmare. I get the feeling of wanting to 'look'. It's part of remembering, isn't it? I wanted to hold my son again. It pained me that I couldn't remember how big he was or what his weight felt like in my arms. I was so high on pethidine that I was spinning in and out of consciousness for the first time, the only time, I held him just in my arms. There's a company that make dolls in the weights and likenesses of deceased babies, but I just couldn't do that either - it would feel like fetishising my grief. I'll hate pethidine for as long as I live for what it took from me. 

I met an amazing woman on my grief journey. Her 10-month-old had strangled in her cot and she was the one who made the call to stop resus after the paramedics said that she'd be severely handicapped if she lived at that point - she realised she was never getting her daughter back. She went on to have several more children and told a story about how her 7-year-old would take the urn from the mantelpiece and 'play board games' with her sister, as though she was an imaginary friend. I was in awe then - I wanted to be like her, as 'cool' with my grief as she was. I guess I'm there now - it's been a long road.

I'm not sure whether burial is really any better. I couldn't comprehend cremation at the time, even though it's more compatible with my environmental views. And I guess, given I was separated, we'd have had to split the ashes as well? Or scatter them somewhere. That would have messed me up. But man, in the early days, we spent every night at the cemetery and leaving him there was hard. I had a lot of crazy nightmares at that time - I'd imagine him decaying in the ground, I'd dream about digging him up and hiding him in my closet while cop cars came after me, lights and sirens going. You end up in some weird places. My heart broke...I'm so sorry. I'm glad you and your son met the woman by the lake... Me too. I wish I knew who she was. I'm sure she has no idea what it meant to us. It's been 12 years...I hope she's had a wonderful life since then. This hit me in the guts somehow.

That someone in the midst of their happiness has to be shielded for the harsh realities that you and your family had to go trough, to the extent where you got alienated? It is not right.

I am sorry for your loss, and in some ways, even more sorry for the way you was treated. Nature does as nature wants, people, that is paid to support and care? Should behave with some compassion. Thanks for the validation. I've been treated like a crazy person for more than a decade - even by other bereaved parents - for feeling that way. I actually posed as a midwifery student a few years back to try to get some information out of the hospital on whether it was an official policy or just common practice, as I suspect it violates higher-up Government policy on health and cultural sensitivity, but they smelled a rat even though I was incredibly careful with my wording. It was clear to me that they had something to hide. I've considered making an Official Information Act inquiry, which they're legally obligated to respond to, but it means dredging up unpleasant stuff so I've just...put it off. I hate to think of families being treated like lepers even now. That's what hurts the most sometimes - reading notices in the paper and realising that every day, more and more families go through this terrible thing, and that their grief journeys are just beginning.

I honestly don't think anyone would have noticed us. Most of the women there are in rooms, and few people are going to peer too closely at a bundled baby. It was more about the hospital staff, I felt at the time - *their* disgust, discomfort, contempt for us, while all the while they claimed to care, wrung their hands sympathetically and told us how sorry they were. That burned. And even if they did see - is it really going to mar their happiness, or make them more grateful? Perhaps I'm the only terrible person on this planet who drives past an accident scene and thinks, "God, that's horrible. *But I'm glad it wasn't us.*" and goes home to hug my family. First, I'm so sorry for your loss. And no, you're not the only one. I'm just like that. And if I was a mother in the hospital and saw a mother walking out with her stillborn, I'd go and tell her how brave she is. I'll be sorry it happened to her and happy it didn't happen to me. Thank you. I lost my son at 34 weeks gestation. they induced my labor right after discovering he had passed, but I was in labor for 36 hours.  i was mostly (emotionally) numb that entire time.  my brain could not wrap itself around what was really happening.  i knew I'd be giving birth to my dead baby, but part of me kept thinking he'd somehow be alive.   There was a recent blog post about a mother who went through this, I would give it a read, very insightful. 
http://www.sincerelyskin.ca/blog/2015/04/13/born-still-but-still-born/ I have two kids, and while I was pregnant with each of them, I had two separate friends experience a still birth (one at 26 weeks, and the other at 32 weeks). I was honestly convinced that someting terrible would happen, and Im just so thankful that my boys were okay. This was so hard to read but im glad you have shared your knowledge and experience. Im sorry to hear you had to go through that but in glad you're helping others. Ive always wanted to become a midwife but still births will be hard. Im a mother and I could never image that pain but I hope I can help to give families a few special memories with their baby. 

I have seen photos of 2 very different still born babies because 2 of my friends have been through this and loved to share the few photos they had with anyone who would look. I dont mind looking because those babies where their perfect little babies and who wouldn't want to show them off. I guess it was more for them but im glad I read this because neither of them looked dead. One looked fine in the photo and the other just looked bruised with darker skin. I guess im a little more prepared now for what will/could really happen. Wow, thank you so much for your answer.  Thank you for sharing. That must've been a devastating experience. You helped me through some personal shit I'm going through right now. So, for what it's worth, thanks. Thank you for the detailed response, and I'm so sorry for your loss :( I want to become a volunteer photographer that does memorial photography for stillborn babies. Is there anything I need to know with regard to handling, posing, and capturing stillborns on camera? To be honest I'm kind of terrified about touching them...they seem so fragile :( First of all, good for you! Join up if you think you can. And if you can't handle being in the room, there are many other places you can be to help out in grief organizations. More people are always needed. 

If you're thinking of joining with Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep, they have regular training seminars all over the states (and a bit in Canada), and they also provide you with forum access to discuss with other volunteers, counselors and coordinators, as well as a large book that gives instructions, tips, ideas, etc. 
This is what I do, or started out doing anyway (and still do, I just branched further from it), and I personally don't do posing, backdrops, etc. I find it really upsetting for most parents in those first hours, so what I do instead is come in and spend some time quietly appreciating and feeling with them before I even start the photography. From there it's just a matter of going with the "feel" of the room. 99% of the time it's as-is photos of parents just having their moments together, and I try very hard to be as unobtrusive to their process as humanely possible. I don't use big flashing lights (having a good camera with high ISO capability is key for this, as well as some nice fast prime lenses. My 60mm macro is excellent for this) or props or any of that because it starts to feel very invasive and cheap for many parents. I offer it, if the feel seems right, but no one has ever wanted it. About half the parents want photos with them, and the other half just want me by myself with the baby. I focus the most on detail shots (fingers, knuckles, ears, spiral of hair, etc) and those are the most appreciated. That's incredible. Thanks for what you do. I work in an ER and we had a young woman (actually a healthcare worker) who had a stillbirth very far along, and then went into serious medical distress herself. We would have been completely out of the water if the incredible team from the NICU didn't help facilitate everything... those are some of the deepest emotions I can imagine. I have a Canon Rebel with a 50mm lens and a 24mm lens in addition to the default. I also have a speedlite flash attachment with a diffuser and some gels that go over it. Do you think I'll be able to pull off the right looks with those? I think I'm the most nervous about the portfolio review process when I apply and I'm doubting all my "cheap" gear, lol. 

Yes, I'm thinking of working with NILMDTS :) i signed up for their Webinar this week and once I work up the nerve to send in some of my work I'll go apply. 

Hearing that i don't need to worry about props/posing is a big relief, i like what you said about being unobtrusive and just being there with the family while they have their moments together. I personally have not ever had a child, let alone lost one, but I think NILMDTS is a great cause and I want to help. Thank you so much for your advice, it is very appreciated! :) The 50 will be more flattering, and you'll probably find you'll use that one the most, I think. Like any aspect of photography, it's the skill and not the gear that makes it good photography, so if you're an accomplished and experienced photographer then you have nothing to worry about and will do just fine. Professional gear helps, of course, but it's not the pans and the knives that cooked your four star meal. ;) Great! I've done a LOT of close-up work with my good ol' 50mm and it really is a great little lens. It will be perfect for capturing the details of tiny little fingers and toes. Do you find that you use a tripod much, if at all?  Very rarely, which is why I say the ISO capability is probably a good investment if you can do it. I generally only take out my speedlite when I'm on my own with the baby (I don't want to disturb the parents with constant flashes), and I try to use window light as much as possible otherwise. I'll ask if I can open the blinds a little before I'll bring out a flash or tripod, simply because I want to remain as "in the background" as I can. That's a very good idea. What do you do when you're shooting at night? Also what ISO do you typically use? Thanks for answering my million questions :) I try and use the lowest ISO I can get away with using, just for image quality purposes. I use a Nikon D700 but have used a D300 up until pretty recently and I find that Nikon handles iso pretty well. I try not to put the shutter speed down much lower than 1/30 because camera shake is too much of an issue. Shoot in RAW and process in Lightroom so you can do your best to salvage slightly underexposed images if you get any. 
The times it's been super dark, and I couldn't get away with shooting as is, I've asked if I can set up a speedlite in the corner. I use remote triggering and put it on a cupboard or dresser and aim at the ceiling so I just get a bit of fill to bring up the shadows without blinding anyone.  You can also use light painting with a pen light or sunpak, which gives a very nice ethereal feel to the images if done well (practice lots before attempting this, of course). I am not going to address the more specific things here, but I want to mention something that should be common knowledge among anyone that deals with people. Please, keep your soaps and similar unscented. We had a nurse around when my granddad passed, that was clearly fresh out of the shower. Wonderful woman, but her shampoo made me physically ill for a day.

For your own sake? Find a way to debug yourself afterwards. Games, a movie, or whatever suits you well. Grief is straining to deal with, and a outlet is good to have. I just want to say how wonderful it is that you've taken what you learned from your own horrible experience to help other families going through the same thing. That was truly chilling, and your account makes me thank my lucky stars I haven't gone through that, and you've also opened my eyes to the realities that many unfortunate women and families go through. Thank you (I think).  Thank you for sharing.
I am sorry for your loss. This is a fantastic reply.  I wish you and your baby didn't have to go through that but thanks for sharing.   Thanks for taking the time to talk about this. I had no idea about the horrors of miscarriage that aren't really talked about.  I cannot imagine the pain you have gone through to be able to provide such a thorough and eloquent response. I am so sorry for your loss. 

You are an amazing person to relive your heartache over and over for the sake of helping others through their tragedies.  I am so sorry for your loss and the loss of those other mothers. What a truly devastating thing to go through :( Thank you for explaining it all in such a respectful and informative way.
Please forgive me for asking this, but what does "birth" smell like?? It's really hard to describe. If you've ever smelled a newborn baby head, you'll find it rather sweet, light and... somehow very comforting. It's a thick smell and yet not overpowering or offensive. Birth has that same smell, but a little stronger. You don't smell the blood, but you do often smell the vernix (the cheesey white covering that helps protect the skin) and while it can look rather gross the smell is very sweet and mild. Amniotic fluid also tends to have a sweet smell. Smelling a new baby has a very powerful mental aspect that's difficult to describe, like it sort of sets off all these "I like this" bells in your brain so it's more of a visceral experience. A lot of women in particular describe it as very literally mouth-watering, but not in an "eating" way, more like a "I must kiss and nibble this" way. I have never known a parent, particularly a female parent, who didn't feel an absolutely overpowering urge to nom on their baby... and yet have no idea why. Maybe a long shot but animals have a natural instinct to lick their newborns clean after giving birth. Could be related...? That's actually a good theory; I've never thought about that but it would make sense! Especially since the urge stays throughout babyhood but tends to fade once they're toddlers and preschoolers.  The way you described that is so absolutely beautiful. Wow. You have a way of expressing yourself which is an absolute joy to read. Thank you for sharing that. I have a huge smile on my face now. I cannot wait to have a child. I know that nom nom feeling - I had it with my nieces and nephew. I cannot imagine how incredibly overpowering and all consuming it will be when it's my own child. Thank you for sharing! :) Thank you for providing this information. Still birth and miscarriage are so rarely spoken about, and you provided me with a lot of knowledge I didn't have before. I'm sorry for your loss. I hope you're doing well now. It's really nice of you to reach out to talk about these topics, because they effect so many people in our population, though it must be difficult to discuss.  Thank you so much for sharing your experience and insight, and for opening your heart to those that need it. This was a very affecting read. You gave such a great answer for something that is so rarely talked about. Thank you. I really don't know how I could give my baby to someone knowing that I'll never hold it again because it isn't alive, but at the same time, eventually I would have to. It must be, without question, the worst sadness anyone could ever feel. I'm so sorry you had to go through it.  Thank you for being so informative. Also I am sorry for your loss. I can't imagine how painful it must have been. You must be a godsend to the woman you help in the hospital who also experience this trama, so thank you! This was the only thing that made me cringe so hard. I cannot even imagine... I am sorry for your loss and you're stronger than I would've for helping others in the same position.  This was so heartbreaking to read. I'm so sorry you went through that. I think it's a wonderful thing to turn your grief into care of other families. Thank you for doing that difficult work. Thank you very much for sharing your experience.

Your prose was also quite lovely and moving. You are an amazing person to help these women in their time of need just like you were helped. I am a combat medic and your answer made me squirm. Honest, precise answer. But some things are never easy to hear/read. 
Edit: so sorry for your loss.  :( all I can think of is my poor mother and my twin brothers Jeremy and Joshua. Still born about a little more than a year before I was born.  I almost cried. I can't imagine what this must be like. Thank you for answering. 

My son is asleep on my breast, at the moment. I feel like holding him extra close to me. I'm so incredibly grateful he came out healthy.

I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm glad you're able to help others. I am so sorry for your loss. I could not even imagine having to go through that. Thank you for helping others, you sound like an incredible person.   That's the worse thing I've read in my fucking life. Wow. Such an amazing post. I can't even fathom what you must have went through at the time.

Thank you for sharing your story. I hope by doing so you're that little bit more at peace with the loss of your son. We REALLY need to pay nurses and midwives more Strongly agreed. Where I'm from (Canada), midwives have the highest burnout rate, and it's no wonder given how incredibly hard they work and how little they get from the government and medical community by comparison to other doctors. :( This is why I volunteer for NILMDTS. Absolutely on of the most rewarding thing I do with my life. This makes me quite sad... I am so sorry for your loss.  My best friend just went through a similar situation and lost the baby in her 8th month.  It took a much larger toll on me than I had expected and I can't even begin to imagine how it felt to her.  I did hold the baby, and I can tell you that I felt the same way - that he would take a breath at any moment.  It was sadly surreal.  I hope you never have to experience a situation like that again! This all sounds terrible. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. My mom gave birth to my little sister and her stillborn twin brother and she was kind of in shock for a couple weeks. She'd just kinda sit there and stared into the distance. I'm really glad I can't give birth. Sounds like a really traumatic experience if there's any complications.  That was a really good answer. Sorry for everything you've been through, but thanks on behalf of the asker. How awful. I'm so sorry for your loss. Has it been healing for you to work with families going through similar experiences?

My mom had threw miscarriages before she had me, and was never able to get pregnant again after me. I know she's never talked to anyone about it - I only know about the miscarriages because my dad told me. I often wonder if it is something I should bring up and talk about with her... But it was 30 years ago and it might still be too painful. Or she might never want to talk about it.  I find it very healing. It's not that it's not difficult or emotional, I cry almost every time, but it still find it helpful to be able to take a part of that pain that I've gone through and use it to ease someone else's. 
If I can give someone something that I didn't have, and desperately wanted; a hand to hold during the worst of it, photographs that aren't difficult to look at or share, the shoulder of someone who has gone through it before and won't give you bullshit like "time heals all wounds"...  than that gift of ignorance is worth a lot to me. And selfishly, it feels better in the bad times to know you're not alone and you don't have to suffer in silence. Child loss is this weird thing that absolutely nobody talks about, but when it happens to you, all of a sudden all these people are popping out of the woodwork to say, "Hey that happened to me" and you're left wondering why the hell you never knew. It's so taboo, and we have this weird culture of fragility around pregnancy that tells us you can never let a pregnant woman know that death exists or she might somehow "catch" it. It leads to feeling very, very alone in your grief... and so being involved in grief work helps everyone at least a little. &gt;skin slippage


Noped my way out of that comment real quick after that mental image Sucks , I have no knowledge to compensate the turmoil that you must of felt .

As a 16 year old male , I still learn everyday , what life is.

I want to know more about it , there are corners that are endless walls in every way of life ; I believe yours is one . 

Why? I have no idea . Sorry for your loss . 

But I feel as if sorry is just a dumb word we use to express our sympathy ...  Damn, have you had to answer this on an exam in essay format as well? Haha, no, but perhaps I'll save it in case I do one day? :)  I figure it's better to give more detail, especially about a topic that so few people talk about. This is really harrowing. Jesus Christ that sounds horrible. 

It also reminds me of the cockroach man from men in black, but in a much darker tone.  I'm sorry for your loss.  Well....that's horrifying. I didn't want kids before but now I don't want them even more out of fear of this shit You deserve gold for this. When my paycheck kicks in, I'll give it to you. 

RemindMe! April 20th With all respect, I really hope your username isn't relevant to this question. I hope you're feeling better now.  That legitimately made me snortlaugh. No no, the username is actually in response to trying over and over to log into my first account, giving up and finally making a new one.  How do you deal with it? How did you deal with your first one? I'm assuming it gets easier over time but damn.  First one... I'm not sure what you're referring to. First loss? Or first time I was present for someone else's? When I worked at a hospital they kept the stillborn babies in the garbage/dirty utility room as well. I was horrified the first time I walked in to collect dirty items and see a baby just hanging out on top of the freezer where they store the placenta. The nurse didn't even bother closing the door so anyone walking by could see the baby.

Shortly after that, the nurses were required to put a sign with a butterfly on the door so we knew not to go in. There was something rather insulting about having to photograph the little babies in a room next to boxes of broken glass and soiled linens. After some time I finally worked up the gumption to ask if I could move the babies to another room for photographing, and got permission to use the "nursing room" instead. I am so sorry for your loss. A highschool friend of mine posted pictures of her stillborn baby on Facebook, to commemorate the anniversary of its death.  All these photos of this little purple baby and her family taking turns holding it while crying.  I can understand taking the photos and taking the time to look at them, to remember their stillborn baby and all, but Jesus, why post them publicly on Facebook? :( &gt; when I held him I spent a long time just sort of waiting for him to take a breath

Well I cried. I am so, so sorry for your loss. Thank you for commenting on this. How about the taste Not as good as people who troll threads about child loss; they're a delicacy.  TIL: lots of sad things. Thanks.  Wow, as psychopathic as I am, that made me kind of feel weird. I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing this with us. It's one of those things you never hear/read about and in a very disturbing way, it was actually interesting. Thank you,that was a very informable answer. I wish that nobody has to experience that kind of loss. Wow thank you for writing that up. It was truly fascinating and will help me if I ever have to provide care to someone in this situation. What sort of volunteer work do you do? And much love to you. &lt;3 I started off with Now I Lay me Down to Sleep, then branched off when I made some very deep bonds with a few of the women I met through the work. We founded a grief group together (the only one in the area), and from there my name got passed around a lot and I started getting calls from social workers and midwives to come and talk to women who were having a hard time with their grief, were new to the area and had no one to talk to, etc... Over the years I've met dozens and dozens of little babies, been present for births and babies turned off life support, gone to close to a dozen homes and sat and talked with parents for hours, I've given presentations to hospital staff and helped bring forward improvements to social work and grief care in hospital. I've even attended a memorial service or two, and was incredibly honoured to have been trusted enough to be present. Even my husband has come forward to offer his shoulder to other dads from time to time. 

It sounds pretty wrong to say I enjoy the work, because it's so devastating and sad, but I do on some level because I want to be able to help others... and in turn it helps me. It feels good to know you're not alone in the dark with that pain. I just started with Angel Gowns. They make gowns out of old wedding dresses for babies who have passed in the hospital. I'm not great at it yet, but I am learning. I've not experienced a loss, personally, but we are all mothers who love their children and zi wanted to help in some way. Time to leave this post.  Is it common to have mothers hold their stillborn babies? I've never been in that situation, so it seems so strange to me.  Very common. Regardless of whether or not they have passed, they are still your child. A child you may have prayed for, hoped and wished for, prepared for and built a life around. To have that ripped away from you is devastating, and is a pain that never, ever leaves. It changes you forever. You're a mother with no child, and at the end of your time giving birth all you'll have left is empty arms. Being able to hold, touch, kiss and say goodbye to your baby is an important part of being able to move forward. I'm 5 months pregnant with my first baby, I really need to stop reading this thread about still births, miscarriages and people wishing they would have had abortions.  &gt; If the baby has been handled by care workers before being given to the mother, sometimes they'll douse it with weird smelling soaps and shit and that can be a rather offensive smell (if you are a care worker or staff member reading this: please don't ever do this, ok? It really fucks up the grieving experience for mothers. We want our babies to smell like themselves). 

While I don't doubt that it would be a difficult experience, having been friends with a couple medical professionals, they absolutely do not do things for no reason. If they're using these products, there is a good reason for it, and it's probably your health.

 This is probably the first one that is *actually* terrible. I had two perfectly normal daughters and pregnancies. My 3rd pregnancy and 3rd daughter was normal, except I was much sicker and had to inject nausea medication daily. I went for my 24 week ultrasound and my obgyn started the ultrasound and quickly looked stressed. I knew by watching the ultrasound something was wrong. He told me she no longer had a heart beat. They called my mom and sister for me author me knowing( since my husband wad in class and want answering his phone) I immediately went to the hospital. I was in labor 3 days after starting pitocin. I finally had her vaginally on my 28th birthday. We share a birthday. They gave me dilaudid for labor, since the meds couldn't hurt the baby. I chose not to have a epidural. Since she was only 1 lb,  I didn't have to be dilated all the way, just to7cm. She ended up coming out breach and was stuck in my cervix. The Dr had to inject numbing meds right into my cervix and then try to open it with forcepts. He was amazing and said he wad doing all he could to get her delivered without damaging her. She did end up having a tear on her scalp. We held her for hours as did everyone in our family. We took tons if pictures. The hospital experience was sad. The door to my room had a black sign on it warning housekeeping and other workers this was not a normal delivery. She had a normal smell and looked just like a tiny baby. It was a very, very traumatic experience, especially hearing other babies crying in the next rooms Omg, I'm so sorry. Thank you for your response.  My first born was stillborn  (he passed away at 1day shy of 32 weeks gestation). When my water broke it did smell kinda off (I kept thinking I could smell it for weeks afterwards). Labour was just as difficult with him as with my second son but delivery was a lot easier even though my first was breach (he was a lot smaller).

The emotional pain of a stillborn baby is the worst though the birth of our second son has provided a lot of healing. Were you given a cause of death? I've heard other parents say that waters that smell 'off' are a sign of infection. I never found out why my son died, and wondered if infection could have been the cause, but my amniotic fluid just had that normal 'mousy' smell. It was a cord accident. I was told the smell was due to the start of decomposition. It just smelled different than where my second son was born.  I'm so sorry. Thank you.

The birth of my second son, and being able to raise him, has been very healing for me. As it has been for me. I'm happy to hear that. I'm glad you're healing too. :) The top rated comment is a bit misleading. The baby certainly can smell. Depending on how long it has been since the baby passed it can begin to decompose and all the things that come with it are present including foul Smell. The baby can be deteriorated and it can be really traumatic.

Source: am an EMT This doesn't answer the question directly but...

Our firstborn came out followed by the placenta.  It smelled funky to the doctor and she sent it straight to the lab.  Wife spiked a fever almost instantly.  Placenta was infected with something. How did that happen? Was your wife okay? Not sure how it happened or why it didn't fuck the kid up.  The placenta just kinda flopped out, like they do, the doctor took a whiff and sent it straight to pathology.  My wife went down with a fever *immediately*.  It was very freaky seeing that fever hit her so fast but they pumped her with antibiotics and she recovered quickly.

We were mainly concerned about the kid strangling on her cord and inhaling amniotic fluid.  The medical staff was calm and cool as gangsters.  Threw the baby on another bed and started beating the shit out of her.  It was all very surreal.  I was worried about my wife, she was worried about the baby and everyone else acted like it was no thing while the doctor sewed her up (not a Cesarean, she just cut the taint open a bit, Jesus that's horrible even writing that out).  

All was well in the end.  The little fucking monster is 2 and sleeping the sleep of the just in her new bed tonight.  We were only in the hospital and extra 2-3 days while they checked the baby out.  Doing this all again around the first of [July](http://i.imgur.com/yIV6DtR.jpg).   They definitely smell the same and feel the same to hold. No rigor mortis. My stillbirth was with my first and at 29 weeks, so not full term. It was by far my hardest birth and I was doped to the eyeballs, which I now regret - it's a rough time to find out that opiates don't agree with you. I have no idea whether it was physically harder because it was a first birth, because he was small and perhaps not positioned properly, or because he was dead and wasn't helping with the birth process, but it took 12 hours (as opposed to 1hr 45 - 3 1/2 hours for the other three) and it was brutal. I get pretty pissed off when people talk about the baby's size as though it really has much to do with the pain of labour. &gt; or because he was dead

i just felt my stomach shrivel up Honestly, it's still pretty rare. People feel more able to talk about it these days. My uncle was stillborn back in 1941 due to a mismanaged birth, and my grandma didn't even get to see him. Brah My friend gave birth to her son still born last year. He had died at some point the day before. His face was pretty bruised and he was blue with darker spots. All of the ones I've known to be born sleeping look similar.  Wait, babies can be born sleeping??  That's what stillborn babies are often called. 

Do not search that on YouTube. You will find the saddest videos ever.  Oh...I'm sorry, my question is so stupid. I feel like an ass now. No question is stupid. It sounds weird the first time people hear it. I remember looking it up when I was younger because it made no sense.  oh what the FUCK dude, there's a SMELL? I swear to god every single new detail I hear about pregnancy/childbirth brings me one step closer to voluntary sterilization.  Seriously.

As a forever-virgin, what is this smell you people keep talking about? Babies do poop and pee in the womb, so maybe that in addition to how long the baby was in there after it died..  When my water broke with my overdue daughter, poop and pee came out too.  She was fine. Any time there are bodily fluids involved, there's going to be a smell. If nothing else, the blood smells. I know that this is what this thread is about, but.. god damn this is a fucking awful question :( How about the taste triggered Go file a complaint on Tumblr. what would happen if i cut off someones butt cheeks, i am totally serious, would they be able to live without an ass?
