[{"body": "Solar physicist here.\n\nThe Sun is immensely loud.  The surface generates thousands to tens of thousands of watts of sound power for every square meter.  That's something like 10x to 100x the power flux through the speakers at a rock concert, or out the front of a police siren.  Except the \"speaker surface\" in this case is the entire surface of the Sun, some 10,000 times larger than the surface area of Earth.\n\nDespite what /u/Bigetto said, we do in fact know what the Sun \"sounds\" like -- instruments like SDO's HMI or SOHO's MDI or the ground-based GONG observatory measure the Doppler shift everywhere on the visible surface of the Sun, and we can actually *see* sound waves (well, infrasound waves) resonating in the Sun as a whole!  Pretty effing cool, eh?  Since the Sun is large, the sound waves resonate at very deep frequencies -- typical resonant modes have 5 minute periods, and there are about a million of them going all at once.\n\nThe resonant modes in the Sun are excited by something.  That something is the tremendous broadband rushing of convective turbulence.  Heat gets brought to the surface of the Sun by convection -- hot material rises through the outer layers, reaches the surface, cools off (by radiating sunlight), and sinks.  The \"typical\" convection cell is about the size of Texas, and is called a \"granule\" because they look like little grains when viewed through a telescope.  Each one (the size of Texas, remember) rises, disperses its light, and sinks *in five minutes*. That produces a Hell of a racket.  There are something like 10 million of those all over the surface of the Sun at any one time.  Most of that sound energy just gets reflected right back down into the Sun, but some of it gets out into the solar chromosphere and corona.  None of us (professional solar physicists) can be sure, yet, just how much of that sound energy gets out, but it's most likely between about 30 and about 300 watts per square meter of surface, on average.  The uncertainty comes because the surface dynamics of the Sun are tricky.  In the deep interior, we can pretend the solar magnetic field doesn't affect the physics much and use hydrodynamics, and in the exterior (corona) we can pretend the gas itself doesn't affect the physics much.  At the boundary layers above the visible surface, neither approximation applies and the physics gets too tricky to be tractable (yet).\n\nIn terms of dBA, if all that leaked sound could somehow propagate to Earth, well let's see... Sunlight at Earth is attenuated about 10,000 times by distance (i.e. it's 10,000 times brighter at the surface of the Sun), so if 200 W/m^2 of sound at the Sun could somehow propagate out to Earth it would yield a sound intensity of about 20 mW/m^2 .  0dB is about 1pW/m^2 , so that's about 100dB.  At Earth, some 150,000,000 kilometers from the sound source.  Good thing sound doesn't travel through space, eh?\n\nThe good folks at the SOHO/MDI project created some sound files of resonant solar oscillations by speeding up the data from their instrument by 43,000 times.  You can hear those [here, at the Solar Center website](http://solar-center.stanford.edu/singing/#sing). \nSomeone else did the same thing with the SDO/HMI instrument, and [superposed the sounds on first-light videos from SDO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWCJkG31h0c).  Both of those sounds, which sound sort of like rubber bands twanging, are heavily filtered from the data -- a particular resonant spatial mode (shape of a resonant sound) is being extracted from the data, and so you hear mainly that particular resonant mode.  The actual unfiltered sound is far more cacophonous, and to the ear would sound less like a resonant sound and more like noise.", "gilded": 2, "score": 3665, "created": 1430098299.0},{"body": "Glad there's an expert here! :)\n\nHow loud is 100dB?

It works thusly: 10dB louder is 10x the energy hitting your eardrums.  \n\nYou can also think of it this way: your ability to perceive a *difference* in sound intensity worsens as the sound gets louder. In a silent room you can hear a whisper, at a rock concert you can't hear someone screaming at you. So instead of using crazy W/m^2 numbers (how loud is 0.0002W/m^2 ?), we use decibels, which make the numbers seem like we hear. In decibels, going from silent to whisper is +30dB.

Our ears work on a logarithmic scale, meaning you have to double the sound energy to perceive a relatively modest increase in volume. This enables us to hear sounds over many orders of magnitude, from rustling leaves to powerful explosions.\n\nIt's worth noting that this isn't just true for hearing.

Annoyingly though, I discovered our system for measuring sound is a bit of a bastard. The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, which makes it very nasty to graph, so scaling the dBs from a 1-megaton nuke up to the dBs produced by the 91,467,495,219 megatons the Sun is equal to was a bit much for the addled remnants of my high school Advanced Vegie maths.\nBesides that, explosions are apparently notoriously difficult to determine dBs for. The sound peaks very quickly, then trails off, and at higher dBs the sound becomes a shockwave, which behaves differently altogether.\n\nLuckily, I found that dBs can be converted to watts and vice versa. The sun produces about 3.8e+26 watts every second, or 383 yottawatts (whatta lotta yotawatts\u2026 sorry), which, as you would expect, is an absolute pants-load of energy.

Different species may have different colours or amounts of colours.\n\nImagine if your bicep was red when your arm was fully stretched outwards, and it turned blue when your hand tried to touch your shoulder.

No, they don't get tired from it.\n\nLong Answer:\nThe cells responsible for color change in cephalopods are called chromatophores.  These are cells which contain pigment.  When relaxed, if you look really closely you can still see the chromatophores with the naked eye (they look like tiny dark spots), and provide their \"natural\" color.  Typically their tissue or \"skin\" is white and the pigment within the chromatophores is reddish brown.\n\nEach cell/chromatophore has its own muscles and nerves, which provide independent control of each chromatophore.  However, this limits how much direct control cephalopods have over their own color.  The nerves react to chemical signals and I have read articles suggesting that the nerves can to some extent can detect light, which allows them to match their environment so well, even if the surface isn't within the critters line of sight (e.g., a checker board on their underside).  Once the nerves are triggered the muscles contract, stretching and flattening the chromatophore, hence producing color change.  This is similar to a water balloon, when in its relaxed position it is thicker and prevents light from pass through, but the more you stretch it the thinner it gets and the more transparent it becomes.  What is even more cool is that the muscles are attached to all sides of the spherical cell, so not only can they \"pancake\" the cell the can make different shapes!\n\nLike any muscle, the muscles attached to chromatophores have an antagonistic relationship.  When one contracts, its stretches the other in an opposing direction.  The tension from this relationship allows the muscle to reset, otherwise it would stay contacted.  Also, when relaxed the muscles well find some middle tension, but will tend to \"lean\" towards the stronger muscle.  Similar to your eyelids, where the muscle that opens you eyelids is slightly stronger, so when relaxed you eyes stay open.  Another component of cephalopod tissues and chromatophores is that they tend to be elastic, and provide energy free resistance to reset the muscles.\n\nOf course activating any muscle requires energy.  However the amount of energy requires for this is negligible.  Especially when compared to the energy requires to move, reproduce or digest food.  Have you ever heard of someone getting tired from blinking or breathing or growing new skin cells?\n\nWhat is really amazing is loads of marine organisms have chromatophores, like shrimp and fish.  These structures become really important in deeper parts of the ocean where less light reaches.  Some chromatophores can even emit light!\n\nPlease bear in mind that while they may appear similar, a chameleon's ability to change color is unrelated to cephalopods, and is really quite different.  This is referred to as convergent evolution.  This is also the term used to explain why cephalopods eyes are so complex and similar to ours, yet we share no recent ancestors.\n\nIn case you think this is a little long winded or I'm nuts, I would like to apologise.

This source generates a signal that can be represented in the frequency domain to look [something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/2oYKKel.gif) Of course, it varies based on gender and voice characteristics, etc. but it still conforms to the same general characteristics. One takeaway is that this signal is *not bandlimited*, meaning even at very high frequencies and very low frequencies, the amplitude of that tone is not zero. It may be very small, for instance, at 20 KHz it is ~50 dB lower than at 200 Hz. This corresponds to a 10^5 = 100,000 weaker signal but it still is not zero. However, for all practical purposes, we can say with high confidence that most of the energy of the human voice lies between 50 Hz and 5 KHz. Although, we like to think of human voice as being within 20Hz to 20 KHz, it's not like the amplitude of the tone at 20100 Hz suddenly becomes zero. The spectrum is continuous.\n\nNow, think of a [system](http://i.imgur.com/cVKCrzt.png) where your voice generates a signal x, an example of which is represented in the frequency domain above as *X(f)*, as a function of frequency *f*. The background noise between the source and your ear, as well the combination of multiple paths that the signal takes to get to the ear modifies the signal *x* into a new signal *y* that could be weaker or stronger on different frequency tones.\n\nThe human ear can be thought of as a decoder of this noisy signal. The reason your question doesn't have a simple yes/no answer is that this decoder is not a simple one that filters out inaudible chunks of the spectrum. Instead, it has its [own frequency dependence](http://i.imgur.com/HCFfF8B.gif). What you can deduce from this is that the hearing threshold is very much frequency selective. You would need a 1 million times (60 dB) stronger signal at 40 Hz than at 4 KHz to hear it at the same level. Does this make a 40 KHz signal audible? Now that becomes a subjective answer that depends on how you define audible. If you had large enough speakers to blast a 40 Hz tone at 60 dB higher than your normal voice, it certainly could be. [This video is pretty cool demonstration of this frequency-dependent listening threshold that sweeps from 20 Hz to 20 KHz.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNf9nzvnd1k) Clearly, if you have better speakers, you can start hearing at a lower fundamental frequency.\n\nTo summarize, there is no discrete high/low frequency cutoff, neither for the generated human voice, nor for human hearing. If you speak louder, you are effectively reducing the lower frequency cutoff of your hearing and increasing the higher frequency cutoff, thus capturing a bigger fraction of the spectrum. But, in practice, beyond some point it become irrelevant, because (1) You already captured &gt;99.9% of the voice signal energy and the remaining out-of-band chunk wouldn't increase its fidelity, (2) you would need amplify your own voice thousands of time to capture the slight remaining energy at the edges.", "gilded": 0, "score": 35, "created": 1430160921.0},{"body": "I don't think he's limiting it to voice.\nWhat about farts, stomach rumbles, etc", "gilded": 0, "score": 16, "created": 1430168156.0},{"body": "20-20k Hz is usually used to describe the limits of human hearing, not the human voice.", "gilded": 0, "score": 14, "created": 1430162844.0},{"body": "When our muscles contract, they actually pulse/vibrate somewhere below 20Hz (just below the range of human hearing).

This is still an innate immune response because receptors for PAMP's are just generally recognizing common themes in microbial structural components. Once an APC has recognized a PAMP, it will phagocytize (eat) the offending pathogen. Inside the phagocyte, the pathogen will be broken apart and some protein segments of it will be processed and be loaded onto MHC-II protein complexes. Then that loaded MHC-II will be presented on the surface for a T cell to connect to with its CD4 receptor complex. That connection will lead to T cell activation and bring in the adaptive immune system through various other processes (B cells have to be activated too).\n\nAlso, the inflammatory cascade is often (though not always) started by mast cells in tissues. These will recognize a PAMP, be activated by crosslinking of membrane-bound IgE, or will be physically damaged (such as if you cut yourself) and that will prompt them to \"degranulate.\" They'll release granules containing quite a few different chemicals including histamine and chemotactic cytokines, which will make it easier for white blood cells to cross into the tissue from the bloodstream and recruit WBC's to the site of inflammation, respectively.\n\nMacrophages can also promote inflammatory response simply by phagocytizing a pathogen they've recognized via a pattern-recognition receptor like a TLR (Toll-like receptor). They'll then release proinflammatory cytokines.\n\nIn tissue rejection, the MHC on the transplanted tissue itself acts as an antigen (rather than just holding the antigenic substance).

These peptides can come from self and from pathogens. An individual's T cells are designed to react to cells that express an MHC that binds unusually strongly. During T cell development, T cells selected that they won't bind self MHC with self peptide.

The vast majority of t-cells see the difference in structure yet assume they are self-antigens and therefore ignore the pathogen completely...however, there are some T-cells which never graduated from the t-cell academy (autoreactive) and decide that the slight difference in structure means they are foreign and proceeds to attack every single self-antigen which can do occasionally induce an autoimmune disease in the individual. \n\n\n\nAnother is **T-cell Anergy** which in laymans  terms means to incapacitate/deactivate t-cells (immune cells).

This occurs as lymphocytes develop under the direction of a larger cell, such as a dendritic cell in the lymph nodes. These cells display HLA antigens associated with host cells. Lymphocytes have two main objectives: Identify and protect \"Self\" or host cells and attack foreign cells. If a developing lymphocyte produces a receptor or antibody that targets these self antigens for attack, they are induced to undergo programmed cell death. More specifically there are HLA Antigens that nearly all host cells display to identify them as \"Self\" to active lymphocytes. Active lymphocytes are continuously patrolling their environment, transiently attaching to host cells they come into contact with. So immune cells don't only interact with foreign cells, they are constantly interacting with cells in our body to give the \"all clear.\" When transplanting organs, the goal is to find a donor whose HLA antigens most closely matches those of the recipient. When there is a mismatch of the HLA type, the transplant may be rejected by the host's immune system due to the binding of lymphocytes to the foreign HLA sequence and initiating an attack on those foreign cells. To avoid this fate, transplant recipients are often given immunosuppressant drugs which decrease the immune response to all foreign cell types, including pathogens.\nThere are two reasons that parasites escape detection. Firstly, parasites are often not located in the aqueous humor where a vast majority of lymphocytes are circulating and are thusly not subjected to the same type of survailance as transpanted tissues would experience. Second, there is only a limited type of lymphocytes that occupy the environments in which parasites thrive and these cells must have antigenic specificity for cell surface markers displayed by the parasites. These antigenic specificities are developed through a complex process involving genetic rearrangement to specific genes that develops the antigenic specificity of the antibodies or receptors produced by the lymphocyte. For instance, if the parasite was located in the intestines, only a handful of lymphocytes would interact with the parasite and if none of the lymphocytes has a receptor/antibody specific for a cell surface identifier on the parasite then the parasite would go completely unnoticed.\n\nI am a bit rusty on my immunology so don't take my word as absolute, but generally this is my understanding.", "gilded": 0, "score": 6, "created": 1429640277.0},{"body": "The simplest answer is that it tries to kill the parasites, but isn't always successful.\n\nThink of this: parasites (by which I assume you mean helminths, or parasitic worms) have evolved alongside us for millions of years, and so they've evolved mechanisms to avoid the immune system.

And even when your body does reject them, and you start getting puss, and other body mechanisms to fight infections, it may not necessarily kill the parasite.\n\nAnd some parasites form a symbiotic relationship with their hosts as well.

So 2 Mpc away, an object would be moving 140 km/s, 3 Mpc would be 210 km/s, etc. This ignores local gravitational effects.\n\nSo, I suppose one way of calculating this would be to ask: what fraction of the Universe's size is a megaparsec, what fraction is a kilometer, and then convert those into the new units. What you should realize, though, is that you'll be multiplying both numbers by the same scale factor. This should make some sense, because when looking at the raw units of Hubble's constant, the distance parts cancel.\n\nOkay, so what does that mean. 1 Mpc converts to [450 m](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.5e-20+*+%281e6*3e16+m%29) and 70 km/s converts to [1 femtometer per second](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.5e-20+*+%2870+km%29).

You \"feel\" this propagation as the \"will\" to \"open my eyes\". Heavy use of quotations here to emphasize how subjective (and hard to explain at a biological level) the problem is.\n\nFirst, to even get the \"will\" to open your eyelids, the PFC has to get a propagation of neuronal excitement. This is made more difficult by the fact the [reticular activating system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_activating_system) is likely not exciting the PFC very much (to over simplify, once again, this may be a part of the reason you feel the need to go back to sleep.)\n\nAt this point I'd like to note that if the reticular activating system didn't already wake you up enough that you could even think about opening your eyes, all of this is moot. We're just talking about \"fighting\" at the sleep-wake transition to wake up and not go back to sleep, not saying that the RAF doesn't do most of the work already.\n\nBut somehow the propagation gets enough steam (overcoming inhibitory forces) that you feel the will to open your eyes. \n\nThe PFC, in this case, would send excitatory signals to the part of the brain that controls eyelids - I would assume this would be to the motor cortex, but don't know for sure.  Once again, along the route and in the motor cortex the propagation of excited neurons would have to overcome inhibitory forces, including inhibitory neurotransmitters such as adenosine. If it's strong enough to open your eyes, the muscles in your eyelids would cause your eyes to open. \n\nAt that point you create a huge change in the brain.

However, for the most part, I think it is simply one of the sleep areas of the brain which is in control of many others (within the suprachiasmatic nucleus), so as soon as that nucleus gets the go-ahead from our attention/alert areas of the brain (thalmus, hypothalmus, prefrontal cortex), then it can begin sending excitatory neurotransmitters to those areas which are, at the time, keeping certain parts of the brain suppressed via inhibitory neurotransmitters. While asleep, the areas of our brain don't shut down or anything, they're still active, but inhibitory neurotransmitters are overcoming the excitatory ones being produced, thus stopping signals from being sent along their respective pathways. Neurons are often constantly receiving signals from other neurons, either excitatory or inhibitory, and often both. These signals are \"added up\" within the axon hillock, and whichever one is more powerful, either excitatory (telling the neuron to fire) or inhibitory (telling the neuron to do nothing), that's what the neuron goes with. Once the excitatory signals can overcome the inhibitory ones, activity will commence as normal (one such signal of activity is known as an action potential - this is what is meant when a neuron is said to be firing). This could be done via a release of epinephrine, or, depending on the area of the brain, a normal presynaptic (that is, the neuron sending the signal to the other neuron) signal of serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, or acetylcholine, to name a few. It could also be done by the presynaptic neuron ceasing its GABA production. This is a very simplistic explanation, as sometimes these neurotransmitters may be inhibitory instead of excitatory, as it often depends on the synapse and receptors receiving the neurotransmitter as opposed to just the neurotransmitter being released to determine whether it is excitatory or inhibitory.

Obviously.  Some places are warmer, some are cooler.  The thing is, air is actually pretty bad at conducting heat.  If you heat up some air, it will do a very bad job of heating up the air around it!  However, warmer air is less dense than cooler air, so it rises, and when it does, cooler air comes in and takes its place because low pressure sucks in what's around it.  This means that the difference in temperature causes air to move around.  And if you take hot air here and put it over there, then over there becomes warmer.  This is basically what convection is.\n\nBut if you have a hot *object*, it will heat up the air around it -- but *only* the air immediately around it.  That's because, again, air is bad at transferring heat.  That bit of air around it is called the boundary layer.  The object will lose some of its heat to the boundary layer, but as long as that boundary layer doesn't move, the object is in equilibrium: it's losing heat to the boundary layer just as much as the boundary layer is heating the object.  But boundary layers, generally, *do* move!  If you blow some wind at them, for example, you sweep away some of the boundary layer, and the object has to lose more heat to basically bring the new boundary layer to equilibrium.  (That's how fans work!)  If you put some water on them, the water will eat up some of the heat to evaporate, which will, again, cause the object to lose more heat.  (That's how sweating works!)  On the other hand, if you put the object in a blanket, it'll help keep the boundary layer undisturbed, because it won't have anywhere to go.  So it'll keep a warm object warm.  In the case of a person, remember that a person is a machine that turns food into, among other things, heat.  So a person is constantly producing heat, and if you put a person in a colder environment, the person will need to produce more heat to stay warm.  Put the person in a blanket, and now the boundary layer doesn't go away so the person doesn't need to produce as much heat to stay at the right temperature.\n\nBut will it work on a cold object?  Actually... yes.  Let's define \"cold\" as just colder than the ambient temperature.  Something cold has less heat than something warm (basically).  The very same processes will bring the object to equilibrium -- except that the *air* in the boundary layer will lose heat to the object until it's cold enough that the air and the object are in equilibrium.  But the boundary layer mechanism is the same.  So blowing air at a cold boundary layer will sweep it away just like with a warm boundary layer.  Similarly, wrapping it in a blanket to preserve it will work whether it's a cold boundary layer or a warm one.  But putting water on a boundary layer will only work to make it lose heat, though.  However, if you put enough water in the *air*, depending on the temperature and moisture on the surface, you might make it so that the boundary layer is drier than the air around it, so in equilibrium, the air gives more water than gets evaporated, and you could see a warming effect instead of a cooling effect.

As you pointed out, force and energy aren't the same thing. Crushing something requires energy more than it requires force which is why cars are designed to crush to absorb the energy of a crash rather than withstand the force of the crash. Therefore, we need to answer the energy question just as much as we need to answer the force question. I'll get to that in a second, but I'd like to talk about your analysis first.\n\nIn your analysis, you assume the light field is applied over a 1 m^2 area, but the pressure is applied over a 0.04 m^2 area. There is no good reason for this mismatch unless you want to assert it's impossible to focus this much light into 20 cm x 20 cm, but it is somehow fine to do it on 1 m x 1 m. If you apply the power to only the necessary area, your incident power requirement drops to only 1.49 TW (as calculated by your parent comment) which is a much more reasonable power to achieve. Today, the NIF can produce 500 TW pulses which they use to crush fuel to start nuclear fusion; clearly a much higher pressure than what would be required to crush a person. They have something more going for them though which I will get into more in a moment. There are also benchtop lasers that can produce TW-class pulses (some of which I've worked with), but head crushing is not a safety concern when using them.\n\nThe real problem with radiation pressure becomes applying enough energy through it. The NIF is very powerful, but it can't apply that power for very long. You'd have to apply that pressure over a distance of say 0.1 m to half-crush someone's head (I'd say half crushed is as good as fully crushed) requiring an energy of 0.149 TJ. Here the NIF falls far short of the goal. It can only do 1.85 MJ.\n\nA few other nitpicky things before I get to the real answer:\n\n1. Industrial lasers with wall-plug efficiency of well over 30% are available today. The NIF isn't nearly close to this efficient, but if you could get that kind of efficiency and keep some of the peak power capability, one would only need to store up 138000 kWh of energy (the consumption of about 12 average US homes for a year) and successfully deliver it through the laser system to achieve your goal of a half-crushed head.\n\n2. If we operate under the assumption that the target head is covered in an absolutely perfect reflector that retroreflects all the incident light, then by Newton's 3rd law, all of our requirements are cut in half.\n\nHowever, there is no such thing as a perfect reflector (as far as I know at least) in the macro scale. There will always be some significant absorption and at these power levels, which means the target will be thermally damaged. In this case, things suddenly get a lot better for us optical head crushers, even if we don't let the human head get burned. Suppose we allowed for a metallic face mask to be in direct contact with the head, but otherwise free to move. We'd also make the face mask thick enough that the heat from the light wouldn't make it to the head. What we'd find is that it requires much, much less light to crush the head because as the light vapourized the top of the face mask, the vapour would apply significant recoil pressure to the mask. This pressure would be much, much higher than the radiation pressure alone. (Again this was alluded to by the parent comment) The confounding factor here is that the escaping mass would also tend to temporarily block some of the beam from hitting the mask, making this into a dynamic problem which would be quite difficult to simulate. People do this kind of stuff, but they are modelling a few hundred to a few thousand atoms; not a whole head.\n\nJust as a note to those who are interested, there are people who can take multi-terawatt lasers and focus them down to a few hundred microns creating intensities well into the zettawatt/cm^2 regime; way, way more energy density than thermonuclear weapons; enough to distort the conventional laws of light-matter interaction.

That's the same amount of energy you'd receive if you were 270 meters from the surface of the Sun. If you were using a man-made lightsource to shine on all 2 square meters of human, it would take 6x10^14 Watts of energy, which is 30 times the world's energy consumption in 2010. \n\nNaturally, at that distance from such an energy source you'd be totally vaporized by the light itself.\n\nLets imagine you had a 100% superconducting superreflector that was indestructible to damage from light (but would not prevent you from being crushed).

So we need half the amount of Watts per square meter, which we would find around 390 meters from the sun. \n\nSo, wearing your fancy suit, strapped to the outside of a spaceship that's stationkeeping at 390 meters from the surface of the sun, you'd be crushed to death by the radiation pressure. \n\nBut that's fairly inefficient. It would be far easier to use a big collecting surface, concentrate that sunlight into a box somewhere, and fill the box with light (and humans) until all the light crushed all the humans. \n\nFrom Wikipedia, \"A body in a uniform radiation field (equal intensities from all directions) will experience a compressive pressure. It may be shown by electromagnetic theory, by quantum theory, or by thermodynamics, making no assumptions as to the nature of the radiation (other than isotropy), that the pressure against a surface exposed in a space traversed by radiation uniformly in all directions is equal to one third of the total radiant energy per unit volume within that space.\"\n\nWhile the theory behind the above statement is complex, the application isn't. The pressure is simply a third of the energy per cubic meter.  \n\nLet's suppose we build, in orbit around the Earth, a collecting dish with 10 square km of area. Pointed at the sun, it collects 13.6 Gigawatts of energy. Since our collector also uses sunlight to stationkeep around a lagrange point, it can only reflect 20% of the light it receives from the sun into our crushing chamber ( it uses the other 80% to deflect sunlight at different angles to produce thrust and correct its orbit). \n\nAlso, because our chamber is leaky, it lets out a bunch of light - say 90%. Even with these conservative estimates, our 2m^3 chamber reaches 1.5 MPa of pressure after only 30 seconds in operation.

The person in question is resilient enough to withstand less than 500kg of mass if it were placed on them, so that equates to the crushing force that the light needs to produce. Let's also assume that the area over which the force will act is 1m^2, because it's reasonable and makes life very easy. That means we are assuming that a person under a not-so-heavy 1m^2 plate will be crushed if we place a 500kg bock on it, or 4905Pa (call it 5000Pa) of pressure. We need to do this with only light.\n\nSome more assumptions. We will use an ultraviolet scale wavelength of light, which occurs at around L=400nm. This means that each photon contains E=hc/L (h=Planck's constant, c=speed of light) which, according to Einstein's energy-momentum relation, means a momentum of p=h/L (N.B. we could have got that from the de Broglie relation too). Now, let's assume that the plate is a perfect mirror and so deflects the light and does not absorb the energy. That means that the momentum change is 2p=2h/L. From Newton's second law, we know that the force applied to an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum, and we need a force of 5000N. This means that 5000/(2h/L) photons per second need to hit the mirror.\n\nThat number is 1.51\\*10^30.\n\nThat's 15100000...then twenty more zeros...then these five here...00000. Let's call it N from now on.\n\nNow, the energy of this many photons is E\\*N. The power(wattage) of an appliance that can produce this many photons is also E\\*N. So the wattage is E\\*N=N\\**h*c*/L = N *pc* = 5000\\*p*c*/(2p) = 2500\\*c = 7.5\\*10^11 or 750Gigawatts.\n\nOne could, with such a device, go Back To The Future 750/1.21 = 619.8 times, though how one goes back to the future by the odd 0.8 times is left as an exercise for the reader.", "gilded": 0, "score": 9, "created": 1430461563.0},{"body": "I know you're probably talking about conventional sources of light like lasers or flood lights, but technically if anything crushes a human or throws them around, it's light.

A couple of examples:\n\n* An X-bound tendency to create more females, e.g. by aborting all males.  If this was X-dominant, it would cut at minimal prevalence in the population cut off half the male offspring of the carriers (since there would usually be only one copy); if it became more advantageous (because females can get more children), it would reproduce and become common.  And if this worked by abortion, would effectively make all the carriers of the male-only gene sterile with those females, since their offspring would all be aborted.\n* A tendency in females to select normal males, e.g. by only wanting to have offspring with males that have sisters.\n\nIf you got into a situation where having only male offspring was truly bad (as you can see it would be, based on the above numbers), you'd have strong selection pressure for any variant that chose to mate with normal males, restoring equilibrium.  And for any species where the variation wasn't available, you'd have rapid extinction.  Based on this, you have to presume that for any existing species either this kind of mutation has a very low likelihood of happening, or the requisite counter-variation is available.

If the population has its male/female ratio vary randomly over time (swinging around 50%), it is of advantage in the periods when the ratio is more female dominant (and of disadvantage in the periods where it is male-dominant), which may keep it stable - but I don't know enough to say for sure.\n\nNow, there is evidence for many other species that females can influence the gender of their children, so I think the allele would have a disadvantage because that strategy is likely to be better than forcing.  This may result in the allele disappearing; it depends on the quality of that strategy vs forcing in the resulting environment (which is likely to be around 50% parental investment in males/50% in females), including how that environment changes over time.

Sorta!\n\n**Long answer:** You're familiar with the idea of electromagnetic fields and waves, right? Basically, the idea is that when you have an electric charge or a magnet it will make a 'field' around it, that other charged objects can in turn interact with, and feel an electromagnetic force. [For example, when you pour iron filings around a bar magnet, they'll line up with the magnetic field.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EWI_p8V2fJk/Tj4cHzHLQMI/AAAAAAAAAGE/AkCxMZw750s/s1600/iron%2Bfilings.png)\n\nAdditionally, you're probably familiar with the idea of light being an electromagnetic wave. Basically, if you wave a charged object back and forth, you'll make ripples through that field- this is the principle behind antennas, and is really a core concept in electromagnetism and modern electronics. \n\nIn summary, there is this *thing* that permeates all space, which is the field, and by putting energy into it we can make little ripples in it, which are 'particles' we call photons. A really simple analogy would have you imagine the field as a calm surface of water on a lake, and if you put energy into it by shaking a stick at the surface, you can make a wave. \n\nIt turns out that this idea isn't limited to electromagnetism, and is a core concept in *quantum field theory.* QFT basically tells us that there are *fields* for every fundamental particle, and by exciting the field you have made a particle. A simple example is the *electron* field (which is not to be confused with the electromagnetic field). The idea is that there is an 'electron field' that permeates the universe, just like the electromagnetic field, and at certain points there are little 'knots' where a lot of energy is localized into particles of that field. Similarly, the positron - or antimatter electron, is an excitation of this field. In a simple sense, you could imagine the electron as a wave 'crest' and the positron as a wave 'trough' ([left hand column of this picture](http://www.alanpedia.com/physics_waves/waves_clip_image058.gif)) and when you bring them together they annihilate each other. This is all [an oversimplification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_sea) that many practicing particle theorists will dislike, but I think it at least illustrates the idea well if you've never been exposed to it before.\n\nOur current best quantum field theory is the [Standard Model of Particle physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model_%28mathematical_formulation%29#Alternative_presentations_of_the_fields). It's basically a set of fields with their properties, and thus the associated particles, and the interactions between the fields. For example, the electron field can interact with the electromagnetic field - this is because electrons have charge and energy can move between the electron field and the electromagnetic field (like when an electron and positron annihilate to make two photons). \n\nThis just comes from E=mc^2 - the *mass of the particle* is equal to some amount of *energy* which can be exchanged between the fields. Imagine it like gold in ancient times- there is a finite amount of gold that Greeks and Persians and Egyptians can trade (imagine they aren't mining any new gold). They stamp that gold into their own coins, and they trade those coins with each other, which they melt down and stamp into their own coins. It's kinda like that with energy and fields. Each of these civilizations is like a 'field' and their gold-trade is the exchange of 'energy.' \n\nAnyway, you'll notice on that figure at the link two paragraphs above there is a \"Higgs Boson.\" Basically, there is this other field, similar to the 'electron field' and 'electromagnetic field' that interacts with the fields that have massive particles. And if you've been paying attention, it means that this field must have a particle associated with it! Again, in the Standard Model, every field has its own properties and different ways of interacting with other particles and rules for what it makes particles do (e.g. electromagnetically, like charges repel), and that's a little beyond the scope of this post here, but I will leave you with this comic which I think illustrates the *idea* behind the [Higgs mechanism.](http://krbowie.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/higgs-boson-cartoon22.jpg)\n\nAs for what it's made of? It's made of the same thing as every other fundamental particle- an excitation of its associated field. Once you get small enough (smaller than atoms and protons and neutrons and all those other composite things) we say that these are 'fundamental particles.' The Higgs Boson is by definition an *excitation* of the Higgs field- which you could say has an associated energy. In a simple analogy, energy can get locked up in a little kink in the Higgs field, and that's the thing we call the Higgs Boson.
