Schools function best if there's a reasonable ratio between difficult* kids and obedient kids. There's a few reasons for this.

The parents who care enough about their kids' education to get a voucher to stick them in a private school is likely to have one of the \"obedient\" kids, as kids with higher parental involvement tend to be more attentive than the difficult kids. \n\nWhile this could be a great opportunity for the individual obedient kid, removing too many obedient kids from the public school is bad for the school as a whole: classrooms become more difficult to manage and the culture of that school becomes less similar to that of a school and more similar to a fort under siege. \n\nSo whether or not you support vouchers depends on how much you value the well-being of the school system as a whole over the well-being of a handful of individual students. \n\n*difficult= could mean jerks, kids with clinical learning or behavior difficulties, lousy home lives/involved parents, etc. Calling these kids difficult is not meant to pass judgement on them, but to explain things as simply as I could.

The facts are that in abstinence-only states you get more teen pregnancies. Still, conservatives think it's *wrong* to teach kids about safe sex and provide them with condoms, because in their minds it's just *wrong* for teens to fuck. They don't make it their priority to help people who make the *wrong* life choices. They're not in this to make life better for everyone. They're in this to tell you \"what's right\" and they don't mind damning you to hell if you deliberately disobey. They think that someone needs to stand against the tide of decay and debauchery and try to turn this hand basket around. They're not about making a more comfortable and functional handbasket.\n\nLiberals (of which I am one) focus more on outcomes and \"what works.\" If condoms and sex ed lead to fewer pregnancies, then that stuff *works.* we don't care if our states have ten times as much teen sex, as long as that sex doesn't have unwanted pregnancies as an outcome. Liberals will take a 5% improvement in mileage over a solution that \"feels right in the gut\" and we pay attention to numbers in making decisions. Sometimes this leads to really counterintuitive stuff like giving needles to drug addicts, which feels like you're enabling their habit. But often liberals show greater realism about \"what people are gonna do anyway\" where conservatives focus all their energy on \"what people oughtta do.\"\n\nSo the debate we see over and over again is as follows: \n\n\"Excuse me Senator but our studies show that, if enacted into law, this bill would bring a 15% benefit overall and a 40% benefit to populations most at risk.\"\n\nvs.\n\n\"But it just ain't right for people to do that!

So claiming that behaviors shouldn't be protected by civil rights is a statement so absurd it practically lacks any real meaning. \n\nBroadly, constitutional rights either prohibit the government from taking a certain action (e.g. searching without probable cause) or prohibit the government from preventing an individual from taking an action (e.g. speaking). Rights that protect individuals from government discrimination based on their status at birth are a relatively small subset of the former. Of the 15 or so Amendments to the Constitution protecting individual rights, only three prohibit discrimination against classes of people. The Fifteenth prohibits denying the right to vote based on race, the Nineteenth prohibits denying that right based on sex, and the Fourteenth's Equal Protection Clause more generally prohibits government discrimination against classes of people. \n\nAll the other rights enshrined in the Constitution prohibit specified government behaviors or protect individual behaviors rather than classes of people. Speech is a behavior, and the First Amendment protects that. It also protects free exercise of religion and freedom of the press. The Second protects owning guns. The Fifth, the right not to testify against yourself. etc. etc. All behaviors and not birth features.\n\nReligion itself is probably the best example. Free exercise is a civil right. I wonder how the pastor of that church would feel if his religion was banned? He wasn't born Christian. He can choose to stop being Christian at any time. So by the standard of his sign's argument, his free exercise should not be a protected civil right.\n\nBut far more importantly, the Equal Protection Clause prevents government discrimination against classes of people, regardless of whether the characteristic features of that class are present at birth or are a result of the individual's choices. Admittedly, race is the most common suspect classification to receive the highest level of scrutiny under the EPC. But age, disability, gender, wealth, political affiliation, felony status, and almost any other classification can be the basis of an EP claim, even when the classification is based on a feature not present at birth. \n\nAlongside race and national origin (two features determined at birth), guess what classification receives the highest level of scrutiny under the EPC? Religion. So if the pastor of this church doesn't want classifications based on behavioral choices to receive the highest protection of the Constitution, then he has to give up one of his most powerful protections against governmental persecution.
