It's not an illegitimate fear- beyond paypal or google wallet gated transactions (which are clunky and weak for this purpose), there are no *well recognized* platforms (the largest probably being [desura](http://www.desura.com/mods), a fringe player) that provide a maker to user sales medium, especially with the level of redundancy and trust that Steam offers.\n\nHundreds to thousands of work hours go into popular mods for A-list games, often producing content that trumps the original studio material in return for negligible recognition and compensation. Presenting an alternative doesn't threaten mod makers - in fact, it's a supportive and excellent thing to do - but it does threaten their *users*, who are a much, much larger voice (if one that deserves less input), and where a huge majority of complaints regarding changes in freely available premium content and bug fixes will come from.\n\n---\n\nIt's *not* unreasonable to offer a platform for mod makers to monetize their work. In fact, it's a step up from platforms like [nexus](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/premium/?) and [withsix](https://withsix.com/gopremium) on the simple basis that the mod maker *gets anything at all*. These two major examples already monetize their positions as cornerstone mod distributors to support themselves - after all, bandwidth isn't free - but the people that provide their actual *draw*, the mod makers, are left out in the cold.\n\nIt **is** unreasonable to take **three quarters** of the value of the **mod maker's** work. It's [public knowledge](http://www.bethblog.com/2015/04/27/why-were-trying-paid-skyrim-mods-on-steam/) that the split was 30/45/25 - The 30 being valve's standard cut, and the 25 being the mod maker. Nobody can reasonably dispute the 30; Steam costs money to run, and Valve is providing a sales platform to the mod maker that should result in profit for the company.\n\nThe 45 to the game publisher **is** hilarious - in a bad way, in case that was ambiguous. Zenimax/Bethesda may have set their own terms, and the entire community *is* a squirrely mess of derivative works in one sense or another, but anyone at either company that was of the understanding that the studio was *entitled* to **half** of someone elses work, **after** their own sales and DLC revenue, and out of the hides of a community that has been one of the single largest draws to the series in public media for more than a decade ... well.

I don't believe that what steam (Valve really) was try and capitalize on this repository for their own sake, but rather is providing content creators an incentive to build great mods. \n\nCapitalism being capitalism, we vote with our wallets. While I am hearing a lot of individuals say \"don't buy mods\", why not say \"buy the good ones\". If given enough time, the good buys will separate themselves from that bad ones. At the end of the day, a monetary incentive is still an incentive, and you better be ready to produce a quality product or else no one will buy.\n\nAnd, I know this will sound like a \"be grateful\" statement, but 25% of something is better than 0% of something. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it would be currently illegal for any modder to sell their Skyrim mods. I'm sure that Bethesda explicitly does not allow for the sale of derivative works based on their tools. While the content creator received 25%, the lion's share will go to the original creator of the game, as it is their Intellectual Property and their modding tools that are being used and resold. \n\nAt the end of the day, this is a good idea, but still requires some refinement. There needs be better checks and balances for ownership and copyright, that much is plainly obvious. Such things exist on the mobile platforms, and are dealt with accordingly. \n\nHowever, what valve has done was to provide a centralized, **legal** way for content creators to sell their good. Prior to this, the only time you saw this was in Valve sanctioned games (TF2, CS:GO), where you had to hope Valve chose your product to feature in their game. Now, you can self-publish your mods, and hope that the price you ask for correlates to the quality of the work you release. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, you are still under no obligation as a consumer to BUY the mods. You can pass on them if you would like. All these examples that have been shown ($2 Fishing mod, $100 HD horse genitals) are examples of people attempting to monetize for the sake of monetization, independent of quality.

That's not true.\n\nValve is taking 30%\n\nBethesda is taking 45%\n\nModders get 25%.\n\nBreaking that down:\n\nValve has 30% of sales to support their storefront, the business end of that concerning maintenance, design, customer care, curation, etc. Up until this point, they've been hosting and distributing terabytes of free community content at a cost to them. It takes thousands upon thousands of dollars a month just to power servers needed for this, and even more for colocation and distribution costs. If things end up being paid for, Valve needs this cut for them to be hosting all the stuff they do host. And they're not exactly going to be profiting from the free content they distribute either. This is a pretty normal publiusher/hosting fee.\n\nBethesda gets 45% because literally none of the new products being sold would be possible without their intellectual property. If there's a profit being made from this, they are entitled to their cut for supplying what the entirety of what makes these mods possible.\n\nModders get 25%. And you don't see that until you make $100. I don't see why people think this is unreasonable. If you want to waste Valve's time and resources and make a shitty $.05 mod that wont' break that barrier, Valve won't have to have wasted their resources for nothing and you should've done a free mod anyways.\n\nIf you have a professionally done mod that you'll maintain and care for like any digital gaming product that's paid for should be, and charge $5-10 for it... you'll break $100 in your margin before the day is over. That's a really low threshold to be set for anyone who actually has the means to provide something worthwhile.\n\nI don't trust Valve to handle the legal/accountability aspects of people stealing work but I also can't see many of these stolen assets becoming high profile and well-selling mods. We'll see how it plays out.\n\nI get the feeling this will be ignored but if anyone cares about this and is mad/skeptical it should be for the right reasons. No one needs to panic and talk about pirating the whole world like a reactionary child. 25% to the modder is a great cut considering the cost of distribution, licensing from Bethesda, and the fact that it leaves the modder with no financial risk at trying out their product.

They created the game with modding capabilities and modders who sell their work have to pay royalties to the original software they're basing their work on. This kind of issue applies to all software. There are tons of instances of lawsuits where even open source software that utilizes some licensed code in it can be in breach. Bethesda doesn't void their cut of a sale being made because they didn't intend a mod to be made- it's not like they were charging for free mods or mod tools anyways and they don't make anything off of free mods.\n\nSo yeah I can see why you personally feel the distribution is a bit off but it seems like Valve is taking a pretty common cut (from some random articles I looked up online) and mod developers are getting a pretty standard developer cut. Since there's no outside marketing or really too many other costs involved I can see why you'd feel that 45% is high for Bethesda, but I think given how important their IP is to each modder's product (should they choose to sell it) I don't think it's unwarranted. \n\nIt's also important to consider that this platform for publishing doesn't require any financial investment or resources from the modder up front to be listed on the store.

I'd like someone to explain to me what the big deal is.\n\n&gt; First, Valve, you have now made \"modder\" a dirty word here on the steam forums almost overnight. Thanks a bunch. You have now divided PC consumers and modders, when we used to be a pretty tight bunch.\n\nI can see this happening, but this seems more like a consequence of people posting angry articles online about it instead of Valve's decision directly.  I also think \"dividing PC consumers and mdders\" is a bit much.\n\n&gt; Second, I now see mods going up that are little tiny swords and whatnot going up for sale. Bundles already that cost more than the game itself. In other words, I am concerned about a complete influx of mods that are completely useless and tiny and unsupported and updated, just because of money-grabbers who want a piece of the pie. \n\nThis sounds a lot like Greenlight.  Not a problem with the service itself, but there does need to be some sort of moderation system in place to make it easier for consumers to weed out the crap.\n\n&gt; Third, this leads to microtransaction hell. Hell for consumers, and a deluge of stuff to compete against for us modders. This isn't healthy competition. It is gonna be cutthroat. Thanks again for taking the fun out of it. \n\nI don't understand what \"microtransaction hell\" means.  Like a lot of microtransactions?  There are only as many as the number of mods you buy.  And how is \"cutthroat competition\" bad?  The worst it's going to do is lower prices of mods.  The worst case scenario is that mod prices are going to be free, which is the way things already were.\n\n&gt; Fourth, there will be inevitable stealing of other's people's content and then selling it as their own. Some may claim that because they modified another mod's content, they now have created their own mod and are free to sell. I disagree. They are making money at the expense of others. \n\nFrom an economics standpoint this makes no sense.  If someone is selling the same mod for a price, any sane consumer would prefer getting the free one anyway.  I've also seen mods use the \"if you paid for this you have been scammed\" line to further prevent this.\n\n&gt; Fifth, you have a \"return policy,\" if it is even worth of the name, that is full of holes. First, 24hrs isn't much time to test if a mod will glitch out or not. Ever heard of a standard 14 or 30 day return policy?\n\nOk, this is a good point.  I completely agree that there needs to be a longer return policy, especially for mods that are likely of dubious quality.  There should something like this for all games, especially Greenlight ones.\n\n&gt; Lastly, you, Valve, are likely hurting good, legal sites like Nexus Mods as some greedy people take their mods, or the \"premium versions\" off the site in favor of posting to the Steam Workshop. These sites rely on advertising revenue to run, and you will very likely hurt this revenue. Why do that? You used to have a reputiation of siding with the underdog. It is not like you are in competition with people like Nexus. It is not like they are EA, taking a corner of the market. And it isn't even like you really need the money Valve. This just feels to me like a cash cow. A move EA would be proud of, sadly.\n\nAgain, any sane consumer would prefer getting the free version.  If anything, free mod distribution sites are going to benefit if their competitors start charging for mods.  And the last bit is obvious pandering to the pro-Valve anti-EA circlejerk.\n\nValve is simply offering an option to content creators to charge money for their works.

This event has created a huge divide between those who have augmentations, and those who do not. Amongst this emotional turmoil are various factions looking to manipulate the public by twisting public opinion of augmentation to further their own agenda and hide the truth of what really happened.\n\n&gt;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided also continues the story of Adam Jensen, a former biotech company security chief turned super-augmented, anti-terrorist agent playing by his own rules. Jensen has been empowered with all new augmentations, enabling him and the player a greater sense of self-control as they explore all new locations in-game. As social and political tensions reach a major turning point, Jensen and conspiracies surrounding the Illuminati continue toward an inevitable crossroads \u2026 and possibly, an epic showdown.\n\nand in terms of tech \n\n&gt;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided will also mark a new era in Eidos-Montr\u00e9al\u2019s technology, utilizing the advanced visual and immersive capabilities of the Dawn Engine\u2122, specifically built for the recent generation of consoles and PC. Under the umbrella of the Gaming Evolved program, AMD and Eidos-Montr\u00e9al have been collaborating on Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, and the game will feature Microsoft\u2019s DirectX\u00ae 12 support as well as AMD\u2019s TressFX\u2122.

Like Battlefront 2, this game will allow for switching between first-person and third-person at any time.\n* A new mode called Walker Assault, which will support Battlefront\u2019s largest player count with 40 players. Other maps and modes will support smaller player counts, down to as few as eight players. Walker Assault mixes together all of Battlefront\u2019s main ingredients. Some players will shoot it out on the ground while others dogfight in X-Wings and TIE Fighters in the skies above. (Sounds like Titan Battles from Battlefield 2142). \n* Hero characters are most definitely back.

Players can choose one Partner to always be able to see in-game, and always be able to spawn next to. But more importantly, you\u2019ll be able to share item/weapon unlocks with your partner. \n* On launch there are three planets available, Tattooine, Endor, Hoth, and Sullust, though DICE is planning a free DLC pack called The Battle of Jakku, which is a climactic battle between the Rebels and the Empire shortly after Return of the Jedi.

Sometimes one mod may modify the same files as another mod, or a particular combination of mods may cause unexpected outcomes. If you find that mod has broken or is behaving unexpectedly, it is best to post politely on the Workshop item's page and let the mod author know the details of what you are seeing.\n\nSo basically if a mod breaks, you as a consumer have no recourse or right to a refund. You have to 'politely ask' the creator to fix it and hope that he does.

I wouldn't care at all if they just blanket made every mod on the store 'pay what you want' as low as $0.00 and gave the modder the lions share of the transaction cost, because then it just heavily promotes what are basically donations to modders, which I'd be mostly cool with, because I do think they deserve something. Instead this just takes everything I hate about microtransactions in F2P games and crowdsources their creation.   \n\nThe crazy thing is I don't even download mods on steam for my games outside of maybe 2-3 for Skyrim forever ago, so this literally has no effect on me.

We mod because we enjoy messing around with the game and creating something. It's a hobby, not a job (Though Mitch from TGW recently got hired by the Creative Assembly thanks to his stellar mod work!) Sure some people will see it as a way to make money and pump out minimal quality stuff to try to make a quick buck, but a lot of people who see modding as the end itself, rather than a means an end, will continue to make mods for their own enjoyment. I could never imagine Dresden, head of Divide et Impera, making the mod monetized even if CA let us, and hell he's bought three copies of Rome II just to be able to upload all the versions of DeI and Constantine: Rise of Christianity.  \n\nAnother thing that needs addressing is the steam workshop itself. I... kinda hate it. It's massively inefficient because it doesn't allow us to compress our mods, which leads to issues like that I described above in which Dresden had to buy multiple copies of the game in order to upload all of DeI. Even then, here were bugs that came with it, such as buggy textures due to poor transferrence. TW overhaul modders largely prefer TotalWarCenter over the Steam workshop simply because the workshop is kind of a pain in the ass. Here's hoping it never becomes the only way to get mods into TW.\n\nIn short, no we are not all going to charge for the stuff if given the chance. It's a hobby, something that most of us do for fun, rather than money. I would prefer a thank you any day, especially as a vocal minority of people already tend to be fairly entitled when it comes to mods. God it would be a nightmare, having to deal with people like those who buy early access and suddenly feel like they are part of the design team. I feel like charging for a mod would put a level of being beholden to those who paid for the mod, and that is something I, nad most other modders I know, would never willingly subject myself to. \n\nEdit: Thinking about it, I had a shitty little event pictures mod on the Rome 2 workshop with over 27,000 subs. What if I monetized it for a buck, or even 50 cents (even though it is completely not worth it, and I doubt anyone would actually pay that much for it) MUWAHAHAHAHA! \n\nBut it also leads to an interesting question: sure that events mod is a small thing made pretty much solely by me with some help from people who let me use some of their artwork, but how the hell would one divvy up %s for larger mod teams such as Divide et Impera.

Another reason is that some devs actively try to prevent modding, especially in multiplayer games, so modders have no choice but to do it through the backdoor. \n\nModding has mostly been a DIY and hobby community with a focus on sharing.

However, there'll also be a lot who will happily take this opportunity, and if this would've been a thing before, they would've taken it.

I'm trying to post schools of thought from both sides of the argument, which is why I think it will be interesting to see how this unfolds over time.\n\nHowever to take an example from your history, you seem to be a keen blacksmith as a hobby. If someone gave you the option to earn some cash on the side smithing something like knives or other outdoor tools, or to repair something, would you provide a service for free since it's a hobby? Or if you wanted to get paid would you have to set up your own blacksmithing business, as you say these guys should? \n\nI've heard that the gaming industry is a pain to get into; in fact a good friend of mine's son just finished a degree in computing and game design, and he is really struggling to get into the industry. This could be a way for people like him to get a bit of cash on the side whilst building up a portfolio of proven projects. Of course this is disregarding the vast amounts of issues with paid mods that myself and others have alluded to.\n\nModders do this as a hobby, and it is typically free (with encouraged donations on some sites). I think this could really backfire for Steam, as Greenlight has done, due to their hands off approach with quality assurance and content management. I think it's a potentially promising idea in principle, but forcing people to pay for mods is too far and will cause headaches with piracy/IP infringement/disagreements between paid for mods relying on free ones to work.\n\nPersonally I would be far more comfortable if they introduced a donate button, as there are some mods I would happily donate freely to support.\n\nEDIT: In fact after mentioning potential issues with disagreements between paid and unpaid mods, [the first paid one has been pulled for this exact reason](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/33o886/within_hours_of_launch_the_first_forprofit_skyrim/cqmtniw).", "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "created": 1429876498.0},{"body": "Here's the problem, as I stated in the C:S sub.\n\nThe way I make a hook, or a knife, or a nail as a blacksmith is unique to me.

To change this within the framework of the game is going to be very similar, no matter who writes it. \n\nNow, because of how DCMA works, if a free version of the mod is available, and the code is necessarily pretty similar, the paid modder can issue a DCMA against the free one and get it banned. \n\nNo blacksmith will issue a DCMA against me if I make something similar to what he or she made.", "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "created": 1429878118.0},{"body": "Oh that is a big problem and I mentioned it in [some](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/33m403/steam_introduced_paid_workshop_mods/cqm864f) of my [earlier posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/33m403/steam_introduced_paid_workshop_mods/cqm7z6k).\n\nThat's what I mean when I think it *could* be a good thing, and in principle is promising. You get to support good, large mods; modders have an incentive to be more ambitious and devote more time to mods; they can enhance a game's experience further (a la Skyrim); and so on. In principle it's all well and good.\n\nIn reality Steam have (probably) done this to carve more profit having seen success with their profits from the marketplace and game skins for TF2/DOTA2/CSGO. Also in reality there are going to be issues like conflicting pieces of assets in paid mods relying on free ones as I mentioned in my initial reply to you (with an edit as a recent example), and as you say with DMCAs. Also now that it is clear that Devs do take a slice of the \"paid mod pie\", what is to stop them from ceasing to provide large patches for free when the community can provide better ones for a potential fee? (See Skyrim Unofficial Patches being better than official ones). And this is without touching the reams of other issues with IP issues, conflicts of interest, piracy etc. It's a risky precedent that requires careful curation, support, and management to succeed; none of which Valve are any good at.\n\nI'm going to follow with a close eye and remain hopeful that the vast majority of modders will either remain free, or provide top quality content in the event that they do charge.

But before saying why, let me say that KSP certainly is a great game. I completely agree with this statement\n\n&gt; [Landing on the Moon] remains one of my greatest achievements in a game. It was a proper achievement, too. Not a pat-on-the-back trophy, created to convey incremental progress, but the successful completion of a challenging, self-made goal. The entire process\u2014from failure, to revision, to hope, to euphoric completion\u2014cemented for me why Kerbal Space Program is one of the best games on PC.\n\nI had the same experience. First landing on the Moon was without a doubt the best experience I've had in any game ever. This is not a hyperbole, it literally is the best experience any game has ever managed to provide in my gaming history, which goes quite a ways back. And it's echoed repeatedly in the KSP subreddit by new players who feel the same way. For certain, any game that can pull this off deserves a good score and deserves the praise.\n\nBut that quote is then immediately followed by \n\n&gt; That this all happened two years ago is why it feels strange to be reviewing the game now.\n\nI feel like this review is more about the early access and the reviewers history with the game than a fair review of the released version. You might ask, what's the problem, surely the released version is only better. The problem is the career mode that's been added to the game at the final stages of development. It's portrayed as the actual game, the eponymous space program. When you start a new game, it's the default mode the game starts in if you don't change it. And traditionally sandbox mode is just messing around without restrictions. But it just happens that the career mode is really quite bad while the sandbox mode is the great game everyone who's played KSP for a while is telling you about.\n\nThe review even says this but for some reason skips over it really fast and doesn't make a big deal out of it, which quite frankly boggles my mind. \n\n&gt; It can be a bit of a grind, as you're encouraged to spend slightly too long repeating experiments in order to progress through to proper space exploration. ...  It still feels like an area that could use some extra expansion. There are only so many contract types, and eventually I decided to abandon the career structure in favour of the continued pursuit of my own ambitions.\n\nIt says so right there that career mode is so bad that the reviewer decided to abandon it completely. And I agree with that, it is a struggle to get through the early career mode. Not a struggle because it is challenging but because it is just tedious. If you do get past the worst parts, then it quickly becomes basically a sandbox game. Most of the career mode mechanics won't matter after a while. You'll have more money than you know what to do with and you don't need any more science. As such, there's no reason to do contracts other than what you think look like interesting challenges. The game essentially is a sandbox game at this point. In other words, career mode is a sandbox game where the early part really sucks.\n\nIt seems like most of the people who genuinely like career mode are actually veteran players who take the early career mode as a challenge. You have many restrictions in rocket size and parts available, it's a challenge to get to the Moon with these limits. And it can be a fun challenge too for veteran players. Challenge in the same way of complete some other game without using any weapons. That is not something you should subject beginners to.\n\nAny new player that doesn't realise that, unlike most other games, sandbox mode is the real core of the game is probably going to have a bad time. In this sense, I think the game would actually have been better without the career mode being in it at all. If that was the case, I might actually agree with the 96 score. It just comes with the caveat that this is a purely sandbox game, if that's not your thing then look elsewhere. Now the review makes it seem like career mode aspect is very nearly perfect as well.\n\nSo yes, part of the game deserves that 96 score, the career mode doesn't. If you don't see yourself liking a sandbox game then KSP isn't for you. Otherwise, and especially if you're at all interested in space flight and physics, KSP really is an awesome game. Just skip over the career mode, at least to start with, and focus on the sandbox mode. Watch some tutorials online, or ask for help at /r/kerbalspaceprogram. It can be a bit daunting at first.

These days, everybody wants to put a number to how bad they are - and even if they *don't*, even if they choose to stick to casual play, they still want *matchmaking*, which requires stats tracking and at this point, everybody has to be on official servers, or it's just a huge pain in the ass.\n\nNone of this *precludes* devs from making player hosting a possibility, and some do, but most probably won't, because it doesn't strike me as a very effective use of their time or resources.", "gilded": 0, "score": 4, "created": 1428300079.0},{"body": "Yeah your reasoning makes a lot of sense here.
