Most the time the bullets come out of the camera, not the barrel. Why you might ask? Ever play a game where you could see around the corner but when you go to shoot it gets blocked by the corner? That's what happens when the bullet comes out of the barrel. If it comes out of the center of the camera (or known as the camera's forward vector) then it will go exactly where your crosshair is at all times. Making the game feel more fun in this case is more important than making it realistic for most games.\n\nSomeone mentioned ray casting, also known as line (or other shape) tracing. Bullets usually aren't ray casted unless they are INSTANT. No reason to ray cast if you are just going to be spawning a particle or bullet anyways which most games do. So simply they just spawn a bullet actor at the start, send it on the camera's forward vector and make it go SUPER fast. Like real bullets. Why? Well when the actor hits something you can just tell it to cause damage them from the server. Because its an actor it exists on the server and clients. Ray casts can be ran on the server and clients as well but it's useless for the clients to run them because they are never the authority and the clients would get nothing from running them.\n\nSo when would you run a ray cast vs spawning an actor? Well simply when you want that gun to be INSTANT. ray casts basically happen on the same tick if not the moment you left (or whatever button) click. Meaning the bullet literally has 0 travel time. Where even fast paced games like counter-strike and call of duty have bullets with travel time. Although one game that doesn't have bullet travel time would be like Unreal Tournaments instant gib gun. That is an insta-kill and only lag stands in the way of the winner.\n\nWhich brings us to the other issue of guns. What do you do if the player gets killed on the server but sends the button to shoot. What if that packet to the server is dated before the player died? A major issue of ray casting is that you die quickly. Very very quickly. With bullets you have a chance of killing each other because both of you are spawning bullets and sending them at each other. So after you die those bullets could be in the world still. Essentially you could kill each other. While rare, not impossible (unless the game deletes all bullets that belong to your gun on your death, looking at you Counter-Strike!) So a major issue with ray casting is what do you do with people who simply have better ping. Do you delay kills on the server? Do you rubber band the players every few moments? Do you tell the clients to predict what might happen but never let them do key things like kill people or make others shoot? Most games go with the last. Let the clients predict movement and allow the clients to shoot at others but NEVER kill any player on the client unless it comes from the server. Thats why when you feel like that guy should have died about 2 bullets ago, its most likely because he should have and the server decided you didn't make those shots. Frustrating but less so than actually killing a player just to have them come to life again and shoot you.", "gilded": 0, "score": 260, "created": 1429120568.0},{"body": "Counter-Strike uses raycasting, it doesn't delete bullets on your death.", "gilded": 0, "score": 12, "created": 1429124678.0},{"body": "hmm, haven't played it much recently but I thought they spawned actors in the newest one.

We even got to present our mod to Valve many years ago (2006-ish), and suffice to say, I would not be working in the games industry now if it wasn't for that opportunity and experience with Valve back then, so thank you to all of the team at Valve for everything over the years. Also, I want to add that I'm viewing the workshop changes through the lens of my own experiences working on a total conversion mod.\n\nNow, I do think offering content creators the option to have the ability to create revenue for themselves is an extremely noble goal. I'm not completely sold on the current direction, but I believe your north star is true. After all, it's the dream of many modders of total conversions at least, to be able to create enough interest where they one day can devote the massive amount of resources required to turn their mod into a full retail game, which is not cheap by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nHowever, there are two tweaks which I would consider:\n- Publisher/developer education on appropriate revenue splits for mods. I think it's fair that there should be a split, but with Skyrim, I think the pendulum is not enough in favor of the developer of the mod, who were the ones to devote their time to build on their game. Yes, Valve and Bethesda created the platform and tools inside of the game to allow mods to happen (which is why I think the split is fair), but the actual developer(s) of the mod may have spent a lot of their time and resources working on a mod. Previously, yes, they would get nothing, but as of now, it's tough to imagine anyone to be able to count on the Workshop revenue as something that they could live off of. For smaller mods, let's say a new sword or armor, you likely would need to achieve a large volume of mods and sell those cheap and overall you could make a decent amount of revenue especially compared to the time investment. However, if you work for 3 years with 10-20 people on a total conversion, getting 25% of potential revenue would be extremely rough because you will only have a single mod to sell, and thus can only bank on your mod being extremely successful (which let's face it, statistically is unlikely).\n\n- Two-tiered system of content creators. By this, I mean that if you are a new author to the workshop, you have certain limits on what you could charge, until the author can develop a sense of trust with their customers. Let's say that at the beginning, I can only use Free or Pay-What-You-Want. Once I have X amount of downloads/payments, or perhaps if there were an author rating system where I could achieve 4+ stars out of 5 from the community, I would then graduate to have the ability to be able to create a static price mod. Maybe this would be too unfair, but the root of my concern is that there needs to be a trust relationship between the mod author and their customers. If a game update breaks the mod, and I had $15 for the mod, I want to have trust that the mod author would help their customers and fix the mod.\n\nThe root of that two-tier system is from a very old Valve presentation on surviving modding. In the presentation (which I can not find unfortunately), the general advice was that if you created a mod that was able to sustain 5,000 players on a consistent basis, you would be considered to be \"successful\" or at least have a fun mod, and Valve may look into helping you become a retail title. Having a structured system in the workshop like that old advice may be something worth investigating.\n\n- Finally, I wonder if it would be feasible to have a humble-bundle style slider system when you do payments. Perhaps create a floor for which category, and it would of course require buy-off from the developer/publisher, but it would be interesting if as a customer, I could influence where my funds went. Most of the time I may just leave it at defaults, but if I thought the developer deserved more, that would be my choice.\n\nIf you read this, thank you, and I hope you are enjoying your coffee. As I live in the Bellevue area, I would be more than willing to talk to you in person to have a larger discussion (private message me).

It's refreshing to see a thoughtful discussion on how to improve the system rather than just pointing out what's wrong with it or hiding behind odd ideological notions (like how a successful artist somehow can't be authentic anymore). \n\nA friend of mine made note of the difference of expectations between a donation and a purchase. A purchase has an expectation of continued support (though that doesn't always happen in AAA titles even). He suggested a disclaimer like Early Access games have, \"Due to the nature of mods this mod may function correctly with other mods, and may not function in the future due to changes in other mods.\"\n\nSpecific requirements versioning in programming isn't anything new, and would alleviate -some- of the maintenance problems mod users face. At least then if a framework mod does change there's a known good set of mod versions that can be restored to until mods are updated. Mod management is really something Valve needs to invest in in general though. But that's not really related to the topic of funding mod devs.\n\nI see some parallels with Kickstarter. People paying for something that isn't concrete, but with the expectation of a working or finished product. I think some sort of commitment from the developer as a requisite for charging more for a mod might work in addition to a good history. As I'm about to write \"to give users some sort of legal recourse if a large mod doesn't fulfil it's commitment.\" I feel that's pretty darn harsh compared to what we both expect and receive from commercial development teams. I wonder why continued support is so much a concern (at least to everyone I've spoken with) with mods when the support we get for the games we buy is often so much worse.\n\nIt's a complex issue for sure.

It is changing a system that has been working fine.  Modders aren't an oppressed class working without benefit.  Modders choose to work on mods for many reasons: fun, practice, boredom, the joy of creating something.   And gamers appreciate their contributions.  While, some gamers may feel entitled most understand that if a modder is unable to continue the mod may be abandoned.  Donations may or may not help but they are an option.  This system has for years made PC gaming what it is.  Modding in my opinion is the primary benefit of PC gaming over console.  Changing a functional system is dangerous and could have unintended consequences.\n\n&gt;2. Now that people are paying for mods they will feel entitled for these mods to continue working.  If a free mod breaks and isn't supported that is fine because there is no obligation for it to continue working.  If someone pays though they will expect the mod to be updated and continue working as the base game is updated.  Furthermore, abandoned but popular mods are often revived by other people; if these mods are paid then the original creator may not want people to profit off of updated versions of their mod.\n\n&gt;3. Related to the above paid mods may reduce cooperative modding.  Many mods will borrow elements from other mods; usually with permission.  Having paid mods will complicate things.  Someone who makes a paid mod will be unlikely to share his/her work with others.  What if someone freely share's his/her mod and someone incorporates it into a paid mod?  Does the first mod's owner deserve compensation, does the second modder deserve the full revenue.  This makes modding more politically complicated and may reduce cooperation.\n\n&gt;4. This may reduce mods based off of copyrighted works.  There is a very good chance that any paid mod based off of a copyrighted work will be shutdown.  Modders could still release free mods of this nature but it complicates the issue.  Many mods based on copyrighted materials borrow (usually with permission) from other mods to add improvements.  If these other mods are paid then the original creators likely won't let them use it.  Additional many modders may now ignore copyrighted mods in order to make mods that they may profit on.\n\n&gt;5.  Steam/the developer are taking an unfairly large portion of the profit.  Steam and the Developers are offering nothing new to the situation.  Steam is already hosting the mods and the developer already made the game.  They now wish to take 75% of all profit from the mod.  If the market gets flooded by low-quality paid mods, the modders will likely make very little and the quality of the game will not be increased.  However, Steam and the Developers will make money off of no work on there part.\n\nEDIT: So this got a lot more attention than I expected and someone even gilded my comment.

My thoughts on this to Gabe and Valve, from elsewhere in the thread:\n\nYou should give a fair share back to the people building the mods then. Right now [Valve+Bethesda] are charging like a [platform+publisher] combo, when you (combined) are only functioning as a platform.\n[Amazon + book publisher] or [console + game publisher] take 75-80% or more, but a publisher also fronts the cost and risk of building the content, promotes the content, advertises the content, and so on. If Bethesda wanted a publisher's cut from mods, they should front the dev cost and risk, buy or fund some mods, and package them up on Steam as paid DLC.\n\nMods requiring Skyrim to exist does not make Bethesda a special snowflake. Sony built an entire console and operating system (and ongoing live ops cost) in addition to their marketplace, and they only charge 30% despite all of that foundation required to consume the content in that ecosystem. Same for Google+Android, Apple+iTunes+iOS+iDevice, and on and on.\n\nThe value proposition to modders here is pretty fucked.

One mod might enhance weather, another mod might improve snow effects, then you have seven or eight different mods that improve textures, static meshes, visual effects, lightning, etc.\n\nNobody *just* installs 'wet and cold' and one texture improvement pack. You install **all** the environmental effect improvement mods, and **all** the graphic improvement mods. The mods together are greater than the sum of their parts. That is how you have to mod Skyrim.\n\nThe vanilla game is like a fired bullet. You have a used primer, a dirty casing, no powder, a mangled jacket, and a destroyed bullet. If you want to fix this bullet, you have to fix all of this. The way Skyrim modding works now, you have one guy who decides he wants to fix the primer, so he does. Another couple of guys work on cleaning the case, and maybe they have their own personal take on how to do so. One guy adds powder, another shapes the bullet, and the last guy reforms a jacket.\n\nThe guy forming the jacket can't form the jacket unless he knows what shape the bullet is. The guy shaping the bullet can't get the weight right unless he knows how much the powder dude is adding. The powder dude can't get the powder right unless he knows the case's volume and pressure threshold. In order to fix the bullet, people need to work together towards a common goal, and you cannot just buy the 'new primer DLC' and 'repaired jacket DLC', because you still are left with a non-functional bullet.\n\nThe end result is a bunch of mods that do stuff so subtly that you don't notice - they become part of the game. Vanilla Skyrim is an outrageously shitty game by every possible metric you could come up with, but I don't care because I could fix it with these gameplay mods. \n\nNot only does paywalling destroy the collaborative incentive for modders to 'split up the workload' (ie: you work on cold effects, I work on weather, he works on graphics), but it would basically kill heavily-modded installs completely, because there's almost nobody that would fork over the ***hundreds*** of dollars it would take to buy all the fucking mods that comprise the Skyrim mod base.", "gilded": 0, "score": 9, "created": 1430017868.0},{"body": "In addition, paid DLC from literally every other source whether it be LoL/DotA2 skins, map packs, gun skins, expansion packs, etc. Are all expected to work both by themselves AND with each other.

I wanted to say that I appreciate the idea of attempting to help modders gain greater reward for the great work they do.\n\nBut, conversely, if I was modding for money, my incentives would be all wrong. When I make mods for Skyrim, or Fallout or Oblivion or Morrowind, I do it because I see something I want to have in the game or something that I feel needs to be fixed about the game that I have the capability to fix. And I make those fixes or add the new content I've made because I want the game to be more enjoyable for me. And conversely because I feel the content I've made makes the game better for me, I've shared it on various mod community sites so individuals that might enjoy the content can use it too and largely its done fairly well. I've got around 75000 combined downloads on the Nexus alone for all the stuff I've done over the years...I'm certainly not the biggest modder nor the best modder I know but that aside my content has been enjoyed by a small amount of other people.\n\nNow if I start modding for money, my incentives get switched. Its not really about what I think I want in the game any more, its about what I think people will pay for....that limits my developmental scope quite a bit. There might be an issue that I think really needs a fix, long ignored quest AI bug that most people are happy to ignore because it doesn't break the entire game, but would be better if it was fixed...well why would I fix that and share that fix with others if there was no incentive for others to pay for it? \n\nSo you end up getting a bunch of really talented people having to work in a very limited scope of content that is \"worth money\" and anyone outside of that area...makes no money so they end up feeling as if they have a disincentive to create their mods at all.\n\nThere thousands of top quality mods of course, but you know what really makes the mod community the most fun? Its the million other mods that are literally just there to fix problems with the game or to put a top hat and a monocle on a mudcrab that really make game modding truly great.\n\nWho's going to make a mudcrab with a top hat and a monocle if theres no incentive to do so when modding becomes about money and not about expressing your creative talents in respect to games you love and enjoy? Simple answer to that is no one is.\n\nSo overall, this system goes against the grain of how PC game modding really works. Because while there are some top tier mods made by some outstanding developers that might be worth a few dollars to have, its really not worth losing all the inconsequential mods and content due to the fact that everyone will spend their time working on projects they expect to get paid for, rather than spend time on projects they simply make because they can, or because they love what they are doing.\n\nThat aside, it appears you've taken a lot of what has been said into account and I appreciate that, hopefully this situation can be dealt with in a way that still remains beneficial to all parties involved, but doesn't end up harming the very communities its supposed to benefit.\n\nI'm sure you have people familiar with modding culture on staff, or at least on contract, to be honest, the fact that no one appears to have seen this coming is a bit surprising to me. Anyone that has been part of the TES modding community for the last 15 years would have been extremely familiar with how badly this would be received in its current form.\n\nAnyways, thats my piece which can now get lost in the middle of thousands of others.

It would be great if PC gamers could come together and do to this what they did to Subscription-based Online gaming services like GFWL or more recently \"cloud gaming\" on the PC:\nhttp://www.informationweek.com/software/operating-systems/microsoft-drops-player-fees-on-games-for-windows-live/d/d-id/1070253\n\nhttp://money.cnn.com/2012/08/18/technology/onlive/ http://toucharcade.com/2015/04/03/onlive-shutting-down/\n\nThis decision will have far-reaching consequences into what happens with the Modding scene and possibly the entire PC gaming ecosystem as a whole into the future.\n\nFrankly, this is just such a monumentally stupid decision and a red mark (putting the writing on the wall of what is to come) that it makes me feel unsafe to continue using Steam as a main Digital Distribution platform into the future (and I\u2019ve used it for 9 years and have over 700 games). I tolerated items in Team Fortress 2 and DOTA 2 because they were F2P and just cosmetic, I tolerated the badges and cards and Community market updates because they were tangential to the actual games and I didn't have to use them, I tolerated the regional price restrictions, but this goes too far. I will likely switch to GoG with their Galaxy release beginning with The Witcher 3 Retail as my main platform. I also planned to buy a Valve Streaming box and VR headset when they come out, which is going to be put on ice for now.\n\nThis isn't going to end anywhere beneficial for PC Gaming or gamers at large and Valve needs to be taken down a peg, it already has a very worrying share of the PC market and instead of making new games, fixing bugs and thinking of better ways to use Steam and add new wanted features they are just using that market position and thinking of various ways on how to further monetize features that have been free or didn\u2019t need monetizing. \n\nYou essentially want to turn Modding into an effortless free \"DLC scheme\".\n\nThere\u2019s nothing to say that in 2-3 years from now companies like ZeniMax or similar will start DMCAing and suing sites like the Nexus and consider it as Copyright Infringement/Piracy that they allow people to download \"free Mods\" and they get no cut off of it similar to how Nintendo already does with YouTube videos after they recognized that there might be a market to extract some money.

The implementation is completely idiotic and needs a complete overhaul. Cancel the experiment; it's already lost you a ton of money and goodwill. Your actions have already killed tons of popular mods, and more to come -- SkyUI is becoming paid-only, which is a mod that thousands of other mods rely on. We are losing uncountable content overnight.\n\nAnd you are answering softball questions on /r/gaming.\n\nThis is utterly disappointing.\n\nNow, for some questions and specifics.\n\nPROBLEM 1.\n\n* 1) 75% of the revenue goes to Valve and the publisher.\n\nThis is one of the most important problems people have with this. People already bought the game, mods (and the existence of mods) help sell the games just by existing, and now you (and Bethesda) want to dip into the wallets of consumers years after the game has stopped receiving any kind of update.\n\nAnd you do this by completely shafting the people who want to make content, by offering a measly 25% for doing - let's face it - all of the design and artwork most of the time.\n\nWhy? Why this, instead of a donation button? Why this instead of a Patreon model? If you want to get people used to the idea that paying for mods is a thing they want to be doing, you should nudge them in the direction of the guy who is making money off of modding Cities: Skylines right now. *That's working.*\n\nThis isn't about making modders get paid for their work. If it was, a Patreon system to get people into the idea would be much, much more effective. This isn't about wanting modders to get paid. Valve and Bethesda take a MASSIVE cut off the work of someone else, and you couldn't justify that under a Patreon model.\n\nIs this just because you want people to get used to paying for mods ahead of time, so that when the time comes - and it is fast approaching - where, for certain games, ALL mods on the workshop will be paid-only, that practice will be much more accepted?\n\nPROBLEM 2.\n\n* There is zero quality control. It is currently buyer beware, and Valve is offering refunds for obvious and immediate scams or abuses of the system -- *within a 24 hour period after purchasing.*\n\nThis is another problem. Your laissez fair attitude towards content in your workshop, however laudable you may think it is, means that most of the content on the store will be shitty skins, useless trinkets, or - as we've already seen - *early-access mods with benefits given to people who buy them early*, and *in-game popups asking players to pay for and use the paid version of the mod they are using*.\n\nWe are seeing a lot of mods that used to be free, but now aren't -- and we are seeing mods that were uploaded without the consent of the original creator. And the only thing we can do about this is report it, that your legendary customer service may occasionally take a peek at it?\n\nThat's what you're selling us?\n\n**Intermediate and longevity problems:**\n\nPROBLEM 1.\n\n* Mods have all sorts of compatibility issues. When modders come together to work on things for free, you get the Nexus, a place where modders collaborate and offer solutions to compatibility issues with other people's mods.\n\nThere is no such system in place on Steam, and modders are under no obligation to make their mods compatible with anyone else's, nor offer support for people who have these issues. They are not required to fix anything broken.\n\nOnce the game updates, will the mod remain compatible? Frequently the answer is no, as API changes are frequent and things break on a regular basis. Like the above situation, modders are under no obligation to patch their mod to work with the latest game (and it would be unreasonable to expect it). You are buying something that may be entirely transient.\n\nLike with point one, when mods are free, modders are much more likely to collaborate with each other, offer patches, offer compatibility updates, and generally rely on each other's content. Very frequently, mods have other mods as requirements and dependencies. SkyUI is the most prominent example right now.\n\nSkyUI is a mod that has been around since the beginning. It is a UI overhaul that adds a lot of accessibility and functionality.\n\nThousands of mods rely on SkyUI to work.\n\nAnd the creator just said SkyUI will now be paid-only.\n\nUnder this new system, content creators will be tempted to scramble for air time and popularity. They will be better off if they do not promote or rely on other mods at all, or do anything that can hurt the sales of their own content. They may even engage in anti-consumer practices. *That is what is happening here.* This limits the overall quality of content and hurts the consumer.\n\nWhat happens if SkyUI refuses people to make money off their work for free? What happens if paid content depends on free content from elsewhere when they are under no obligation to share their revenue with their dependencies? I don't think Steam has any idea what is going to happen here.\n\nAlso, how will you determine the legality of not only the actual mods, but of the games themselves once mods are front and centre as a selling point on Steam? How will you deal with mods using unlicensed names of people, vehicles, guns, or other gaming characters? How will you deal with regional problems with mods introducing (or reintroducing) cut content that is illegal in some countries, but not others?\n\nThis is not a stable environment.\n\nI think this is a humongous misstep from Valve. PC mods being free is a large part of why so many games have enjoyed such longevity for so long, and putting everyone on an even playing field so to speak is why I love the PC platform on the whole. Additionally, I have problems with the heavily abusable system to the incredibly skewed monetization (with 75% of the revenue going to Valve and the game publisher rather than the person who did the work on the mod).\n\nEveryone completely hates your system, Gabe.

A game's value is increased by the presence of a robust modding community, as its longevity and re-playability are increased at 0 cost to the developer. \n\nNow you want to take these mods, give 45% of the money paid for them to the developer for something that was already enhancing their game and thus making it more attractive to people who might have not yet purchased it. \n\nExample: \n\nCrusader Kings II was released by Paradox Interactive. While it does has some paid DLC (made by the developers) it is also open to non-paid mods. One of the most popular mods out there is the [Game of Thrones](http://www.moddb.com/mods/crusader-kings-2-a-game-of-thrones-ck2agot) mod, which transforms the game from a game about Europe to the fictional world presented in the novels. \n\nTo a person who doesn't really care about Medieval Europe, but who might be a fan of GoT, this mod has suddenly made this game a more attractive purchase option. Thus, at no cost to the developer, the potential market for this game has increased. \n\nThe moment you put payments into a mod, then fights over whom is using who's assets begin. Many mods are created using derived and shared assets from other mods. They aren't done to steal from the original, but merely add to it. \n\nSay I make a custom shield mod, and somebody makes a custom shield store mod, that uses my shield (among many other assets). Can the shield store mod be sold without my consent? On the flipside, can I object to the entire shield store mod on the basis that a small portion of it borrows my asset? When you consider the hundreds of different assets that can be used between mods, ownership issues become a mess. A mess that does not exist if mods are free. \n\nPlease: Reverse this policy, and add a donation button to the mods. See exactly what Nexus is doing for the mods hosted on their site.

I think you were ill-advised on the economic impacts of monetization of something that was once free. I fear Varoufakis' departure has left a hole in Valve's understanding of human behaviour and economics.\n\nCosts and rewards can take many forms, not just financial forms, and when you push one specific \"currency type\" (pride/guilt, money and social capital can all fit into this concept) as a means to acquire a service or product, you push out the others, sometimes for a long time. \n\nThere's actually a [study on day-cares in Israel](http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/gneezy/pub/docs/fine.pdf) that illustrates that point really well. Many people know it from Freakonomics and/or some form of low-level Econ class. To summarize; parents often came to get their children late, forcing day-care employees to stay at work longer than their scheduled hours, creating problems. Following the idea that financial costs are deeply linked to human incentives, the day-care centers elected to put a financial price on late pick-ups, in order to discourage them. The complete opposite happened. Because of the appearance of the financial cost associated with the late pick-ups, parents stopped feeling the moral cost of being late and negatively impacting the day-cares' workers. They felt entitled to being late as long as they paid. The problem grew worse. \n\nWhat's the link to this current predicament? By opening monetization of mods you're going to push away modders who made things for their personal pride and/or social capital, and you'll bring in those who make things solely for money. This won't just make the old modders sad, it'll make your workshops an absolute shitfest. Actual modders will get their mods stolen, it'll take massive manhours to try and regulate the market, and the quality modders will simply move on to other things, disgusted. What you'll be left with is the typical app store shovelware, with the customer raging as he tries to find a mod that's actually worth acquiring. Everybody loses, even the scammers (who only lose time).\n\nI truly think you should consider the proposal to let people donate to modders. Valve and the devs can still get a cut of revenue (say 40%) and everyone will be happy about it. Why you didn't go with this option is, to be very honest, rather surprising.\n\n^ps: ^I'm ^available ^to ^work ^on ^these ^things ^with ^you ^guys ^since ^I'm ^finishing ^my ^M.Sc. ^like... ^right ^now.

There is no one who benefits from these transactions other than you or Bethesda.**  \n  \n* You claim that this is helping modders by giving them a revenue stream, but what you don't address is that this turns previously hobbyist work into a product.  \n  \n* As a product, consumers have expectations (rightfully so) that products they purchase must work and be worth the amount charged. This means that these paid modders will be the only ones who shoulder the burden and backlash anytime something in their mod either breaks or conflicts with another mod. Thus these modders for a measly 25% are roped into doing massive amounts of **required** updating and patching or or will have their reputation dragged through the mud by angry consumers.    \n  \n* These products, which are effectively outsourced DLC, place all the fiscal responsibility onto the modders who shoulder the start up cost, before they can begin selling the mod in the hope of recouping their losses. Meanwhile Bethesda and you (Valve) simply profit of these works which you invested nothing into. This encourages cheaper more shallow mods from those who begin with the intent of making a \"career\" off of modding.  \n  \n* Any problems that due arise as a result of a bad or broken mod now are negatively harming a paid consumer. Whereas before, if a mod broke something it was understandable due to its free nature, now mods must be ensured as working correctly or you are selling a defective product.  \n  \n* By taking a 75% cut of these mods you and Bethesda are effectively asking a modder to pay you to add value to your platform and Bethesda's game\n  \n* The \"returns\" you offer punish the consumer because any money put into the Steam store that they refund is locked within the store replacing it with your \"funny money\". I realize that there is not a way for you to truly refund the purchaser without incurring bank fees, but this system is abusive.\n  \n**2. The modding community has always working in such a way where most extensive/impressive mods were the result of massive amounts of collaborations between the modding community.**\n  \n* This has already occurred as a problem with Skyrim where Art of the Catch was using another modders work as a basis for its own.\n  \n* By adding money into the equation there will now be infighting and paranoia by those modders who want to get paid versus those who expect their products to be free and don't want their work used as the basis for someone else's paid mod.\n  \n* Additionally in the case of such a widespread support mod such as Skyrim Script Extender (they are choosing not to sell it), it would be unfair for it to be sold because doing so would require every consumer to purchase it in order to purchase any other mod that required it thus increasing the amount which players are being forced to spend. Additionally it increases the effective price of all these secondary mods which again, only benefits you and Bethesda.\n  \n**3. There is very little value in many of the products being offered versus the game's official content.**  \n  \n* The 2 major official expansions for Skyrim released at a price point of $20. The shadow scale set mod is being sold for $2. This means that I could buy one suit of armor for 1/10th the price of an expansion build by a professional team which has new characters, quests, voice acting, items, abilities, (in the case of Dawnguard) new weapon types.  \n  \n* The way this system works modders will always be incentivized to overprice their own work or contribution because they only ever see 25% of the product, in a market which is going to become highly competitive in fighting over players funds. This means either the modders will need to maintain high prices with less sales to make a return, or more sales at a lower price point. Both cases where only you and Bethesda are making any real profit.  \n\n**4. There is no oversight within this system.

These are things like SKSE (code / scripting database), Wrye Bash (mod compiler for unifying multiple mods in the same category), Boss Mods (for properly deciding and sorting mod load orders), SkyUI (complete UI overhaul that many other mods rely on) and many more.\n\nI cannot see paid mods in the workshop doing anything but stifling mod development in the future if even ONE of these mods become a paid mod (which is already the case for SkyUI). This means that 100s of mods that use this as a dependency are now behind a paywall.\n\nHow do you plan on dealing with the complexity of mod dependencies in the Workshop? Will there be warnings if you try to buy a mod and you don't own another mod it requires? Is this something Steam can even track?\n\n**Issue 3**\n\nWhat prevents people from simply decompiling mods and removing DRM-esque features? Given DMCA's do not cover mods. \n\nMod ESPs are purposely made to be easily edited and viewed. I've already edited several mods that added certain ads or limitations to their free version to force people to buy the paid one.\n\nRight now I don't publish them merely out of respect of their original authors, however I've already gotten plenty of messages ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING me to upload these to Nexus Mods in order to bypass Steam's paywall.

So you have to return the $5 mod or disable (throwaaway) the $2 mod, and that only works if you discover the problem within the 24 hour period. Otherwise you have to choose what paid mod you use.\n\nThere are just an insane number of ways for mods to break or interact poorly with the game or other mods. Be that the mod actually breaking a part of the game or just unbalancing it or destroying immersion. A few of the current mods for sale actually just give you 1 hit kill weapons within the first 5-10 minutes of gameplay.

However, once you start selling a mod as a product you have a certain amount of responsibility to the consumer. Which happens in CS:GO, or Dota 2, or TF2 because Valve acts as a wrapper for the mod.\n\nMod -&gt; greenlight -&gt; Valve picks it up (refine, polish, officially fitted into the game) -&gt; released in the Steam store as a Valve product\n\nYou have a very clear path where Valve is a partner with the modder to make the content official. The consumer isn\u2019t buying from the modder, but Valve and Valve maintains the responsibility of selling the mod as a working product.\n\nWhat is happening here is pure fucking insanity. It will create so many support tickets and so many witch hunts. You know the modder has his name on the product and he stops updating after selling lets say 50,000 units (super popular mod) . The mod breaks and the modder doesn\u2019t want to deal with it (the bug is too big or he just doesn\u2019t feel like it. whatever) one of those pissed of consumers posts something to a few forums, and voila we have a witch hunt.\n\nA donation system avoids all of this by not making a mod a product. Now you say \"but people don't donate\" and I say bull fucking shit. People don't donate because it takes minutes to find out where to donate, it takes minutes to create a paypal, it takes minutes to donate with paypal. There is nothing easy about it, and this is in a world where your website will get dramatically fewer visitors if it takes over a second to load. \n\nOn the mod page you have a donate button. Linked to your fucking steam wallet. HOLY MOTHER OF GOD, EASE OF USE IS IN TOWN. Tied to that fucking button you have a few Steam badges, maybe one for each game. All you have to do is donate $1. That;s it and you get a fucking badge and 200 XP. Every motherfucker loves fake numbers. Holy shit, we have ease of use and incentive for initial use. Now, in addition to all of this shit you allow a certain amount of donated money $3, lets say, to give the user an extra trading card drop, if you donate $5 you get an extra booster drop. Holy shit! We have ease of use, incentive for the initial usage, and incentive for return usage. Valve can take some fucking money from this and so can Bethesda or whoever the fuck else. OH MY FUCKING GOD, DID YOU SEE THAT!?!?!

We have no incentivized the user to donate again, and again.\n\n4: Valve and the Dev take their cut (be nice and take %50 or some shit).

This logic extends to a lesser extent to making poor game mechanic and balance design decisions, making subpar graphics, and creating inconveniences for the player.\n&gt; \n&gt; It just so happens that Skyrim has four unofficial patches--one for the base game and each expansion--that are considered mandatory to install before doing any modding, and highly recommended even without mods. It also has several overhaul mods to fix game mechanics and balance, a plethora of graphical improvement mods, and at least one that lets you enchant items in the most commonly used player home (Breezehome in Whiterun) instead of having to travel to the other side of the city to do so.\n&gt; \n&gt; I urge you to reconsider your company's decision to offer paid mods.", "gilded": 0, "score": 135, "created": 1429995259.0},{"body": "I know you're buried by this and a very busy man (now more than usual) but I hope I can cut through and talk with you for a moment. Even if you have to reply days, weeks or even a month or two later I would sincerely appreciate it.\n\nIt took me time to really put together my thoughts on this in a constructive way and I'll try not to waste your time.\n\nI think a large portion of why this upset people comes from the incredible interdependence of mods and the hours of help put forth and assets given freely to help people with the communal understanding that we're all doing this for free. It's very disheartening to spend many hours helping with a mod that is strictly for the benefit of the community and then it becomes monetized.\n\nAnother part of this interdependence comes up when a mod that is in many ways a framework for others is made into paid software, effectively placing all the mods that work with that one behind a paywall. The scariest example for us as modders and players is SkyUI, which because of this debacle I have already begun a fork to provide a community alternative. \n\nThen we have the equity of the situation. Bethesda would never have sold anywhere near the same number of copies of their games without the modding community, but the monetization push seems not to recognize that. Specifically the revenue split is (and I don't like saying this) appalling, deeply offensive and completely tone deaf. Bethesda made money indirectly from modding for a long time and while there's not really a good way to show that on a spreadsheet it's absolutely there. \n\nWhat made that worse is how the numbers were touted and paraded as though the share the mod maker got was generous. I want to emphasize that it was in no way even approaching a fair split and actually showed a sense of entitlement to the author's work that is obscene. Frankly although it's unlikely for many reasons I feel that sort of insulting undervaluation of the modders' worth deserves not just making it right, but an apology.\n\nLast is centered around quality and positioning: With this monetization of mods a market force not entirely unlike that of Google Play and the Apple App Store enters the realm. I'm sure you're quite aware that from a gamer's perspective those are horrible cash grab wastelands, and while they certainly make money they don't make games with anything like the artistic and cultural impact Deus Ex, HL1&amp;2, Portal and Skyrim do.\n\nThen as I'm sure you know mods break all the time. They break to all hell. Save games with 300 hours get lit ablaze at Skyrim silently crashes to desktop. If someone made it in their free time and gave it away then whatever right? Once it's for sale it's a product and EULA TOS and whatever be damned, I expect it to work. I expect that when an update for whatever shows up and breaks something that it will get fixed. I expect that since Valve is endorsing and marketing this product that Valve should make it work and not leave me to plead with a mod maker who is in no way obligated to help.\n\nLastly even unmodded Skyrim fully updated crashes, is full of oversights and bugs that Bethesda has been made aware of, but did not choose to fix. The unofficial patches are virtually required to render the game to a state that is in the eyes of most players acceptable. No matter what patches you use you still can't utilize the bloody display cases in the offical Hearthfire DLC! Even the main questline often breaks without these patches and Bethesda wants to monetize these mods and take the lion's share of the revenue. \n\nOver a year ago Bethesda declared Skyrim \"done\" and left the bugs outstanding. The bugs we've done our level best to fix to make their product fully playable. To stroll back in for an indecently sized revenue double dip based on our work that they've already profited from a year later is not really a friendly move. They didn't even patch their own DLC before this to show goodwill.\n\nApologies for the length and I sincerely hope you can sorry this out.

The following are issues that have arisen over the past two years that are morally wrong or far too monetarily based.\n\n1. Trading Cards; a fun and innovative idea that's absolutely tarnished once it becomes more about how much money you're giving to Valve, instead of playing the games and unlocking achievements.\n\n2. Seasonal events; another fun and innovative idea that's absolutely tarnished once it becomes more about how much money you're giving to Valve, instead of participating in event activities and having fun.\n\n3. Steam Greenlight is incredibly inefficient, often times more or less scamming players for products that are unprofessionally maintained and will never be completed, or are simply subpar games to begin with. Valve's lack of quality control on Greenlight allows for cheap marketing tactics and developer abandonment.\n\n4. Steam's refund policy is absolute garbage, and we know this because even EA, the absolute kings of greedy bastards, have a more lenient and chill refund policy than Steam's.\n\n5. Nearly all of Valve's popular games involve and often focus on microtransactions (hats, weapon skins, etc.) instead of actual game content. Valve takes every opportunity to turn fun game mechanics into money grinders, instead of simply letting a game's item acquisition be through enjoyable means-- like just about every ethical company in the games market.\n\n6. Valve's almost unquestioned allowance of developers censoring reviews on their products. Why exactly does Valve see this as acceptable developer behavior?\n\n7. Valve's response to the paid-mod crisis hasn't been silence-- they've been censoring ratings and closing discussions that relate to people's issues with their update, as if to simply shove their middle finger in our faces. Rather than negotiate to form a better and more fair update, they simply stop people from showing their disagreement.\n\n8. Valve's lack of organization and ability to keep promises. Between Half-Life 3, Diretide, and the constant 'Valve Times' that the company is so well known for, it's amazing how Valve has yet to take responsibility for the promises that they make.\n\n9. Steam Gems. Started as a terrible fundraising concept, ended as a terrible fundraising concept. In lieu of a fun seasonal event, Valve introduced bidding for games (that almost always cost more than the game itself) and held events based on how much people bidded.\n\n10. Valve's support system is low-tier and often takes weeks to process the simplest of requests. God forbid you actually have a problem that isn't Googleable, because the chances of you getting a response by the end of the year are laughable.\n\n11. The final straw itself; Valve's implementation of a morally bankrupt system that forbids mod developers to take donations simply so that all revenue, even if in the form of a gift, has to go through the 75% cut.\n\nYour unethical policies have begun to greatly concern me and many other users, and are making Steam a less and less desirable platform for us all.\n\nThank you for your time.", "gilded": 0, "score": 745, "created": 1429995029.0},{"body": "&gt; Nearly all of Valve's popular games involve and often focus on microtransactions (hats, weapon skins, etc.) instead of actual game content.

Mods have been the extra lifeblood of pc gaming, for **me** since I started playing Doom95 20 years ago. \n\nThey have given me and every other single pc gamer a lifetime extension on our favorite games and changed some of our lives.\n\nWhen my mother first bought me Half-life I loaded it up and pressed Quick Online, this sent me through WON to a TFC server. \n\nLittle did I know I was actually playing a mod for HL and it completely blew my mind when I tried singleplayer to find out there was a completely different game. It was so mysterious and expansive, and amazing! Oh what laid in store for me... It didn't take me long to find a PLETHORA of FREE games I could play because I had bought this one game!! I had Firearms, Richochet, Action Half-life, That scientist and Industry, Box huntes, Runaway Train, Counter-strike (I read about it in a gaming magazine and lusted for it like a wild animal...) They hunger, DOD, and endless amount of others...\n\nI thought at the time this was the single best game that could of ever existed. (I still do). \n\nI met a friend playing some HL mod some late night, and he had a server. He loaded up a map he made and explained how I could do the same. That moment changed my life. Although when I finally installed WorldCraft from the HL CD I hadn't quite wrapped my head around orthogonal geometry yet (I was around 9-10 years old, Lol).\n\nAll I could make was huge, flat rectangular blocks. No concept of leaks, skyboxes, etc. Now i'm 25 and i've been building levels for every single game that has an available level editor for over HALF of my life. \n\nWhat else could this game do? A decade of counter-strike and day of defeat, probably by now 50 thousand of hours on WON and then STEAM games...  followed me when I picked up Tribes 2 and Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear later and basically every other game I've ever played. This is why I am a PC gamer, it's in my heart and blood. I'm downloading new tracks, gear, and bikes for MX simulator right now! I gave the sole creator 42 dollars and he seems to have no problem with the THOUSANDS of free HD models and skins that we can instantly use for free to enhance his game! The modders certainly never have more than a donate button because they're using it online too!\n\nThese modders were my heroes and I have spent decades learning how to be like them. I know how to build levels, make models, unwrap and texture, make normals, zbrush, normals, collision, etc etc.\n\nWhen my friends bought consoles I was embarassed for them to find out they had to pay for a subscription JUST to play these stock games online! OR that the ONLY thing they could add or change was in DLC form and it meant they were paying for every single thing from new weapons, locations to freakin desktop backgrounds! Saints Row I believe had the GTA character customization screen, except most of the extras, from sunglasses to purple suits cost them hard cash. This is a pathetic excuse for gaming when you've grown up with the experience I have. This is not the way I want PC GAMING TO GO! I am not against modders possibly earning some cash for their work but a paywall is most certainly NOT the way for pc gaming!\n\nI don't know why i'm explaining this, I just want you to know how much you, Gabe (even if you'll probably never read this bs wall of text), and the free mods your game exposed me to have directly and indirectly effected my life. I just can't fathom how different my experience had been if TFC was a 10.00$ mod, or I hadn't played CS before it went retail... \n\nBasically, you leaving Microsoft to start your own business and John Carmack's parents buying him a computer were some of the best things to ever happen to me!\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 11, "created": 1430263724.0},{"body": "Wow this is an awesome comment :) Late to the party but I read it and loved it!", "gilded": 0, "score": 2, "created": 1430269592.0},{"body": "well spoken", "gilded": 0, "score": 2, "created": 1430270828.0},{"body": "Beautiful", "gilded": 0, "score": 2, "created": 1430289209.0},{"body": "For the entire history of PC modding the mods have been free.

Map packs, skins, cheats.This was perceived as another one of them and proved to be the preverbal straw.  \n\nGaming is already the most expensive of the major entertainment mediums and publishers seem to be looking for more and more ways to make it even more so.

I don't want to have to choose between two of my favorite mods because both of them cost more than the game itself.\n\nFurthermore, DLC is often curated by the developers themselves. There is a reasonable expectation of quality control and devs can be asked to fix any unexpected problems it could cause. Not mods. If you believe that the meager 25 cents a dollar is going to encourage modders to step up their game, you're naive. If a mod is somehow incompatible with a mod you've bought more than 24 hours ago, it means you're either stuck with that one or you've paid actual money for nothing. That won't be the fault of the modder, but it won't stop people from unfairly directing their anger at them. Modding communities often have a reputation for passionate conflicts. Before now, these were ideological, but add money and it is going to be *toxic*.\n\nI believe this system is not conductive to supporting modders, rather it's an easy way for Bethesda to make a quick buck out of an untapped market. Both modders and fans are going to suffer for it, and I think that's unnecessary.\n\nPeople might hate DLC and its various attempts at getting more and more money out of players, but at least it's a fair system to both parties involved.

The other reason they were mad is because the old docking mechanic, where you could stare at your ship and make it spin a lot, was outright removed.\n\nWhen players had this terrific outburst of hatred, CCP just stopped developing it, reintroduced the option of ship spinning without removing what they had of WiS, and went back to fixing actual spaceship stuff.

In particular:\n\n&gt; An absolutely absurd money grab attempt with Valve/Bethesda trying to take 75% for little contribution from Valve and zero additional effort from Bethesda. This was made even worse by Valve's initial non-transparency regarding how the money was being split between them.\n\nThis actually makes more sense than it seems like. Valve took their usual cut that they take from all paid games, no more, no less. It makes sense that Bethesda gets a cut of the rest, because they provided the engine and a ton of the content -- really, if this seems unfair, remember that the alternative is to go make your own game with your own engine and *still* pay Valve 30%. Or license an engine and pay Valve 30% plus some amount to the engine.\n\nBut it probably would've made a lot more sense if these two numbers added up to 50% instead of 75%.\n\n&gt; Zero support from Valve or Bethesda regarding ongoing compatibility of the mods people have already paid for (after the first 24 hours) and zero assurances that the paid mods will be compatible with, even, the other mods for sale on Steam Workshop.\n\nIt's hard to see how you *could* make such a guarantee and still make mods any fun. But how could this be done better, honestly, and who should be liable when things break?\n\nFor example, if Bethesda is liable, then they'll be less likely to patch things than they are -- remember how long it took them to *turn on compiler optimizations* for Skyrim, something any first-year CS student would know how to do? Plus, the best way to make sure all mods are compatible is to make it so mods can't do anything to interfere with another mod, which would hamstring the API and make most of the mods people care about utterly impossible.\n\nBut if mod developers are liable, then how can they hope to make any sort of profit at this? Sooner or later, their mod *will* break and they'll have to either scramble to fix it or lose every penny they made. A time limit would help, but it'd still be a *lot* of work.\n\n&gt; Zero control of bullshit like that one modder that went back to older versions of his/her mod and added pop-up ads nagging the player to buy the for-profit version.\n\nThere's nothing stopping that in the first place. What's stopping Valve from going back and updating the original DotA mod to spam people to upgrade to DotA 2? As far as I can tell, the only thing stopping that for most mods is that most mods don't have an autoupdate system like Steam Workshop.\n\nThat said, it might've been nice to have a rule about this, but it's hard to imagine how to make that fair. Surely if I'm running version 1.2 of some mod (which was free), and version 3.7 is available on the store, I'd want to at least know about it -- so seeing an ad once or twice is probably a Good Thing. Being spammed constantly would be problematic, though.\n\n&gt; As usual for Valve, zero responsibility taken for policing blatant IP theft in the mods. Hell, even in full games, Valve has shown a seeming complete willingness to profit from obvious IP theft in some Steam games...\n\nWhich makes me wonder why people are so pissed about this in mods. It still sucks in full Steam games, but it's not like this is a new problem.\n\n&gt; Valve chose the WORST possible game/developer to start this kind of program with. For as fun as Bethesda games usually are, they are infamous for releasing them absolutely full of bugs (including bugs that make playing and/or beating the game completely impossible) and then NEVER going back to fix them. Some of the very mods that Valve's action could cause to fall behind a pay-wall are mods that people actually NEED just to be able to play the basic game...\n\nYou mean the unofficial patches could actually get some funding?\n\nI see your point -- you shouldn't have to pay more than $60 to get a functioning product. But at the same time, a *ton* of work goes into those...\n\nThe easy fix would be a donate button. A better option might be a Humble Bundle style pay-what-you-want with a suggested amount, to encourage people to pay more, but to let people pay a penny if they really want it for free.\n\nAnd altogether, I think this just goes to show that most people really weren't pissed about the implementation. They were pissed about the basic concept, and they were pissed about some of the more inflammatory buzzwords like \"Greedy\" and \"75%\".

It's completely on Valve to make sure the situation doesn't happen in the future.\n\n&gt;This actually makes more sense...\n\n* No, the money split does NOT make sense.

I helped contribute to Mass Effect mods (MEHEM, CEM, and Harby Module, specifically). Now, I have not contributed to Skyrim mods, but I feel that I have enough experience on modding itself that I can at least have a justified opinion on the subject of Valve charging for mods.\n\nBasically, it is a terrible idea\n\n\"Why is that? Don't good modders deserve support?\" some may ask. Absolutely. Black Mesa, for instance, is a good example of a mod that might deserve monetary compensation. Counter Strike started as a mod too. As a modder and a human, I like money. But this isn't the way to go about it.\nThis situation Valve started is terrible, because it has resulted in, or will result in, the following:\nFirst, Valve, you have now made \"modder\" a dirty word here on the steam forums almost overnight. Thanks a bunch. You have now divided PC consumers and modders, when we used to be a pretty tight bunch.\n\nSecond, I now see mods going up that are little tiny swords and whatnot going up for sale. Bundles already that cost more than the game itself. In other words, I am concerned about a complete influx of mods that are completely useless and tiny and unsupported and updated, just because of money-grabbers who want a piece of the pie.\nThird, this leads to microtransaction hell. Hell for consumers, and a deluge of stuff to compete against for us modders. This isn't healthy competition. It is gonna be cutthroat. Thanks again for taking the fun out of it.\n\nFourth, there will be inevitable stealing of other's people's content and then selling it as their own. Some may claim that because they modified another mod's content, they now have created their own mod and are free to sell. I disagree. They are making money at the expense of others.\n\nFifth, you have a \"return policy,\" if it is even worth of the name, that is full of holes. First, 24hrs isn't much time to test if a mod will glitch out or not. Ever heard of a standard 14 or 30 day return policy? Let's say a consumer buys a mod, then one week later the modder releases an update. This update has a bug, and the game crashes or glitches out. Then let's say, for whatever reason (even a good one. Like real life got in the way) the modder doesn't release an update to fix the bug. Before today, big deal. You could either uninstall the mod or revert to a previous version. Given it was free, most people wouldn't complain too much. But NOW, a consumer will likely be stuck with a useless piece of software they paid good money for. Software that now is worth zilch. They will be, understandably, really upset, with no way to get their money back.\n\nLastly, you, Valve, are likely hurting good, legal sites like Nexus Mods as some greedy people take their mods, or the \"premium versions\" off the site in favor of posting to the Steam Workshop. These sites rely on advertising revenue to run, and you will very likely hurt this revenue. Why do that? You used to have a reputiation of siding with the underdog. It is not like you are in competition with people like Nexus. It is not like they are EA, taking a corner of the market. And it isn't even like you really need the money Valve. This just feels to me like a cash cow. A move EA would be proud of, sadly.\nAs a modder, I disapprove of this move Steam.

Some mods being monetized were required elements of hundreds of other mods and utterly vital to modding the game at all.  Example:  SkyUI.  All of those hundreds of other mods requiring SkyUI were developed by people who never expected that users might have to pay for something else.  That alone broke the modding community.\n\n4.

If they hadn't allowed compilations of mods from lots of different authors to be sold by a single person without any credit to the many contributors, it would've been different. If it didn't completely break the experience of modding the game for the user, it would be different.\n\nBut it was going to do all of those things and was amazingly, astonishingly poorly thought out.

Why waste your time sharing an advanced mod when someone else is just going to put lipstick on it and sell it for $1.99? Why waste your time extending an existing mod (a lot of Skyrim mods depend on SkyUI, for instance) when the original developer can convert it to a paid mod at any time? Abandoned mods right now are often picked up by other developers to keep it active. All that collaboration that made the modding community great goes out the window.\n\nThen there's copyright issues. A lot of mods are made quickly because they are not bogged down by copyright. Who cares where you found that texture or soundbyte? Throw it in. It's non-commercial fair use. Use assets from a different game if you want to. Mods based on movie franchises, or celebrities, or real products/companies, are all fair game.

Just select your vanilla profile from a dropdown or untick all your mods\n\nThat said, there are a lot of people who use NMM successfully and are happy with it.

There are many reasons why people are upset with this change.\n\n&gt;1. It is changing a system that has been working fine.  Modders aren't an oppressed class working without benefit.  Modders choose to work on mods for many reasons: fun, practice, boredom, the joy of creating something.   And gamers appreciate their contributions.  While, some gamers may feel entitled most understand that if a modder is unable to continue the mod may be abandoned.  Donations may or may not help but they are an option.  This system has for years made PC gaming what it is.  Modding in my opinion is the primary benefit of PC gaming over console.  Changing a functional system is dangerous and could have unintended consequences.\n\n&gt;2. Now that people are paying for mods they will feel entitled for these mods to continue working.  If a free mod breaks and isn't supported that is fine because there is no obligation for it to continue working.  If someone pays though they will expect the mod to be updated and continue working as the base game is updated.  Furthermore, abandoned but popular mods are often revived by other people; if these mods are paid then the original creator may not want people to profit off of updated versions of their mod.\n\n&gt;3. Related to the above paid mods may reduce cooperative modding.  Many mods will borrow elements from other mods; usually with permission.  Having paid mods will complicate things.  Someone who makes a paid mod will be unlikely to share his/her work with others.  What if someone freely share's his/her mod and someone incorporates it into a paid mod?  Does the first mod's owner deserve compensation, does the second modder deserve the full revenue.  This makes modding more politically complicated and may reduce cooperation.\n\n&gt;4. This may reduce mods based off of copyrighted works.  There is a very good chance that any paid mod based off of a copyrighted work will be shutdown.  Modders could still release free mods of this nature but it complicates the issue.  Many mods based on copyrighted materials borrow (usually with permission) from other mods to add improvements.  If these other mods are paid then the original creators likely won't let them use it.  Additional many modders may now ignore copyrighted mods in order to make mods that they may profit on.\n\n&gt;5.  Steam/the developer are taking an unfairly large portion of the profit.  Steam and the Developers are offering nothing new to the situation.  Steam is already hosting the mods and the developer already made the game.  They now wish to take 75% of all profit from the mod.  If the market gets flooded by low-quality paid mods, the modders will likely make very little and the quality of the game will not be increased.  However, Steam and the Developers will make money off of no work on there part.  \n\n/u/Martel732\n\nEdit: uuh this is just the comment [link] (https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/33nxep/slug/cqmw1qq), y'know if you vote on this comment please vote on this dude's too.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 248, "created": 1429854694.0},{"body": "I don't mind you quoting me if you think I made valid points.
