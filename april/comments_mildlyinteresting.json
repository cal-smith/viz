Since its inception, the band underwent a number of line-up changes. Known for its grindcore musical style and controversial lyrics, Anal Cunt released eight full-length studio albums in addition to [a number of compilations and extended plays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_Cunt_discography). On June 11, 2011, the band's frontman and founder [Seth Putnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Putnam) died of a suspected heart attack,  ending the band.\n\n&gt;They have been categorized as [grindcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindcore),    noisecore,  [noisegrind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindcore) and [hardcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk).  The band is often referred to by their initials A.C. (often written as AxCx) due to the offensive nature of their name and [censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship) limits on some radio and publications, and many of their album covers simply display the initials A.C. However, the band managed to subvert even this abbreviation by drawing these letters in a manner resembling an [anus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus) and a [vulva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulva). Their early material contained no pre-written lyrics or music. Rather, the band developed a style which consisted of extremely loud, fast, and aggressive noise that was created entirely on the spot. Over the years, the band eventually shifted their style and slowly began to incorporate more riffs and pre-written lyrics into their songs. It was not until then that the band earned the reputation (at least via their recordings) for intentionally being outrageous and offensive. In 2011, they released a \"[cock rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cock_rock)\" album entitled *[Fuckin' A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuckin%27_A)*. An album of material similar to their old grindcore albums called *Wearing Out Our Welcome* was released digitally in 2010. \n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/dsc2Jz8.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Seth_with_AxCx_at_Relapse_Festival_1993_crop.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Anal ^Cunt ^discography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_Cunt_discography) ^| [^Everyone ^Should ^Be ^Killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyone_Should_Be_Killed) ^| [^Top ^40 ^Hits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_40_Hits) ^| [^Picnic ^of ^Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picnic_of_Love) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cqlyh01) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cqlyh01)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "score": 5, "created": 1429796079.0},{"body": "What the fuck", "gilded": 0, "score": 2, "created": 1429798251.0},{"body": "What I always find so hilarious about this band is that it comes out of Newton, Mass.

They have used the most basic cheapest model VW sells as their comparison point, because they know that the rest of the model lineup services are significantly more expensive.  See below:\n\n1) Transmission Service.  Most VW's use a DSG dual clutch transmission.  The fluid and filter should be replaced at least every 45k miles.  The cost for materials and service?  $600\n\n2) Spark plugs are at least $100 a set for a 4 cylinder engine, and they like to bill at least 2 hours of labor (possibly much more if you have plugs that are hard to access)  What they are leaving out is the fact that you're usually going to need new coil packs as well when you replace the plugs (they like to go out every 40k or so)  Add another $400 to your bill.\n\n3) Pollen filter, I actually don't really have anything to say here.  The filter is about $40, so the labor charged here is not *that* bad.\n\n4) This is also a decent deal.  Oil + filter runs at least $45-50 so this is a pretty good deal.  Definitely a loss leader for the dealership.\n\n5) $20 for a tire rotation is a bit ridiculous.  Most tire places will do it for free (America's tire, etc.)\n\nOverall I love German cars, but if you don't learn to DIY you are going to be spending a lot of money to keep them running.  Most of the things on this list are very easy things to do even for people with no mechanical skill.
