Asked my wife if she's excited that 81,000 people have looked at a photo of her walking around a model village this evening.
Response: "I couldn't be less excited. Go to sleep"
She's not even mildlyinterested :(

 Right! That's it! I'm taking my views back.. [deleted] [Erm.](http://i.imgur.com/xQa2TMY.gif) Not sure that's him. No middle finger showing. I think this is CGI. [Sigh](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/4925.gif) Dentarthurdent I couldn't help but read that in a British accent. It certainly does sum up a lot of what comprises Britishness in a nutshell:

An indignant yet petty demand for recompensation overshrouded by a subtle, glum feeling of knowing full well the argument is sadly rather futile in itself; as well as being actually terribly apologetic that one has had no choice but to reach the end of one's tether and regrettably abandon the shy comforts of politeness. [The American version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk7fYBw6PfQ) Jim Carrey is brilliant. Ugh. Stop. 
http://imgur.com/tWhGSgs That moment when OP knows he's not getting laid tonight. Wake her up. Ask her if 461,000 people looking at the photo excites her. Evidently it excites *you*. Requesting AMA of OP's wife. But..but.. We have to know what our views are worth. Sounds like a model citizen.  Regretful upvote Tell her you posted in gonewild She is already there under user name /u/pillagethisvillage  You bastard. That's a fucking amazing username. It's now over half a million people!!


How can she not be excited??


Your wife unreasonably irritates me.. Nearly 700,000 already.  At this rate it'll be a cool million by midnight (EST). I feel like this is the sort of ludicrous thing that could only happen in Britain. Splendid.  It reminds me of this joke from the British show "Look Around You": http://i.imgur.com/43UWPbB.jpg

I couldn't find the actual clip on YouTube (it was from the "Iron" episode in season 1), so this image will have to to do.  I fucking love 'look around you' 

"Set your calculator to 'maths' mode" Every time I watch that series I catch something new.

Narrator: (cutting into a boiled egg) Make sure you look out for the release of the new albumen... (the egg cracks open) It's out now. What *are* birds? [We just don't know.](http://i.imgur.com/5ZUtoRY.jpg) Thanks ants. Thants. Bless you ants. Blants.  There's a part where they're boiling eggs and an off camera scientist keeps reaching in to pull them out and everytime he does his hand becomes redder and shakier. I have never felt more proud to be British.  Not even during the Olympics? That was pretty cool too That opening ceremony. More British than tossing off a bulldog. While using HP sauce as lube, singing God save the Queen, at a pub, for Sunday Dinner.   Where do I get this Harry Potter sauce? Morrisons. It's Hewlett-Packard sauce, silly Hermione?  They seem to be carved out of single bricks of Cotswold stone, whereas the larger models are actual laid bricks and other materials. I think it would be hard to do the same on a smaller level. The larger ones are mostly set concrete, aside from things like the roof tiles etc.  I've been going there since I was a kid - the village has been there at least 40 years. They should keep going using 3D printers, it wouldn't cost much and it could go to a minuscule scale! No not Ludacris. Xzibit.  Yo dawg, I heard you like model model model villages...  TIL two of the next villages are "Upper Slaughter" and "Lower Slaughter". I wouldn't go there by night.

https://goo.gl/maps/MB1ik Sounds like an MMO raid.  LFM Upper Slaughter 1 tank 1 dps - can summon LF tank/healer.  Don't have key.  Pls whisper I remember when "please send tell", or PST, became a thing, and it has driven me crazy ever since. Of course I'm going to send you a tell, the hell am I gonna do, talk to you over the spam of hundreds of people in OOC? And here I am thinking people were saying their timezone to find people with same schedules. Don't I feel silly.  TIL every MMO player lives on the west coast.

But yes, that's what I thought first as well. Whoa! I always thought "pst" was shorthand for whisper! Like, you know, *psst... hey you, orc...* but "please send tell" has been around way before whispering. sending tells is everquest stuff.

 Interestingly, Upper Slaughter is one of the few "Doubly Thankful" villages in England, owing to all of their enlisted men and women returning home safely from both World Wars I and II. One of only 13 villages in England and Wales.
53 *Thankful*, 13 *Doubly Thankful*.
Tellingly, France has only one Thankful Village and no Doubly Thankful villages, they suffered even more than we did... I wonder how many there are in Russia. Probably zero. Unless there was a Siberian hamlet where only one man was enlisted and he got lost in the bureaucratic shuffle for the entire war. some would say a substantial number of the 30 million were lost because of the bureaucratic shuffle during the war...... So there's no memorials? Or did they make one anyway?

Seems every town/village has a war memorial with a list of their dead.  They should just have a blank plaque. Despite the names they are probably the most idyllic places around the Cotswolds! Getting married nearby. Lower Slaughter also contains "The Slaughters Country Inn" and "Lower Slaughter Manor". Aside from the unexplainable feeling of impending death, it's a nice place. Been there many times, the village is also home to Brum which is a tiny yellow car that had it's own tv program where it would go on adventures.  Oh my god, I remember that show. Having just moved to the UK I'm  blown away by how close I am to so much of the stuff I've watched and listened to my whole life. Brum was exported? Where are you from? Can confirm. I remember watching it while growing up here in Denmark. Yeah, it was. I know it was at least on tv throughout my childhood in Australia. Yep, another Australian here. It was also in Croatia, watched it here. This is almost as mad as when I heard Serbians love 'Only fools and horses'..  Why? I love it too, it was really popular here. I don't really know. I just never expected it to have been exported. Like Brum. 

I guess the wheeler dealer Del Boy character is pretty universal, so it makes sense.  Yes! At least to Sweden, but probably a few other countries as well. And I thought it was only called 'Brum'  in Sweden because the name makes a lot of sense in Swedish - that's the word for the sound that cars make.  Brum is also a British onomatopoeia too. 'Brum brum'! Ah so many good memories as a toddler watching Brum German too. Except it's written with two m. "Brumm, brumm!" Not only that, but Brum is a nickname for the city of Birmingham, which is where the programme was set and filmed.

source: I'm from Birmingham. Also my dad used to know the 'owner' of Brum who appears in the opening of each episode. Ask him for an AMA! &gt;the village is also home to Brum

Okay, this submission is now /r/veryinteresting.  Surely Birmingham is Brum's *true* home. I knew that I'd been to this model village before! My grandparents took me to the small museum type building where Brum is years ago. Good memories :) this is borderline /r/veryinteresting /r/interestingasfuck Since a black hole was created with should be upgraded to /r/Beyondinteresting   With what? Argh! The model in a model in a model, come on a black hole is bound to be made when it reaches past the size of an atom. I'd say definitely more than mild, near the top of very, bordering on as fuck but maybe not quite in there.  http://i.imgur.com/vZWLIA5.gif I had to make [this](http://imgur.com/a/NlZ8V) to undestand what's going on. Thanks, was trying to find the smallest model and couldn't. but there it is in purple!!  Stupid op how is that the top left corner Well done. Surprisingly confusing. Is this the same village where the movie [Hot Fuzz](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/) was set in? I was thinking that, too. Turns out, it's [not](http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/h/hotfuzz.html), but I couldn't find a mention of the little model village in the film, so that bit may very well have been filmed in Bourton instead.  As far an I can tell, the model village was built specifically for the film, at Hatfield House in Hertfordshire.

I grew up not too far from Bourton-on-the-Water and could quickly tell, when visiting the Model Village, that it isn't the same one from the film. It would have been cool if it was though, Simon Pegg grew up in the village next to mine and it would have been a nice shout out to Gloucestershire. Wait, I was there when they were filming that! Holy shit, I'd completely forgotten, but I was visiting Hatfield House with my parents and I remember seeing a model village and upside down police car and being really confused. I'd forgotten about it until now Lots of villages in Britain have model villages Why? Why not? They're cool as hell.  Why do we have them or why in Britain?

We have them because they're cool and tourists like them.

In Britain because that's where the villages are.

Seriously though, I don't know why it's a mainly British phenomenon. Maybe it isn't and I'm misinformed. Most of the villages also have a village within a village but most don't go down as for as OP's. For the greater good.  I was looking for the church steeple Owwww! Thith weeally hurths. He used to be James Bond, you know. Ahh, how the mighty have fallen ^^^^onto ^^^^tiny ^^^^churces Most people didn't care for him as Bond. Honestly of all the Bonds, I found his to be the most realistic. For me, in realism, his is second to Craigs. But I do prefer Dalton over Moore and some of Brosnan. That scene made me cringe so hard...  [You wanna be a big cop in a small town? Fuck off up the model village.](https://youtu.be/HWgYVeCqJ-8) You want to be a bigger cop in a smaller town? Fuck off up the model model village. I always thought that was a mini golf course or something. Also.. oowwweeee this really hurts. I used to work on the gate of bourton model village for like 2 years and no, hot fuzz was not filmed there. I think they based the location on a Cotswold village like bourton but it was all filmed Somerset way. Oasis filmed a music video there though when i was working there, can't remember which song it was for though But it was the model village where 'Nativity 3: Dude, where's my donkey' filmed a scene. http://xkcd.com/878/ [Image](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/model_rail.png)

 Hey no nesting what irks me the most about this comic is that they forgot to add "dx." x^2 is a 0-form.  Integrating it at a gives you a^(2).  This is important because it allows one to generalise the fundamental theorem of calculus, as Stokes' Theorem.

----
Stokes' Theorem says that the integral of a k-form  over the boundary of a region  is equal to the integral of d (the exterior derivative of ) over .

Thus, since d(f(x)) = f'(x) dx, 

integral_(f'(x) dx) = integral_(d(f(x)))

= integral_(f(x))

In 1D,  is a subset of **R** (assume open interval WLoG).  So let  = (a,b).  Then  = {a,b} and we get that

integral^(b)_a(f'(x)dx) = f(b)-f(a)

Which is the 1D fundamental theorem of calculus.

EDIT:  Note:  the -1 coefficient of f(a) comes from the orientation of , which is induced on it by the orientation of . RIGHT!?  Man, what a nitwit that other guy was.  Go ahead and have my upvote, you sound like you know what you're taking about. Is there an xkcd on that? if there's an xkcd about this though...

"this is stupid. the entire world knows it as alpha-alpha HO. Even the text herein says that pronunciation is Aitch-oh, not "aitch-zero" or even "half-zero". Point is today and for the foreseeable future, it is PRONOUNCED "aitch-oh" so we should SPELL it HO. Mention the legacy in the article and note the evolution to alpha-alpha, that actually adds some value to the article. But don't perpetuate arcane and obsolete terminology for reasons of a neurotic personal disorder, it appears juvenile and immature; model railroaders have enough social stigma to worry about without adding more logs to the fire. Ken (talk) 19:57, 14 January 2009 (UTC)"

Lost it at 'neurotic personal disorder' I've never even SEEN a model train in person, and I'd already decided it must be H0. Not sure what that says about me. The road to the village: http://i.imgur.com/vfZcn3d.gifv (x-post /r/DrosteEffect/) &gt;The Droste effect  known as mise en abyme in art  is the effect of a picture appearing within itself, in a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear. The appearance is recursive: the smaller version contains an even smaller version of the picture, and so on. Only in theory could this go on forever; practically, it continues only as long as the resolution of the picture allows, which is relatively short, since each iteration geometrically reduces the picture's size. It is a visual example of a strange loop, a self-referential system of instancing which is the cornerstone of fractal geometry.

 [**Autogram**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogram): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;An __autogram__ ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language):  = self,  = letter) is a sentence that describes itself in the sense of providing an inventory of its own characters. They were invented by [Lee Sallows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Sallows), who also coined the word autogram.  An essential feature is the use of full cardinal number names such as one, two, etc., in recording character counts. Autograms are also called self-enumerating or self-documenting sentences. Often, letter counts only are recorded while punctuation signs are ignored, as in this example:

If you read the article further down it notes that Sallows specifically pioneered the autogramic pangram, which is a subset of autograms in general.  It sounds to me like invented may be correct in the sense that he invented the standard framework or method most people constructing autograms use to do so.  

It's generally true that we use "invented" when the product is something that did not generally exist prior to some effort exerted on the part of the inventor, therefore Sallows inventing the process to generate these pangrams does seem to fit that definition.   I'm partial to [Autological words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autological_word) myself (like mellifluous and grandiloquent), especially as they imply an [intriguing paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrellingNelson_paradox).   Hey wouldn't this mean there's an infinite amount of black in this comic? Since you'll keep going down forever  Read up on [limits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_%28mathematics%29) or better yet [absolute convergence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_convergence).

The sequence [1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1/2_%2B_1/4_%2B_1/8_%2B_1/16_%2B_%E2%8B%AF) for example equals 2.

Since there is limited space in the panel it's obvious that the black ink amount is not infinite. An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar. The first orders a pint, the second orders half a pint, the third orders a quarter of a pint. At this point the bartender shakes her head, pours two pints and says "you guys really ought to know your limits!" Are we doing bar jokes?

Three logicians walk into a bar. 

The bartender asks, "Do all of you want a drink?"

The first logician replies, "I don't know."

The second logician says, "I don't know."

The third logician says, "Yes." So does this answer that paradox where if you have to walk a distance you have to walk half of it, and to walk half of it you have to walk half of that... Etc?  Very good. You are talking about one of [Zeno's paradoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Dichotomy_paradox). Calculus is one way to resolve it, another would be that Achilles and the tortoise live in a space with discrete values like a computer screen. Since there is a minimum of length Achilles has to cross each step he also reaches the tortoise in a world like that.

       log(500/1.26E-10) / log(9)

So the village can have 13 nested model villages before resorting to sub-atomic scale.

Come on, Bourton-on-the-Water, you're almost a third of the way there! Synecdoche, Village. Came here to say this, glad someone else was on the same wavelength.  OP is a master of rule #6. There's a little town called Godshill on the Isle of Wight with a model village in the centre, including [several nested model villages](http://imgur.com/mDNRFfO,PCrRhkh).

Yo dawg I heard you like model villages so I put a model village in your model village so you can see the model village in the model village while you're in the real village.  http://i.imgur.com/iGjkRBm.jpg Can a Briton please explain to me what is up with you guys and your 'model villages'? The town I lived in had one and it was always kind of weird to me. What is there to explain? It is what it is. It's a little version of the village, to look at, and it's interesting because it's a small replica of where you are. Not everywhere has one, it's just a little oddity.  Back during the Blitz in WW2, the Home Guard units of each village built scale models of their village so they can train the locals defence tactics to prepare for a potential German invasion. A lot of these model villages were demolished after the war, but many villages preserved them to be a memorial to the war and as a tourist attraction.

edit: I made it up. Sounds plausible, eh? 'Right, the Germans are invading. They're coming down Church Street and past Woolworths.. Henry, as we're all giants now, just step on them and kick their tank back across the channel. William, you chuck this bucket of water down church street and cause a tsunami.' Heinrich, Ich hab dich ja gesagt das die GMO's gefhrlich sind! Pretty sure this is the model^5 village right [here](http://imgur.com/vXmiQj3). It's in the right spot (as shown by the position of the model^4 village in the second-to-last pic) and you can even see the river drawn in.

EDIT: I didn't read OP's captions carefully, and the village I circled is actually mentioned by OP. Thanks to /u/RonWisely for pointing this out. I'm pretty sure that's the "model model model model village" OP is talking about in the last pic when he says look closely.  This is the post I was waiting for!   :D  Flipping heck, Bourton-on-the-water on the front page. Never thought I'd see this day. After reading the captions out loud, by the end the word "model" had lost all meaning.  Now it even looks like I'm spelling it wrong &gt;_&lt; I went there once...it was cool Me too. It was neat, it was one of three miniature villages we visited that day, but this was the best one also the same place they filmed the kid's tv show *Brum*, [you can see the river and bridge especially in the intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMxoWnYOI-4). 

You can visit the museum where Brum still resides, I went there a couple of years ago. Was this the same model village as shown in that one episode of *Midsomer Murders*?  My mind immediately went to Midsummer Murders; half the freaking town gets murdered one way or another over the course of a couple of days, with the cops running around in circles... This is a good way to model future projects in the village, start on the smallest one, if it works and the design is desirable just scale it up thrice. When the European buildings add on for Cities: Skylines comes out someone can make a virtual version! Yo dawg. I heard you like model towns, so we built a model town in your model town in your model town  It's models all the way down. that's the most meta shit if I've ever seen /r/thingsforants Is this the village from hot fuzz They even have tiny pitchforks and tiny dog houses in the tiny houses!

Hey /u/jamieasp,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts. So when someone cuts down a tree, is there someone that has/gets to update all of the models? Wow, as a kid I would have killed for this. So many options for army men.  https://xkcd.com/878/ [Image](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/model_rail.png)

**Title:** Model Rail

**Title-text:** I don't know what's more telling--the number of pages in the Wikipedia talk page argument over whether the 1/87.0857143 scale is called "HO" or "H0", or the fact that within minutes of first hearing of it I had developed an extremely strong opinion on the issue.

I haven't seen something so meta since Abed made that movie about Jesus. Somebody please tilt-shift this model of a model of a model of a model... for science As an englander, like many others, I have been here multiple times. Me and others where I live consider this one of the best small villages in England, it is exceptionally exquisite. 
Also, brum lives there.  I thought there was going to be a tiny supermodel inside the final village.  Also, she's freaking tall. I need a banana or something in the frame, for scale. What is this a school for ants? This is a little more than mildly interesting.  This is why we need the pesticides! Otherwise slugs will just eat more and more of the crops...its science. Lead and copper are great pesticides.  support my kickstarter Slugs4Slugs, and I'll go shoot *all* the corn. Please support my kickstarter to create THE WORLD'S BIGGEST PILE OF CASH and you'll recieve 1 whole dollar from the pile!  What if I only donate $0.50? Then you get an exclusive WORLD'S BIGGEST PILE OF CASH screensaver! You also get my eternal gratitude! Fucking cheapskate!  Maybe I won't donate $0.50 to your fund if you're gonna speak to me like that! You asshole. Do you even realize how huge of a dent refusing to donate $0.50 will cause to his earnings?!?! That's like .00000000000000050%!!!! The zero after the 5 is an insignificant figure!  -Flaven ACTUALLY it is significant! It provides for a more exact measurement. .0000000000000005 indicates that there could be numbers after the 5 that were simply left out or the number was rounded, or the tool used for measurement could only measure up to the 16th decimal place. The 17th decimal place in reality could be any number in this situation.

.00000000000000050 measures up to the 17th decimal place, and even though it has the same value as .0000000000000005, the former is more precise, because it offers a definite value for the 17th decimal place. Thus, 0's at the end of a decimal are actually significant figures. You're like a mathier Unidan. I like you. It's like they say, two significant figures is better than one! Dude, just get Jenny to give you .50 and y'all can donate a dollar together. Everybody wins.

Shot right in the cornorary [He was a corn of action](https://youtu.be/jQVbaTYGZXE?t=49s) Kill it humanely before the blight gets it, Michael Caine taught me that. I'm still trying to piece together if it was a slow moving bullet that lodged itself in the ear or it grew around the spent projectile  Looks like a .22 head. Probably happened when the corn was young and soft seeing as it didn't mushroom. I've never done it, but if I were on a cornfield with a gun the corn would definitely be a target.  I was thinking that, but the bullet would have to be traveling pretty slows to lodge in the corn right? Maybe the first 47 ears of corn slowed it sufficiently to get stuck in the 48th. Very specific... I'm watching you /u/no_4.     48. Definitely, definitely 48. 48, 48, 48 states I get it in they call me mr treat your nose 4+8=12

It was a nice try kid, you came in Cth place. Sith place? Does this mean I can use the force? It's a cornspiracy! Is it finally my time to shine? Corn can't melt steel beams though Some dank memes you got there. Something something something half life 3 something something.  Bio-fuel can't melt steel beams. The original bullet speed is irrelevant. http://i.imgur.com/PN9Z5lM.gifv

Hit enough things and it will slow down.
  This is why I come to reddit. full video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlZRnpyZjBE what caliber was that? .357 or .44 magnum.

Edit: [Found the source.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq0KaVURf2E) It's a .44 magnum. Like all objects in motion a bullet will eventually lose momentum. Given the sheer expanse of most corn fields it's perfectly reasonable that the bullet had slowed enough that it had enough energy to penetrate a growing head of corn but not cause any serious damage. 

Every bullet has to come a stop somewhere after all, and not all of them come to a sudden and catastrophic halt in a target immediately after the gun is discharged.  My initial thought was that someone was aiming for a squirrel or a crow and missed, the arch slowed the bullet enough to lodge it in the corn That could well be. It's also possible they clipped the object they were shooting at and that absorbed a good portion of the energy too.  [deleted] I've seen undamaged .22 slugs stop in &lt;2 inches of rotting wood, probably similar to a live ear of corn. Fibrous material like wood is nearly perfect for stopping projectiles. It's heavy but yielding, so it drags on projectile. There's a reason soldiers are protected with Kevlar cloth and holes in the dirt.

Edit: meat is pretty good at stopping bullets too, but it does leave a hole in the meat. So don't be the meat, if you can avoid it. It could have gone through something else before it lodged in the corn. They won't necessarily deform, unless its a pretty solid object or a hollow point bullet. This looks like a full metal jacket, which would likely retain its shape going through a couple of ears of corn. I'm betting someone was just plinking .22s out in the field and this was a fluke.  Some kids were probably shooting hundreds of rounds of 22 out in front of a corn field.  That particular piece of corn may not have been the intended target. Maybe it went through something else and got lodged in because it'd been slowed or something Nah, the tapering is off. Also small corn kernels range around a quarter of an inch and this looks larger than that. I'd probably say a 9mm. Looks like a 9mm...a little too big for a .22. Was there a hole in the husk?  A coupe rips on the inner husk but the outer ones were clean, you can see a little of the bullet destruction path. Must have lodged itself in when the plant was young?  Maybe, but it could have also lost enough velocity by hitting other corn stalks that this was the one that finally stopped it. But then the outer husk would be ripped. Bullets don't magically teleport into corn. That would make sense, still one helluva shot though Shoot into an acre of corn...you're bound to hit something My thinking is that the bullet went through several ears before finally lodging in the last one. 

...that looks really bad out of context.  Gun owner/collector here, I'm guessing the farmer was probably doing pest control, likely shooting birds, from the shape of the bullet and the lack of penetration, (a .22lr would easily penetrate an ear of corn) I'm guessing the farmer or pest control guy missed and the bullet traveled a good distance before it hit the corn. 

This is just my theory though, maybe there was a civil war between the north corn and south corn.  Bullet passed through intended target, killing bird, lodged in ear, discovered by vegan corn eater. ITT reddit's only two corn puns  Everyone's trying to find the corniest pun and the actual interestingness of this is being underplayed. :( &gt;corniest pun

 ayy lmao Well bullets and corn are both powered by potassium nitrate so maybe there's some good jokes in that. That's awesome, I want a corn bullet  You'll have to take that up with the kernel, soldier.

Edit: Thanks, /u/katatonos! This is the best it's going to get folks! Pack it up  Sorry, kernel got fired. 

Didn't have enough caliber. These puns are just corny  Yours had a bit more pop though. This isn't funny. Someone got shot in the ear. Shucks, that would hurt. I'm trying to think of another one, but im stalk Now that you're gilded I'm sure you're smiling from ear to ear.  Why, shucks... I bet that's actually pretty common. I would imagine people shoot guns often near corn fields.  Not much else to do in Iowa. We also do meth Wadm  Someone once told me Iowa is an acronym but I'm not rude enough to insult you.  Insult away. I've only visited. It's stupid:
Idiots
Out
Walking
Around  u wot m8 **You forget yourself sir! How very rude of you!** **FISTICUFFS! FISTICUFFS!** I always heard it as "Wandering Aimlessly" Never heard any of these before, but I like "Idiots Out Wandering About" because it ryhmes I like that better.  You know why geese fly upside down over Iowa?

Because Iowa's not worth giving a shit. i only wank alone It's either that or wait for the corn to come for you and everyone you love.

EDIT: Grammar is important. My buddy and I will, quite often, shoot his suppressed .22 in the backyard of his house at various small targets. His backyard ends in a massive corn field. So I'm sure some of those ears have/had our bullets in them. And some will when the next harvest time rolls around.  Nah, squirrels and crows eating your corn is pretty common. For a bullet to make it from a gun to my dinner table, by accident and never having touched the ground, is pretty uncommon usually it's shotguns though There was corn growing in the field behind my house last year and I would shoot .357 and .38 into a berm nearby. It's definitely possible that some rounds went into the field, though not on purpose. Jimmy capped corn, and I don't care.  This is the most concise picture of America I have ever seen. Plot twist: Monsanto patents new bullet-growing corn. Murica! But is the corn vaccinated against bullet diseases? And did it sign up for Obamacare to pay its hospital bills? Reminds me of this [MH4U gunlance...](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130913003004/monsterhunter/images/5/5b/Cornpopper.jpg) Monster Hunter for me? Well how else was the farmer gonna catch it? I hope she didn't bite the bullet.
...get it? http://i.imgur.com/2lqsf5N.gif How's that working out for you? Someone had to say it, thank you  I came here to say that. Did a Ctrl + F. Thanks for sharing that with me. We may be different people, but we shared that same thought. I think i love you. bye. That shit doesn't hunt itself, you know. That's a corn bullet. It's a natural occurrence. Just eat around it How do we know the bullet wasn't just.... PLANTED there? Eh? Eh? Clearly the work of a cereal killer. This feels like a Breaking Bad episode plot.
Show starts with a woman complaining at her local grocery store about finding bullet in her corn, show ends with Walter White dodging a bullet in a cornfield. Shot through the husk and you're to blame, you give maize a bad name. nice. I thought this was an octopus arm... Nothing quite like the thrill of stalking wild corn.  Then the immense satisfaction of a clean kill shot, and knowing your family will eat well that night.   The hunter finds himself faced by the deadliest predator in the field. The ear of corn. Knowing the corn can move faster than a greyhound and is more hive minded, he knows he must dispatch the aggressor before the threat hormone is released. Slowly raising his 9mm as to not startle the ear, he squeezes off one round. The corn releases not the threat hormone but the dead hormone which unfortunately for our hunter quickly escalates the situation to something more dangerous. He turns, quickly unsheathing his machete from his belt. Running in a hunched position he makes his way to where he remembers his quad, keeping low to avoid being detected. The rustling nearing his position could only mean one thing. He begins swinging his machete above his head. His only options now is kill as many before they group up on him. With the air thick with threat and death hormones, the reality of what has happened takes hold. There is only wind now. The sky slowly disappears, blocked by green and yellow. His grip on the gun and machete loosens as his hands fill with sweat. He drops to his knees. The rustling is back. Scene \#cornlivesmatter \#EarsUpDon'tShoot? Was the corn field owned by Arnold Schwarzenegger?  I thought he only served bullets on pizza. America? Clearly shot by another ear. 

We NEED TO STOP Corn on Corn violence NOW!  The Jolly Green a Giant took a head shot.  Right to the ear!  We're both corn of action. But one of us is DEAD CORN!! Murica! Pop pop! Did she bite the bullet ? I found a bullet in my poop.  Mystery solved.  Most likely a victim of the Cartel Wars down in Mexico. Los Zetas have a long-standing rivalry with Los Maizes. In the farmer's defense the corn was heading right for him Who put that bulletin? Come on, dad.  Nah, that's just how we fortify corn now with copper.   I mean, I'm honestly surprised I haven't seen this before. 

You ever been to Nebraska? Lots of corn and lots of free time. Not really that much to shoot at except rabbits in the cornfields. So... badda-bing badda-boom. 

Bullet-corn is born.  /r/trypophobia  I guess you could say she bit the bullet. That is a .22 round for sure.  A normal .22 LR would rip right through a corn cob at a normal distance of say less than 100 yards.  It can go through small trees if close enough.  So either the person was quite a distance away from the corn or it was a subsonic round.  [CCI Makes a subsonic round with a copper jacket like the one in your cob.](http://www.luckygunner.com/22-lr-40-gr-cpshp-cci-subsonic-50-rounds)

Either that or depending on the trajectory, it could have been someone firing up towards a squirrel, missing and coming down onto said cob.  I would however expect the bullet to begin tumbling once it reached the apex, and this bullet seems to have entered into the cob straight in. Most likely self defense. Corn becomes extremely aggressive during its mating season, this person was lucky they were armed when the corn attacked. Did she bite it? The taste of freedom THE PUNS IN THIS THREAD, DUKE, THE PUNS!!!!! r/interestingasfuck conflict corn? This is one of the most American pictures ever. Not uncommon to go out and shoot in the fields. I never realized the round would stick in an ear of corn though. Looks like Kevlar has met its fucking match.  bit more than miidlyinteresting id say [r/interestingasfuck](http://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/) Did she... Bite the bullet? "mildly" Guess it was time for her to bite the bullet. That corn got popped Only in Murica Not sure if it's common knowledge, but corn fields are some of the best deer hunting area of all. This is more than mildly interesting  R.I.P my homie cornflake
He was popped too soon Just a shot in the dark, but the jokes that bullet makes are corny. Lucky she didn't
Bite the bullet lol probably was shooting the crows [/r/trypophobia](http://reddit.com/r/trypophobia) This could be an epic album for a Green Day cover Band: 'Bullet in a Corn Cob'  Quality control guy in a E.U corn factory here:

Did she buy it or did she collect the corn herself? I'm asking because there is meant to be metal detection taking place along the process.

Hope her teeth are fine. It's obviously the bullet from the "freak on a leash" video Someone didn't want that ear....listening.  Someone's been sleeping with the farmer's daughter. She should be used to having loads in her mouth The key to a good assassination is patience! Dafuq is a pixel stick and where can I get one Not to [rain on OPs parade](http://imgur.com/a/9lS49) but I built one for less than $100...[Half life 3 confirmed]( http://imgur.com/03xdV1v)

EDIT: Since everyone wants to know how to make one... this build uses only 144 LED, but produces similar results.

I take no credit for this work - [Michael Ross is the brain behind the light wand](http://mrossphoto.com/wordpress32/neopixel-ws2812-dlw/). Please donate him if you use his blueprint to build one. By mentioning Half Life 3 you have delayed it by 1 Month. Half Life 3 is now estimated for release in December 2123

I am a bot, this action was performed automatically. If you have feedback please message /u/APIUM- If it's delayed a month for mentioning it, how long is it delayed when you release a bot for it??? By mentioning the bot that has mentioned that which will not be mentioned...

eh, not as funny now that I type it out. [It actually went crazy a while ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/shittyrobots/comments/337zcd/whenishl3_goes_on_a_rampage/) Whoooaaaa how's you build that?

Think of it this way, though: not that I'm going to buy a $350 pixel stick, but does the $100 you spent include the time/opportunity cost? That's probably why the pixel stick costs so much. It's $100 in raw material, but skillful construction costs money and takes time. As well, there's a profit margin to consider. Suddenly, the price tag actually seems more rreasonable, even if it's still more than I would spend. The process includes knowledge of soldering parts on to an Arduino. Other than that fairly simple.  Not to mention, from what I've seen that pixel stick one seems to produce better results. The pixelstick does, but I didn't pay $350. The biggest cost is the LED strip which has to use programmable RGBs.  That's $100 retail cost for the parts.  Buying in quantity and direct from manufacturers would significantly reduce that price. Good job.. 2123.. Do you realize how far that is.. Now I'll never see it. 

Nice photo regardless  Oh dang I read that as 2023.

It's ok though! None of us will ever see it until no one cares because people will keep mentioning it! Care to share the secret? I'd love to build one of these guys myself! I don't want to crash the artist's site who made it. You can inbox me.  It's another Kickstarter success story. http://www.thepixelstick.com

Edit: Holy shit I went to bed with 7 upvotes. Thanks for all the internet monies Reddit! If only I could throw this down onto my student debt. Now to try and respond to these comments... Hang tight. 

Edit 2: Went down to my basement after a long day of answering comments and saw my [little brother's ghost](http://i.imgur.com/81LRmr0.jpg)! I need a pixel stick NOW! FYI all: it's $350.  I no longer want a pixel stick &gt; I no longer want a pixel stick

Another emotional rollercoaster of a thread, which went pretty much the same way for everyone who read it. I say we create a kickstarter to get EVERYONE a pixel stick. Sign me up!

Uhh..

For the recievers. (   ) Opposite for me.

Fuck Pixelstick, I dislike colorful fun looking things.

Yay it's $350 - I like to waste a big chunk of my hard earned money on a toy I'll literally never use. &gt; Yay it's $350 - I like to waste a big chunk of my hard earned money on a toy I'll literally never use.

 WHAT YEAR IS IT? Hopefully it's 2015 and /u/Guinness2702 just spent a ton of money on a "vintage" PDA. I used the fuck outta my Palm Pilot.
 Treo was the shit back when literally every other phone was voice-and-text-only.  Palm was the only was to get mobile internet for years. I had one with wireless internet that was like $15 a year, and it had map quest. Was the shit. I sat on mine :( I lost my stylus! Noooooooooo! You should have worked at a place that was selling them. They were practically giving them away
  Out the back door
  When the cameras were turned away... Or you can give it to me and I'll use it for food and other essentials:3 I mean, i still WANT one... but more now i want someone to just give me one. Or find someone that has one and let me use it for 15 minutes until I get bored.. Sounds like you could get one cheap from ebay soon from someone who got bored. I'll send you one! Can you send me your home address?

And also, your name, birthday, social security number and bank account info? I need these things because you know, these mail carriers are really locking down nowadays haha! haha! yes i know how they can be!  i'll go ahead and PM you that info, don't want it gettin out to any weirdos!  oh, and i'll include a list of my fears, though i'd be a bit amazed if you can somehow arrange crippling abandonment from far away.

 You still owe me 20 bucks so you're actually in the negative Damn.. can confirm It's still cheaper than a lightsaber... I bought one for 50$ last week A light saber or pixel stick? Well clearly we're going to pick the lethal one. Yes lightsabers are not Fitty bucks. Well, I dont know how much since I was given mine. Thanks Mr Kenobi.



 Dont the authentic movie props go for big money? What?! I got one for Christmas and will be really pissed if that was $350. http://www.amazon.com/Bitbanger-Labs-Pixelstick-Lightpainting-evolved/dp/B00UHXUFYG

sorry... I think he meant the lightsaber. Keep in mind Amazon does fucktons of EPIC sales around Christmas.  It might be $350 now but it might have been much cheaper at Christmastime. Good to know. (: I'm still in. (I have no job though. Screw bills. Sorry, student loans.) wait... watch this first...

it's pretty cool, I must admit. you can make your own similar device, someone did it some years ago, around the nyan cat era, with open-source drivers.

The world is spinning too fast. I need lead Nike shoes.

Someone give me a 2014 reference to latch on to. What happened last year? :-( 2014 went by pretty fast :( 

I dunno what I missed.  Russia being a douche. Saudis being a douche. The US being less of a douche to other countries, but more of a douche to Americans. Some shit happened with some planes. The Fappening. I made a similar one based on his design: http://scott-bot.com/led-light-painting/ I mean, I still want one but I would like someone else to pay for it.  Or steal it for me.  Just get it to me without cost to... me.  And useless unless you have a decent camera. Your Samsung Galaxy isn't going to cut it on this one. It will be ok if you get manual controls. You just need low ISO, small aperture and long exposure, depending on how long you plan to fuck around with your gay pride scepter. &gt; gay pride scepter

[hahahahaha](http://media4.giphy.com/media/iahsjX48WASBO/giphy.gif) Actually Android 5.0 lets you control ISO values, exposure time, and "aperture". Only program I've seen yet that has the controls is [L Camera](https://github.com/PkmX/lcamera) and it only works with Nexus 5 and 6 so far. It's not that hard to make one yourself:

- Stick some [APA102 LEDs](http://www.ebay.com/itm/APA102-Led-Strip-Light-Dream-Color-Individually-Addressable-Replace-WS2801-5V-DC-/351191941509?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;var=&amp;hash=item51c4abc185) on a piece of wood
- $84 for 2m with 288 LEDs or $58 for 2m with 144 LEDs
- Use some kind of arduino clone as the controller, all the software is freely available: ~$10
- wood: $??
- batteries: $??
- Total cost: ~$80 - $130

The RGB LEDs are the expensive parts, and there's no diffuser in this setup. WS2812 LEDs are cheaper but they sometimes flicker at low brightness settings. 

The control software is a different story though, I expect a lot of work went into that, $350 is actually pretty reasonable.  I would pay another 200 for the time it takes to so this.  Nice try, Nessie, I ain't givin' you no $350. That de-escalated quickly.

Someone should make some editing software that lets you overlay graphics and other stuff over photos. I can do it, but the best I can do is charge $699.95 per copy and update every year while dropping support for previous versions. $350 jesus. I made one with an arduino and a wii-mote for less than $100... $100 ganesh! I made one with a stick of bamboo and some glowworms for like $3. I'll photoshop rainbows in urban pictures for have that price! Can i have the other have? Meh. Why would someone want those effects in a picture?  Kick starter successes would be an interesting sub. That's actually a great idea! We should start a kickstarter for the kickstarter success sub You would need some really active moderators to make sure none of those indiegogo fiends get their stories told Can we talk those guys into meeting up with [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uue6oJ_jDns) for eyegasms? How come the person holding the pixel stick doesn't appear in the photo? The magic of long exposure. Because the person holding it is moving and not emitting light, they are invisible to the camera for the most part.  That's sick! Wait'll you see it doing animation haha

https://vimeo.com/78163959 Where did you take that photo? Balcony is pretty cool. Holy shit. I've recently been screwing around with light painting. This is amazing The most expensive way to add text to a picture. I doubt it's the most expensive way, i wonder how much sky writing costs?  [About $1,500 apparently.](http://www.sky-writing.com/)

Or about 6K to get the equipment to do it yourself.

TIL Starting a sky writing business costs less than a Honda Fit. Rainbow Road It looks like an album cover. Not a black flag album cover though [Could be](http://i.imgur.com/niTHF4T.jpg)... We're gonna have a pixel party tonight!

&gt;__Anal Cunt__, also known as __AxCx__ and __A.C.__, was an American [grindcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindcore) band that formed in [Newton, Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton,_Massachusetts) in 1988. Since its inception, the band underwent a number of line-up changes. Known for its grindcore musical style and controversial lyrics, Anal Cunt released eight full-length studio albums in addition to [a number of compilations and extended plays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_Cunt_discography). On June 11, 2011, the band's frontman and founder [Seth Putnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Putnam) died of a suspected heart attack,  ending the band.

&gt;They have been categorized as [grindcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindcore),    noisecore,  [noisegrind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindcore) and [hardcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk).  The band is often referred to by their initials A.C. (often written as AxCx) due to the offensive nature of their name and [censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship) limits on some radio and publications, and many of their album covers simply display the initials A.C. However, the band managed to subvert even this abbreviation by drawing these letters in a manner resembling an [anus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus) and a [vulva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulva). Their early material contained no pre-written lyrics or music. Rather, the band developed a style which consisted of extremely loud, fast, and aggressive noise that was created entirely on the spot. Over the years, the band eventually shifted their style and slowly began to incorporate more riffs and pre-written lyrics into their songs. It was not until then that the band earned the reputation (at least via their recordings) for intentionally being outrageous and offensive. In 2011, they released a "[cock rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cock_rock)" album entitled *[Fuckin' A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuckin%27_A)*. An album of material similar to their old grindcore albums called *Wearing Out Our Welcome* was released digitally in 2010.

A city that was once awarded the "Safest City in America" and is commonly called Jewton because there's so many wealthy Jewish families living there. It's a funny contrast that this band originates from there.  wait, there is a band named after my ex gf?
 Suck it, Trebek!

Are those archived somewhere online? I wouldn't mind watching again. I think they're on Yahoo now for some reason. Low batteries? Or magical girl mid transformation? 
You decide.
 Like Vanellope in Wreck-It Ralph?  It's pretty much a long LED flow wand. Has some other nifty features though, such as an SD card slot -- you can load an image onto it and it'll scanline-output the image. This is the coolest feature. This is the only feature  It's also a stick. What's brown and sticky? poop. http://i.imgur.com/XHBhrZN.jpg Snoop Dr. Dre Stick! Stick! Get the stick, stupid! No wonder you're extinct- Can someone explain what that means? It'll 'display' the picture, one vertical line at a time. If you take a [long-exposure picture](http://www.duskyswondersite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/long-and-short-street.png), it'll appear as the picture on the camera. In real life, it'll just look like the stick is flickering about randomly.

Think of [these LED toys](http://www.houseofrave.com/media/battery/skyliner-message-big2.jpg) where you spin the LED array and it'll rapidly flash the LEDs so it looks like an image. But instead of moving the stick rapidly, you move it slower and take a very long picture.

The end result is something like [this](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/GY5ZQhZt0HY/maxresdefault.jpg).  That image was 'displayed' one pixel-width at a time on the Pixelstick while a camera combined each step of the way. Wow. It's like copy paste but easier! If you look at a printer, you know how it prints an image line-by-line. Similarly, the pixel stick will display one line of an image at a time if you use that feature. 

So, When you move the pixel stick, it'll give the illusion of the actual image from the sd card. Is what she said Saturday Night Live [used a Pixelstick in their most recent opening](http://www.alex-buono.com/how-we-did-it-snl-titles-sequence/). Rainbow Road: Corrupted Imagine driving along that as a track.  
*Do bee doo*  
"HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII....."

*Toad falls through the gap in the track* So pretty much a normal rainbow road experience? I would watch that Vinesauce Congratulations, you've created a new Windows logo. rainbow volcano. Too soon, bro. Why does the person holding and moving the stick not appear in the picture? Magic.

Or long exposure photography. Why would the light show up but not the person? The person is moving, and small amounts of light are bouncing off of that person, but not enough to create any defined images of them. The wand, however, is emitting light.

This is why a long-exposure shot with a bright flash can freeze a subject/object, while leaving everything else ghosty.  It's a long exposure image. The camera sensor basically takes the sum of all the light that hits over the duration of the exposure, so if you're not reflecting much light--particularly if there are other bright lights behind you--and you're moving in the picture you can essentially disappear. 

For example here's [a *single* 30 second exposure I took just goofing around](http://i.imgur.com/pSq2nSl.jpg). I appear ghostly where I was standing still for 9 seconds or so each place (roughly 30% visible, as I was standing in each spot for just under a third of the exposure), and virtually invisible from where I moved between positions. 
 I was wondering the same thing! If you keep moving the camera can't capture you in the image.  also having a bright lightsource between you an the camera helps :) Don't know if they allow it but try cross-posting to http://www.reddit.com/r/glitch_art

Edit: Haha, [fuck you guys](http://i.minus.com/ibt29cySgdnZSI.gif)! You [had me for a minute](http://www.gifbin.com/bin/reverse-20030430yu.gif) tho, shame on me. THIS IS NOT ALLOWED

HOLY SHIT MAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING

OH MY GOD

STOP

PLEASE STOP HOLY SHIT 

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD

**WHAT ARE YOU DOING**

^^EDIT: ^^/r/PolandBall meanwhile, at /r/Polandball
 Hold my pixel stick, I'm going in RIP in pixels How could you?  You ded now.  r u kil You've probably just been banned now. [deleted] what is this, fight club?
 No, this is Patrick. Dude, you had better get out of here. Cross-posting is definitely *not* okay. I am a mod at /r/glitch_art and no we don't allow cross-posting.


Just kidding, we do. I actually already did before reading this post. OP, you should x-post in /r/glitch_art 

Also, could you maybe send me a hi-rez version of this picture? It would look awesome as a wallpaper. 1. get one.

2. load it with goatse

3.  start running in front of people doing long exposures.  city skylines, fireworks shows etc. You've entered the Gaytrix, Neo.  How did you take that picture? With a camera. But does he use a lens? I'm pretty sure you have to use the entire camera. [deleted] Did you make sure to press all the buttons simultaneously? But how can pictures be real if our eyes aren't real? It's a long exposure and probably using a tripod Nyan. And with that, you've given Nintendo ideas for making Rainbow Road even harder. Thanks. Thanks for the new wallpaper.  Thanks for that :) /r/glitch_art  Aaaand new background. Some others we curated: http://imgur.com/a/6Ed7J How does your body not show up in the picture? Long exposure at night, with a bright lightsource in the frame. Anything moving and not lit up doesn't have a chance.  It's a long exposure photo, probably 10-20 seconds or more. Dark moving objects, like a person, don't show up because they do not give the camera sensor enough light to register anything. If you stand still for the whole exposure you will show up in the photo. Could get After Effects and a good course to teach you for the price. Would offer a lot more. I set this as my background.  
Anyone know of a good place I can look for other pictures that have alterations like this (intentional or not)?  Real pictures with digital alterations over them?  Thanks! You could try /r/pixelstick.  Thanks! You'll find lots of them over at /r/ExposurePorn . It looks like a Mario Kart track It's not a glitch, it's a feature! :P

Joking aside, I have a pixelstick too but haven't gotten the time to really try it out, but this stop in the middle thing should be added in the firmware. Just found the website and HOLY FUCKING SHIT I NEED ONE OF THESE. Is that Vancouver in the background? My husband experimented a little bit with light painting using sparklers/flashlights/etc.  He would probably love one of these!  Very cool! I would almost call that art!
opps  From someone who light-paints, I want a pixelstick so freaking bad The Pixelstick is awesome :) it lets you do stuff like [this](http://i.imgur.com/TwhVfGT.jpg). And [this!](http://i.imgur.com/PxoMflr.jpg) HAPPY ACCIDENT! YAY UNICORNS. Commander Video, is that you? Only a matter of time until dickbutt is recreated I shamelessly stole this and now it's making for a pretty neat facebook cover. They should add glitching in the next firmware. That is actually really cool
 I sense a disturbance in the unicorn fart /r/glitch_art  new wallpaper Annnnnnd... Wallpapered /r/ExposurePorn features a lot of these shots even by the creators

https://www.reddit.com/r/ExposurePorn/comments/1phk1m/one_of_the_best_light_painted_ribbons_weve_been/

They even created the banner for the sub too! This is an amazing photo! what in sam hill is a pixel stick! Wallpaper material. I suddenly remembered when the batteries of my walkman were running out... the tape would slow down and my 9-year old brain would trip with the pitched-down tones. I have always thought that technical glitches can lead to cool and trippy effects. Yeah I remember that too! Ah Walkmans, what an age we lived in.. Glitched Rainbow is a pretty good band name. For 12-year-olds. wut? Is that Seattle? I don't really see any of the key buildings im looking for, but that view looks soooo familiar Album cover.  This is the most beautiful glitch I've ever seen {a cool demo video of pixelstick](https://vimeo.com/78163959) That is amazing cross post to /r/AlbumArtPorn  Like Bob Ross said... "happy accident!"
 Thanks for the new wallpaper, OP! Someone photoshop a poptart cat at the end of that. Yesterday somebody called Deadmau5 "Dead Mou5". Today someone is calling Nyan Cat poptart cat.

Dear lord, what is going to happen tomorrow? Hahahah, my bad. My brain just derped and ended up switching out nyan for poptart. :-P No need to apologize, just thought it was funny. :) &gt; submitted just now

3515 upvotes. What the fuck. Just like Rainbow road That's got some messed up coloring for a rainbow. It's kind of like a [supernumerary rainbow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow#Supernumerary_rainbow) I guess. This is a great idea. Now all you need is something that blooms where the numbers are. So true. As a former mailman, I could miss even the biggest street numbers unless they really stood out from the background. I always looked where *most* people put their street numbers.  

So if you want to save the mailman some time, put the street number where all your neighbors put theirs. Unless it's really, *really* obvious. As someone who has tried to find people's houses when they send me their address, I agree.  * Say the address into your phone, you won't even need to physically see it this way. Unless you have an iPhone.

Of course it does, it's a fast food ad, ergo it's not an accurate representation of what you get. Someday voice recognition will be accurate

I am normally not the type to complain about downvotes, but how is this comment even marked controversial?  what are you talking about  
  
is this HUMOR Pizza delivery guy here, would save me so much time  Those neighborhoods that have the house numbers [painted on the curb](http://i.imgur.com/pqs6aux.jpg) made my job so much easier, especially when I was delivering at night. except if theres snow on the ground Or a car parked or a solar eclipse or my axe? You'll mostly find this in the American southwest where we don't get much snow. It's for emergency responders to easily find your house. If there's a fire I certainly hope they can find your house....otherwise I don't trust them as firefighters  it should be really reallly obvious that your house is 28, if the one to the left of it is 26 and the one across the street is 27.... but I can feel your pain, its a really impractical thing to do. Unless this house is 26A and the one next to it is 28. There is a street in York which consists of three buildings: 1, 1A, and 1 1/2. Because ~~we're charming and quaint that way~~ fuck you, that's why. That's just cruel.... what's wrong with choosing B over 1/2? Or 2/2 instead? There's already building 1. Can't you read? Fair enough but a house numbered 26A is almost always an apartment, and if not bungalows or attached housing so you have context to tell Not here in the UK. And if you are standing there judging the age of a property as to whether you're at the right one, then the owner should make their number more visible. It's not always that simple. Especially not in a mixed commercial/residential area. You're probably right. We just remodeled our house, which meant disrupting the curb where our house numbers are normally painted. We now have 6" tall metal numbers on our house AND mailbox (which stands *at the curb*), but we've still had a few people tell us they had a hard time finding our house because of the lack of curb numbers.

Edit: we are waiting for those guys who come around every year, volunteering to paint the curb numbers for a donation. why dont you repaint the fucking curb I wish places in Ireland (Republic) would do this. They don't use Zip or postcodes so find places are a compete nightmare to find.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24455863

This article says they are being introduced, but I've not heard anything since. I am a meter reader and o do the same thing. If my route is out of order I came find people's meters in the system if I can't find there house number. In some neighborhoods I've gone as far as learning the house number patterns so I could identify the house. doesn't the mailman go on the same route everyday? Wouldn't you just have it basically memorized after a few months on the job?

Maybe not, I'm in a small town, and I have the same lady every day, I think...I'm not home often.  No, you're right. This guy is probably just a dirt liar. dirty mouth breather  I was a sub. So every morning I met at the post office I would be assigned a random route. They gave me that job because I knew the entire district quite well. But being familiar with a district and being familiar with every single house on a random route in that district are two very different things. What about the paint they use for the lines in a stadium ?  As a night shift taxi driver I would hate these people. London? Yes but its NOT in Shepherd's bush Muswell Hill bingo Woo hoo! Muswell Hill resident here! Shout out to everyone who frequents the Maid of Muswell and gets the 102 bus! How much does she charge? 3 for a single, but if you want to ride all day you can pay 4.50 102 or 299 gets me to Bounds Green from Colney Hatch Lane, yet when I'm in a rush there's only ever 184s. #MHproblems Hooray for the 102! Yay. It's those decorations above the door, I just knew it. Hold a Muswell Hill redditor meetup! There have been plenty.
 I saw the picture, came to comments, ctrl+f'd 'muswell hill' and had the same reaction as you Windermere? Please tell me its Windermere....... Wtf are you talking about? Windermere is a lake in Westmorland. Yes I know, I was enquiring if it was one of the 'lake' roads in N10. Winderemere, Thurmere and another one that escapes me. I bet my partner that was my old road.....Im not crackers, honest. ... are you from the past? Windermere hasn't been in Westmoreland since 1974. I refuse to acknowledge the counties invented in the '70s. England's counties were more or less unchanged for over a thousand years, so I don't know why the government decided to mess them up.   Well it is the name of a town on the lake shore as well. That's what she said  Hey! Great to hear the Bush mentioned on reddit. I'm a native, but not living there right now. My stiff upper lip is quivering with pride. Im going with Sarf London. Rayners Park? Looks more like where I grew up in Norf Londan. Looks like Crouch End I say west.  I'd guess Ealing. anyone know where the wheelie bins have green tops? It's not Twickenham or Richmond. They do in Haringey Yep, somewhere in the Barnet/Haringey region?
  OP please deliver. Raynes*  we also don't have wheelie bins. slums out here To be fair everything about it is so obviously British, it could be anywhere here Yeah it reminded me of some houses in Exeter. Kind of like the ones on heavitree or topsham road? I miss Exeter so much! It is quite the beautiful [place](http://i.imgur.com/iztssmJ.jpg) I'm Irish and I came to see where it was Yeah thats what I thought Strictly speaking, it's not called a 'street number' here, but a 'house number'. 

But cool idea with the hedge though.  You're technically correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo The clip cutting out just before the end bothers me.  You're technically subjectively correct.  That's some cutting hedge street number technology. That was sharp That pun was shear genius Not another pun war. Why can't reddit just leaf the puns alone? You've got rough hedges man Give him a break! People are busy; it's hard to stay trim.  You are going a bit over the topiary now, I think you're branching off there, bud Imagine if someone did that in their pubes and the number was the number of people they have slept with  I trim my pubes with a bird hedge clipper like in the Flintstones.  Must be hard to trim a zero with such a rudimentary tool Yeah doing 2 zeros is always a problem for me i appreciate the use of significant digits in your trim, but that decimal is tough though, right? That's a comma.. we know he digs the period Get with the times man and start using a chainsaw like the rest of us.  Shaving pubes would be like hitting the reset button.  /r/thebutton Don't press that shit read the sidebar first. 

If for some weird reason you are one of the people who hasn't been there by now.  Button? What button? I don't know of any buttons that I intend to press.  Stand strong, gray brother. The willfully ignorant shall prevail.  Out of all the things, this is what comes to your mind? That'd be a slutty hedge in the pic.  37!?!! ... In a row? Simultaneously. Lol, hardly. 28x3=84 if it's a female or 28/3=9.3 if it's a male huh? It's an old joke the men multiply the number of partners they have had by 3 and women divide by 3.  That's why my ex had a landing strip.... Right?! *sobs* they'd have to grow it back in after every sex encounter so they could shave a new number Must be hard to count in an orgy, no? Kinda like in misfits but their numbers were on their forehead.  To all those commenting on how difficult it will be to find in different scenarios/circumstances, the door itself will have the house number on it.  Yeah, I like how everyone assumes this the *only* house number this place displays. As a delivery driver, this would piss me off at night. Why? There's nothing to suggest the house isn't also numbered. As an emt, at night you may die because of the delay from this A little excessive surely. The surrounding houses are undoubtedly numbered, the numbering system is pretty formulaic, the houses are all identical terraces. As a postie going along roads delivering to houses I have to say if you couldn't find this house on this road because of this then you're doing something wrong. LOL Forumulaic! Everything goes great until theres a random 50 number jump for no reason. And as a postie, you're not feeling too much of a sense of urgency, definitely not akin to someone like an EMT or even a delivery driver for that matter. Also, you go (presumably) to the same houses every day. I'm sure you know *your area* like the back of your hand... I haven't come across any housing numbers that aren't formulaic, like he described. 

Pretty much my whole county goes up by 10, odds on one side, evens on the other. Sometimes it's a bit different. But seriously, if you just check a couple of house numbers it isn't hard to figure out the pattern. I've never seen one random one that doesn't fit in. Although my job doesn't involve searching for numbers, so I suppose my knowledge my be limited.  Yeah but you're commenting on stuff with Americans. Where streets do jump like that quite often.

What you're describing is extremely common and I doubt anyone would have any trouble finding number 28 on that street. For one it probably also has 28 on the door or next to it, and it's obviously the house in between 30 and 26 all part of the same terrace.

Streets in central London (and in rare cases elsewhere) are often number consecutively, so say 1-10 running north-south on one side of the road and 11-20 running up the other side

That said there's a street in Potters Bar of pretty standard houses with no great separation between them that has a weird jump. Number 28 is next door to number 56 or something. Did a bit of work for Parcel Force over Christmas. You'd be amazed at how incompetent councils can be at numbering houses. 

 "undoubtedly"? You haven't driven around looking for house numbers before, I guess. 

This is a great idea for decoration in addition to well-light, standardly-placed number. There is probably a number on or next to the front door too.  where's my pizza? i carved the street number into the hedge and everything. "What's your street number though?"

"It's whatever you want it to be, baby." Fuck looking for that house at night  Looks like the opening of Shaun of the Dead. Is every entrance in England the same? Yes, mate. We don't like radicals. A hedge is a hedge... http://imgur.com/FIdBjyG I've got for this one This is the most British thing I've seen in weeks. I feel like this would be hard to read from the inside of a passing car... Well good luck getting a pizza delivered. As a delivery driver, fuck that. I think this is the house number. UK doesn't have Street numbers, street names mainly.  Just out of curiosity I found [a place in Wales](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Second+St,+Newport+NP19+4XF/@51.5655481,-2.9593489,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4871e68159ed5d59:0xc72e9dcf552a041e) with numbered streets. Home of Edward Scissorhands! Those houses really look like the houses in Skins (UK) Not surprising, considering there's thousands of terraced houses in Britain that look like this. That house will be a bitch to find at night.  Alternatively, how to make sure the delivery driver will never find your door. That looks awesome! 

Unless you're delivering pizza, at night, in the rain. Then it's just "I can't see anything. Where the fuck is #28?" In between 26 and 30? I love really good topiary work. When I was a young kid, we had a neighbor that had a huge plot of bluegrass juniper in his front yard. He trained and trimmed it to look like ocean waves, and in the middle a holly bush shaped like a ship.   [r/interestingasfuck](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck)
 Not much help if you're trying to find the place in the dark. *Goes up, carves the 8 into a 3.* As a delivery driver I only have one thing to say to the owner of this house... Fuck you. At night I would totally miss this, then probably get yelled at, no tip, bad night. "ooh it looks so cool though" but it's highly impractical. Not street number, just the house number. Looks like England. My guess would be Bedford.  Holy shit I'm pretty sure this is my friends house...  what about in winter... Reddit: meet your next Captcha Very mild, good That's really pretty neat.


I've always been impressed with garden sculpting.  Aww... I thought it was a headshot count :( This is genuinely the definition of mildly interesting. As a guy who had done delivery for 7+ years this would piss me off so bad because I wouldn't look at any sort of plant for numbers, so mildly interesting to everyone else, hugely infuriating to me.  Or you could see the 26 or 30 next door and figure it out? If you have a job delivering you will notice this process of elimination does not always work.  As a pizza delivery guy, I wish everyone did this so I could find their fucking address. Innovation at its peak. Who needs apple watches when you can do this to a hedge. Life complete.  Seen by no-one except those that have the right angle on a well lit day with just enough shadow for depth. Great bush "I've driven up and down the street 100 times man 28 isn't fucking here!" Bad title should have been edged in the hedge Could somebody please explain the angry comments from mailmen and delivery drivers? Here in the US, street numbers are on the curb, the front of the house, and/or the mailbox. Where are the street numbers in London? I assumed that the hedge was trimmed into the number *in addition to* the actual painted address number, not instead of it.

Personally I think it's neat, though it would be annoying to maintain it. DEBONEE kicks this thing's ass. Totally [Homer'd](http://www.gifbin.com/bin/102011/1319738930_homer_simpson_hides_in_hedge.webm) it. I love how the number is more visible in the thumbnail than in the picture  That's nothing, I've seen a house with the street numbers spelled out in letters. Im sure delivery drivers have fun trying to see that All in good fun until someone turns that 8 into a 6    &gt;:)  wahahaha! No mail for you Isn't that ilegal? Is this house in North London? As a delivery driver I would be pissed Is that london? Burn it, burn it all Pretty cool I agree with @ARedditingRedditor imagine flowers blooming where the number are. Cool enough as it is though! *"The people in this house are really rich"* Yes, mildly interesting, perfect.  This is the kind of stuff that appears on captchas. Nope, just a Marshall Faulk fan I see this, look at the current state of my lawn and feel horrible about the kind of person I am. Thanks.  Fucking overachievers. My bushes aren't even trimmed!  :/ would't it be a house number? not street number? This is like the Britishest post ever.  Where is this? It's beautiful  That must be hard as hell to see Edward scissorhandz Madness, madness no this is York. Is this actually York?  York of the newest style. 2 + 8 = 3.  Half Life 3 confirmed.

- You can be a slice of bacon Quick, someone greenlight it. And a coffee stain. it's Helvetica Yeah, only the most used font on the planet.

(For good reason.) Probably the most used font by designers, but I'm pretty sure Arial, Times New Roman and even Comic Sans is more used than Helvetica. Yeah, you're probably right. As a designer I admittedly wasn't considering home/personal use. As a non-designer I'm not surprised a designer forgot common use scenarios. They're just so *common*. Ew.

*edit: Said the designer in a thread discussing Helvetica. ;)* As a designer I haven't used Helvetica since art school. Good. It's seriously overused. Art school overused? You must be a scientific type. That's crazy. I bought Helvetica Neue LT pro and a massive version of Garamond in 2007 when I started my company. They are the go-to fonts. You can do almost anything with them if you know how to use them well. I only ever replaced a well-designed staple font when the client is willing to fork out the money for a new typeface. (Like in a branding contract.) I never once had any client say "eww garamond" or "ugh helvetica." You can combine them with a more distinctive font and it changes the feel of the whole doc. Yeah that's my point. Helvetica became too ubiquitous because of how universal it is. It's the classic "when in doubt.." font and for that reason it's boring and unimaginative to me. There are so many more elegant sans serif fonts out there with less played-out geometry that actually contribute MORE to the design if you find the right one. If a project does in fact require that generic feeling that you get from Helvetica, I'll always reach for Grotesk instead simply because the slight variation in geometry on some of the forms is more pleasing to my eye.


Don't get me wrong, Helvetica is an amazing font. I overused the shit out of it and it taught me to be a good designer, but it was definitely a crutch when I was in school because it just always *worked* and came in a million weights.


edit: looking at my portfolio book now from when I graduated, the entire thing is Helvetica and DIN. Boy do I still love me some DIN though. To be fair, one of the only fonts with [a documentary](http://www.hustwit.com/category/helvetica/). They're texturized vegetable protein.  You get some high-protein soy flour, remove the fat, heat it up in a pressure cooker to 200C until it's liquid, then extrude it into various shapes.  It's a cheap plant-based protein source, but it's also hella processed.   MmmMmmm! Nothing hits the spot with my morning Fair Trade Gluten Free Non-Asbestos coffee than a bowl of reconstituted texturized vegetable protein!

The awkward nod of your head let her know you were interested and as she walked away she looked back to tell you "I doubt you'll be needing *THAT* card this weekend" before winking and returning to work.

This only further proves that piccolo is indeed a black man Piccolo is Peter Mensah. http://imgur.com/Tt6vKIh There should be a new movie based on this picture.

The balls are inert How Can We Fly On A Nimbus If Clouds Aren't Real? Just make it Dragonball, I want to see that Piccolo as a villain. Besides, the best action in the entire franchise was from the Red Ribbon Army arc of Dragonball through the Frieza saga of DBZ. Everything before it was more comedic, everything after it sucked by comparison. IDK, I definitely agree with what you're saying, but I also love the Android/Cell sagas (I always thought of them as one big one). Gohan going Super Saiyan 2 is still my favorite DBZ moment.

Edit: I will give props to Vegeta's sacrifice/his overall Buu Saga character arc and the SSJ3 Ascension Theme is probably the best Bruce Faulconer song. However, the whole Buu Saga is just... not as good. Going Super Saiyan becomes nothing special, and even Super Saiyan 2 is glossed over. The best and most emotional moment is basically useless. And Buu, even by DBZ standards, is stretched out way too long (pun 100% intended). But that's just how I view it, and I, of course, don't mind that people love it. I got a childhood hard on when vegetta finally did it.   Vegeta doesn't get enough love. He's badass incarnate and he always got the short end of the stick via Toriyama I'd say he's lucky. Not only did he try to conquer Earth, destroy all life on that planet, murder thousands of people in their initial rampage, tried to kill all the "Z-Fighters", succeeded in killing many of them...


In fact, he got with Bulma despite actually killing her last boyfriend and trying to kill all of her other friends. It literally makes no sense why anyone on Earth accepts Vegeta. 


Not only that, but they also witnessed that he has no loyalty to his actual allies, as they witness him murder Nappa first hand. 


Usually Anime that do the "Bad guy becomes the good guy" trope has it done when the bad guy doesn't do anything seriously bad or unforgivable, or does something very bad but has to atone for it long term. 


Vegeta is completely unapologetic, murdered thousands of people, killed friends, and somehow is welcomed to their group. Goku is obviously believable as accepting, but it's kind of weird how everyone else, specifically Bulma gets with him.


He's pretty lucky. The only time he was unlucky is when he ended up getting that pink shirt because nothing else was clean. Well to be fair, death is not that big of a deal in DBZ, not only because they can bring people back to life, but because they know there is actually a happy afterlife if you were good

also the thing about vegeta, was that he was raised as a psychopath, he never have much choice on becoming an asshole in the first place They clearly care about human life being lost, their friends being killed, and the pain they have to endure while being tortured. 


Nobody thought when it was happening "Ah, who cares if Krillin and Gohan are mercilessly beaten to death. I can totally wish them back anyway". Goku didn't become a super saiyan on "eh...Krillin will be okay when we get to the dragon balls later" 


Vegeta still put a lot of them through some very serious shit, and at the time he first came to Earth, there was a limit on who could be revived. Some people were thought to have died permanently in the early days. To be fair the pink shirt sucked balls Gohan wrecking Cell's shit is the pinnacle of DBZ for me. It's all downhill from there. Gohan defeating Cell was actually supposed to be the climax and finale of the series.  Goku was gone and officially had passed the torch to the next generation.  Unfortunately due to fan pandering and the temptation of lots and lots of money, Toei Animation brought back Goku to continue the series.  The fact that they turned Gohan into a chump after this also really pissed me off. Yeah, where they took Gohan was just repulsive. Kept expecting him to just whoop Buu's ass but noooo Well I mean he did, but he got absorbed while trying to figure out a way to free the boys and Piccolo.  Everyone talks about how much he sucked post-cell, but he becomes the strongest non-fusion character in DBZ. To be fair though, there were a lot of good things from the Buu saga. The biggest one was Vegeta's character development. I consider him one of the best developed characters in fiction and most of his defining moments came from the Buu saga. We also were introduced to the concept of fusion which I think is a really cool technique. And Gohan did get another moment to shine when he got his mystic upgrade. It's just a shame he wasn't the one that ended up killing Buu. But I guess the spirit bomb was the only thing that really could have killed Buu for good and Goku's the only one that knows how to do that. That was literally the only time the spirit bomb killed... anything. The other times it was used, it wasn't very powerful. The spirit bomb used against Vegeta was very weak (though it still managed to cripple him pretty badly) and the one made on Namek didn't really have enough energy to draw upon to finish Frieza off. You didn't enjoy him getting drunk and almost killing his wife? Gohan 4 life! I have no idea what you're talking about, looks like I need to rewatch the series It's from the most recent movie. Battle of the Gods. Check it out. That father-son kamehameha most definitely had me close to tears.  The cell saga was the first time I felt like the z warriors were truly helpless for a while. The Frieza saga just scared the shit out of me. I'd consider the end of cell to be where it started to fall off Not sure if I agree.  DB was great but it's hard for me to go back when I understand how absolutely weak everyone is.   Most of the really bad ass moments were in DBZ.   Have you watched it lately? After the Frieza saga, they're basically just telling us everyone's getting stronger. Visually, they look a lot weaker. There was about as much damage done at the Cell games as there was when Goku fought Piccolo at the world martial arts tournament, and less than what King Piccolo had done the year before. In the saiyan saga, they were causing massive earthquakes with the fighting. In the Frieza saga, they destroyed an entire planet. Then after that, it was like everyone got toned back down to about Goku's level when he took down the Red Ribbon Army. I agree with you and if it was realistic they would have been destroying galaxies by SS3.    But I'm more comparing DB to DBZ. Agreed. They should make a series of movies spanning the final arcs in Dragon Ball all the way through to the end of the Frieza Saga, ending with Goku's death on Namek. 

Frieza was the only enemy who had any meaning to Goku. After Frieza all of the enemies were only enemies because they were a threat to earth. 

However, I think they should tweak it a bit. Really, only 1 thing has to change. Porguna is never summoned on Namek. Therefor, Piccolo is never brought back to life. The Dragon Balls on Earth stay *Inert*, Frieza is defeated by Goku, Namek is destroyed by Frieza;Goku, Vegeta, and Frieza are caught in the blast, and the Dragon Balls on Namek die with them.

This ends the entire movie series with Gohan being Earth's protector, which if you're a DBZ fan, you'll know that he technically becomes Earth's protector. Cell was created to destroy goku and the androids. All of which were made by a former enemy  of goku Majin Buu Saga was def better than the Red Ribbon Army Obviously you've suppressed your memory of Gotenks. Imma let you finish but Majin Vegeta vs. Goku was the best fight in Dragonball history.

Also let's not forget how badass Cell was at times. He straight up KILLED Goku, the only other person to do that was Piccolo.

Some of the movie fights were great too, but I assume we're talking about the show only. Goku sacrificed himself to save the planet from Cell's explosion.  He still did kill him, but the way you put it makes it sound like he just destroyed Goku like it was nothing I don't which version of DBZ you guys watched, but it's already bloody violent.   
I'll never forget Freeza impaling Kuririn in the gut and then shaking him in his horns.   
Or when Piccolo shot both Goku and Radditz, there was a gaping hole spewing blood in there.

Did the US version cut all the blood? Just like DareDevil. I've completely binged and completed the whole season this past weekend. So gritty and gory. I love it.

Trunks: "I like your shirt."

Being green shouldn't have anything to do with you finding a healthy, young bitch. "Men of color" Greegas Why is this such a universal assumption? What is it about Piccolo that makes us all just think it's a black guy? Japan has been known to color black people differently in animation so they don't get in trouble for stereotyping.

Don't forget the cheese grater. [deleted] These are old school 7-11 Slurpee cups.  Yep, they cost a quarter ($0.25) for a 16 oz slurpee and the souvenir cup. Those were glorious days to be a kid. Had a stack of those fuckers all the way up to my ceiling back in the day.  Yes they were. I still have a bunch including several DC comics ones. I need to find them.  Due to inflation, that'd be about $1.50 so not that much difference now.  Why this? Red pigment, I think, fades the most over time. I'm assuming the brown was created by some mixture of red and green. Yep. Just messing around with the color sliders in a photo editor, CMYK values of 30/50/100/40 produce a reasonable shade of brown. Reduce the magenta without touching the other values, and it becomes quite green, pretty much the same shade as OP's cups.

Some red pigments are notorious for fading quickly. I'd bet that's what happened here. Exactly. Magenta ink is most susceptible to UV damage. Look at any fading billboard and you'll notice there aren't too many red shades remaining.  I, for one, welcome black baseball players as our reptilian overlords.

Edit: steal beans don't melt jet fuel!  Me too, I'm not planning an insurrection,  that's for sure. Green fuels don't melt jet beans!  What if they weren't black men at all?  What if they were green all along?  What then? Or perhaps they turned green with _rage_!!

That sounds disconcerting... Lets try a new spelling. Edited It's partially to avoid image smileys.

Also, most of the reverse smileys add a creepy factor which can be a plus (: For me it was to get away from the graphic emoticons. Then it became habit. (: It's ok MargotsGhost, they just don't know that bitches love the " c: " face. Use a 3 next time :3 My uncle is colorblind and he thought black people were green most of his childhood. Did someone tell him they were or something? Nope, he just saw the same shade and assumed. It wasn't until he asked about the new green people in church that anyone caught on. "See that guy? He's green, but that's racist so we say he's black."

 This feels like something I'd make up if I were colorblind.  Well the vast majority of them aren't black either, they're brown. So he wasn't any more wrong than the average. Is this true? what type of colorblindness does he have? &gt;Green with ~~age~~ rage. 

They're all Hulks.  Talk about performance enhancement just sayin' what everybody is thinking. We all know it.  They are just envious of Jim Palmer.  why are there 3 right hands and 1 left hand For me the most interesting thing here is that it took at least three people to make this photo happen. 

Poor grandma had to choose between cups or tables. Can confirm. This is what happens when black men age. 
Source: am green.  Actually Rod Carew was green. Not a lot of people know that.  Wilt Chamberlain confirmed for alien Yeah, but they didn't crack. Dr.Dre played baseball? The colors were pretty bad anyway.  Kind of a purplish after some washings.  I had Orlando Cepeda on mine.  I still have no idea who it was, I just know he played baseball and I had his cup. [deleted] You damnable printing geek. I came here to post the same thing. "OJ Simpson: not a Jew. But guess who is? Hall of Famer Rod Carew" It's not easy being green.  In Wilt Chamberlain's case, I'm willing to assume that the green was from an STD, as evidenced by his "20,000" women claim. Or they have gone green with *rage* - Hulk rage - from all the recent cops killing black kids... BOOM - Memories.  These are 7/11 Slurpee cups if I remember correctly.  We used to collect these (and those damn football pencils they sold at school) I haven't seen one of these cups in at least 30 years.  Those turned green pretty early on. I think it was a result of the dishwasher.  We got a good laugh when "Mean" Joe Greene turned green. The trade of football pencils was a serious fucking business in elementary school. (Especially the striped ones...when the striped ones came out it was like the L.A. riots.) Time reveals the reptilians' true form. It's just so you know they're all the hulk.

WE'RE ALL THE HULK, ONE DAY. TIL that black men turn into aliens when they age. who's the Cardinal? When 900 years old you reach, look as good you will not. Good timing; while watching Django Unchained last night, my wife leaned over and whispered "....why does Samuel L. Jackson look green??" it's all ogre now. Now I'm picturing what the world would be like if black people turned green as they aged.. 3 undead zombies + 1 immortal vampire 7-11 slurpee cups, only took one cycle of hot water in a dishwasher to ruin them. Scooby Doo guest stars? How much do you want for that palmer cup?
 [deleted] They haven't faded with time. My older brother had a collection of these back in the early/mid-70s. I think they are Slurpee cups from 7-11. I remember Roberto Clemente had this Martian shade of green. It always made me wonder... /r/oldschoolcool Just like real life.  So.. black people are Aliens, this explains why the cops are trying to shoot them all... because they know the truth.. That X-Files episode was true! They're like Shrek's brothers.  A fate all men will share eventually. See, I knew it! Obama is a reptilian. Reptilians. [The only rational explanation](http://www.journaldugeek.com/files/2015/01/ancient-aliens-guy.jpg) Black men: You won't like them when they get angry. That tends to happen Why isn't their hair green  Now we have scientific evidence on the development of Shrek and his origins. 
This a great day for the world.  Black People: All secretly the Hulk. This reminds me of that X-files episode where that all black baseball league turned out to be aliens Build it, and they will come ... from outerspace Is never ogre Alot of black inks are actually dark dark green. Look at most black tattoos over a couple decades old, green. Don't make me green. You wouldnt like me when I'm green. Just add a ridiculous price tag and you have a piece of modern art right there. Greengros? that's natural, just ask any 120y/o black men Actually they all are part Hulk. They turn green with RAGE This proves that black people are actually aliens.. You mean the African-American men became Martian-American. &gt; All the black men have turned green with age

Sounds like the name of a grindcore band Nope, not me.  Dont have a coat like that, looks heavier, hat too big.   There you go guys. Myth busted.  [But just for fun...](http://media1.giphy.com/media/12KiGLydHEdak8/giphy.gif) It's not Mythbusters worthy if it can't be tested with explosives in some way.  http://i.imgur.com/PKaFBON.gif
 What were they trying to do there? https://youtu.be/3wAjpMP5eyo The duct tape doesn't actually explode. Somebody was just messing around.  In our world the duct tape does not explode. In the world of mythbusters everything explodes, like a michael bay movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJxj1mou03M&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=55 I think I saw a clip of a Bollywood movie. They literally make stuff of nitroglycerin and C4 in their movies. I'm pretty sure a horse exploded.   Time to blow Jamie and fat Jamie up and compare the difference &gt; Time to blow Jamie and fat Jamie

Um ... for science? sure, thanks for volunteering
 http://i.imgur.com/xfsqg.gif Now we have to replicate the circumstances of the myth.  Jamie...  Do you mind buying that coat, wearing your hat all wonky, and heading to Nevada?  You forgot and washing a car. I vote we use mine. \#1 rule about mythbusters... if you lend them something, don't expect it back in one piece. It's a 1994 mercury stationwagon. There is no loss either way  Plus it'll be worth beaucoup karma You've never watched an episode to the end, have you?  Well, dang! Thanks for confirming, tho! :) Also, the dude's beret has a little pompom thing. Jamie's beret never does... I wonder if this guy has any clue who he looks like? Maybe he really is trying to impersonate as Jamie. Hilarious though, they are like identical twins separated at birth.
 I find it hard to believe that this is accidental. That guy knows what he's doing. I've accidentally impersonated Jamie before. I used to have a style very similar to his (mostly the hat and facial hair, and we have similar builds). Around Halloween one year people mistook me for wearing a Jamie costume. You are aware, we need to see what you look like.

For science! Is this picture of you at the car wash? Ha! I wish I owned a car. Maybe if he was washing a bicycle... My theory: Jaime does not own a jacket like that YET. This is Jaime, but from a yet to be filmed episode on time travel.  &gt; little pompom thing.

It's called a *tourie* (Pronounced Tour-ee)

- Signed, an angry Scotsman. Isn't "angry Scotsman" redundant?  [You just made an enemy for life.](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/791/850/b91.jpg) Damn Scots, you ruined Scotland! The problem with Scotland is there's to many Scots... or too many, even. So you are saying yes? ...Yes. &gt;...Aye. He may have no idea. I knew a hippie who drove around in a VW Van painted EXACTLY like the Mystery Machine. Had never watched Scoobie Doo, had no idea why people kept hollering about ghosts and darned kids at him on the highway. &gt;  painted EXACTLY like the Mystery Machine.

He seriously had "The Mystery Machine" painted on the side of his van, and he didn't know what it meant? Plot twist: it's Adam in the Jamie mask. http://i.imgur.com/saiIfO0.gifv Even the Jamie mask has a proper beret. I'm of the opinion that having Jamie Hyneman respond to your post is far cooler than possibly seeing him in public.  &gt;Nope, not me.  

Thank you for your testimony, Mr. Hyneman, but the community has not yet reached a decision. We will weigh your input against the photo evidence. [Myth busted.](http://i.imgur.com/z7AYpv1.gif) Jamie, did you press /r/thebutton? Must be the best 2 days of Reddit ever involving shoulder chickens and Mythbuster impersonators. He either:

A) Is Jamie

or

B) Desperately wants to be mistaken for Jamie. Yea, my first thought was that guy knows exactly what he's shooting for Yeah.. He's shooting for the dirt. On his vehicle. It's a car wash, dude.. this guy Plot twist: Jamie stole this guy's style  Michael Bolton: https://youtu.be/a7DdyChR8JU "Why should I be the one to change my style? He's the one who sucks." C)  Has no idea who Jamie is and lives his life wondering why people he doesn't know keep saying, "Hey Jamie!" 

Puzzled, he always says, "I'm not Jamie."

Every single person winks and says, "Riiight," and then smiles.
Eventually he's had to figure out for himself that some guy on a tv show has stolen a look that he thought was original.  Like that extremely obsessive fan that dresses and acts like Jamie and goes to Comic-Con every year and asks the same questions? Are you sure that isn't Jamie? Pretty sure, but I didn't go talk to him. I just took his picture from behind my steering wheel like a stalker. 

Edit: Damn, front page! Based on everyone's input, I'm now 99.9% sure it was him, and kicking myself for not getting out of my car and actually talking to him. 

Bonus tale: before he drove off, he put extra money in the wash, so I only had to use a couple dollars of my own cash.

Edit 2: Adam confirmed on a post in /r/aww that it was not Jamie. Myth busted!   9 out of 10 Redditors would've done the same. That's a myth. PLAUSABLE  *Plausible

**FTFY** He rejects your spelling and substitutes his own. [hehe] (http://img.pandawhale.com/61768-Kari-Byron-swimsuit-laughing-g-VNtD.gif) What did I just watch.... Thrice. She could shit on my chest for all i care. what's the difference between a chickpea and a garbanzo bean?  I wouldn't pay a garbanzo $300 to bean all over my chest _ Why is your username black? You can't just go around asking why people's user names are black It's ok, I have a friend with a black username.  Because LOOK AT ME EVERYBODY.

Nah, I saw it before in another sub and it was the first time I reliased usernames weren't black. I've always had a black username since then in my native /r/northernireland sub, and last month I removed my "accepts vodka bribes" flair in favour of a cool black name. It's blue if you remove subreddit style. Yep,

    a.author[href$="RedSquaree"] {
      color: black;
    }
is in this subreddit's style sheet which literally means for any anchor element with the URL that ends with RedSquaree, set the color of the text to black. This is also why that NotNotRedSquaree username is black as well. And the 1 out of 10 that wouldn't do that look like Jamie from Mythbusters. 11 out of 10 11/0
I just put zero as a denominator...how you like me now /r/math err Living in NYC, I've realized that if it *really* looks like someone famous, probably is. I've walked opposite past Emma Stone 4 times now in lower manhattan.  And each time, I get about 30 feet past her and say to myself, "shit, that looked like Emma Stone."  

My other recent celebrity brush.  I was climbing with my daughter at Brooklyn Boulders gym, and apparently Michael Cera is a semi-regular there.  So, as usual, I'm pretty oblivious.  And my 12 year old daughter 'whispers' to me, is that the guy from Superbad?  And, as most of us know, 12 year olds can't whisper very well.  He looks at me and says, you let your child watch Superbad?  And laughs.  

Yeah.  Living and working in the city you get pretty numb to it.  The only time I ever truly lost my shit and acted like a retarded fanboy was for Chris Farley back in the day.   In 1999, I beat the shit out of Andy Dick in a nightclub I was bouncing at.  Felt good. John Lovitz beat the shit out of him too, so that isn't anything to brag about. Did he?  Jesus, now I almost feel bad for the poor bastard... The real question is where did you take this picture? Northeastern Nevada Yeah, there is a pretty good chance it was. If it was Bangor, Maine I'd understand your hesitation over stamping it "plausible" however, they do a lot of their big boom experiments out in the desert. Seems possible he could have been in the area. Jamie has an honorary degree from the University of Maine, which is ten minutes outside of Bangor. So of all the remote places you could come up with, you actually picked a semi-plausible location, since I'm sure he goes to visit his honorary alma mater alllll the time. That was beautiful.  Can confirm. I got my degree at UMaine and while there I attended a talk with Jamie and Adam. [plausible](https://imgur.com/Ksr4Ttw) [plausable](https://imgur.com/RPyLfgK) [plusapibable](http://imgur.com/lVodNiZ) Stephen King, is that you? Was it near I-80? Because he has a Jamie &amp; Adam Unleashed show in Colorado Springs tomorrow. SF to Colorado Springs is like a 20 hour drive, but Jamie is just odd enough to do it instead of flying. That would put him on I-80 in northeast Nevada right about now. I heard somewhere he hates flying, so mark it MORE Plausible. Long driving trips are great if you have podcasts and taped books to hear A pretty good bit of filming for Mythbusters is done in various parts of Nevada, since there's a lot they legally can't do in California. It could just be a coincidence, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was actually him - either working, or just cruising around the 'neighborhood'. There's an assload of supercar stuff at the Bonneville Salt Flats right over the border in Utah, like famous record setting speedways and stuff... I don't watch Myth Busters but could they be testing something that requires a place like that? I know they like speed and booms and all that. Or maybe something less exciting about salt? :P That's why I'm not totally positive it wasn't him. We're only two hours from the salt flats, so if there's some kind of speed testing going on, it would put him in my vicinity.  That IS Jamie. Is it him, or not? Can someone bust this myth?  tweeted to him, and now we wait.  we need to know. pls respond *Its been an hour, is OP even still alive..?* He will surely ~~deliver~~! The Mythbusters are on a spring tour. If this picture was taken in the past week then they were on tour.

[Link to schedule](http://www.mythbusterstour.com/#) Of course that's not Jamie. It's clearly a walrus. That's another Redditor, who has long dreamt of this moment. what was he driving? Toyota Tacoma  You suck at this, OP. Jamie actually drives a Toyota Tacoma. That was totally him.

/edit 
http://www.imcdb.org/i092482.jpg

Did it look like that? Holy shit, yes! TIL I can't recognize a real celebrity when he's standing 20 feet away.  You recognized him enough to think it couldn't be him. You recognized him too much man Kind of like Charlie Chaplin getting 4th in a Charlie Chaplin lookalike contest [Busted](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/9423/did-charlie-chaplin-lose-a-charlie-chaplin-look-alike-contest) Many years ago when my brother and I were teens, we met Dave grohl at a small venue in LA.  We were standing like 3 feet away from him for a couple minutes just saying back and forth to eachother "is that Dave grohl?" "no, I don't think that's him" "no wait, It really is him!"  "no, it can't be" "no seriously, it's him" "is it really him?" he kept looking at us for a while with a weird expression (after all we were standing 3 feet away staring at him and having that conversation)  turns out it was him.  He took a couple pictures with us.   :) 

Edit: i fixed it :-/ OP, was he driving his Tacoma like this too? OP what happened? OP?! OOHPEEEEEE!

http://i.ytimg.com/vi/sT8m1Rk0oCU/hqdefault.jpg Well, that's an early 90s Toyota Pickup - the Tacoma started in 1996, that's an 88-95 Toyota Pickup. But I digress. Sorry to dash your hopes dude, but that *is* Jamie. Jamie dresses better. He wouldn't go out in clothes looking like that.  yes he would: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G2NiBiqhzo8/maxresdefault.jpg hey that's from tested Which isn't outside.

Myth Busted. dude that vest is leather looks like a sleeveless hoodie to me. Straight from the Bill Belichick 2014 line.  Maybe he would if he was washing his car at a self wash or something.  I detect a tone.  You just passed the hearing portion, now onto the vision test! **WHAT?**

You'll have to speak up, I'm blind. Maybe it was laundry day. nothing says good dresser like round glacier glasses, a beret and literally the same shirt and pants every single episode   You can really get your whole car clean in 3 minutes with just 12 quarters.  Confirmed or busted?  Today on Mythbusters. I usually end up spending about $50. And that's only when you call it good and just give up Summoning /u/IAmJamieHyneman.  You have to say his name *three* times.  "His name." "His name." "His name." Dad? /u/IAmJamieHyneman
/u/IAmJamieHyneman
/u/IAmJamieHyneman You guys ruined it, you've said it four times! It's supposed to be ***three*** times. Great, now he's dead. Happy? This is why we can't have anyone nice. /u/IAmJamieHyneman /u/IamJamieHyneman

There, now we should have two jamies showing up any minute... Goddammit It's been half an hour,  You'd probably have better luck with /u/mistersavage. I'm pretty sure Jamie was only on reddit for his ama. Based on everyone's comments, plus the picture of his truck, I'm 99.9% positive it was Jamie. 

http://imgur.com/DXkLS2f pic of him and the corner of the truck, didn't even think to look at the license plate.  The dealer sticker says Wills Toyota. This is located in Twin Falls Idaho super close to Elko Nevada, making me think this is actually not Jamie.  Zoom in, plate says "NTJMIE". Plate actually says BUSTED Was thinking the same thing. Jamie lives in Nor. Cal and is originally from Michigan so not sure what the connection to Idaho would be. Seems like a long way to go to buy a truck. I still want to think it's him though. It creeps me out that someone would go to such lengths to look just like him, of all people. 

edit: things &gt; Was thinking the same thing. Jamie lives in So. Cal and is originally from Michigan so not sure what the connection to Idaho would be. Seems like a long way to go to buy a truck. I still want to think it's him though. It creeps me out that someone would go to such lengths to look just like him, of all people. 

One of my clients is from MO, lives in IL and bought a $80K truck from NY because they could get it to him in a week for cheaper than the guys in town, which we later found out the guys in town were contacting the NY dealership for the truck anyway.

Dealerships being nearby is no longer necessary, and hasn't been for quite some time. I'm not saying it definitely wasn't him, but I wouldn't think too much about the truck comment. That picture of him riding in the back of one doesn't mean he owns one, it just means they used one on an episode of Mythbusters. If you'd mentioned 100 other cars, people could've found you screenshots of Jamie in or around one of them in the show too.

I think the important thing to ask is where were you when this picture was taken? If you'd taken this picture tomorrow, I'd say you'd have to have taken it in Colorado, because that's where he's going to be. It's actually too bad this didn't happen 24 hours later.

http://www.mythbusterstour.com/# /: This is the kind of post that I expect to be featured on /r/bestof where the post actually is Jamie and he shows up in the thread saying Hi. Sadly, /u/IAmJamieHyneman hasn't been active since his AMA a year ago :( Someone should call adam, he'll know Paging /u/mistersavage [When I met him](http://i.imgur.com/FBN3M6C.jpg) he was wearing a black t-shirt and no beret. Were you just hanging around in a shipping yard and happen to run into him? The shipping yard is the wild Hyneman's natural environment; they make their nests in those containers. No beret? Black shirt? That's not him, you got lied to man. Its actually Adam in the Jamie mask [Were you just hanging out in the shipping containers waiting to ambush celebrities... or what?](http://i.imgur.com/gDQk9GQ.gif) He was wearing no beret, but only because he was there picking up a cargo container full of new berets. He's like, "Get your damn hands off of me." Not to be offensive but man , his head is 100% egg shaped! I'm 99% sure that's a walrus and not Jaime.  [Are you implying that he's not?](http://i.imgur.com/DxrE4.jpg) [He's quite musical too](https://i.imgur.com/Y7MlVh.jpg) http://i.imgur.com/Wb6NslJ.jpg That makes me sad. hiney man Whoa, he definitely looks like a wordbank. If you asked him for an autograph I bet he'd get a semi  Why would he need a tractor-trailer to sign an autograph?

 oh that's the best response to that picture. I imagine if we were viewing the other side we'd see your username. Myth busted?

No, nut busted. Looks like the chicken I put in the oven and forgot to turn on.  Looks pretty turned on to me. Risky click of the day...  

Could've gone without. Every time someone says "risky click of the day" I think, wow, this dude needs to take more chances. Myth Buthded Sick cosplay  Can we all take a second to admire how starched his jeans are? Shit looks CRISPY It doesnt look like Jamie - That definitely is him. I can tell because of the beard and beret.  [deleted] I think that's him. That's the guy from Mistbusters. On first glance he looks like he's wielding a shotgun. "TIFU by seeing Jamie Hyneman from MythBusters and not approach him" Nope, just a Jamie impersonator. I hear he's booked for months. FTFY

&gt; Nope, just a Jamie impersonator. I hear he's booked for ~~months~~ myths.

 Monthbusters! ^(Tampon brand?) Patent pending Made of 100% walrus whiskers. When Jamie and Adam were on the Nerdist Podcast, they said that they often come across fans who try to look like Jamie. Have a Karma for being a Nerdist.  Good trigger discipline.  Is he standing behind Jamie? I can't see the gentleman you are referring to.  Your mythtake Is that walrus missing an arm? No. It's a wordbank.  That is Jamie from mythbusters http://i.imgur.com/wbEx2kM.png

Jamie just commented on Facebook saying it isn't him.  There is a Jamie in Anchorage, also. He's nice. So yeah that was totally him. I'm not sure if this counts as mildly interesting anymore  I work on Adam Savages car almost monthly. Had it for a month when he lost his keys......... Jamie has detached earlobes. That man appears to have attached earlobes I think it's just the angle and intensity of the light. It looks attached when you look at the ear directly, but the shadow on his neck looks detached.  Definitely, if it was attached it would not make a shadow like that. Creepy that you know this.  I just looked at the two pictures on this thread. [deleted] He can't. He's blowing smoke out of his ass like on that Mythbusters episode "can someone blow smoke out of their ass". Busted. No ear lobe shadow This guy has solved the mystery.  That's his disguise so people don't recognise him in public lets take him and let him fight against the real jamie.. the one who will survive is the new real jamie I'm pretty sure he's trying to look like our beloved Jamie, of which there can be no equal Hey! Aren't you Jamie from Mythbusters? No, then his username would be Jame :/ Or Amie Hey aren't you that guy that spelled your own username wrong in a note to Obama? Hey you're the guy who spelled your name wrong. HA! So she basically weaponised her calculators. I wouldn't have thought that was possible... She could be charged with building a weapon of math destruction Mike Tyson, is that you? Mike Tython. 

 Math Tython  Math Python Snakes  Thnakth I said this out loud more than any adult should.  I thed tith out loud more thyen any adulth thoud. My defenthes are impwegnable!!! It's a weapon of mass construction actually. C'mon now... It's a weapon of math instruction. No, she wants to build things brick by brick. As someone who went to a High School where our plastic lunch trays got removed because they were being weaponized, this was my immediate thought How Take thing.

Hit person with thing.

Thing is now a weapon. "You see this floor? Yeah, it's now a weapon as I'm gonna smash your head into it" I've been lobbying for years to get floors removed. they're just too dangerous for the kids. You should also remove the kids, they are a danger to themselves.

 And the adults, because the number one group of pedophiles are adults Also remove the pedophiles, they're too confusing for new players. outside is leaking Replace them with trampolines.  But then you got the gangs of thugs super bouncing kids into the ceiling.  Well then you just gotta replace the ceiling with trampolines.

This all ends with Timmy getting ballistic bouncing past the window. Bingo. If a kid was getting jumped by a group they would grab extras from line and it looks pretty innocuous to have trays when you are in the cafeteria at Lunch so the security guards wouldn't suspect anything. And then they would use them to beat the shit outta someone. Public school! You mean prison? It really wasn't that bad. There certainly was a really diverse population, both economically and socially. But in my experience it was a pretty typical American high school. But I suppose that statement can differ a lot based on the region.  &gt; pretty typical American high school

I really really hope not. that's terrifying. Even having security guards at school is a weird concept for me. It sounds a lot more like my middle school, actually. High school was much safer than middle. https://31.media.tumblr.com/b5200a74e6de259dd0ef55bd8bb8e800/tumblr_mrqeopy2Y51rawucpo1_400.gif That is amazing
 Ours were fiberglass and people would take them outside and throw them like frisbees.  When they inevitably hit trees, buildings, fences, etc. they would sometimes shatter.  Then people would throw the jagged pieces of fiberglass, which once led to me momentarily having a large piece of tray sticking out of my head. I can still steal the bricks, the calculators don't deter me I can send someone a message.

I used to work at a GameStop and when people traded in consoles, we had to put the serial number in the system which would print a sticker for the box. Many handhelds didn't have a serial number (stickers worn or fell off) so I always used 8675309. Every once in a while I'd ask a coworker to read the serial number to me so I could type it in. My coworkers hated me. Thanks for the story, Big_Ol_Butthole I turned my phone around to see what this spelled upside down :/ I turned my laptop. I'm not a smart man. Same.

But does she give kisses and hold hands? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTdTwcmxyo bOES LgB, obviously The song that will haunt you forever and ever 'til you give up and die.
  *8675309*  *Jenny, I got your number*  I can't believe I didn't get that.

I need make you mine.

Jenny, don't change your number.

 It's like a reverse kinder egg No, it's from a song  I called, no one picked up :/ dat feel when no gf you have to stutter the nine - "nieeeine" My grandpa had two barrels of sand stolen from his pickup truck.

They didn't even have calculators glued on... [Ah that ol' reddit bricker-ickeroo!](http://www.reddit.com/tb/32pf7p) Hold my science, I'm goin' in! Wrong link.  [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/32ol96/every_purples_computer/cqdbyb2?context=3) is the right one. The Last Of Us: Student Edition Tried using an extra large key chain with the bathroom key at work for the bathroom on our firm's floor. We used a 15 inch pole, a 8 inch Dreamcatcher, a wooden cutout shaped like a toliet that said "please return me", yet people still ended up forgetting to return the key.

I don't think the brick is going to deter anyone from taking it, purposely or mindlessly.  If someone wants to take it and tries hard enough, they will be able to.  This does, however, deter people from accidentally taking it away.  I don't think I would mindlessly carry a 1-3 lb. brick outside of a classroom and put it in my bag/locker. I said the same thing about the 15 inch metal pole and the 8 inch circumference dream catcher that I don't think anyone would mindlessly carry this away, yet mysteriously, people took it home with them. 

The dreamcatcher ended up in New York City (the office is in Chicago). There was an attorney visiting from New York, used the key to go to the bathroom before leaving for the airport and somehow forgot he had it with him. He called the next day from his office when he found it in his bag.  Hey... I don't remember bringing my dreamcatcher with me to Chicago... Welp, back in the briefcase it goes! My mind read 15 inch as 15 foot and I wondered how anyone could accidentally take that with them. I doubt it was an accident.  Dreamcatcher Esq. thought it would be the prank of the week. You underestimate my inattention to detail You need to put on one of these voice recorder thingies and let it say please return me nonstop Maybe.

Maybe not. 

Chemistry is about experiments amiright? I am chemistry teacher. I spray painted the back of 21 calculators blaze orange. Only two were stolen. I like this brick idea. I want what adhesive was used. 

On a side note, I use the cover and back of a 3 ring binder as bathroom/hall passes - hall pass taped inside the plastic cover sleeve. They have lasted about 5 years.  My AP Biology teacher in high school got sick of people incessantly asking for the bathroom hall permit to leave his class, so he stopped using the regular laminated cardboard pass. In its place, he used a vacuum sealed bag containing a fetal pig, swimming in formaldehyde. This effectively reduced the number of times people asked to leave. 

(He eventually had to stop using it though; Re: leaks) Damn it Snowden! ruining it for us again. I would never want to use the restroom in that class. E6000 will glue almost any two things together forever. No mixing required. Interesting, I'll update my "WD-40/duct tape" flowchart. I think I speak for everyone here when I say please share this flowchart. [flowchart](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8160/7214525854_733237dd83_z.jpg) My Spanish teacher used sombreros as a hall pass.  My German teacher used my French teacher as a hall pass  60 minute epoxy is what I would use.  Home depot has it in smaller quantities (I'd guess a tube would cover 6 or 8 calculators).  You will find larger quantities online or at a woodworking store (woodcraft, rockler).

Make sure you rough up the back of the calculator with 36 or 50 grit sandpaper (one sheet should be enough for 100 calculators -- you don't need to sand it much).  If you don't, the glue won't have enough little crevices to "bite" into.

Note:  If they aren't solar calculators, you're going to be sad when it comes time to change the battery. Yeah but you have to mix that stuff. There are other glues that would work just fine for plastic to brick right out of the tube or caulking gun. If you'd like, I'll ask my teacher tomorrow what epoxy was used.  I am interested in the glue. However, one fall of the desk - face down - and the calculator is dust. I also wouldn't want the bricks scratching the he out of lab benches, desks, etc. 

I also could imagine storing 21 bricks or lending 21 bricks to my coworkers. 

 I'll ask her about the glue tomorrow.  You should use JB Weld - it's meant for repairing industrial/farming equipment. Super strong and bonds to just about anything, in my experience. My old history teacher used a toilet seat as a bathroom pass.  It was always brought back, but it also had the side effect of deterring people from going to the bathroom because there's always a chance that the weird kid actually used it as a toilet seat.  Kind of genius, really.   Switch to a PIN code entry lock.  No key to lose, and you can change the PIN from time to time. I would be all for it, but the building controls the bathroom. We get two keys to each bathroom, the kind that are hard to copy. They charge $50 for a replacement and a locksmith charged $35. They have an incentive to keep it like that, because it makes money when everyone is losing keys. The reason the keys are expensive is because the design is patented and proprietary and the manufacturer has a near monopoly on their production. I believe there are a few different key and lock systems like this from different companies. This is marketed as a security feature since they keys can't be copied at a hardware store, and it is, but it is also convenient for the company charging tens of dollars for a simple key.

I found this out trying to get a new key for my building and questioning my HOA as to why the keys were $25. Turns out, the HOA is literally making $0 on the keys, that is just what they pay for them! This is for medeco brand keys. One of my teachers gave us an actual toilet seat. Back in my day, you had to trade a shoe to use one of the teacher's calculators. Stinky but effective. My highschool chem teacher did that.... until the school stopped it because the kids "needed" their shoes, in case of a fire or emergency.

No idea why they thought shoes were requisite, but them's the breaks. My school doesn't allow that either. I now accept anything of value they can easily prove belongs to them. Phone, credit/debit cards, driver's license, etc. The phone and driver's license are good ideas, but I would rethink credit/debit cards. It's a liability issue if they get stolen or compromised. *"But Abominablechupacabra had it last!"* I think I've accepted debit cards maybe once or twice. 99% of them use their phones. I think I've had to take a debit/credit card twice in the 2 years I've done this. I'm not terribly worried about it. So 99% of your students give you their phone (which probably has a calculator on it) to get a calculator? They also have access to the vast majority of humanity's collective knowledge via that phone. They only have to borrow calculators for tests. simple solution: exchange shoe for calculator and a fire extinguisher. Running with one shoe isn't as effective with two. Plus stepping on each other's feet and on glass. I still do this. Kids offer me bags, phones, pencil cases whatever, always take the shoe - no way they're leaving my lab without their shoe! My teacher last year made us give up something valuable too. It was the weirdest thing ever Free calculator AND a *free brick*? Is this Christmas already? don't drop it Yeah she didn't think that far ahead That's cause she's not a physics teacher.  A physics teacher might still do this, just to make jokes about their students having a lot of potential. They'll conserve their energy and just sit there with all their potential. Can I PM you large boobs instead Come on dude, read the instructions. This is genius! I think I'll glue my golden iPhone 6 plus 128GB smartphone onto a brick. Take it to the genius store and tell them you bricked your phone. Then you'll be the dad joke king. http://i.imgur.com/Lg8XITh.gif [deleted] /r/wheredidthesodago  A man was driving along, when suddenly his iPhone changed into a brick. This caused him such distress he started swerving all over the road.  I'd shit bricks if my phone suddenly changed to a brick. I mean, that's some straight up twilight zone type shit. Displays size compatibility And strength Of the brick? Dont forget to drill a hole for the camera. And the Apple logo. That'll make sure it never gets bent! Glue it *between two* bricks to protect it even better! On the bright side, it wouldn't make it any bigger!  Just a bit heavier  I'd be quite happy if that was thrown through my window
 The students likely to steal calculators are the same people that like to throw bricks through windows. Two birds with one stone. Actually, it's a brick Fascinating.

How does she propose to change the batteries? Um, bricks don't need batteries. How am I the first person to point this out?? Uh, yes they do. Ever seen the power bill for a brick building? you could power whole offices with the energy those suckers take! This is why you make things from steel beams people. I thought most buildings were made out of dank memes? Cause jet fuel can't melt steel beams.  Jet fuel can't melt...bricks? &gt;Um, bricks don't need batteries.

[Ah, the ol' Reddit Batter-roo!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/32ocqt/what_annoys_the_fuck_out_of_you/cqds82k?context=42)

 I'm guessing you've never had a TI-30X. Those things never die. I've had one for 10 years and have never changed the battery. Yepp.. My first calculator ever was a TI-30 which I got 28 years ago. I just changed the battery last year for the first time, and used it to sum up numbers for taxes today.  Solar power! She can change the batteries using solar power? Incredible  What a time to be alive! Ever tried using a solar calculator with dead batteries? Tilting this thing while using it would be liable to give you a wrist injury. I guess that would deter theft even more though.. I have been using scientific calculators for about 10 years and I have yet to come across that problem. She is a chemistry teacher, so I would presume she can concoct some sort of de-glue. I came here looking for this question.  The first student to steal a calculator and not a brick gets an A. Use chemistry: I'm sure there's a good solvent for that epoxy you could find.  This is what I was thinking. Get extra credit if you can use chemistry to remove the brick without damaging the calculator. Show your work.  This could go many ways...

Teacher could get in trouble for putting bricks in the hands of students. These days, school districts can pretty much proclaim anything as a weapon..

OR the desks are gonna get fucked up and the teacher will get in trouble. Either way, it won't be good. Way better way from the frontpage last week: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/31xyav/this_is_how_my_university_stops_theives/ If I were a teacher, I'd glue my calculators to machetes. My weight training teacher in high school let us use the gray 45 pound plate as a bathroom pass. Eventually we couldn't use it anymore cause it was seen as a weapon. It still has the words "Bathroom Pass" written on it in black sharpie to this day( I think) Your school must be full of some real assholes if this is necessary.  Years ago before TV control apps, my dad attached our TV remote to a 2x4 so we wouldn't lose it anymore

EDIT: a word Genius. Great minds think alike i suppose.  My HS math teacher searched through every single student's backpack and pockets because one of her graphing calculators was missing, only to discover she had left it in her office. Is it even legal for a teacher to search students like that? I know it's legal for the administration to do random locker searches for drugs and weapons, but can a teacher legally search an entire class of students even if they have a reason? In Canada, it is *technically* legal for school administration (and *only* school administration) to search students without police or parent consent.  But not the teachers.  And we all knew it was highly illegal, but none of us wanted to be the one that protested it because that would automatically label us as the one with something to hide. We're talking about a place where an 18 year old gets told they're not allowed to go to the bathroom. They rarely care about how their students feel.  This is exactly what the stapler guy in Office Space should have done. [deleted] Is this what people meant when they said they bricked their PSPs?  So, when the batteries run out, and you can't get to the back to put knew ones in, are the calculators *bricked*?

Fuck, I just noticed they have little solar panels. Fuck it, I like my pun, I'm keeping it.  They aren't even good calculators. Graphing calculators, I can understand because they're $100+. But those? They're $20 at best.  $20 * how many times they get "lost" per year.  It's not exactly Thor's hammer. You can steal a brick.


But would you download a car? Steal enough you can build yourself a house. This is so funny I shit a calculator. "Calculator fight!" *Challenge Accepted* JOKES ON HER IM A MASON Great, now little Jimmy can calculate the exact trajectory and velocity he has to use to break my window. That seems like a return policy to me. You take the calculator home and when you're done with it, throw the brick through her house window to return it. Pretty sure you can steal a brick... with a calculator glued to it.

More like she glued the calculators to bricks to make them less appealing so that they wouldn't get stolen. can confirm, a friend stole a brick from a bar once.

we had some drinks, it was there, got home, she took the brick out of her purse.
some people, man... "Outch, out of battery. Time to get the jackhammer out" Wouldn't asking the student for one of their shoes or something like that a lot easier than attaching bricks to calculators.  Not to mention they are pretty much weapons now.  But then again maybe she just wanted to make chemistry class a bit more interesting Jokes on her.  You have the chemicals to create a solvent.  Perhaps you'll get extra credit if you dissolve her adhesive.  So we can just give out bricks to children but that one kid who pretends his chicken nugget is a gun get's expelled? I've seen a couple of these Teacher-stuck-calculator-to-Brick/Wood etc lately, is this a common thing cause I've always had to have my own calculator?
 I don't think it's a common thing. I'm not sure though it could be.  ...how exactly does this prevent the calculators from being stolen? Having been a student before, I'd be even more tempted to swipe one. "You see a mousetrap. I see free cheese and a fucking challenge." She'll regret it when a student gets hurt. Really people? Batteries? You know they're all solar powered right?  /u/Ak74udieby is the real hero in this thread You see a calculator glued to a brick. I see a free calculator and a fuckin challenge.  Wise teacher... Glue them to AIDS.  Nobody wants AIDS. Oh so it's a calculator AND an excellent burglary tool? Don't forget a weapon! Awesome! Now you can save up and build a house!  "Can't be stolen" ^^^Hah! bollocks You don't think she did? I'll timestamp the row if brickulators tomorrow if you'd like Lmao... Go the fuck outside, kid. Thats a great idea. Dang

Nice to see you're still alive btw ;) Congrats on a good post! Oh damn!!

Whats up, buddy! took me a sec to understand the "glad to see you're still alive" haha! Thanks lol  lol ;) I was surprised to see an RES tag on the front page, then I was like &lt;INSERT YOUR NAME HERE AS FAR AS I KNOW IT BUT WILL LEAVE IT OUT SO AS TO NOT DOXX YOU&gt; ... now kiss.... We're old friends. 

Haven't talked in years lol If you bring your own calculator must you also bring your own brick?
Or are bricks and adhesive provided?  back in my day, we brought our own calculators to class and if we didnt have one, then we didnt get to use one. Lots of kids today get calculators because it's in their papers that they need them. For example, one kid at the school I work at is smart. He knows how to do the work, but he's a turtle. He's so freaking slow. 

The calculator lets him do the tedious problems quickly. Please note, none of the kids are allowed the use the calculators at all times. They're usually saved for tests.  I know, I had a similar policy. I'm saying we were responsible for our own materials  Reminds me of my high school chemistry teacher whose bathroom pass was glued to a large tiki head. 
Then, after someone stole that, the bathroom pass was a water jug that he would gradually fill with water as the year progressed.  What about changing the batteries?  That looks more like a sponge than a brick Nothin' a little bit of denatured alcohol cannot fix. I wonder what kind of building you could make with those. kind of presupposes accusal, thus causing of bad behavior

cant the calculators merely be tethered to something Their slogan should be "Why go anywhere else? You're already here you lazy fuck." [deleted] This screams success. I'd scream success, but I'm kinda \*yawn\* tired. Asshole you jut made me yawn Does it work with other things if I put them in asterixes.....asterisees? Lets try.

https://youtu.be/8Zf7tgRbvGY Well then take a nap.

Then fire ze missiles! I was thinking you might get sued but then I realized they'd be too lazy to care. http://i.imgur.com/ckzpWAj.jpg Honestly, a more delicately phrased version of this was my go-to response for people complaining about my shop's prices.  I'd basically say, yes the other guys are cheaper.  If price is important to you, go there.

No one ever did.  Because we were the most conveniently located store that carried the product they were looking for. The former mayor in my town owned a midas and at one point in time he was not honoring a national coupon. I guess this initially pissed people off, so he wrote an explanation and posted it by the service desk. In it he described why he wasn't honoring it and it basically broke it down to say the coupon was losing him money and that if he did honor it jobs would be lost or he would have to hire less qualified and experienced mechanics. He then went to compare his prices with everyone else in town and it proved that he was usually at or below everyone else. 
His shop had the best service around, and the nicest people. That letter made me a customer for life.  Thats good. Most Midas' are automotive hell-holes.  Fuck Midas in their collective scamholes. &gt;   If price is important to you

This simple phrase exudes confidence in service. 

 Their customers must be stupid too if they think they need to pay some one to rotate their tyres, surely everybody knows the engine does that nononononoNO. 

The road does it. If you just start the engine and never drive it any where, do your tires rotate? I didn't think so. Case closed. If you service your car at the lowest price mechanic, you're going to have a bad time.  They have below average rates on everything except spark plugs.   Most of that stuff could be done by a non-mechanic.

Pollen filter replacement?  $5 filter on eBay.  5 min to find the YouTube video on how to do it for your car.  Watching the video probably tasks longer than actually doing it /r/dadjokes  The savings would have to be $20 for me leave and drive somewhere else. I'm not rich but I am lazy as fuck. Meh, If you've owned a VW / Audi, probably any German car for that matter, and really care about proper maintenance, you either suck it up and take it to the dealer, have a very trusted indie mechanic (that probably buys parts from the dealer), or know how to do it yourself. 

Even something as simple as an oil change can be a nightmare if one of those quick change places uses the wrong oil spec / weight, skips the filter replacement because they don't have it in stock, or doesn't properly reinstall the under engine cover.  Hey, that's advertising that speaks to me as a person. That must be his justification for keeping the board up, too.

"Why take it down? I already put it up there!" Yeah but if you total up everything, the total of each column is roughly equal. To put a finer point on it, the VW dealer is always cheaper than at least one competitor. Thus, you can go to one place and get the average price for all services, versus having to go to five different places to get the cheapest possible price for all services. also known as the "[you could stop at five or six stores, or just one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCeQLeQiRP4)" principle wtf is this IIRC they're having videos of them filmed for an acting agency. What the fuck man! I'm way too fucking high for this Yup.  My favorite comment of the day. When in reality, all of the shops are in league with each other and price things all over the map so nobody is cheapest of all and nobody is most expensive of all. But since they are price fixing they can all enjoy an extra 12% compared to going somewhere out of the area. Brilliant. I doubt they bother colluding.   Most people don't understand that businesses can get the same results as they would from colluding by copying one another, without any of the work or illegality.

And it's extremely easy to justify that way, too. Pepsi starts charging $1.69 for 20oz instead of $1.59? Well, as a Coca-Cola supplier, I'm obligated to my shareholders to also raise my price. [deleted] [deleted] A car dealer can't void a warranty for that.

Source: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0138-auto-warranties-routine-maintenance

&gt;In fact, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, which is enforced by the FTC, makes it illegal for manufacturers or dealers to claim that your warranty is void or to deny coverage under your warranty simply because someone other than the dealer did the work. [deleted] While you do make sense, many economy classes teach you the opposite.

If you and a competitor originally have the same price, and your competitor raises prices, it is in your best interest to keep your prices the same lower price. This is because as a business you are already budgeted to be selling the goods at the lower price, and the customers who care more about price than brand loyalty will jump ship and you will gain a higher market share because of it. In most cases you can make more money by keeping your price the same than increasing the price to match! :) Maybe in Eco101 they teach you that. Real firms are almost totally dissimilar to the model used in perfect competition. Right, because by both raising prices neither one of the companies loses any market share but they both make .10 more per sale. There is no incentive for business B to keep the lower price unless it believes the .10 increase is so great that the majority of customers will chose the cheaper product, which in this case it obviously would not be. And often on products like Coke or Pepsi - people are not making a decision based on price, but on brand loyalty (and different tastes) or on what is convenient at the time.  I'm not going to drink something with a taste I didn't want at the time to save $0.10.  If $0.10 mattered I wouldn't be buying it in the first place. they really really aren't colluding.

i swear reddit will try and find a conspiracy in anything
 and you have the advantage of having someone who specializes in your make of car working on it rather than some guy at midas getting paid crap wages who may or may not know how to service something properly.  Yea but none of these things require any special knowledge. They're all generic service items. Man you would be surprised on what kinda of stuff that should be a standard job on a VW isn't standard at all.

And a lot of manufacturers recommend specific parts or fluids. I don't know I'd trust jiffy line to use the correct ATF in my car or even have the right spark plugs  This. The really interesting thing in the picture is that it's an actual dealer and not someplace specializing in bargains. If my BMW dealership charges anywhere close to what Valvoline charges for an oil change, I'm calling it a win. They don't, of course, but it's nice to see any factory dealer coming close. You shouldn't trust Jiffy Lube to do *anything* to *any* car. 

But manufacturer recommendations are readily available and also mostly useless. Almost all passenger vehicles use DOT 3 ATF, and their recommendation will usually just be a brand that most likely some back room deal got them, rather than quality. 

Either way, us mechanics have google. And AllData. So we can verify anything we want before doing anything.  

The real advantage a VW tech would have in this case is speed. If you've done a job 59 times on a car, you're gonna get it done a lot faster. 

But really whoever you trust is the right answer. As long as it's not jiffy lube. DOT 3 ATF, thats a new one It goes with the blinker fluid, dude.  i love this joke. what makes it funnier is that my boyfriend has an old triumph with pop-up lights. they have lubricant that needs to be replaced every so often, sold in tubes labeled "Headlamp fluid" DOT 3 ATF?? - Good Lord! - you are the kind of "mechanic" people should run from! - a moron that doesn't know the difference between brake fluid and ATF - please stop working on cars, you have no idea what you are doing!! &gt; The real advantage a VW tech would have in this case is speed. If you've done a job 59 times on a car, you're gonna get it done a lot faster.

That has no impact on the price of common service work though, as hours are set by the book. It just keeps you waiting for less time. [One](http://imgur.com/O615tIe) of them is over a $ (I'm guessing) cheaper

edit : $100 Bullshit. 

The VW dealer is 4th place if you're comparing overall prices ($521.36).

If you want all the services done in one shop, the cheapest option is Sears at $417.59, which saves you $108.43 over the most expensive single-option which is Firestone at $526.02.

If you're really cheap and want to save as much money as possible you can save an additional $35.64 by going to the cheapest shop for each option. 

**This brings your total savings up to $144.07.**

[Proof](http://i.imgur.com/PpyGn2p.png)
 It's probably not to say "hey we're cheaper!" but to show how sometimes you're not paying a load more for better work. Work done by the dealership is supposed to be better quality and use OEM parts, so some people might see a job is only $10 more and choose quality over cost.  When I was a mechanic, I worked in private repair shops and at dealerships. The quality of work at a dealership was so much better. It's specialized, they get specific training towards their vehicles **straight from the manufacturer,** they've done the exact same job on your specific model countless times, and they are using OEM parts. That, and if they don't fix the complaint, they don't charge unless the work is done (about +90% of the time, at least in California).

Here's an example, if you do your oil change at some small place, it'r rather routine, drain oil, change filter, refill oil. But nowadays, there are special washers and what not that need to be on the drain plug. At a dealership you would absolutely get that replaced. At a smaller shop, how would they know? Would they even have the specific part? I bet you (from what I've seen in the industry) that the drain plug goes right back on without a replacement washer.

I'm not a mechanic anymore, but I still go to the dealership, simply because I'm less likely to be lied to, and extremely less likely to have a repeat visit for the same problem. Agreed 100%. I can cite a lot of personal experiences to back that up. For example, I used to have an 09 Toyota Corolla. Oil changes were a huge pain in the ass. There was a special tool required to remove the oil filter housing that I've never seen used on another car, a cartridge style oil filter that nobody else was using at the time as far as I know, and a crush washer on the drain plug that was designed to be replaced every oil change. If you went to jiffy lube for example, I would bet money on it that they wouldn't have the special tool to remove the filter housing or the filter to replace the old one. They may or may not have the crush washers but probably wouldn't bother replacing it anyway. So you'd pay for an oil change and they would tell you they changed the filter when in reality they didn't because they couldn't.

Recently my mother-in-law brought her Lexus SUV to Pep Boys to replace the battery. [This](http://static.cargurus.com/images/site/2014/04/02/21/14/2010_lexus_rx_350_awd-pic-5949172662346048271.jpeg) is what it looks like under the hood. There is a plastic cover over everything held on by these stupid little pop clips. If you don't know what you're doing, they are very easy to break. Well the idiots at Pep Boys broke a ton of them when they replaced the battery and then tried to just lay everything back together without it actually being secured. I noticed right away when she got back home and I drove back and made them pay to replace all the clips. Most other people probably would never have noticed.

I have a handful of other examples, but I know firsthand that there are some things you just go to the dealer for, or if you're like me, just do it yourself. Having worked at a Greasemonkey before, this is extremely true. Annoying underbody shields would have missing screws to make it easier to do work the next time they came around. We would get the cheapest oil, our minimum wage employees wouldn't care to always replace the crush rings, cheap as they were.

I don't trust many places with my car for that reason. I would at least trust a dealer to fix mistakes made but you have to be savvy enough to catch them.  Had to scroll too far to see this. They are a specialized VW dealer. Not generic cheap untrained labor crap shops like Midas. Im very anti-dealer for having work done, but im way more anti-psuedomechanic chain shop. &gt; Im very anti-dealer for having work done, but im way more anti-psuedomechanic chain shop.

This confuses the shit out of me. Are you pro anything?  

It sounds like you're saying everyone should go to a mom-and-pop-type mechanic that they trust, but unless you're already mechanically inclined and have a lot of experience getting work done to the point that you already know who knows their shit, and who doesn't...... this is entirely moot. There are shops that specialize in German cars so they know what they're doing. I would rather bring my car there than to a dealer or one of those chain shops that barely know how to change the oil properly. &gt;  I would rather bring my car there than to a dealer

I will take my car to local shops when their operating hours don't involve me taking time off of work to go. My local dealer is open until 9 each night during the week and until 5 on Saturdays. All local shops are 8-5, M-F. Guess what. Those are the same hours I work. Being anti-dealer is like being anti-restaurant, in my opinion. It's almost meaningless to make a general argument because they're all independent and very different. Honestly, I think it's to build a good reputation with their customers. "If this dealer is honest about their service prices then I bet they're honest about their vehicle pricing!" Crazy theory but car dealerships play all kinds of mind games with their customers. Also, many customers are loyal too and will use one dealership to purchase and service their vehicles. You don't want to piss them off by charging them too much for a service and they find out they've been "ripped off" because so and so could have done it for much less. 

Source: I work with over a thousand dealerships.  &gt; You don't want to piss them off by charging them too much for a service and they find out they've been "ripped off" because so and so could have done it for much less. 

To go along with this, I think they may also be fighting against the assumption that because they're the official dealer, they're going to be more expensive.  To me, the sign kind of reads, "We *specialize* in the make and model of your car, and we're priced about the same as everybody else, so why go anywhere else?" The fact that you're getting OEM parts, certified techs and a huge corporation behind the price should also influence people.

Alot people complain about dealer shit prices, but every few weeks you see shit happen and first thing they do is run to corporate so the brand can get into the problem. The truth is, most of the time, big companies make it right when something goes wrong. Be it for publicity or not, they do.

Trying to that with you local oil change, if they don't fix it, good luck in small claims. Big dealers don't offer much more than a good local mechanic. Maybe you get a free loaner car at a dealer. The exorbitant prices are not justified.

Source. My dad has been an automechanic for over 35 years. Thats only *if* you can find a good local mechanic midas are not mechanics my dad has also been a tech for over 25 years with Mercedes you dont want to bring those cars (or any German car) to non dealers. They have so many special tools that only the dealership has and now shit is getting so intense you can fuck up the car  pulling out the dip stick too quickly, getting the wrong reading and flooding the engine with oil. A lot can go go wrong and thats why you want to go to dealers not some shady guy on the corner unless he has papers to go along with it. I agree with a lot of what you say. The one thing you are missing is that just because you are at a dealer, it doesn't mean you are getting a good mechanic. Hell, get a shitty service department and a shitty mechanic and your car and wallet both get fucked. Agreed. The dealerships I worked for required the techs to routinely go to extended learning and schools about the brand.  Yeah that's the impression I was getting from it.  Since it's clear they're not competing on price, I think what they're saying here is, "you could get your service elsewhere, but you won't save much money, and get a worse job done". So they trick customers into thinking they're being honest by being honest? Brilliant. I bought my truck at a dealership out of town. My first oil change (under warranty) I took it to the place I bought it. Great service. Drove right in, no appointments, in and out. They also found a staple in my tire that was causing a slow leak, patched it, and topped it up. No charge.

Second oil change I took it to the local dealership. I brought it in on a Wednesday morning at 8AM when they opened. They told me to bring it back the next day. Ok.. sure. So I did. I had just got my winter tires put on, and the tire pressure was all over the place, so I asked if they could even them out properly. No problem. I also had a recall to do, basically a firmware update for the truck.

They had my truck all fucking day. Around 4PM they called me to pick it up, I got a ride over. This oil change was also under warranty, so when they told me I had a $12 bill I was like, what? For the air in the tires. Are you fucking kidding me? I paid them with a silent vow to never come back to this place again. I get in the truck and it stinks like gas inside. I check the tire pressure and the numbers are different, but theyre just as out of whack. Like 240kpa, 256kpa, 250kpa, etc. I want these numbers fucking all identical, especially if I'm paying $12 for it.

It also turns out that when they updated the computer, they wiped out several of the feature codes, so I lost things like my compass. Now when I hit the compass, it just says 'No Signal'.

There's a reason I didn't buy from them in the first place.

I kind of went off on a tangent but your part about loyalty got me. I have loyalty to the dealership I use because they're good, fast, and not expensive. The one time I tried the local dealership because they're 2 hours closer, I got so screwed I'm still dealing with it (I have to get the feature for the compass put back in still).

I don't know if the local place is just inept or what, or if they saw another dealer's decal on the truck and thought "Fuck this guy" but they're not getting my business.. Chevy or Dodge? They put nitrogen in your tires, I bet. One of my coworkers is a sucker for this. The "free" oil change but the special nitrogen air. I told him that I'd fill his tires with 78% nitrogen blend for half the price. He goes, "where are you going to find a 78% nitrogen blend?" And that's why the dealership service departments are still in business. I always thought Tire Discounters was shady, but I needed new truck tires on my old 98 F-250 so I figured I'd go there. Free nitrogen for life of the tire, free rotations for life, and even pulled a screw out for free once. I've been so happy with them I've used them for new brakes and all my oil changes in that sucker. They've been absolutely great and honest with me.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/a3894/4302788/ As a technician, the air should be part of the service.  As far as the numbers all matching, there are within a half a psi of each other.  Just  parking the truck with the front two tires in the sun and the rear in the shade is enough to make the pressures different.   240kpa = 34.8psi.  256kpa = 37.1psi.  Those are a bit more than half a PSI of eachother.  I understand that the weather can adjust these but the dude wanted it even'd out and they didn't even try. Many cars call for a 2-4psi difference between front and rear tires. Also, the $1-$2 tire gauges most people use are not even close to being accurate.

That said, charging for air in your tires is fucking absurd. It should be included free as part of an oil change to begin with. yeah, that's the crux... inflating tires shouldn't be something you charge.   AIR IS FREE DAWG!

Totally agree with you, unless you're silly and paying for pure nitrogen inflation then filling the tires should be free along with any other paid or unpaid service. 

$12 is obscene. You can do it at a gas station just as accurately for less than a dollar and five minutes. That's actually not true for AWD vehicles like subarus and audis.  You want a bit more air in front, since there's more weight up there.  The goal is having identical rolling diameters which is better for the center diff. &gt; It also turns out that when they updated the computer, they wiped out several of the feature codes, so I lost things like my compass. Now when I hit the compass, it just says 'No Signal'.

It's possible the compass needs to be calibrated after the flash/firmware update.  Check your user manual for how to calibrate the compass.

If that's not the case, then they probably flashed your truck with the wrong flash. Say for example they also sell your truck without the compass, they may have flashed your truck with the firmware version for the control unit without a compass. &gt; another dealer's decal

What's the deal with dealerships putting a fucking advertisement for their dealership on your car? I live in California where that never happens - I don't know if it's illegal here or what. All I know is that I would never pay a lot of money for a new car if it had a BOB'S FORD sticker on the rear end. I bought my Civic at a Honda dealership. No stupid sticker. There was a rear license plate frame advertising them, but that was easily removed. I refuse to buy a car that has a dealership sticker on it. That shit comes off or I don't buy from them. Their choice if they want the sale or not. Last car I bought had one on it and I told them I wouldn't buy it unless they got it off and didn't leave a mark behind.  I know of one person who specified no dealer sticker when he bought his car new. When he turned up to collect, there it was. He turned around and walked right back out the door. Customer satisfaction is a funny thing. Loyal customers are both your best and worst customers. Best because they keep coming back, worst is the wrath they will feel when they think they are wronged. They are more likely to go to the deep end when they feel that they have received very bad service, though the caveat is that they are also more likely to shrug off minor things than regular customers. Don't let loyal customers snap.

Regular customers will usually just won't take their business to a business which wronged. Loyal customers who turned bad is more likely to try to fuck the business up by posting on youtube. Plus they also expect more special services for their loyalty. Your password is not "obvious". Reminds me of this:
http://i.imgur.com/c6tMzZH.png /r/firstworldconformists Name: "changed later"

/r/firstworldanarchists It was when the account was created, then someone commandeered it and changed the password. Its _obvious I go to my garage because I trust them. They've never fucked me over or anyone in my family. I don't price check because in part I trust them not to fuck me over. Do I pay more? Sure but not by much.

Things like MOT you hear horror stories about cheap tests but they find countless 'problems'. If you don't price check, how do you know they haven't fucked you over? Its less the price and more trying to flog you stuff you don't need. At no point have they recommended work that I didn't know needed doing and never pressured me when giving me options.

  Ahhh good point I avoid these "20 MOT" places for this reason. I use a local taxi company's MOT and garage facilities as they are very honest and don't try to sell you unnecessary work.

If you want an honest MOT, I suggest using your local council's facility in which their vehicles are tested. They don't have garage facilities so won't sell you any work. Also, the honesty there makes you feel like you can trust them not to make up some other bullshit repair.

How often do you get a quote for 300 bucks and end up having to pay an extra 80 for spark plug wires that were fine, or for an air filter you could change yourself in 30 seconds for 6 bucks? You don't have to pay for anything you didn't explicitly agree to before they did the repair, fyi.

 It's pretty smart actually because customer's will trust the pricing since they at least slightly are higher in most areas. However, the area where they shine is the oil change which they probably sell to just about everyone that puts a car in their shop. Ask any tech, oil changes are what's known as "gravy jobs", fast, easy and highly profitable. They know what they're doing here. Hah. Oil change is a gravy job my ass. With the synthetic they are probably getting 30 bucks after oil/ filter costs but to process a car and bring it through the dealer to make 10 bucks after paying everyone isn't keeping the lights on.  He means gravy for the tech, but a big dealership probably has a dedicated service tech/apprentice making a low hourly rate. 

New dealerships don't make their money from their service department. Too much recall work, too few major repairs. Not saying you don't want them to be profitable but they aren't your primary concern. 

If you want to make real money in service you wanna be working on cars that are 5-10 years old. Out of warranty, but still enough value to justify a big repair.  Dealerships *do* make the majority of their money from service. There's not much money in new sales, it's all in the service they generate. Manufacturers pay the dealer for parts and labor hours when it comes to recalls or warranty work, it's not pro bono.  Warranty and recall pay rate is set. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's awful. All depends. I'm well aware it's not pro Bono. 

As for new sales making money that must be a regional thing because they definitely make money. Used cars are where the money's at, not new. Especially with the advent of internet shopping and pressure from the manufacturers. A dealership with a busy service shop and used cars will make money.  That's not the point. They aren't trying to become a quickie oil change place. It's all about the upsale on the cars that are already in the bay. Of course no experienced tech wants to be just an oil change monkey, but if you're already working on the car how much time and effort is it to change the oil? It's about a 5 minute job and the tech probably makes about 10 bucks on it, which can be nice when you're only getting an hour of book time for something that actually takes 2 or 3. The dealership is probably netting $10-20 per car, so even if they only sell 50 a week that's an extra $500-1000 in upsale every week, and I'd bet they do more than 50 a week, easy. Since you have experience with dealerships is there any advice you can give me about dealing with a shady seller? A guy sold my brother a truck yesterday for like 6 grand. A 90's Toyota. By the time we get home it's already having a ton of problems. The guy straight up told us it wouldn't need any type of servicing since it had just had a new oil change and tune up.  I feel really bad, I actually can't offer much advice. By work with dealerships, I meant I am the annoying popup chat operator when you visit the site. Honestly, I know of quite a few dealerships that have return windows for a couple days or so many miles maybe they're one. I would bring it back and be stern that it feels like you guys were mislead.  Where do you live?  I think some states allow you to return the car under a very quick time period.  Advice would be to never pay 6 grand for a truck from the 90s even if it is a Toyota. If you have specific things you would like help fixing ask at /r/mechanicadvice. those are some seriously expensive spark plugs I know right? This reminded me why I know how to gap and install spark plugs.

Strictly speaking, I know *how* to change oil, but I'll pay you bastards $45 to not have to deal with that shit.

Spark plugs? Fuck, that's almost like paying someone to replace your headlights. Sure you *can*, but why should you? It's easy as fuck.

Ninja edit: I just noticed the *hilariously high* cost of a fucking oil change at any of these locations. Yeah, I'll just go get an oil pan and do it myself, thanks. Try changing them on a 3v Ford Triton sometime ;) Or many late model transverse v6 where you will get to pull the upper intake to reach the rear bank.

Many are really easy but there are some where I would pay to have it driven back OUT of my bay. The fucking back right plug(#8?) on the 04' expeditions... The damn fuel injection line makes it damn near impossible. How about $60 for a "pollen filter" change?! They cost about $10 and take about a minute to change. Dude, this is how you get robbed at the mechanic. They don't get sneaky and fix things that don't need fixing.

They fix shit for 6x the price it actually costs. Have you changed a Jetta's spark-plugs? I had to make a make-shift tool to pull the wires on my 02'. No way was I spending money for a tool that pulls wires and grabs plugs. (My tool was a wire hanger). I used to hate buying one-off tools for stupid shit, but if you pay somebody that has the tool to do the job, you might as well buy the tool because its often cheaper in the end.  My latest unitasker is a genuine moen faucet cartridge puller.  If you need your cartridge pulled, I guess I'm your man.  All of these services seem pretty outrageously marked up. I was thinking the same thing, then I realized it's a Volkswagen. Probably have to put it in the service position and remove half the engine to change the plugs.  "Hello there, and welcome to to Steve White Volkswagon.  How can I help you"  

"Yeah, can you tell me how to get to the Sears Auto Center?" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii8rC6CPCvM&amp;list=RDIi8rC6CPCvM#t=7
 Eh, the only ones where they aren't at least the median price are the transmission service and spark plugs. While the board says "non-DSG" I wouldn't be surprised if VW's factory ATF for the regular automatics was still quite expensive compared to off the shelf ATF. As for plugs, I have no idea, those are a commodity item.

Their oil change price is relatively good, and anyone who doesn't buy cabin air filters for $10 on Amazon/Rockauto/etc. and put them in themselves is getting suckered. &gt; Their oil change price is relatively good, and anyone who doesn't buy cabin air filters for $10 on Amazon/Rockauto/etc. and put them in themselves is getting suckered.

Goddamn it.  I just checked Youtube to see how easy it actually is to do and now I'm trying to figure out how much money I've wasted over the years by not doing it myself. If you actually buy the full synthetic oil meeting the VW specs + a filter, you end up spending $50-60 anyway. (I own a 2009 2.5L Jetta, it takes 6L of oil).

Seems to me you could save tens of dollars every few thousand miles, but I'd rather up my chances of my car running for hundreds of thousands of miles than to save a few bucks.

When it comes down to it, living without a garage means I'd rather spend an extra $15 for VW to change my oil.

 I think you guys are not on the same page. 

He was talking about putting in your own AIR filter not oil filter. Exactly this. My time is worth way more than $10-20, and they are financially vested in finding issues with my vehicle before I'm stuck at the side of the road. Depends on the car. You can do an oil change for like ~$20 if you go cheap. I always did my own up until buying my truck. For $38 I get an oil change (syn) and an inspection. I can't buy oil and a filter for that You live in Greenville, SC? I know the radio jingle played in my head when I saw the sign. Did it open up your mind when you saw the sign? Steeeevvvee white.  Drivers wanted.  Clemson  I'm form the area and immediately recognized the dealership. Damn radio ads. So weird to see my hometown's name on Reddit, usually if SC is talked about something fucked up happened or people are talking about Myrtle Beach or Charleston.  Fuck the prices, how's the *service?* A couple extra bucks for the peace of mind in being able to trust a company is almost universally worth it. Very good. Had a small part replaced this afternoon. Pulled up to 5 cars in front of me. I think I was there for a half hour. It's a great dealership.  Totals:

Steve White needs the money for those radio jingles Drivers...wanted... Steve White... Come on down to KIA OF GREEEER! 

Sometimes, I miss Greenville.  Haha I've been here almost 5 years and I don't think I've spent an hour total listening to the radio down here, so I'm not familiar with the jingles.  Why go anywhere else?

Hmm, no idea. Sorry, that's a typo.

"Why not go anywhere else?" Why? Go Anywhere Else! Works on contingency?  No, Money down! Interesting.  Also that they use an exclamation point instead of a question mark.

"Why not go anywhere else!" Well, I'd probably go there first so I don't have to waste time figuring out who's the cheapest. Ooh, ooh, I know! Because there is more to a job than the end price.

This is a dealership so they are using OEM parts/filters/fluids. Those other places are using aftermarket parts and *usually* the cheapest they can get. Sort of order of importance:

* Tire rotation? No biggie, no parts involved (as long as the tech doing it knows how to torque your lug nuts (or bolts for a VW).  
* Synth oil change: Again, no biggie. Although I have come across some cheap synthetic oil, that's usually not a problem, though.  
* Pollen filter: most people won't care about the quality of their filter. There might be a little difference, but it's probably negligible.  
* Trans fluid: here's where things get interesting. I can only speak for Honda because that's where I work but I'm guessing VW has special trans fluid, too. Putting the wrong fluid in there is worse than not changing it at all.  
* Spark plugs: most aftermarket places get their plugs from one company. As long as that's the same as the OEM plug, you're fine, but using a different brand can be disasterous. For example, Hondas *need* NGK (or Denso for some models) plugs. While many aftermarket shops use Autolite, Bosch, or Champion, because they are usually the cheapest. I like my local dealership when I go in for service.

3 series drivers : helped by paunchy, sweating old guy wearing a polo shirt.

7 series drivers : helped by supermodel wearing Dior and Chanel No. 5 Are 5 series drivers helped by a sort of hot soccer mom?  Yeah, kinda like Flo in the Progressive Insurance ads. God damn ProTech $45 for a tire rotation?! I went to Les Schwab with non-Schwab tires on my truck once.

I figured $20-$25 I'd be out of there. They wanted $18 per tire. I went to Wal Mart and had all four done with new stems for $16...and they do it for free from now on. I have always gotten fantastic service at Walmart for basic shit. Never any up sale, they double check everything, and prices are among the best. Aside from specialized sports car tires, they have great time prices too. Hail corporate I guess.  http://i.imgur.com/wFuIC0N.png "we are the okayiest!!!" &gt;Prices exclude tax and **applicable shop fees.**

That's how they get ya...or get themselves... I work with car loan documents quite a bit. Texas and California are the worst for fees. Texas has sales tax, $33 titling fee, $23.75 inspection fee, $5 sticker fee, vehicle inventory tax, licensing fee, road &amp; bridge fee and a $125 documentation fee.

Then they tax each and every contract or add-on you purchase with sales tax. 

To be fair, most of this goes to the government and not the dealer. The point is not that they are the cheapest. The point is that people assume the "stealership" is overcharging for everything by a lot, when in fact their prices are in line with others. The real question is who the fuck spends 45 bucks for a tire rotation... That one place is significantly more than all the others....  And 115 for an oil change..  It costs me 70-80 for full synthetic using like about 7 quarts.  Honestly, I'd take it to an official dealership before I go anywhere else.  Anytime I've taken a car to a mechanic, whether it be a "family friend" who is "honest" and "does good work," or just some corporation franchise shop like those listed, it's never been a good experience.  In fact, the dealership usually has it done in a day or two, done right the first time, and did it for less money than that other "honest" guy who wanted to keep my car for a week and still not get it right. I have the same experience. I think the reason is a dealership just replaces the part that is broken, whereas a mechanic will try to fix it or find a cheaper replacement. Dealerships pretty much always just put a new part. Also, they only work on one brand, so they know your car inside out, fixed everything there is to be fixed on you model many times before, a normal mechanic no so much.

Last time I went to a mechanic, charged me 150 euro to play with some "loose wires" and said it fixed the problem. It didn't, had to replace the valvetronic that was 400 euro installed at the dealership. So lost 150 euro for nothing... this si a double edged sword though, the dealerships are trained to just throw on a new part and send you the bill. like in this example with a hybrid battery with oxidized connectors: http://www.carscoops.com/2015/02/man-fixes-camys-hybrid-battery-pack.html $60 to replace a cabin air filter! geeze i'm in the wrong business.  They should show how much it costs to DIY.  Power to the home mechanic! My old mechanic had a great sign in his shop. It explains how you get what you pay for, and sometimes paying more will save you in the long run.  Paying more to get something done right the first time, and without that work screwing something else up is always worth it in my book.  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/qYPZdyG.png) are the ones that are cheaper for anyone who doesn't want to have to compare every number. Weird this is here today. I brought my Jetta to VW yesterday to see what it would cost to have my 4 in-door speakers replaced...$1,261.00. Nooppe Not Happening. Go to Crutchfield.com and buy the instructions for your car model and with a little googling you can do it yourself. It's seriously not super difficult.  Are these VW specific prices, or is this area expensive? Fifty bucks to replace a filter; $80-100 for oil change? Fuck that. most people don't service their car at a dealership When fixing your car the cheapest option is not always the best Nor is overpaying for basic services. It all depends on the quality of work. If you've got an honest mechanic it's worth paying an extra 20% rather than go with one that will tell you something else needs to be replaced when it's an easy fix or sabotaging parts. Or even just incompetence. That ends up costing you much more. Often times shops advertising low prices is just to get you in the door, then they milk you. My guess would be this guy advertises as a reputable mechanic that is worth the money... Why else would you post those in your business 100% agree. I go to a guy I trust absolutely. He's no discount guy, but ive saved thousands by having honest assessment of my autos and options, with no pressure.  As a person who owns multiple German vehicles, I'd just like to take a moment to say that those service prices are a bait and switch for most owners.  They have used the most basic cheapest model VW sells as their comparison point, because they know that the rest of the model lineup services are significantly more expensive.  See below:

1) Transmission Service.  Most VW's use a DSG dual clutch transmission.  The fluid and filter should be replaced at least every 45k miles.  The cost for materials and service?  $600

2) Spark plugs are at least $100 a set for a 4 cylinder engine, and they like to bill at least 2 hours of labor (possibly much more if you have plugs that are hard to access)  What they are leaving out is the fact that you're usually going to need new coil packs as well when you replace the plugs (they like to go out every 40k or so)  Add another $400 to your bill.

3) Pollen filter, I actually don't really have anything to say here.  The filter is about $40, so the labor charged here is not *that* bad.

4) This is also a decent deal.  Oil + filter runs at least $45-50 so this is a pretty good deal.  Definitely a loss leader for the dealership.

5) $20 for a tire rotation is a bit ridiculous.  Most tire places will do it for free (America's tire, etc.)

Overall I love German cars, but if you don't learn to DIY you are going to be spending a lot of money to keep them running.  Most of the things on this list are very easy things to do even for people with no mechanical skill.  Look up some internet DIY's and start saving yourself some money. &gt; 3) Pollen filter, I actually don't really have anything to say here. The filter is about $40, so the labor charged here is not that bad.

Where the fuck are you purchasing your filters from? I bought a pack for my car (needs 2) off amazon for $15. It literallly takes less than 5 minutes to do, and you can sit in your car the whole time and often do it with no tools at all (depending on model). What car is that for?  OEM filters for german cars are expensive. You don't need OEM cabin filters... you're not going to get 10 HP more or something, there is literally no additional value with OEM label on an air filter. I know that, but for comparisons sake the parts should be the same.  I was making a comparison between the dealer and DIY'ing.  Sure you could go to NAPA auto parts and buy some filter made in china for 10% of the price but that would be an odd and lopsided comparison.  Why are the plugs so hard to change?

My Honda takes 20 minute to change out all 4 plugs.... I hear you, German over engineering is a real thing. Its not really over engineering in the sense it is better.... i don't understand this....spark plugs are like 2 bucks each and they're easy as shit to change. Please keep in mind that my commentary is only directed towards German vehicles.  Parts costs are significantly higher than Foreign/Domestics Yeah but here you can have genuine certified one of a kind VW techs fix your VW. Dealers love to make people think that they are the exclusive source of repair for a make of car. Its not that we are exclusive source of repairs,, its that your vehicle is all we work on.  All day every day we work on cars just like yours.  We know the common problems, have the best resources backed by the manufacturer to help fix the less than common ones, the special tools to do the job right which can be insanely expensive.  We keep the proper parts on hand that keep your car running like it did when it was new.   Of course the price will be higher, but our overhead is higher. We're not paying some window licker 9 bucks an hour to work on your car.  Quality costs money. VWs are among the worst with the special tool bullshit.  I needed to change a hub or something and it took some fucking ridiculously expensive adapter.  I agree with you about the 9 dollar guy, but I think most A techs are A techs and your going to get pretty similar results provided they are honest.   Most A techs are all the same,  but if you've got one guy who works one 16 different brands and only sees a VW once a week, and another A tech who hasnt touched another brand for 10 years, who would you choose?
 For a regular service? I'd choose the one that's cheaper. Considering it's something that anyone can take a couple hours to learn to do, why go with the more expensive option if not do yourself? The only reason I can think of is when you sell your car it looks better to some people when they see on carfax that you got your car serviced at a dealership.  As is your right to chose where to go. "tire rotation" don't the tires rotate by themselves? *sigh* upvote  No. They REVOLVE. I never tire of that joke. This seems like a decent ad for Sears...do you work for Sears?
Hmm... I work at a dealership, I'd rather pay slightly higher pricing then deal with some shitty customer service, also you do get what you pay for!! Assuming it's a reputable dealer service department they're not so much more expensive that I'd let someone from, say, Firestone touch the spark plugs or transmission.  Better chance of them following torque specs and such.

The little stuff is competitive enough in price it's really probably not worth the time and effort go to another place if you're already there for something else.

If your vehicle is still under warranty having the service done at the dealer also makes it much harder for them to try to blame someone else if something goes wrong (fortunately I've never been on the receiving end of this).

Outside of warranty I'd probably check to see if there's a local club for my vehicle and see if they could recommend a good independent mechanic who knows your car. Most customers who come into an official dealership for service are there because they believe (rightly or wrongly) that they'll receive better quality work. But in the back of their mind they're worried that they could be paying a much lower price elsewhere.

So you might say "Well ok... but the prices on the board are lower, so they're just going to leave."

Well, not necessarily. The customer might feel obligated (to themselves) to at least get an estimate from other places. But... if a customer leaves the lot, chances are they're not coming back.

So the dealer puts the prices on the board for essentially two reasons: To satisfy the customer's need to shop around, and to keep them on the lot.

The customer wants to purchase service from the dealership. That's why they walked in the door. And, they know they'll probably pay a premium for it. But they do want to be reassured that they're not totally being ripped off.

Also, if you'll notice, it doesn't say (or even hint) anywhere on the sign that the dealership will have the lowest price. It emphasizes things like genuine parts and certified technicians. ITT so much nonsense:

- People assuming the 2.5 is a four cylinder (its a five).

- "My 93 civic is $15 for an oil change therefore every other car ever is too" (the 2.5 takes 6.3L of synthetic, oil changes differ in price depending on the amount and type of oil used).

- "The transmission service is stupid for reason X, Y, or Z" (maintain the fucking car or buy a Corolla and drive your appliance on wheels into the ground.  You don't get to buy a car that requires certain maintenance, not do the maintenance, have it break then join the "all VWs are bad" crowd because you are too lazy/cheap to take care of your car).
