I chalk it up as no one my age wanted to go see B.B. King play cause of a generational thing or something.

I was standing there by the back of his bus where there were a few dozen other fans and this one family was talking to this guy behind the fence to the bus who ended up being one of his tour managers or something. The guy walks in to the bus and a minute later pokes his head back out and tells this family's 3-4 year old kid to come around the fence and meet Mr. King. So this kid goes on the bus for a bit and comes out with a bunch of signed stuff and he's totally into it. It's like he was too young to realize who  exactly he just got to meet but it was pretty amazing for all of us to see. The show was awesome and frankly Im lucky I got to see him when I did.

Thinking things like \"I don't care if people torrent; as long as they hear my music, I'm happy. Then they will know what they're getting when they come to see my shows.\"\n\nIt's fine for Mumford &amp; Sons, as they can draw a crowd. Lots of acts make most of their money (at least the quick money) from touring. That's fine, and there isn't anything wrong with that. But for musicians who don't tour/play shows and primarily just make recorded music to be sold (which, like I said, recorded, mixed and mastered music is almost a complete art form unto itself), they aren't making nearly as much money as they could be making, because the people who own copies of their music are torrenting them.\n\nA streaming service like Tidal that could pay more money to artists could help this. But people don't seem to care: they don't want to pay or give artists any compensation really, and they just think artists are being greedy. Jay Z might be a fucking billionaire, but millions of other bands are nowhere near that level. It's like the 1% + the 99% thing.\n\nIt's a shame, people seem to be willing to follow the rules to not steal anything else that you'd spend money on (or at least most people), but when it comes to art, people want to consume it so badly, yet don't want to give anything to the artist in return.", "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "created": 1428986934.0},{"body": "Can Mumford start a streaming service that is exactly like Spotify except it pays fair royalties to artists?

What is twitch you say? Twitch is a website that streams pro and amateur gamers alike, allowing you to see what someone else is doing when they play a video game along with what they are saying or appearing like as most streams are accompanied by a webcam and mic.\n\nWell, twitch has a thing for Darude Sandstorm. Idk how it came about, probably because the song itself is archtypical and for many encompasses a wide swath of electronic music. So, when someone on twitch chat asks what song a streamer has playing, the go to answer has become Darude - Sandstorm. This is regardless of whether it is techno music or country, the answer is always and will always be Darude - Sandstorm on twitch. I have no fucking clue why. And when the song actually is Sandstorm? Prepare your anus, because that chat will be nothing but a solid fucking wall of\n\nDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDU\nDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDU\nDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDU\nDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDU\n\n... and so on.\n\nSo that, is the joke that everyone is making in this thread. I don't fucking get it for the most part. I guess it might be because many songs on p2p networks were improperly labeled Darude - Sandstorm, or maybe its because the song embodies the genre so well. In any case, the joke itself makes no fucking sense. Sure you can have origins, but if twitch has taught me anything it is that twitch defies all reason.\n\nEdit: a follow up for you, because you also asked about \"dank memes\". The phrase dank memes is something that is native to reddit and from what I can tell is a joke about the stupidity of some of its user base, or at least people who frequently use the word dank. Dank was a word that was originally used in reference to high quality marijuana, but because stoners are stoners, came to be used as a reference to anything that was positive. Thus young people could often be heard calling all sorts of things \"dank\". Someone along the line apparently thought this was stupid and jokingly called something here on reddit a \"dank meme\". The joke took off and now it has become a spammable term that reddit loves to use often without context or any real significant meaning. Generally though it is used to poke fun at someone being the lowest common denominator redditor, someone who really likes \"memes\" (commonly confused here on reddit for image macros ala /r/adviceanimals) and uses the word dank a lot, or perhaps another way to phrase it would be a \"bro\". This sort of jest is also where \"ayy lmao\" comes from, making fun of people the user views as stupid, but also used as a completely spammable phrase that has no significance or meaning.", "gilded": 1, "score": 800, "created": 1428502862.0},{"body": "It started because one of the users, who played mostly League of Legends, loved to play that song over and over on his stream.

They all knew it, but had to answer it for every new viewer. So it became a joke, which everyone enjoyed because they were part of those core users who answered the question all the time.

What the hell? This song sounds great though. \"Strings\" at end of last chorus come through well. +\n\nI'm probably going to be in the minority here, but getting rid of compression completely kills **Parallel Universe**. The [original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fPYyoY49Bc) is in your face and intense the whole time; the loud volume is used as an effect that sustains intensity across the sparse instrumentation. With this revised version, the bottom is constantly going out of the song. John's guitar solo in particular sounds weak. It's just not as enjoyable. -\n\nHowever **Scar Tissue** sounds great. Way more of a ballad version. +\n\n**Otherside** sounds way more complex and interesting, but again the guitar solo used to be the strong point of the song, now it's weak. -\n\n**Get On Top** is more interesting. Anthony's voice sounds way more nasally and annoying than the [original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A6VY-TGysU) sounded. The chorus is more annoying. Him doubling himself sounds annoying. It sounded way better when it was less clear. The jam session, however, is more awesome. +/-\n\n**Californication**: I'm starting to question the quality of this remaster: Anthony has a lisp added to his voice. It's very distracting and annoying. He does not sound like himself, or like the original recording did at all. The instruments, however, sound impeccable. Drums are amazing and the main driver of the song's intensity, bass and guitar are great. I really want to like this song, but Anthony sounds like he's an alien from another planet here. It's just very sloppy. I expected better. -\n\n**Easily**: Man I did not remember this crazy ethereal jam part at the end of this song. It's been a while but it sounds amazing. I [confirmed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhiE6B1AkgQ) that the original does not sound this awesome at the end. The opening riff is weaker, but it's not that important - this song is a clear win. +\n\nPorcelain: I always skipped this song haha. It sounds nice and full but I'm not qualified to debate whether it sounds different. +/-\n\n**Emit Remmus**: sounds way more hard rock without the treble.. I guess John's guitar was probably too loud in the original. Bass and drums give it a plodding, technical, building feel. The bridge is crazy. I think there's double bass? +\n\n**I Like Dirt**: You can hear the tension in the beginning. Guitar is weaker but I hesitate to call that a bad thing. However I do think it is bad that Anthony and the guitar don't encroach on each others' sound waves anymore. It used to create a cool blend effect (like two soloists playing over a similar register) but they don't complement each other well here. Also at 37:34 I hear a very distracting noise 3 times.. sounds like a bad cymbal recording. +/-\n\n**This Velvet Glove**: Guitar is just weak. It needs distortion to compensate for the lack of distortion on the track or something because this is not the song I remember. This was one of my favorites too. It would not be my favorite if this was the original album version. Guitar does sound cool on chorus though. It used to blend in with Anthony's voice but here it is distinct. -\n\n**Savior**: Always thought this was kind of a boring song. However the remaster helps Anthony sound better somehow, and the weird breakdown part sounds good. The guitar solo at the end is very heavy on the mids. This makes me think that maybe it's not coming through in other songs because its focus was moved from treble. +\n\n**Purple Stain**: Bass sounds awesome. There's some distortion effect on it. Anthony's voice is louder than guitar though with this remix, and although I have been rambling on about it for most of the review, that's a problem that heavily detracts from the original intent of the mastering. +/-\n\n**Right On Time**: Bass sounds clear, drums sound cool, guitar comes through (and gets loud at the end), vocal mix sounds hilarious (because one of the singers is creaking), there's more personality than there was before. Some weird clips of someone talking were added at the end. +\n\n**Road Trippin**': Epic. Gave me chills. Vocals are a little high but still the definitive version. +\n\nDon't know the B-Sides :P\n\nOverall, the electric guitar is way too low. It does not maintain a consistent and commanding presence like the original master did. This affects basically every song, but some songs it does help (guitar was too loud to begin with). Also, the increased clarity that comes with the dynamic range does not make the songs unequivocally better. The instrumentation gets really sparse - they are after all only a 3 piece band - and the compression served as an effect that filled the instruments out and gave them character. \n\nLove him or hate him, Anthony's voice is now the primary focus when he's singing, and it creates a very unequal, unsatisfying balance between him and the guitar. This is very typical of some remasters I've seen - in particular the remaster of the album The Ugly Organ by Cursive decided that every syllable Tim Kasher utters needs to be comprehensible or something, and in doing so completely upset the delicate mix and cut off the balls of the awesome guitar work. Maybe this is a necessary move to increase the dynamic volume. On the other hand, the remaster of Gish by the Smashing Pumpkins did not do anything whatsoever to disrupt the powerful presence of Billy Corgan's guitar strings with his voice. So I think this remaster is just sloppy. \n\nI gave 7 songs a +, 4 songs a -, and 4 songs a +/-. That sounds pretty good on surface, but you can't ruin Parallel Universe, Californication, and This Velvet Glove and get away with it, so I'm giving this remastering a thumbs down.\n\nEDIT: I now think this is an unmastered version; the song differences are similar to one described by [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Californication_%28album%29).", "gilded": 0, "score": 6, "created": 1428705218.0},{"body": "Holy shit where can I download that?

Shouldn't we respect their art and their creative process by listening to the tracks as they originally intended?\n\nI'm just unclear on the artistic merit in making a piece of art *more palatable to the buyer* after the fact, instead of respecting the original artwork and the artist's intent to make something that we happen to find less-palatable.

This is the reason why TV commercials are often so much louder than the adjacent programming.  Advertisers want the ad to be as loud as possible so that people will perk up and pay attention when it comes on.  The same principle applies here.\n\nIf everyone were to agree on an RMS (or average perceived volume) well below the current \"brickwall\" norm, then end-listeners could achieve the same exact levels by simply turning their volume knob, while still enjoying the benefit of wide-open dynamics.  The problem is that in order for this to work, everyone has to agree not to smash their tracks, and this isn't happening.  Songs that aren't compressed to hell will always sound puny when played alongside their crushed counterparts, so nobody with a shot at radio airplay can afford a dynamic mix as long as everyone else is just \"making it loud\".\n\nI think you'll find that, in most cases, the artistic elements of distortion, compression, and lo-fi aesthetic are all fully formed in the mixing stage (which, ideally, has about 6dB of headroom).

Most people i've encountered think mastering is about making the mix sound fat and polished and what ever. Nope. That's the mixers problem. I've always tried to make my masterings as transparent as possible. If the mixing is done professionally there's not much that the mastering engineer needs to do or even should do. And i think a good mastering engineer knows that. Some guys use EQ to bring the levels up and some guys like myself just use a limiter. But i always try to keep the mix sounding like it originally was mixed. Just louder. And it's actually pretty hard to do that. I very rarely use compression when i'm mixing, maybe when it's a live band and usually i just compress the kick and snare a bit to make them more punchy or something. EQ is my best buddy. Holy fuck this is hard to explain. Compressor is just a glue for mastering.\n\nAbout them bits and kilohertzes. 16bit 44.1 is plenty enough for anyone. Youtube does some weird encoding shit that pretty much always cuts everything above 18-20khz or something. That's why stuff there sometimes sounds so flat. They do other shit too. Only reason those 24bit 196khz things exist is because it gives more headroom when you're recording it. Of course it sounds better, but when you poop out the normal 16bit 44.1 version of it, there's not much difference in my honest opinion.\n\nI hate when tracks look like sausages on the waveform, but if the band played full blast punk rock for 3 minutes then obviously there's not going to be that much dynamics in there. So band people, think about the dynamics!!! Have some silent little moments in there. But yeah, it's pretty much down to the mixing engineer and what the higher ups tell them to do.
