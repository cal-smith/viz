Let's also write a book about them and teach children that the cosmic teapot is real and it loves us. Of course, there's no evidence for it (the book is not evidence), and it's undetectable by our senses (even through the most powerful telescopes), so they just need to accept this all on faith.

My problem is that people then take this thing that represents the unknowable and tack-on a whole load of bullshit that they can't possibly justify; they claim to know what their god wants.

They had a rock slide while I was staying in curry village. It is so loud, it was a deafening cracking and splitting of granite. I thought thunder at first, then I felt the ground shaking. It was like a larger sized earthquake. Luckily, it was in the afternoon so people were not as panicked as they would be if it were in the middle of the night. I'm telling you, it sounded as if the earth was cracking and splitting apart. It was truly insane, and quite scary. I half expected to be swallowed whole by the earth or have a tree fall on me, I didn't know what it was until a minute later. An experienced hiker yelled \"rock slide!\" And then we all knew.  From what I can recall, at least one rock climber died (while saving his friends), and many people were injured. The size of the boulders were probably larger than this one. You could see the dust rising from miles away I heard.  \n  \n\nI guess what happens is in the summer, when the ice melts between the rocks, it then dries up and the cracks expand, splitting the boulder apart? Something like that.. Anyways, it was a very scary experience.  \n\n  Edit: I found the link, and it was June 14 1999. http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-06-14/news/9906150052_1_rock-slide-curry-village-yosemite-national-park\n\nEdit 2:  thanks to my fellow redditor, smith6ar for explaining the correct process in how the rock slide occurs:   Water freezes in the cracks and expands.

Big, large, spews lots of ash, and violently explosive.\n\nThink of it as someone who had been really really constipated for a long time. The kind of lava in a Plinian Eruption is felsic (silica rich, low iron content, very viscous, forms a thick lava dome....hence my constipation reference).\n\nNow, imagine massive amounts of fart gas being built up in our constipated man. The same occurs before a Plinian Eruption. Magma is rich is gasses like carbon dioxide that builds up.\n\nGoing back to our constipated man, eventually alot of poop and fart gas builds up. As you can imagine, our man is in a lot of pain and discomfort, probably some damage to his large intestine and rectum. Similarly, immense pressures from volcanic gas and magma build up causes earthquakes to shake the surrounding area, mini steam volcanoes called fumaroles and phraetic eruptions to occur, the volcano begins to buckle and swell.\n\nSuddenly one day, at the height of the constipated man's pain, he runs to the bathroom and pushes really hard. What results is a spectacular and disgusting poop eruption as chunks of poop and fart gas fly out of his anus. \n\nSimilarly,  when the volcano's structure cannot take it any more a violent eruption like the one in Chile occurs. Sometimes the lava dome just explodes out. Sometimes (like Mt. Saint Helens), the while side of the volcano explodes out. Nevertheless, a huge ash cloud is sent up into the atmosphere,  violent pyroclastic flows run down the volcano at near super sonic speeds, lava flows run down the mountain, chunks of mountain fly everywhere, and pure chaos breaks out. Any living thing caught in a pyroclastic flow is blown away, incinerated, or both. If they survive they'll be covered with second to 3rd degree burns. If they try to breath in the hot ash they'll burn their lungs severely while volcanic ash (which is just tiny volcanic glass) cuts their respiratory tissues causing them to cough up blood....a terrible way to die actually.\n\nAnyway, happy earth day everyone! :D", "gilded": 1, "score": 1188, "created": 1429752979.0},{"body": "I think you hit on exactly the right analogy for explaining this to reddit.", "gilded": 0, "score": 234, "created": 1429754396.0},{"body": "Reddit and poop analogies go hand-in-hand.

Grant spots a KID kicking dirt onto one of the digs. He notices and frowns.*\n\n&gt; **GRANT**  \"What's that kid doing?\"\n\n&gt; *(to the kid)* \"What are you doing there!? Excuse me! Can you just back off? This is very fragile! Are you out of your mind? Get off that and go find your parents!\"\n\n&gt; *(to Ellie)* \"Did you see what he just did?\" \n\n&gt; *The kid stomps away, pissed off.*\n\n&gt; **KID** \"Asshole.\" \n\n&gt; **GRANT** *(to Ellie)* \"Why do they have to bring their kids?!\" \n\n&gt;**ELLIE** \"You could hire your help. But there's four summers of work here, with the money for one. And you say it's a learning experience, sort of a vacation, and you get volunteers with kids.\" \n\nSource: http://jurassicpark.wikia.com/wiki/Volunteer_Boy", "gilded": 0, "score": 7, "created": 1428796799.0},{"body": "I'd let it sit on my shoulder.", "gilded": 0, "score": 166, "created": 1428792628.0},{"body": "[[meta]]", "gilded": 0, "score": 26, "created": 1428794808.0},{"body": "*You guys, you guys!

", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1430105844.0},{"body": "Sedimentary rocks each have an environment of deposition. Specific lithologies can be tied to a different depositional environment. The resistance to erosion typically depends on the mineral content of the rock and surficial aqueous geochemical processes that operate on the rock. Mechanical weathering also plays an important part in reducing the grainsize of the rocks. A sedimentary facie can be though of as a distinct rock unit or geographic boundary defined under certain conditions of sedimentation (related to depositional environment). Walters law of facies states that vertical changes in the strata reflect lateral changes in the depositional environment. In a sense each time the sea moves further inland different sets of rocks are deposited. When it regresses or moves away from the coast line a different set of rocks are deposited. Sea level changes can be tied to different sedimentation processes that produce different sedimentary facies. These stack on top of each other in geologic time (simplified view) and produce the layer cake view of strata.\n\nShales aren't well lithified and tend to be slope forming strata (more easily eroded). Dolomite and limestone are more resistant and often are cliff forming strata. Sandstone is often resistant to weathering too. Resistance to weathering depends on sorting (how the size of grains is distributed through the rocks), mineral composition (feldspars easily weather to clays, quartz is resistant to weathering (dominant mineral in sillisiclastic rocks), and calcite weathers easy in the presence of carbonic acid), the actual grain size and geometry of the grains, the nature of bioturbation and other freeze thaw processes that may mechanically separate the rock, pore space and fluid chemistry, and on the nature of the cement of the rock. Lichens also can produce acids that act as chelates that further weather rocks lol. If u want to know more let me know.\n\nOver time I think the force of waves exposing the strata would average out so there won't be certain areas of the structure that were more differentially eroded than others for rocks from the same formation (lithology). If anything there would be pore network differences in the rock and differences in geometries of sedimentary structures that would allow for a preferential erosion of a specific area of the geologic formation.

As the water smashes up against the headland rock, the erosion process begins. Waves chisel away at the rock and over time a cave is formed. Another factor of the erosion process that forms sea stacks is wind. Both wind and water pound heavily on the rock pieces to crack and weaken the stone.\n\nWaves continue to smash into the cave throughout the years, breaking pieces of rock away slowly. Cracks and weak places are created due to the amount of force with which the waves smash into the cave, especially during storms and swells.\n\nEventually, the cave will give way and the water will drill its way on through the back of the cave, thus creating an arch over the open section. The arch may survive the destructive forces of the waves and break away to reveal one large stack of rock.

Well, that is due to transgressive and regressive sequences (Basically changes in sea level). The more resistant and white rock is likely limestone while the thinner beds of dark rock that seem more eroded are shale and there is certainly some sandstone in there too.  Every change in lithology (rock type) is representative of a change in sea level, up or down.  These see level changes are generally caused by glaciation events and plate tectonics.
