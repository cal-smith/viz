I like it because every time I would carry one of my own trash bags I'd feel like I'd saved a dollar. So then I could treat myself to a few beers each week as a reward for my moneysaving. Good going, kid. I make $30 dollars an hour, which essentially means I make $.50 a minute.  If it takes me 3 minutes to run the trash down, that's $1.50 of my time.  Having the kid do it is like saving me $.50!

Edit:  Guys, obviously I know I'm not saving money if I pay someone to take my trash out.   And the more garbage you make, the more money you save!
 This guy gets it. Throws mattress in trash bin.  Dusts off hands. Dollars.  If I order a bunch of stuff from Amazon I could save even more money! [The logic of a Kohl's shopper...](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-K392wrPUgms/UW8--V8_c4I/AAAAAAAABhw/egwn5BCBh6M/s1600/2013-04-17+19.22.14.png) If you somehow took 10 bags of trash down a day. At 50c/bag, That's $35 a week rolling in for taking out your own trash. That's one Keystone Light!! Go on, you've earned it pal! What do you do for a living? I need a better job. Or to go back to college... probably both. I work in IT as field support.  I have not been to college.  And the network engineer who is making $85k/year above me?  He didn't go to college either.  Get your foot in the door somewhere, and start learning as much as you can, even if it means doing it on your own time.  I can't tell you how many times I've staying after work to see the resolution to a problem. Awesome, thanks for the advice! And of COURSE you're in IT. I forgot this is reddit. :P haha To be fair, I was in preventative maintenance (of HVAC equipment) before I fell into this job. Look at this guy with the job. Man I wish this was my apartment complex i'd feel guilty for only giving $1 a bag. some of my trash bags are ginormous and heavy as hell. The trash bags that come out of my apartment following a complete kitty litter replacement would be worth at least $5. It's basically a bag of sand after that. A bag of very disgusting sand. It's heavy and kept at arm's length at that point. Quite the workout. Honestly he should be paying you, dudes getting jacked off of your own material, fucking free loader. stealing your gainz &gt; dudes getting jacked off

heh Not me. Kid needs a hard lesson in how to price his services. Supply and demand, bitch! You are both a little evil and correct. Perhaps he is still attempting to acquire new business before he pushes toward the prices the market can bare. 

Yep... I meant bear. I'm not a smart man.  $1 isn't bad depending on how far the dumpster is.  He could probably do like 20/hr.  That's good money. Let's say there's 500 units in his complex and he gets 100 of them on board, he said 5-8pm, he could easily be taking multiple bags per unit and stop by multiple units per trip.  He's making $100 in three hours assuming 1 bag per unit every 2 minutes.  After one day he buys himself a red cart for $20 bucks and he's up to 1.5 bags per unit on average, that's $150 an evening, or $50/hr.  Next thing you know he's getting too many bags to handle himself even with his cart so he hires two kids at $10/hr to take bags and charges them a rental fee on the red carts he owns...eh, I'm done..  
Edit:  3 years later, he's built a multi-apartment conglomerate with hundreds of employees to pay who now need health insurance and greedy investors who expect record profits each quarter.  The IRS is on his ass because, well he was a 13 year old kid so he didn't know the first thing about taxes.  He's shooting dope to relieve the stress and that awesome camera he finally bought sits on a shelf collecting dust because he works 100 hours a week.  It all turns out ok though because he ends up selling to yahoo for $800 million and starts a photography studio where he can finally do what he's passionate about.  A few years later once yahoo has run it safely into the ground he buys it back from them for $1 million just because he fucking can. Keep going.  I want to know how he builds his empire  Breaking Bags
 TRASHPORTATION this week completed a vigorous round of fundraising by venture capitalists on wall street, raising $15 million. 

Soon to be sold under the ticker symbol TRSHP, the CEO of this new company is said that he plans to invest his new profit in a new camera, acne medication, and a new gaming PC. YES!!! I want to know how he ends up buying out Waste Management and Advanced Waste [deleted] That's when you start using contractor bags and fill those suckers up.  Sign up now, get locked in to the $1.00 low rate, be warned though, prices will go up to meet ever rising demand! That's why he needs to institute a subscription service! $15 a month for service would be really good for all parties, and if he can get just 10 people to pay that's already $150 a month in low effort spending money. I might have to steal this... Actually if he could just get 12 people a day and take 1 bag per door he would make $360 in 30 days. Give or take a couple bags and doors he has the most efficient way already.  I would say he could make $300 for the service regularly and that doesn't include tips (which he's almost guaranteed) Yes but that seems like an unrealistic amount of trash.

Edit: Nvm maybe not if there is a decent amount of apartment buildings in the area. I used to be a maintenance man at an apartment complex with over 700 units. This kid could possibly make this a full time job. If his complex is anything like the one I worked at, the farthest units from the compactor were over a 1/4 mile away.  I was just opining that my dumpster was at the end of my block.  
  
A quarter mile?  I'm shutting up now. Mine is a full mile away. Through snow. Uphill. Both ways. I'm not a topologist but that doesn't sound right... Hell no. $15 for unlimited trash throwing you're out of your mind. In my gf's complex there's no elevator and you have to up a couple flights of stairs then walk all the way to the trash which is way on the other side of the building. Per bag is way more fair  I'm sure he's banking on tips from folks like you. If he is smart he will invest the first $20 he makes into a 2wheel dolly and maybe a couple bungee cords to help streamline his buisness. My apartment complex has valet trash service, but it is mandatory and costs 15 bucks a month. I'd rather take it myself, though I'd be more than happy to provide a monthly fee for a kid like that.  Valet Trash Service has a nice ring to it.  I'm thinking band name. Agreed; ours is closer to $25 and also mandatory. Living on the third floor it's convenient at times, but ultimately I'd rather save the money. I left my garbage bag outside my door one day to take when I went to work and when I went to leave it was gone.  I assumed a nice neighbor too kit which was great. Instead I came home and saw a $50 bill from my apartment saying I was leaving trash everywhere.

Edit: People saying to leave it in front of neighbors door is one of the reasons why the fee got thrown out. Solution: Leave it outside your neighbor's door Wow, something similar happened to me. We had maintenance men that would come pick up trash I think on Tuesday and Friday, but it was made clear "have your trash placed at the concrete pillar in the parking garage by 8am" because after that they wouldn't take it. I wasn't going to be up by 8am, so I sat it out there at like midnight the night before....the next day...$100 trash fee. NO where at any time did it say how early you could put your trash out there. I fought it and fought it and eventually I won but man were they trying to fuck me for setting a bag out early. 

And when I asked them how they assumed it was me?? Oh they straight up said they dug through the trash to find mail. So, the lesson is, you can leave trashbags outside neighbours apartments for free disposal? I definitely would have paid this genius. When I lived in an apartment complex, that quarter mile seemed like it took an eternity.

Edit: Guys, a 13 year old making a typographical error doesn't make him any less ingenious.  I wish this kid was around when I lived in an apartment complex and had things to dispose of that I didn't want anyone to see me carrying down to the dumpster. Garbage bags are way too thin, and even if you double or triple them up there's always the fear that someone is going to make out a shape poking out. I would have paid this kid the $1 and tipped him $100 if he could extend his hours until after midnight. [deleted] Who* We know the "who". We just need to know "when" he'll strike again...we need a undercover 13 year old The Trashporter.

Teenage photography enthusiast Jack Porter (Jaden Smith) lives what seems to be a quiet life along the Hill Valley apartment complex, hiring himself out as garbage transporter - recyclable or otherwise - from apartments to the dumpster.

 Take my money   God damn, that's beautiful. Can we get warner bros on this? The previous trash boy http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2zot2p/whats_the_grossest_thing_you_and_your_so_do/cpkw0vj What in the actual flying fuck... Thanks, what a great start to my day. 12:20 a.m. and I'm done with the internet.  You think paying a 13-year-old $100 to come to your apt. after midnight might look a tad ... strange? no, why? Of course *you* don't No reason....

:( [This](https://i1.wp.com/giant.gfycat.com/HomelyWateryArgali.gif) is my face reading your post...It's funny, but then it seems like you have put some thought into this... I'm curious now....what kinda 'stuff' you throwing away that you don't want to be seen.

-signed mgmt Kids.  Ha I went through the same thing man. I'd get questions but the easiest excuse is to tell them its Halloween decorations. If it's not between the months of November and January I usually just said something like my son uses prostethics that we cycle through every few weeks.

Eventually management caught wind and I had to move out, since it was hard to explain lying about a son and blood soaked carpeting
 Quarter mile? People in my complex put the trash on their car hood to make the 100ft journey! Hey Ricky how's Bubbles and Lucy doing? Suck it Donny! It's especially funny to see them stop every 10 ft because the bags keep falling off.  I'd buy him a dolly for 10% of all profit he earned in exchange.  Why buy him a dolly? He's a 13 year old guy. Why not buy him a camera like he wants? dollys can be fun for anyone. he could dress her up and use his camera to take pictures of her.

EDIT: [Here are some stats for those who feel the need to comment with your own testimonials](http://i.imgur.com/Xt23Woo.png) 

[Source](http://www.nmhc.org/Content.aspx?id=4708%20) Not many people in general have it currently though About 8 months ago I did a session on Bitcoin mining for some middle school kids as a part of their summer-tech-camp.

To my wtf-surprise, not only did EVERY SINGLE ONE of them know what bitcoin was, but they all had dogecoin wallets on their phones!! I guess it was some joke/fun way for these kids to be throwing less than a penny at each other (or more for paying each other for a soda) that caught on at their after school program. 

That said, considering it was a tech camp.. and these middle schoolers were spending a few weeks of their summer there, they fall slightly away from "people in general". Still neat tho.

**edit** their/there i'm so glad i stopped hearing about dogecoin. The idea of a currency being based on a shitty meme made the whole digital currency thing seem like a joke. But we sponsored a NASCAR car! We were legitimate for a moment! I just about died when I saw the car. My dad watches NASCAR on the regular, and him asking me what in the hell a dogecoin is was fantastic.  was was*
 Edited edited For the love of America.... 


It's a stock car not a nascar car.  are you sure its not a DOGECAR? Driven by a RACEGOD?? i dont think digital currency needs to prop itself up as 'serious', i think it will prove its worth regardless. dogecoin is only spreading awareness about digital currency, and the fact that it's a joke only makes it more popular. i don't see a problem with something like this being funny. I'm sorry, my english isn't that good, I didn't quite understand your last sentence. Is ending the sentence with "their" something legal?

Edit: Thanks for the explanations _^_^ I think OP meant "there" It's legal, but he used the wrong "there". Since no one told you yet, OP actually invaded Poland through his use of 'their' and instead intended to use 'there.' Sorry, no one answers questions about grammar usage on this website. You're silly. There is nothing better than cash. A 13 year old doesn't want a bank account, a 13 year old wants cash. Hell, I want cash and I'm not even 13 yet.
 Lol, calm down.  I think we're still capable as a society at handing over a dollar or two for a kid doing some work.  We don't need to bring technology into ever single situation.  I truly don't even see how this is any easier.  All they have to do is hand him $1 per bag when he knocks on their doors every week.  No need to bring credit cards and smartphones into the picture.  I give you the money, you give me the donut, end of transaction.   There's no need to bring ink and paper into this. I cannot anticipate a situation where I would have to provide proof of my donut purchase.  Venmo that shiiiii like a modern human, b. Not when you live in a shitty apartment like mine where you can find several target, or Walmart carts thrown in the creek near you. We had a cart named dumpsmash that we found in a creek one time, and used it as our dumpster transportation device. Dumpsmash was a trooper. Love that old wheels on plastic. This is my fault.  For a year, I lived in an apartment building behind a grocery store and a ShopKo (similar to Target).  There was a field next to us with a large hole in it, and I'd try to fill it with shopping carts. We retrieved out of lot carts for the local supermarket. $2 each.  We would ride around on our bikes and gather them up.  An afternoons work and we could net $30-$60 bucks.

 After this past winter he should have either enough money to buy the camera or maybe a telescope or enough money to buy a suede jacket for the popular girl at school who will awkwardly teach him to be cool but in the end help him understand the true meaning of love.  Do you write for Disney? http://imdb.com/title/tt0092718/ Also known as "Boy Rents Girl". 

Now that's something I'd watch. that sounds kinda like Pretty Woman That sounds like prostitution. is it any good? Uh, did you not see those sunglasses? Of course it's good. I'd say it is pretty good. About the same as all other 80s highschool romcoms.  If you're a fan of the John Hughes school of movies, then you'll love it. I fucking love this movie hahaha John Green? Not enough death and weird hobbies/interests to be John [deleted] The kid would be a diabolical genius if he found a way to disable the elevators, thus doubling demand for his services and allowing him to charge more.  Plus he could start carrying groceries *up* in addition to trash *down.* My tower complex in Boca Raton had a trash chute at the end of every floor.  Open it up and whoosh!  Down the trash went to the basement!

Jews do not carry trash to a dumpster.

 Oy vey!  Think of the children!  Any chute large enough for a bag of trash would easily be large enough for an unfortunate, curious, young, exploring child to be schlepped off to Shamayim! You need to create a novelty account replying to comments as a concerned Jew. I've been found out.  My apartment use to have one of those chutes. I lived in a government project building, which is 12 stories and MADDDDD people. One chute per floor. I got bored once and tried to climb through, but the way they are design makes it impossible to fall in even when I was 5. When you open the chute, its just a V shaped bucket where you throw your trash in, you dont see the long tunnel that goes all the way to the basement. When you close it, the bucket tilts forward and the trash falls down 9 floors into a main dumpster.

I would make my parent wait in the morning so I can see them take the dumpster out from the basement. Cause yo, I was a kid. Now I live in a house and I hate taking the trash out like everyone else. I read this in Kyle Broflovski's mom's voice. [Your comment reminded me of childrens hospital](http://splitsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/marino-7000-a.jpg) Also have this in mine. I do not live in Boca Raton. 

It would be a bummer to live in an apartment without it. Enough to pay some kid 1 dollar per bag. One would think you could easily buy a firefighter's key on the darknet to accomplish this very thing, but I've yet to find one for sale... Elevators? I wish.  I used to have valet trash in my old apartment. 25$ a month. 

So this kid is doing alright.  I have it now. It's mandatory and it sucks. We had it at one of our places too. It was awful. People would leave some disgusting things sitting in front of their doorway for days.  If there was a valet service, why would it be there for days?
 Ours was set up for twice weekly. So it was only picked up on certain days. It wasn't very on demand like valet would imply.  oh, that's horrible and not convenient at all. WTF is the sense in that? Oh you ate steak on Friday? I guess you'll be smelling rotting meat scraps for the next 3 days. Fucking absurd. Were people not allowed to take trash down on their own? Or would they deliberately stink up the common area as a form of protest against the mandatory valet? Ours is Sunday-Thursday. Some people miss the pick-up time (8 pm) because the douche-nozzle valet waste guy is several buildings done by 8 pm. So they just let it sit there until Sunday. 25 bucks here at my apt as well. 5 day pickup. Mandatory [Does he have a tux](http://acrossthemargin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Sunny2.jpg) and a limo while he does it?
 http://imgur.com/gallery/V6GnsOk Probably my [favorite bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4rd-mXtVMY) from that show. Catchy service title, clear and concise wording with no gimmicks.  This kid is going places. I like the graphic, too. Yeah.  It might not be the slam dunk idea that reddit seems to think but it shows the right ambition and he should see enough success to build on in future endeavors. this kid is going places. mostly to the dumpster for now, but he's going places.  There should be another bullet point that says "No questions asked".  **[I made him a nicer flyer to pass out. Can someone pass it onto him please?](http://i.imgur.com/HNZqQaR.jpg)**

I'm sure this won't be seen now that there's 800 comments, but on the offchance it is, please pass it on. I'd be happy to add his phone number too, but I've left space for him to add it himself. The flyer is Letter size and it's high resolution so all he has to do is click print. His is better for his purposes Agreed. It is more genuine.  It makes me say "I love this kid."  For some reason this turns me off. Now it seems to polished and it screams 'scam' to me.  I agree. This flyer seems like the kid knows exactly how to work the system.

The one he made is more sincere and sends the right message of "I only know how to use Word and I'm using yellow to attract you!" It was all that final misspelled "buisness." Kid knew exactly what he was doing. Last thing you read is the word processer equivalent of backwards letter on lemonade stands. You really just wanted to correct his grammar comma you nazi. There's something about this that screams advertisement, whereas the original just looks like your standard flyer.  If I saw this posted on  a wall, I just wouldn't read it.  I'm sorry, but maybe it's the sharp contrast or the huge trash can, but I just would not read this at the mailbox. I would definitely pay him to get the trash. The dumpster and trash room is absolutely nauseating. I live in a big city and trash is a problem.  If I was the apartment manager I'd double the rate if he could find somewhere else to throw the trash rather than my dumpsters that I pay per load to have hauled off. Bwaaaa haaa haaa haaaaa! Solid. Kid's developing a work ethic, learning customer management, and pretty importantly for a young person, learning his time and effort is worth money. That's a valuable lesson in and of itself. When I was around 11 my family went on vacation to Hawaii for a week. The second day there a tropical storm hit and knocked out power and flooded downtown and generally did what those things do. My brother and I grabbed some flashlights and started escorting people up and down stairs and to their rooms in the hotel or wherever for tips. Well, we'd have done it anyway just because it was such a cool adventure, but all of the old retired people adored us and showered us with money. It was awesome.  

Lesson learned: exploit the elderly and infirm during natural disasters. No one has commented on his spelling of 'buisness' yet.

Edit: damn autocorrect *has comented Muphry's law. I'm sure plenty of people saw it and didn't think it was worth commenting.  The kid is doing something laudable.  Why be the guy who points out that pepper would improve the soup? Because pepper would improve the soup. Yeah. For next time.  *haz commented *commented Meh, it ain't a spell-checking service. Who cares? Unless you expect a certain level of professionalism from your 13-year-old trash-carriers.  If someone put a dead body in a bag and paid him $1 to toss it, would he become an accomplice?  Is there something you're not telling us? Didn't they do this in Always Sunny in Philadelphia? This would be perfect for big dinners or parties.  I would just pay him a flat fee to run bags back and forth. I'm confused, are you feeding your guests garbage? My apartment complex automatically tacks on an extra $30 a month to rent for 'valet' trash pickup, and I'd still pay this kid.  I mean, it's a nice service and all, I guess.  But the fact that the trash fee is mandatory is really off-putting.  Besides, they have a number of really picky requirements; for instance, they won't let you put bottles or recyclables in with your trash, and anything recyclable needs to be *only* recyclables in these special clear bags so that they can confirm there's no 'regular' garbage mixed in there.  To say nothing of the static they gave me the *one* time I tried to get them to pick up a dismembered corpse. The worst part is that my apartment has this and my unit is not even 20 feet from the dumpster. If it was 200 feet away and I lived on the 3rd floor, I'd be more excited. That's great! I would pay him just for him to be able to show other kids what a little crewtifity and initiative can get you. I took way too long trying to figure out what crewtifity is. Duh, it's when your friends pool money together to get from tifity to treefiddy.  Who is this kid? I have a nice, but older SLR I can send him.  He's going to have to work twice as hard to afford the film for your SLR as he would if he just pirated photoshop and bought a fairly nice DSLR with his money.  There was a kid that was doing trash services in my complex here in Florida, I felt bad about the $2.00 per bag thing because I did some spring cleaning and had like 4 huge bags and a box, kid was prob 15. He was kind of stunned that I gave him 50 dollars. I felt like I should because his ad said he was saving for college, I wonder if he's actually using that money for college or molly? Florida? Probably bath salts.  I wish you guys were in my neighborhood as a kid. I had the idea to take people's cans to the street for a quarter a house when I was 10 and got absolutely no takers. Knocked on a hundred doors. As a parent, I have no idea why my mom thought this was an okay idea.  &gt; As a parent, I have no idea why my mom thought this was an okay idea.

Because it is, for all intents and purposes, completely safe for a kid to be out and about on their own if they've had some very basic instructions (and it's safer now than ever before).  It's the national news systems that have to come up with things to scare us that give us reason to feel unsafe. True that. It's crazy how what seemed completely normal to me (and my mom) as a kid now seems so foreign. Like I never see little kids riding their bikes around by themselves anymore. It's a damn shame. I need to shake myself of this and let my damn kids be kids. They're young so I guess I have some time.  decades of fear mongering by the media There's a kid like this in my complex. Good idea poor execution. Always bothering people at their door. Stands around complex if you say no I don't have trash he goes on to say, well can you give me a dollar anyway to help feed my mom. I've seen said mom, she doesn't need to be eating anymore. I feel bad for the kid though.  My brother's baby-mama has trained all her kids to be like this. I had to have a serious talk with my niece and nephew (age 9 and 7) to stop trying to trick me into giving them money. If they really want/need it, I will give them like 5-10 bucks for movies or whatever. But for the love of jesus tap dancing christ quit making up stupid stories to trick me out of pocket change! I'm not fucking having it!

TLDR Some moms are the woooooorst. Poor kid probably has to bring her X dollars every day. I am tempted to create a GoFundMe for his camera but that would kind of spoil all of his hard work. It's a valuable lesson for the kid. How awesome is it to use something you bought with hard-earned cash? If he made the GoFundMe, he could give him the money after the kid bought the camera. That way, he earned his camera, but still feels the appreciation from anonymous people who liked his crewtifity Is crewtifity a thing now? What the fuck is crewfifity? I can very clearly, remember every single thing I bought with my summer money up until I got a 'real' job.  I bought a new mountain bike one summer with my paper route money, Schwinn (that was still a brand back then), aqua blue, 21 speeds, shimano everything...and another summer, I bought neon Oakley's...razor blades and matching aqua socks with the money from cleaning up work sites.  Let the kid work for his camera!  he will love it all the more.    Nah man, just find some extra chores you can hire him for to speed up the process of earning it himself. I hate to be a shit lord but do random people seriously deserve relatively large quantities of money just for having their advertisement put on reddit?

I feel like this is some weird group mentality thing where if one person donates it catches on. All of a sudden half the world has donated and the kid learns nothing about hard work. That's about what my apartment complex forces us to pay Now he just needs to hire some other kids to take the trash down for .50 cents a bag.  He can keep .50 cents for himself without having to do anything at all.  And with more people doing it for him he's pulling in more cash.

Until they unionize and go on strike and the garbage starts piling up and people complain so he has to hire some bigger kids to come in and beat the striking kids with pipes until they get back to work. Government shuts him down...*sorry son, you don't have the proper permits* I think he is thinking small. There are other opportunities here. He should offer a bigger range of  services, like doing a run to the corner store for snacks, dropping off mail, washing a car (if they are allowed to there), etc.  He'd make a killing with corner store runs if he was 21 If he was 21 he would demand far more for his time and the idea would lose its attractiveness.  The only reason this really works is because he sees his time as worth very little and adults see their time as very valuable. 

When you're a kid you have a ton of free time, no access to a car, can't go to bars/movies/whatever easily.  &gt; When you're a kid you have a ton of free time, no access to a car, can't go to bars/movies/whatever easily.

Yeah... When you're a kid... If he was 21 and living in America he'd probably demand less for his time Min wage is at least $7/hour, way more in most states.  Here in Washington it's getting up to $15.  Probably more than what most people would be willing to pay.  The only way the math works out is it you're willing to accept far less than min wage, aka probably under 16.   as a Washingtonian, I hate this misconception. The minimum wage for large companies (over 500 employees) goes to $15 an hour starting January 1st, 2017 (unless you have medical coverage, then its 2018). For companies smaller than that, it's until fucking 2021 with modest yearly increases. 

As a minimum wage employee, I for one welcome having the ability to pay rent AND eat food. What a thought! It's already going up for some employees in the city.  I live/work in the city and some people I know already have gotten pay raises just by virtue of the law being passed.   I work in advertising and our interns already are seeing pay increases.  

Also, if you think $15/hour is going to cut it in Seattle and compete with the tech industry's waves I got some bad news for you.   Would hire right now. I feel like the person to develop an app to offer to pay people to make runs to a store near them kind of like uber but for stoned college kids with the munchies would make a killing.

Is this what I should spend my summer on? i knew a guy who would take out the trash for a joint, but that wasn't a business he was just poor and neighbors with the dealer. If you said that on shark tank Cuban wouldn't like it.  He has a good idea. Don't ruin it by throwing on a bunch of other half asses things.  If he is the best garbage boy the other jobs will come naturally.  That could be. Though I'd be afraid that he will miss out on other opportunities. Unloading groceries from cars.   I hate that as much as taking out the trash.    That's a good one! He can just offer any basic assistance for a dollar, keep his options open.  He should also hit up old folks' homes.  They always need chores done, young people remind them of their beloved grandchildren that never visit, and they often have cash.    hell, muff dive the lonely widows while he's at it can confirm, always in need of last minute snacks after some sleep aid activities. Why doesn't he just pimp out his 19 year old sister too?  A true entrepreneur.  I pay a homeless guy in my neighborhood a few bucks a week to take my trash cans to the curb. It's an awesome service.  Whats the charge for bodies?? Where's his EIN? Wow.. I cannot find any kids in my hood that will do anything for money.. snow, grass.. no matter the season I got lots. The neighbour kid is always too busy on the ps box to earn $$.  &gt; I cannot find any kids in my hood that will do anything for money

phrasing! So are we not doing phrasing anymore?  -Aristotle It's fairly obvious he's actually a spy, seeing as we all know how much one can learn about people by looking through their trash... Nice try NSA I pay $25 a month at my apartments for this exact feature. I wish it was going to a school kid aspiring their dreams. But as long as someone takes my trash to the dumpster for me, I'm happy.  I live in a fraternity house with 42 other guys... We would love this kid! Shouldn't you have like 10+ of these kids a semester? I've heard of some nasty shit in frat houses. He'd definitely need to implement a frat surcharge. There's a kid in our apartment complex who's about 10 years old that does the exact same thing, every Wednesday he walks door to door taking trash for $1. I always give him more though.  Nice. I would tip this kid and extra $1 a bag if i knew there was something particularly stinky in there (fish leftovers, dirty diapers, rotting flesh, etc.) I like how he added a misspelling right at the end of his little paragraph about following his dreams to make him seem cutesy and even more child-like to get those moms in the building to find it adorable and therefore more likely to use his services. 

This kid knows how to advertise.  It took me forever to notice it because even I, an adult, still misspell that word. I work for a private trash company that does this exact service on a grand scale. It's seriously a good idea, go kid. I thought apartment buildings had chutes on each floor?  The last two condos I've lived in sure does. There's communities that do this by default, it allows them to install compactors instead of standard trashbins without someone managing to maim themselves when taking the trash out.

Edit: This isn't my video. I just found it. So you guys can stop saying I'm vacuuming, getting a BJ, or need to GTFO. I'm in norcal. ^(send water though) You know it's bad when the lightning's on fire. [deleted] So they had "Volcanic Lightning" and "Dirty Thunderstorm" to choose from. I do not understand how the latter won. Dirty thunderstorm sounds like a euphemism for extreme diarreha. It's sexy. Aww yeah, baby. Hold still, I'ma give you a dirty thunderstorm. ;) See, I had no idea volcanoes caused lightning (although, in hindsight, the physics behind it are obvious), so if, for some bizarre reason, I were in Chile right now I would be freaking the fuck out.  That stack of ash is basically the largest battery on earth right now.  closer to the worlds most powerful Van de Graaff generator. If I were an ancient Roman and saw that shit I would never not believe in gods. This is something that at one time could have been a life changing event for entire civilizations.  And nowadays I watch a video of this on my phone while I'm in the bathroom, acknowledge that it's kinda cool, and go back to browsing video game news.

Edit: Thanks for the gold! I, too, am pooping. \*nod* Confirmed. I am pooping and will continue off to work not thinking about this again. Pooper here. Can confirm watching volcanic eruption while pooping will have no lasting effects. Also pooping. An another one here. .... Aaaaaaannnnddddd another.  Poop brothers had chilli last night. watching this video whilst sitting on the toilet with my hole pulling off a remarkable reenactment of the aforementioned video. Was thinking the same thing, this is how volcano god beliefs are born. And just around the corner from "Hey, we should throw virgins in there to make it stop." "Did it work?"

"Not really"

"Let's try chopping random peoples heads off"

..........

"Did it work?" "Nobody ever realizes I just want a hug."

I am a robit.
 That just made me so uncomfortable. Needs a NSFL tag. My only friend, The End. Of our elaborate plans, the end. Dirty Thunderstorm sounds like a drink you regret the next morning Or a sexual act that you similarly regret the next morning...  D: One may precede the other (   ) this explains DBZ  Holy fuckin whoa.  The day shots of the tower of smoke were impressive. This is fucking terrifying! I completely agree. I could never live near a volcano.  You should google Yellowstone super volcano. [Oh Boy! Someone's about to learn something cool](https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/135/what.png) You know this super volcano has gotten significantly less terrifying over the years. I remember reading about it nearly a decade ago where it suggested an eruption (always imminent) would basically put the world into darkness for 2 years. 

But now scientists say "yeh the world would get colder for a couple years, (which happened not that long ago from another volcano) agriculture in america would be badly affected, and some other small things, but it is showing no signs of erupting any time in the next 1 million years." When geologists say "imminent", or "due" they are speaking in earth terms, not human terms. In the scale of the age of the earth, a few hundred thousand years is very soon. To us, it's forever.  I'm amused at the diversity of xkcd comics. There's one suitable for every situation!  I don't think *anything* could live near *that* volcano. Tardigrades be like na bruh I'm gud Best photos so far: http://data.sa-rl.at/files/calbuco/ Imgur backup: http://imgur.com/3SrWsNP,mUpig7i,UO5ReUe,u2PNXLY,zAKoHh5,L4KfDKD,hnS7e3w,GbmRMpo,1My5IYF,eqAOfE4#0 Jesus, #3 and especially #6. just to put it into perspective #3 and #6 were taken with long exposures (just look at the star trails to the side).  that lightning's happening, but not all at the same time.

EDIT: One could see the dust clouds ! I just used my phone to watch a live broadcast from space while laying on the couch in my basement. Truly fascinating. That last one is ridiculous.  So... I guess no one is going to ask it:

Are people in danger from this thing right now?? Heard of no casualties yet. The area next to the volcano only had one small town, which was evacuated in good time thanks to the ash plume the volcano was gracious enough to give off as warning yesterday. The main hazard is to agriculture due to the falling ash. And I guess the volcano itself would be dangerous if you were dumb enough to get close to it right now. Falling ash is actually extremely fertile. It'll probably just kill the current crop due to lack of sunlight.  That's a problem in many areas. If winds blow east, patagonian sheepherders are fucked.  Probably.  You're all about the hard facts. I like it.  I have my towel ready.  So long and thanks for all the fish.

-      This is the coolest thing I've seen on reddit all day. Now if I could just find someone to lie in-front of this bulldozer.... It must be Thursday...  I never could get the hang of Thursdays. Guess it's time to go to the pub. Do they have paper bags? Don't panic Don't forget, 5 pints of bitter and peanuts.

 If this was 3000 years ago everyone would be thinking the shit hit the fan Flash forward 3000 years, everyone is still thinking shit hit the fan. but do they have fan 3000 years ago? Manual Fans, so it's manual shit wafting If this eruption is sending particles up high enough, this could effect the weather the world over for a few years. So shit could really be hitting the fan.  http://i.imgur.com/6NfmQ.jpg Cool a painting of Mark Zuckerberg pointing at a fire I remember encountering this painting by surprise in a Russian museum.

On topic, volcanoes are scary. Chile's all like "Earth Day". [deleted] Middle Earth Day** Oh lawd Jesus it's a fayre. It smelled like somebody was bar-b-que-in'  GET DA WATER NIGGA MUDDAFUCKIN' BOOTLEG FIREWORKS [deleted] AW LAWD REEKUS!! REEKUS! &gt; REEKRIS

Bootleg ass volcano  AWW LORD REEKRIS GIT DA WAHTAH NIQQUH!!! Well Chile, nice knowin' ya.  Meh, not our first eruption nor our last. Right now we have around 90 "active" volcanos. Heck, our entire country is part of the Volcanic ring of the Pacific. It's whats supposed to happen, same with earthquakes and because of the huge coastline, tsunamis and whatever else also happen with quakes. I mean, how else is Chile supposed to expand its landmass? It's too damn skinny! Like this if you support countries with curves! Top gear will forever love you! Dammit Satan, close the door behind you! Thor! Put down the hammer and let's talk this over.

Don't forget to [duck and cover!](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4314/1826/1600/DCSP.jpg) I have no idea what's going on, but I'm nearly positve you're going to need Superman. Tell Avatar Roku to stay away I saw a video of this earlier today and there was lightning amongst the clouds of smoke billowing from the volcano.

Honest question - what causes that? Basically, lightning is static electricity right? Imagine shooting all those ash particles into the air is like dragging your feet across the carpet.  Heathens TIL for CG (cloud to ground) lightning the step leader, or stepped leaders (a large negative charge made from particles in the clouds/etc) seek out the streamers (a positive charge made from particles coming from the ground).  The streamers are actually induced by the negative charge coming from the clouds.  Then when they find each other, a lightning bolt actually strikes from the ground up.  Look at the slowed down gif on the first link.  Such a cool phenomenon!  Used to think of it more like arcing between positive and negative charged conductors, but this explanation makes it seem like more of a 2 part process.

Dragon? Nonsense! There hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years Is this the same volcano, which I just saw a few hours ago from a nice, calm town with blue skies and everything, which has now turned into the Ninth Gate of Hell?

HAPPY MOTHER FUCKING EARTH DAY!!!

-Earth She vomits on us in celebration... reminds me of prom.  Earth is pissed that we didn't celebrate her special day The kind of sight that would make a man truly believe there are gods.
edit;yeah science, obviously, i was indeed referring to ancient times. The kind of sight that would make me truly nope the fuck out.

 What would you do in a time when the phrase "nope the fuck out" wasn't even invented? You'd be clueless. You'd build huge tributes to the Gods. He'd probably yep the shit in. Some people got 'yep'd the shit in' to volcanoes after an eruption to appease what people thought were angry gods The *concept* of 'nope the fuck out' has been around longer than our species. I'm sure they had similar phrases for "nope the fuck out" back then. I say we build huge tributes to 'nope the fuck out'.  They can just be giant stone pedestals with nothing on them but a plaque that says 'Nope.' or 'Fuck this, I'm out'.    I'd invent the first dank meme Not me, I'd get as close as I could.  Without dying of course. http://i.imgur.com/seh6p.gif Or the devil. Or, you know, believe there are volcanoes. "Yep. That's a volcano" "You sure?"

"Like, 98% sure, yeah." You can tell it's a volcano cuz the way that it is! Huh.  I guess I had to see it to believe it. Made me think of this...

"Confirmed...that is a volcano..."  I dont believe you. I see no plausible proof Volcanoes can't melt steel beams! ^^^actually ^^^they ^^^can Nah everyone know volcanoes are a hoax like dinosaurs and "I can't believe it's not butter!" The other day a radio presenter (Adrian Durham, Talksport UK) actually said (and said repeatedly) that he "didn't believe in dinosaurs".   I don't believe in dinosaurs either. They always let you down. He was trying to be poetic. And it worked. Dat karma doe. Damn corny bro.
 I'm glad we have you around to contribute to the conversation.  What would be the reasoning here ? There's a volcano hence there are gods ? That's essentially what ancient civilizations thought. Without knowing the science behind volcanoes or anything other than "that big hill over there is making very loud noises and expelling copious amounts of really hot red stuff and making the sky light up", I'd be scared shitless. Without knowing that stuff, what would you think? It's easy to apply rational thought now to this stuff since we've researched the shit out of them, but gods in ancient times were a way to explain things they couldn't explain. We aren't getting any rain? We pissed off the gods. Big hill with hot stuff blowing up? Must not have given this god the right sacrifice.  So, you're saying that /u/AggregateTurtle is a member of an ancient civilization? Otherwise, you're not answering /u/can-opener's question. I'm saying that kind of thinking is what led to gods being created. He asked what the reasoning was for thinking the sight of a volcano eruption meant there were gods. In ancient times they would have thought "god's work". Today we apply rational thought and years of research and say "volcano".

Edit: grammar Many hundreds of years ago perhaps A dumb man, yes. Gods that react the same way we do to spiders. "ZEUS IS ANGRY"

&gt;"Who's Zeus?"

"The God who is causing this shitstorm"

&gt;"Is he the god of everything? Or just lightning"

"I think lightning"

&gt;"Why is the other god so angry. Why can't he chill?"

"Who"

&gt;"Dude angrily spewing rock and hot magma everywhere"

"Bad day?"

&gt;"Must've burnt his toast for breakfast"

"Heh"

&gt;"How do we stop this though?"

"Send him a generic apology letter for whatever he thinks we did"

&gt;"He'll burn the letter"

"Heh. You're on fire"

&gt;"That comment deserves thunderous applause"

"We should stop"

&gt;"Yes"

"So what do you suggest we do?"

&gt;"We fight crazy with crazy. We dance"

"What"

&gt;"Do you have a better idea?"

"I hate that argument"

&gt;"DO IT"

&amp;nbsp;

6 hours later

&amp;nbsp;

"I dont think this is working"

&gt;"Maybe you're dancing the wrong way"

"Assuming there is a right way"

&gt;"Well you can't stop now"

"I do not think I possess the energy to keep going on indefinitely at this ra.."

&gt;"STOP"

"Decide what you want me to do for cr.."

&gt;"HOLD THAT POSE. By Jove, it's stopped now"

"It has?"

&gt;"Yes. Hold that pose. I think he likes that pose"

"He cannot like a POSE"

&gt;"Apparently he can"

"That's ridiculous. What sort of a weirdly indulgent god is this" 

&gt;"There have been weirder fetishes, to be fair"

"Well whatever it is, I am hungry from all that skipping around. I need food fast, or you'll have worse problems than angry Lava dude on your hand"

&gt;"Why don't I hold the same pose as you till you go get some food"

AHA

&amp;nbsp;

A few minutes later

&amp;nbsp;

"We both look like idiots"

&gt;"Better an idiot alive than a sage dead"

"I'm not so sure now"

&gt;"Just go get some food"

"Someone needs to upload this"

*click*

&gt;"YOU ARE TOAST IF YOU DO THAT"

Ahh, toast; wonderful idea

&gt;I WILL BURN YOU TO THE GROUND

half side burnt. Delightful That's it.  For now on, we're throwing fuckers in there.  That'll stop it. God is a construct we use to explain what we can't understand. I truly believe we will never understand everything, and that is why God (or whatever you call it) is eternal. We cannot prove or disprove its existence because there are always things we will not understand about the universe.  Do you believe in many things that we can neither prove or disprove, like invisible unicorns, garden fairies, teapots orbiting the sun between Mars and Jupiter? Isn't it far more rational to suspend belief in something until it has actually been demonstrated to exist? Well if we get really technical we can't prove or disprove that anything really exists, but that's besides the point. Invisible unicorns, garden fairies, and teapot asteroids (never heard that before good one lol) aren't constructs we use for a purpose to explain the inexplicable; they are just fantasy. In other words they have no purpose other than to please our imaginations. An omnipotent entity on the other hand does serve a more significant purpose even if it is just a construct of imagination. I think this greater significance is evident from the emphasis society as a whole puts on religion.  &gt; Well if we get really technical we can't prove or disprove that anything really exists...

True, but let's not drag philosophy into this. For all practical purposes, we can (and should) assume that everything we can detect with our senses is real (yes, I'm ignoring cases where those senses malfunction).

&gt; Invisible unicorns, garden fairies, and teapot asteroids (never heard that before good one lol) aren't constructs we use for a purpose to explain the inexplicable.

Yes, they're trivial examples and they have no explanatory power, but what if we imbue them with supernatural properties and construct creation stories around them? Let's also write a book about them and teach children that the cosmic teapot is real and it loves us. Of course, there's no evidence for it (the book is not evidence), and it's undetectable by our senses (even through the most powerful telescopes), so they just need to accept this all on faith. Now, how does all that make the teapot any more real, or any more useful as an explanation for anything?  
My problem is not that people like to use this term 'god' as a place-holder for the inexplicable or the unsolved mysteries of the universe - that's a harmless and ultimately useless definition. My problem is that people then take this thing that represents the unknowable and tack-on a whole load of bullshit that they can't possibly justify; they claim to know what their god wants. If their god is unknowable, then how do they know these things?

&gt; In other words they have no purpose other than to please our imaginations.

How is that any different to the stories of the Bible or Quran, for example? Aren't they just books written to please the imaginations of our ancestors?

&gt; An omnipotent entity on the other hand does serve a more significant purpose even if it is just a construct of imagination.

How? Ok, the cosmic teapot is omnipotent. Now what?

&gt; I think this greater significance is evident from the emphasis society as a whole puts on religion.

Following a religion and believing in a deity are two entirely different things. Unfortunately, most people are unable to separate the beneficial aspects of religion (chiefly, being part of a social group) from the potential harm caused by believing supernatural nonsense. Well said, le enlightened gentle sir. Another victory for le science! I tip to thee! If you have a problem with my comment, then why not say so instead of acting like an obnoxious turd?

 In the past, sure. And just in time. I was starting to think volcanos were mythical.  ahhh, science Don't mind the rustled neckbeards Specially if they are ignorant fools that flunked geology. The only one ignorant in here is you How? There are not Gods. [Citation needed] That's okay to believe but let other people think what they think They don't seem to want to let me believe what I want to. It doesn't get to work only one way. No. I'm not obligated to let people believe in fiction.  No, you're not obligated, you're just a douche. What others choose to believe doesn't affect you, so leave them alone. If you think religion only affects the religious then you're deluded.  It doesn't affect anyone, whether someone believes in a god or not doesn't make any difference. Religion does affect everyone. In the perfect world it wouldn't and it would be purely a personal thing but in our world it does. Gay laws, abortion laws, all kinds of hatred and violence, wars, you name it. Religion specifically causes these. It's irrelevant for us if these feelings would exist without religion as that is not our reality (just covering my bases for the usual response).

Btw, as an atheist I upvoted everyone in this comment tree expect your last comment and "The only one ignorant in here is you" by a_highwayman. Onionman69 had a good point. Him getting smashed with downvotes just shows how sensitive religious people are about their world view and science. Tell that to the peiple who've had their heads cut off recently. Oh, wait... It does when they start making laws based on stuff from dungeons &amp; dragons. And the laws are being changed. You're naive to think that it's as simple as 'religion is bad' whether through religion or not, people hold views which end up being undesirable. There are atheists who don't support gay marriage and Christians who do, it's not as simple as 'remove religion and everything will be fine' because the world isn't just atheists vs theists where both sides hold the exact same views among all members. Religion at its is just a set of fundamental beliefs and philosophies, a differing religious view is no different to a differing opinion. No one "lets" anyone believe anything.  They believe what they will, just like you. Yes you are. It's called freedom of thought and speech You're not able to stop it. 

"Let"...haha. So edgy Meh, I don't think it's edgy to have no tolerance for people demanding that you believe in their imaginary friend.  It's called the tolerance paradox. Tolerant people  have no tolerance for intolerance 
 /r/atheism is that way - - - &gt; I don't like it there. Is there a subreddit for facts/science/logic/common sense? Man, my fedorometer levels haven't had readings this high since the great prophet, aalewis foretold of euphoria two years ago.

Yep, stupid. Jimmy status: Rustled Only further proving it. http://i.imgur.com/YwgbT16.gif [deleted] Now you're using memes too

We are now full circle What the fuck are you talking about? I haven't used any meme. I always say the same thing when I see pictures of the great pyramid.

"Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb over a 10 to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Initially at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years." **Everything changed when the fire nation attacked** [Dagestan Airlines Flight 372](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan_Airlines_Flight_372)  

&gt;The plane was flying a scheduled trip from Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow to Uytash Airport in Makhachkala, Republic of Dagestan.[5] Two of the aircraft's three engines failed shortly after it took off from Vnukovo Airport at 14:07 local time (11:07 UTC); the pilots reported the loss of engines when the aircraft was at a height of around 9,100 metres (29,900 ft).[1] An emergency landing at Domodedovo International Airport was requested, and as the aircraft was in the process of landing, the third engine failed.[1][5] The aircraft approached runway 32R from the right at almost right angles, overflying the threshold before turning right at 500 metres (1,600 ft) to the left of the runway and crossing over the runway, flying parallel with but to the right of the runway.[6] The aircraft touched down 88 metres (289 ft) to the right of the runway centerline, and only 350 metres (1,150 ft) short of the end, about a half hour after its departure, landing in conditions of freezing rain.[1][6]  

&gt;The landing caused the plane to sustain major damage,[7] and it was written off shortly after the incident.[8] A passenger on board the plane said that the aircraft broke into three parts after landing.[9] Later reports said that both the cockpit and vertical stabilizer had separated from the aircraft, and that the wings and undercarriage had both been damaged.[3]

(TLDR: Flight engineer turned off fuel pump before takeoff and all three engines shut down due to "fuel starvation") Thank you! It took far too long to find this.  That being said, I'm more curious as to *why* it's still just sitting there.  Shouldn't they clean it up or something? The trial of the pilot just finished this January. They are probably waiting for the legal proceedings and/or investigation to end. Why would the pilot be on trial if a mechanic screwed up?

Edit:  several very informed redditors have corrected me.  The engineer is not a mechanic or a guy designing the airplane, but instead a pilot role.  Apologies for my ignorance. never flown a plane but one would think a quick check on fuel status before takeoff would be in order. Similar although to a lesser degree it's illegal to run out of gas on the highway. Why would the fuel level show low/empty if the fuel pump in the plane was shut off? Pretty sure on a plane there's a checklist to go through that is more complicated than "great, gas gauge doesn't say we're on E" Exactly. There are an insane amount of checklists to go through. 

You've got one before you get in the cockpit. 

You've got one before you even start the plane. 

You've got one when you start the plane. 

You've got one while you're sitting on the ramp. 

You've got one right before you're cleared for take off. 

You've got one while you're enroute. 

You've got one when you start your descent.

 You've got one when you're on approach. 

You've got one after you land. 

You've got one when you get back to the ramp and begin shut down. 

And finally you've got one after you get out of the plane and everything is anchored down. You forgot the checklist for emergencies, especially the one  you use in case of single or multiple engine shutdown. I am willing to bet there is something there about check fuel pump is on. At least there  was one for the single engine plane I flew in... Yep. You're right. The acronym we used was ALARMS.

A- Altitude and Airspeed

L- Landing spot. Try to find an area that's clear of trees and buildings to land.

A- Attempt restart of engine.

R- Set radios to emergency frequency.

M- Mayday mayday mayday.

S- Secure aircraft by propping open doors so in the event of a less than soft landing, you're not trapped inside the cockpit if the doors jam. remember this is russia. the checklist goes like this:

airplane. check. 

were good for take off comrade Comrade?

Shit. We not check for comrade.

 Kick the tires a bit...we're good! Rolls down plane window *licks finger, sticks out window*... My legs hurt just reading that. E means Enough. "Wings attached, we're good for takeoff boys" There are checklists for things, and if you're having a fuel problem you would look at your fuel count and your pumps. And then you would click those pumps together and say "there's no place like home."  It wouldn't but that being said I would assume there would be some kind of indicator telling if the fuel pump was functioning or not A flight engineer isn't a mechanic. They're a crew position in the cockpit. In the past before heavy computer automations most planes had an additional crew member that was called a flight engineer, or FE. The FEs job was to monitor all systems in flight, to open and close fuel lines for proper balancing of fuel, consult books in the event of an inflight emergency, etc. I haven't read more than the snippet above about this particular incident but it sounds like they were cycling fuel out of all the tanks manually and he just didn't open the proper fuel lines. Its a pretty rookie mistake which obviously snowballs into a much larger problem. Most planes today do not have FE positions, not necessarily because of this sort of incident, but because of computers with failsafes and warnings, its just not worth the cost anymore either.

In civilian aviation the FE is usually a junior pilot, its used as a stepping stone to the pilot positions. I come from a military background where an FE is a career FE who most often will not be a pilot, they tend to be rather crusty guys but the old guys really know their stuff and do a lot for the pilots / plane.

Source: I was an FE in the Air Force and my father is a commercial pilot who was an FE on 727s Almost all plane crashes involve multiple errors.  (The systems are designed with deliberate redundancy, so that a single error, even a big one, should still be recoverable from.)  In this case, as far as I can tell, the fuel pump was the main error, but the pilot and crew should have been able to deal with the loss of power better than they did. Yeah there's no reason for this to happen when you practice power off situation from like day 3 Mechanic?  Surely you jest, this was a flight crew error.  This stick actuator failed at his job not the maintenance crew. Found the aviation mechanic  "stick actuator."

lol. Some good responses to this question already, but I also think it's notable who died in the crash.  There were only two fatalities out of 168 people on board, but (from the Wikipedia page):

&gt;One of the two dead was Gadzhimurad Magomedov, the brother of Magomedsalam Magomedov, the president of Dagestan.  The other (died of a heart attack) was mother of a judge of the Constitutional Court of Russia.

So the pilot, an employee of Dagestan Airlines, killed the brother of the president of Dagestan and the mother of a judge on one of the country's highest courts.  I believe that in Russia that spells Gulag. It's like when you kill a bug, and leave the carcass there, as a warning to the others. Re-commence Russia jokes here: "Welcome to Moscow. We're suprised you made it!" In Soviet Russia plane doesn't fly.......
I know, not very good Joke 
But you are in Soviet Russia so Joke's on you. in Soviet Russia random Words Are capitalized. I thought they were anti-Capitalists? &gt; in soviet russia random words are socialized.

 &gt; in soviet russia ALL words are socialized.

FTFY In Soviet Russia, joke laughs at you. *sigh* I did it to myself. In soviet Russia, joke tells you As a deterrent for other planes. haven't you been reading the other comments? Couldn't find big enough dust pan The report says it happened in December 2010. That is more than enough time to do something about it This is also quite relevant:

&gt; [...] The report said that the crew had not used all available options to deal with the loss of engine power, and had not followed procedures for landing with two nonfunctional engines.[6] The report also noted that the crew had not been sufficiently trained to deal with the situation.[6]
&gt; 
&gt; On 22 January 2015, the airplane's pilot Zakarzha Zakarzhayev was found guilty in court under article 263.3 of the Criminal Code of Russia (violating safety rules of transportation and air travel, which led by neglect to death of two or more people). The sentencing is pending.[20]

TL;DR not only had the fuel pump been turned off by accident, they fucked up the emergency landing procedure and the pilot was found guilty of violating safety rules.

Also, in case anyone was wondering, there were 160 on board, and 2 deaths.
 &gt;  Also, in case anyone was wondering, there were 160 on board, and 2 deaths.

The passage you quoted says "which led by neglect to death of two or more people", which is troubling. Like a threat. He's thinking, damn, if just one of those two survived, id be drinking vodka at the dacha right now. &gt;Zakarzha Zakarzhayev.  
Is that like the Russian version of a name like Peter Peterson? Dagestanian. Russian would be Pyotr Petrov.  Thank you for providing some actual information and not just Russia jokes. But as it happens, a bear on a unicycle was piloting the plane And we're back! da It would be cool if, for posts like this, somebody would post just the words "serious information" and somebody would post just the word "jokes." We could all upvote the shit out of those two posts and then people could put serious information under "serious" and all of their try-hard (and a few genuinely funny) jokes under "jokes." You're...you're trying to organize Reddit, aren't you? When he's done with that I have a herd of cats that need wranglin'! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk7yqlTMvp8 Yes but that was 5 YEARS ago. No cleanup? Crazy. The airline that operated the aircraft doesn't exist for ~4 yeras. The owners of the aircraft don't want to clean the crash site and keep suing to compensate incurred losses.
 The emergency landing resulted in 92 injuries (of which 39 were serious) and two fatalities. One of the fatalities was a heart attack. 


I mean that plane was either built out of some crazy safety features or that information is wrong. The cabin split into at least 3 separate pieces That's a TU-154M

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-154

With a cruising speed of 975 kilometres per hour (606 mph), the Tu-154 is one of the fastest civilian aircraft in use and has a range of 5,280 kilometres (3,280 mi). Capable of operating from unpaved and gravel airfields with only basic facilities, it was widely used in the extreme Arctic conditions of Russia's northern/eastern regions where other airliners were unable to operate. Originally designed for a 45,000 hr service life (18,000 cycles) but capable of 80,000 hrs with upgrades, it is expected to continue in service until 2016, although noise regulations have restricted flights to western Europe and other regions. In January 2010, Russian flag carrier Aeroflot announced the retirement of its Tu-154 fleet after 40 years, with the last scheduled flight being Aeroflot Flight 736 from Ekaterinburg to Moscow on 31 December 2009.[2] Airplanes are actually pretty fucking safe. Most of the time, fatalities are caused by the fire, not the crash (although the crash has a tendency to incapacitate people from trying to escape the fire). Looks like 2 crew members died  Two passengers. One from heart attack. One from a heart attack. Talk about ironic...you survive something that has such a slim chance of happening, only to die from one of the most common causes of death.  In the Spanish American war, the naval battles were so one sided that while the Spanish fleet was decimated, the US fleet had only one casualty - a heart attack Oh, so this happened recently and they just haven't gotten around to cleaning it up. That's understandable.

&gt;December 4, 2010

Oh, well, I mean, I'm sure it's on their list of things to do.. eventually.. at some point.. in the future.. sometime.. If you turned off the fuel pump before take off how did the engines even survive liftoff? I thought these things burned through fuel like nothing else The engines can draw fuel on their own near sea level, at 30000 feet there isn't enough atmospheric pressure to keep a positive flow of fuel from the tanks. I could be wrong though, helicopters are my thing not fixed wing.  Makes sense thanks How the fuck could the plane mess up so badly in so little time Fuel pump was turned off.  And then the front fell off. There is actually a recall on that model right now. For those who don't understand the reference: https://youtu.be/3m5qxZm_JqM Well, the front shouldn't fall off, for one thing! One would think they would have towed the remains of the plane beyond the environment by now. I'm not concerned, I'm sure there is a dash cam video out there which offers up a perfectly reasonable explanation why it's there.  Probably cut off another plane. The pilot tried to avoid a pedestrian going for an insurance scam.  The plane didn't have a dash cam? We can't prove that until we see the dashcam footage. Plane doesn't have a dashboard, it has a cockpit. Let's go over to the cockcam

Oh god *Technically* its still considered a dashboard in an aircraft...but carry on.  I was baffled when I heard there's actually insurance in Russia. Totally believable . The pilot clearly tried to take off from a sidewalk and those "Stop a Douchebags" guys got to him before lift-off. Not a dash cam video, but here's the footage from nearby security cameras.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epgeD7HDLnU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epgeD7HDLnU) I would call that a crash seeing the picture, but in Russia, is only "extreme landing". Not even that, the russian Wikipedia classifies it as a "rough landing". "Slight inconvenience" /r/ANormalDayInRussia  #BLYAT OK, J to the R-O-C *SUKAA* CHEEKI BREEKI Terminal couldn't decide who was supposed to land first, this plane's pilot opened the door to threaten the other plane's pilot with a baseball bat and crashed. 166 people survived this crash, only Russians could survive a crash like this. Is not crashed. Is only resting. Is warning, to other planes.

Land safely. _On your right you can see what happens when you don't turn off your electronics during takeoffs and landings; plane lands you!_ thank you for the yakov smirnoff twist, that made my day The way the wings are positioned, it looks like it didn't make it far off the runway when taking off. That's what happens when you steal a plane, instant 4-star. It's pretty hard to get it out of the airport at that point. Yea because the cops go all allahu Akbar on you and ram your plane with their fucking cars 'On vacation' Da. *plane crashes*

NOTHING. http://i.imgur.com/ypAvYH2.gif &gt;Two of the aircraft's three engines failed shortly after it took off from Vnukovo Airport 

wow, I did not know they still made planes with 3 engines. But surely one engine should be enough for landing, right?

&gt; An emergency landing at Domodedovo International Airport was requested, and as the aircraft was in the process of landing, the third engine failed

ok. how the fuck do 3 engines fail at the same time?!?

&gt;Several hours after the incident occurred, the lead prosecutor in the investigation said that the preliminary results suggested a bird strike was responsible for the loss of engines.

big flock. can happen. but wait

&gt;On 26 September 2011, the MAK released its report into the incident, concluding that the cause was the flight engineer accidentally shutting off a fuel pump while transferring fuel.

ok. That makes sad sense.

 The only trijets still in production are the Dassault Falcon 900 and F7X.  Other trijets no longer in production are still in use though.  Trijets have mostly been phased out in favor of ETOPS certified aircraft. I still can't think of a reason why they wouldn't remove the wreckage. It's a metaphor for Russia's economic stagnation and backwards political ideology.

At least, that's what my high school English teacher would've said. Just a subtle reminder to never tempt Russia by filling up a jet with your entire pro-western government and fly it into its airspace.   This is what happens when people don't shut down their electronics for takeoff and landing.  Lookin at you OP.. If I'm not mistaken though, you can still use them as long as they are in airplane mode or not connected to any type of cell service or WiFi.  You can still use them if they're connected, it's just overprotective safety measures. Tell that to the passengers  in OP's picture. Ok! I'll go get my shovel. Some airlines will ask you to put them away regardless.  Does GPS count? Last week when I flew, I had airplane mode turned on. However, I wanted to see where I was by using the lakes as reference when looking at Google Maps (using cached maps). I later realized the GPS was still turned on and I could see that blue dot "You are here" and in what direction I was going towards. It ruined my "game", but I was surprised the GPS was still turned on despite the fact that I had airplane mode on. GPS chipsets only receive signals. They dont send anything. Pppsssckt "Is captain speaking to you. Many congratulations on not shot down by missile of filthy capitalists on final approach to most fabulous aeroport. The barmaid will be offerink free to suckle on the great vodka titties. Thanks you for surviving Moscow Air. Enjoy your stay in most best empire in universe!" Vodka titties?! That's like 2 of my 2 favourite things! So... All of your favorite things? You started out like good ole' mother Russia but you ended up as some weirdo eastern european splinter state. Most fabulous? Are we talking NK here? Is no fabulous in Russia! Only manly men and girly girls! Instead of all of these lame ass jokes and attempts to be witty, can anyone explain this? In most cases when a crash happens, its the responsibility of the airline company to remove the bits of the plane that aren't being used by the Accident Investigation team. Obviously the fire brigade and local authorities can move it if it poses a danger to other people and property but its still not their responsibility to move the plane or sell it off for scrap. 

Most major airline companies do this anyway because they like to be able to cannablise the plane for useable parts on other aircraft and also conduct their own investigations. You'd be quite surprised just how many parts from crashed planes work their way back into other aircraft. 

The problem here is that Dagestan Airlines aren't exactly a major airline and probably couldn't afford to haul the plane parts back to Uytash Airport in Dagestan. Soon after the crash, the airline went bust and so there is nobody left to take ownership of it. Therefore it just sits there rusting in a field.  Thank you for an actual explanation. Being Russian and have dealt with how companies/government works, there is a good chance they just never decided on who will pay to move the wreckage.

Not saying that's the actual reason, but there is a good chance. [It's this plane.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11920432) Someone probably had their electronics on after the flight attendant told them to turn it off.  I mean the scrap aluminum is worth something, you would think scrapers would have gotten it by now This aircraft is actually an example of a man-made dry land reef, providing shelter for many animal communities and an important component of the local ecosystem.  "And on your left you will see infidels" Is that one of those fire practice planes? I would be surprised if the international aviation associations would just let them abandon a crash like that I don't think so. They wouldn't do fire fighting testing with that much forest around.  I think it's a Tu-154 that crashed as [Dagestan 372](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan_Airlines_Flight_372) This reminds me of the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ride that used to be in DisneyWorld. You'd see a wreck of the same ship you were in under the water. It made 6 year old me think we were also going to sink and I freaked out. Sweet sweet traumatizing memories. You see, Ivan- 


When pilot see crash plane, he land more better for fear of crash plane. [Surprisingly only 2 people died.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan_Airlines_Flight_372) I wouldnt be to worried, your landing in Moscow that plane is pointing the other way it was clearly taking off. So as long as your not leaving Moscow by plane you'll be fine According to what I found on google, this is a TU-154 plane, that has crashed near domodedovo on 4th of December 2010, basically it's engines failed and it had to land "slightly" off the runway. 
The remains are still there, because the company who owns the plane does not want to spend any money on its recovery, neither does the Russian government, or airport owners, so they just kinda left it there. For 5 years.

Edit:Disregard that, the company, who owned the plane, is actually bankrupt. Edit Edit;  Disregard that.  Yes, they did. O.J. Simpson fleeing in his white bronco? After a second look, I'll give you Second Prize Winner of the Internet Today.  Nice catch. The phrase is "train wreck" not "plane wreck" You found the malaysian flight! Congrats! 
Edit: Spelling  One time when I was flying from Vladivostok to Beijing, the Tupolev we were flying in was in shitty condition.  There was duct tape all in the cabin, mostly holding up the air/light modules above the seat.  When we landed in Beijing, the duct tape failed, the consoles fell on my friend across the isle.  A man in a reflective vest walked up and pushed the console back in to the ceiling of the plane.  Everyone clapped as we landed (presumably because we didn't die).

I'm never flying Vladivostok Air, S7 Air, Aeroflot, or any other Russian airline again.  Also, AirChina was fucking terrible.   Friend travelled to Russia from the UK as a kid in the 70s (his father wanted to 'innoculate' him aganist Communism, or something lol)

Travelling back home, he told me there was a 'hump' in the middle of the aisle you had to step over, the plane's pressure went weird at some point and all the passengers got nosebleeds, the whole thing rattled like it was gonna fall apart.

Similarly, everyone cheered on landing and he said he felt like kissing the tarmac lol Glad you lived.

I have a pretty strong fear of flying (and I know it's irrational) but I'm even more terrified of flying on anything that's not a Boeing (again, irrationally) but there's *no fucking way* I'd fly on a Soviet/Russian built jet. 
 These old Russian designs are slowly being phased out, I know Aeroflot with the exception of a few very new aircraft is a wholly western fleet sames goes for S7 now. 

I think the only airlines where you will still find these old hulks flying mainline would be North Korea and possibly Cuba (although since Cuba is normalizing relations with the US I would imagine Cubana will announce a Boeing or Airbus order soon)  The plane criticized Putin  **Checks username*\*

Right you are, sir! How dare someone criticize such a noble leader! Vlad and Vladimir are two different names. But that's were the differences between them end, cept if a vampire was based Puti-pute it'd sleep in the closet instead of a coffin You do not get it, son. Is not runway... Is operating table.

OR MAYBE YOU NOT DO THIS. PROBABLY IS BECAUSE YOU NEVER DESIGN AIRPLANE  IN WHOLE LIFE. YOU LOOK AT FINE RUSSIAN PLANE THINK IT NEED CRAZY SHIT STICK ON ALL SIDES OF PLANE.

Holy shit, RIP in peace my sides. Damn!  I wasn't aware it was possible to actually read in an accent but you totally pulled that off.

Well done. Oh. My. YES. Great job with the green net, guys. You can hardly tell there's a pile of plane in the shrubs. Is hidden good enough. That's what prompts all the passengers to applaud when the plane safely lands, as though it's unusual. Was on Aeroflot when I first experienced that.  Don't they do that everywhere? All the planes I've been on had applause at landing  I've experienced it only outside of the U.S., and flying into St. Petersburg was the first place I heard it, in 1994. Actually, after a particularly vicious winter flight through the Rocky Mountains, all eight passengers spontaneously applauded, but only because it was a 'drinks all hit the ceiling' kind of flight.  All the cheap airlines with idiots aboard. Looks like I touched a nerve..... xD its Okay poppet Not really, I don't fly nearly often enough to get annoyed by this, but I still think that applause bullshit is stupid. Well at least they didn't have to work too hard to locate the black boxes for this one. It took them all day. Once they found it they passed out. Eventually it rained and they staggered back to the car. Pour Encourager les autres [possible explanation](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-130278/Plane-crash-Moscow-airport.html) No. The plane in the picture is a three engine. Your link is a four engine.  Are there any parts of Russia that don't look like screenshots of STALKER? Try downtown Moscow
 RT: "Was This Innocuous Plane Component Storage Site Planted by Ukranian Rebels?" My whole experience in Moscow was uncomfortable, so this sight doesn't surprise me. :) I imagine a man with 5 bears living in that place.  Russians only get their shit together when France or Germany invades.  When the French/Germans leave, the place goes back to a disorganized dump. Iz only fellz. Username is appropriate. Take an upboat. OMG did you fall for the cheap Aeroflot flight somewhere, only to realize that it turns your 12 hour flight into a 36 hour flight that stops for 15 hours in Moscow???

I paid the extra $100 to get a normal airline.... http://i.imgur.com/IpMuqFQ.jpg http://i.imgur.com/eRHuFUN.jpg At first I thought, "*Why would there be elephants on the back of the turtle*", but then I realised that nothing about the picture makes any sense. It is a planet that exist because, given the infinite reality/universe theory, it much exist. It is from a series called "Discworld" and I, and everyone else who has ever touched it, highly recommend it. Aye, /u/AustinYQM speaks for us all!
Millennium hand and shrimp! Don't get me wrong, I love the disc world series but this concept is much older than that. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Elephant I agree but the one featured in the image is most defiantly Discworld inspired. Defiantly? So they were forced to make the picture? They were asked not to, but they damn well did it anyway! That's actually a bit of a fallacy though. Infinite universes doesn't imply every possible scenario will occur. There are an infinite amount of numbers between 1 and 2, but none of them will ever be 3. You just blew my god damn mind. [More kinds of infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23I5GS4JiDg) I'm waaaayyy too high for this, that blew my mind into dust. I'm so blonde now because I just can't.

The light shit? Pls go. The concepts in the video aren't that hard to grasp. I understand all of what she is saying. It was a great video. But the lights, and reflections and shit? What the actual fuck. Hardly makes sense and seems to be more confusing than what they're trying to explain.

[whoop](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2013/03/whoop-there-it-is.gif) What is this? I'm super curious! From the Legend of Korra! Highly recommended, but definitely check out Avatar: The Last Airbender as Korra is kinda like the sequel to that! Fantastic series It's a [Lion Turtle from the Avatar the last Airbender/ Legend of Korra](http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Lion_turtle) Tv series.

Ancient and wise, they initially housed human populations on their back (as seen in the picture) and would grant a select few individuals the power elemental 'bending'. 

They were hunted to near extinction though until only one remained (that we know of) and he was responsible or one of the most spiritual quotes in the series

*"The True Mind can weather all the lies and illusions without being lost.
The True Heart can tough the poison of hatred without being harmed.
Since beginningless time, Darkness thrives in the void
but always yields to purifying Light."*

I's a great series, and you only see the actual lion turtles twice throughout the two shows, but everything else in the in-between is definitely worth the watch.

Edit: Weather I really liked how they used the lion turtle to explain the origin of bending in LOK. 

I liked the story aspect of ATLA much more though. LOK has way more action in it, which was awesome! But ATLA had a better storyline imo. 

Both are great series. One of the few shows with a story plot line, where I rewatch episodes 
 I just appreciate that it didn't needlessly pander too much. A lot of times shows of this nature tend to take things down a notch or compromise story and character development in favor of being basic kiddie fare. 

They really did manage to grow their characters and amazingly gave you villains that weren't two dimensional but you actually found yourself sorta rooting for them due to how awesome they were, such as [Azula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHwN-xZ-PjU) . 
I agree though that Korra did not have as linear a storyline, but seeing how each season affected the other and the buildup to Kuvira, it was actually pretty nice. Just took a while to payoff. 

Nothing will ever top the [final Agni Kai though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCXHi0kFucc) (spoiler). One of the most beautiful and haunting moments of the show thanks largely to the soundtrack. 

 Reminds me of the turtle island thing from the last season of Avatar. It is that  I think the [lion turtle in the sea](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/a/a3/Lion_turtle.png/revision/latest?cb=20140108080746) works better in this context http://imgur.com/UbOWykP.jpg [deleted] Maybe the movie title should be "BEAK"? http://i.imgur.com/TLDpV2Z.gif https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UUkMoeKohg Good god, the music matches up perfectly.

Son, it's time we teach you how to make a hyperlink...  I remember I used to watch the magic bullet infomercial ALL the time in 2006, it was routine that everyday, at 3 am, after Frasier, I would HAVE to watch it, anyway, my favorite part(who am I kidding, the entire thing was my favorite part) was when the Nigel lithgow knock off says, "you know what this party needs? ...DIPS!"

Wait a second, is that a Spider-Man wetsuit?!? God damn being a Filipino is weird. 

You open up a picture and you don't care about the turtle. You care about the Pinoy. Who's doing the photobombing? This same thing happened near where I used to live in Missouri, and someone from the highway department painted "Free rock" on it.

It was worth a try, MoDot. See, that's not going to work.  When people see a "FREE" sign, they figure it's worthless or someone else would have already grabbed it.  What you want to do is setup a "$10" sign on it and wait until dusk.  It'll be gone. While you're not totally wrong on putting a $10 sign on it, I've had tremendous success with my FREE sign. We call them the "Free Shit Fairies" around here. 

I've never had anything last longer than one night out on the curb with a FREE sign on it. We even had a run where people would take the stuff and kindly leave the sign, so we called it our lucky sign. 

Broken swivel bar stools. A small, old, not-working propane BBQ. A cracked patio table. Most gone within an hour. None of them made it until after dark. 

I helped my FIL take down an old tree in his front yard. He asked for help loading it into his truck to haul away and I bet him $5 that it would be gone by the next day. My MIL wanted in on the bet and painted a "FREE" Sign with glitter and everything and it was on. 

Half of the pile was gone (about a cord of unsplit wood) within 30 minutes. The rest was gone the next morning. One guy even offered to rake up the wood chips from the chainsaw. Granted, firewood is a different story. He probably could have asked $100 for it and it still would have been gone instantly.  Last year I hauled my crappy weight bench to the curb and it was gone before I could finish writing up the Craigslist Curbside posting. &gt; We even had a run where people would take the stuff and kindly leave the sign, so we called it our lucky sign.

I was gonna say I'd be mostly worried about my sign getting taken. Hell, double the price and put "Organic" on it. Gone before your 5 o'clock shadow kicks in. &gt;Organic rock

&amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232; And gluten free!  Can confirm, got rid of a broken air conditioner that way  I should pay more attention to the "Look out for falling rocks" signs. There is a: 'Caution - Deaf Children Playing' sign near where I live.  I always see the sign and think: "How the hell can you even spot a deaf kid?  I usually just try to avoid hitting all children as per usual. As a father of three boys, I can tell you that all kids are fucking deaf.

Edit: Perhaps I can buy them all goddamn hearing aids with all this karma.
 Bullshit... yell "Pizza" and it'll melt those wax earplugs right out. Selective deafness working as it should. What? PIZZA! OKAY!!! He said selective deafness, not Lil' Jon defness. If Lil' Jon made pizza Sharks, I present to you my product, Pizza Car Horn^^tm. It yells out "Pizza!" when you honk. I ask $50,000 for a 10% stake in my company. Now the kids will run TO your car. It should yell "Brussels Sprouts for dinner!" I must be getting old... I love brussel sprouts... Cut them half, cook them with Bacon. Yummy. I'll give you $5,000 for 60%. Okay, okay, I see the pizza and all, but how can this make me MONEY? Eat one of them and the others will listen Easy there Chronos Stop mothering him Gaia  Like I should be scared of a deaf kid... you could probably scream in his face and he wouldn't even flinch. I'd be scared. You basically have to interpret those signs as, 'WARNING suicidal pedestrians are likely nearby'  Again, how is this different from every other road? Pretend you are moving to Russia and every deaf kid is an insurance fraud attempt.  &gt; There is a: 'Caution - Deaf Children Playing' sign near where I live.

First time I saw one of those, I was driving down an unfamiliar street in the middle of the night.  The sign said simply,  "Deaf Child",  [like this one](http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/_dev/pubsys/images/20130123_answer_deaf-1_320x260.jpg).

But as I approached it,  I thought it was a "Dead End" sign.  

Then I saw that the second word was "Child",  and my blood ran cold.  " 'Dead Child'?  What the hell?!"  

It was the middle of the night,  I did not exactly where I was,  and there was a freaking street sign telling me there was a dead child around somewhere.  I felt like I had just driven into a horror movie,  and I'm telling y'all,  you Do Not Want that feeling.  Ever.

I eventually snapped about what the sign actually said.  And it's sort of lulzy in retrospect.  But at the time it was 10 seconds of surreal horror. 


 There has been one of those signs up in my neighborhood for 20+ years. I always think, there is no way there are still deaf children around here. Every 18 years they deafen a new child, to justify having the sign.  In fact, they make the last deaf child do it as a rite of passage. It's more of a "warning, children who can't hear cars play near here" sort of deal I think. All kids are deaf kids when you drive a Prius. Yeah but you can fix that by driving a car. News report: http://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2015/04/10/coal-grove-ohio--colossal-boulder-crashes-onto-southern-ohio-roadway-closes-road-for-the-weekend.html

It's estimated to weigh about 1,500 tons... damn. I'm always amazed by the weight of rocks. I mean you see a dinosaur that size and its estimated to weigh a staggering 120 tons or something, but a rock? Fuck it, lets just keep adding zeroes.

For comparison, 1500 tons of people is about 20,000+ people This seems heavy to us but once you "zoom out" to an Earthly perspective, the Earth wouldn't even notice if this boulder vanished from its surface.  Zooming out even further, our galaxy wouldn't notice if Earth went missing.  I'm sure we could probably zoom out to a super galactic scale but my mind is already having trouble keeping up. But your mom goes missing and the whole Universe immediately notices it. I know the angle you were going for here, but that came off as an oddly sweet comment.  Well something is at the center keeping things spinning Some lucky bastard is going to get to drive up in a truck, scrutinize that rock for cracks and grain, spray paint fluorescent spots all over it, drill a bunch holes...

Then walk back to his truck, grab a bunch of high explosives, stuff'em in the holes, shoo everyone away, shout "FIRE IN THE HOLE!", count down to zero and push a button that goes BOOM!

All while whistling, "We're in the money."

Some lucky bastard picked the right line of work. :D I mean... What are you going to do in that situation? Evasive maneuver?  If that thing has you in its sights, I think it's game over.   im so glad this post came up. the other day I was driving with my girlfriend and passed through one of these zones and I had that exact realization.

so let me get this straight: Instead of doing anything about the falling rocks, they just decide to let you know. not so you can actually DO anything about it, but just like a hey whats up! you might die.

so now I can potentially know before my impending death by boulder that I may die I think its less about letting you know that you may be crushed by a rock that coincidentally comes loose at precisely the right moment and more about warning about the potential of debris from rock that may have fallen within the past few hours.

So I wouldn't look up, I'd keep my eye on the road. Pretty much this. I live near the Pacific Coast Highway and you see these often. Not so much because of the risk of giant falling boulders, but more so because of the tourists who are staring at the beaches and don't see the rock that is about to take the bumper right off their rented Mustang convertible.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure I've seen at least a few that say "fall*en* rock area", not "fall*ing* rock area". There is a video of a falling rock. You see it start falling of the top of a mountain and a few mins later it crashes right infront of the car.  I'm surprised it hasent been posted yet. 

Found  the end of it

Found whole thing watch the shape of the clif at the start 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOJfcTZME0U Functionally what does that look like?  If you happen to be in the path of a boulder like that what do you do?  Just stop?  Speed up?  Should I go slower or faster on these roads? Just be heads up for threats rolling down the mountain. If it's going to fall on top of you you probably won't see it. But that's a pretty low risk. The big risk is that a boulder falls flat in front of you and you plow into while going 80 because nobody's on the road and it's pretty strait. Of course, this happened in Ohio, so you would not want to be driving 80 under any road conditions since the cops there love writing speeding tickets. Slower. 

The point of the signs is not to tell you "avoid the actively falling debris" as much as it is to tell you "There might be debris that has fallen and landed on the road". Goddamn Tiny I thought Falling Rock was an old native american dude? Yep.  His brother Rolling was the of the inventor of a cheap beer. Here's the view from the other side.

[Scissors](http://i.imgur.com/NvCVEk3.jpg) Ok, your picture for scissors totally belongs in /r/oddlysatisfying. The way the road splits perfectly on the double yellow... oh yeah... that's the stuff.  it's posted there ever hour ever after? but not happily.  Sorry for the typo. our work is never over? What's interesting about that scissors picture isn't necessarily that the road itself split so perfectly.  The pavement was likely laid in two "strips", one for each side of the road (meaning there's an inherent weak point in the seam), and painted down the middle.  The interesting thing to me is that the underlying ground also has a natural seam in the same location.  That, or the original road was a single lane and the second lane required adding more aggregate underneath. There is no way a natural seam would follow the road that accurately. The asphalt is stronger and denser than the underlying soil so when the earthquake struck, the asphalt broke along the seam and everything else followed. This makes the most sense. Well there's your problem right there.

Got to watch out those state highway patrol will catch you speeding there!! Can confirm, was ticketed there. Is that Route 52? Better get the dynamite!  Seriously, though, his do you get rid of that? I think they are actually planning on using dynamite. It happened about 2:30 am last night. Wow was anyone hurt?  You could drive right into that at night time. No. A truck did run into it, but they were OK. The fire department was pretty quick about setting up traffic control. It'd be kind of funny to drive up on that. "Well, uh, okay I guess I won't be going this way anymore". 

 It'd feel like a video game.

"Huh, haven't ~~unlocked~~ bought this part of the game yet." Your comment made me sad.  Yep, they will get a rig out there to drill a few holes through it, pack some dynamite in and cap it to blast it. They will then truck the pieces out. [deleted] Huh.

 just move the highway around it  Wile E. Coyote at it again  The only victim was a single coyote. Cleveland rocks? I was in a rock slide in Yosemite National Park when I was 14, in about 1998 or 1999. They had a rock slide while I was staying in curry village. It is so loud, it was a deafening cracking and splitting of granite. I thought thunder at first, then I felt the ground shaking. It was like a larger sized earthquake. Luckily, it was in the afternoon so people were not as panicked as they would be if it were in the middle of the night. I'm telling you, it sounded as if the earth was cracking and splitting apart. It was truly insane, and quite scary. I half expected to be swallowed whole by the earth or have a tree fall on me, I didn't know what it was until a minute later. An experienced hiker yelled "rock slide!" And then we all knew.  From what I can recall, at least one rock climber died (while saving his friends), and many people were injured. The size of the boulders were probably larger than this one. You could see the dust rising from miles away I heard.  
  

I guess what happens is in the summer, when the ice melts between the rocks, it then dries up and the cracks expand, splitting the boulder apart? Something like that.. Anyways, it was a very scary experience.  

  Edit: I found the link, and it was June 14 1999. http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-06-14/news/9906150052_1_rock-slide-curry-village-yosemite-national-park

Edit 2:  thanks to my fellow redditor, smith6ar for explaining the correct process in how the rock slide occurs:   Water freezes in the cracks and expands. When it freezes and refreezes over and over again you get deep cracks in the rock that can cause rock falls. Just in time for the granite countertops I wanted! Blame the pioneers.

They're building a second one! Where? They have the best homemade candy! You'd think it'd be an awful tourist trap but it's legitimately awesome. For real? My wife and I avoided it for that exact reason, assuming it was like a Cracker Barrel gift shop + cheese. It kind of is but the stuff they have is almost all homemade (made by them) and legit. It's worth it for the candy alone. Best gummy bears ever! Chocolate dipped fritos. That's America right there.
 Haha, my GF and I didn't even think twice about stopping in from the moment we saw the billboard.... then again, we kinda have a soft spot for things that are simple, folksy, georgic, etc. It's an endearing place with lots of delicious, unique, and affordable food stuffs. Really? I drive past it (one? no idea how many there are) on my way down to Columbus and I always wonder what Grandpa's Cheese tastes like, but I never stop. I may give it a try next time. Every time i pass that sign, i want to stop so bad, but i never have.

A 'Cheese Barn' sounds like the happiest place on earth. Their foods and candy are really good. They also have tons of samples so that's good. It's definitely worth the quick stop if you're not in a hurry. I always bought stuff as good gifts for out of state relatives too. They love buckeyes and gummy bears. Spent the night there once, just because. I love that place. If you're ever hungry driving from Cleveland to Columbus stop at Grandpa's Cheese Barn. You can have a lunch consisting of free samples.

[This is the same place or is there an epidemic of boulders I don't know about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/324dlb/a_little_rock_fell_off_the_hill_into_the_road/) Oops! It's the samesies just the view from the other side. I didn't realize someone had already posted. hey its different enough! where did it come from? is there a large rock face up the hill or was it a spooky ghost? Probably a rock face.  They exist in Ohio though not as many as Pennsylvania .  So the boulder probably ramped of the top of the rock face and went straight down onto the road. Yes, that is correct. And your boulder is more popular. OP, Are you from South Point or from the ironton area? Really? The post says it's in Kentucky.  It's technically in Ohio, but can be seen from KY. The bridge in the background is the one that connects Ashland, KY to Ironton, OH. On the other side of the road is the Ohio River. Source: lived my first 18 years in the hell hole that is Ashland.

-Earth That's because we forgot to get her the present she asked for for like the millionth time. The destruction of the human race and return to natural order? Not for another 50 years or so.  Hate to break it to ya friend, but your ballon's about to burst... but humans are part of the natural order.



...and that balloon's full of your own butt toots.  Where else do toots come from?? Vaginas, arm pits, and that meaty part of your palm.  Fish, dogs, birds and sloths My wife and I have had many arguments over whether birds can fart. Common consensus is that they cannot.  How can they fart if they have no sphincters?

How can our farts be real if our sphincters aren't real? Other people's butts What's with the human hate on reddit? I know, right! C'mon, /u/The_Mods_Are_Jews, let's make a stand! depending how big this is it could cause more environmental harm than all the good Earth Day does 



that's ironic right?  Dontcha think? It's like a volcanOOOOooo on Eeeearthhhh Day  
  
EDIT: Had to capture the essence of Alanis. It's free Carbon credits when you've already paid It's the organic food that you just didn't make And who would have thought,

of fissures. Volcano has a funny way on sneaking up on you.... Its like raaaaIIIIAAAIAn! a little too ironic Yeah, I really do think.  It's like ash rain on Earth day.  while it depends on the size and scope of the irruption, this actually may cause global cooling. The white particles in the air actually reflect sunlight which can have a net effect of lowering the average earth temperatures. but the earth did it to itself, so its alright.. its not dissimilar to me slowly killing myself with opiates Welcome to Earf. [You'd all be dead now if it wasn't for my David!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_Zn5l0Aw8) I never understood this. Why do people think Will Smith says "earf?"

Dat shockwave. Hooooooooooooooooooly smokin' tolidos  he had a long time to think that one up.  "Watch out for the shock wave..."   ^what ^to ^say ^what ^to ^say I think he was going to say holy shit but realized he was being recorded and went with something a little more family-friendly. OI JESUS! Obligatory Krakatoa post:  http://nautil.us/blog/the-sound-so-loud-that-it-circled-the-earth-four-times

Edit:  I'm not sure how many more people will see this, but Krakatoa is the reason the sky is red in Munch's "The Scream".  For a while, people just thought it was a surrealistic style choice.  Nope, Munch lived when Krakatoa erupted and Krakatoa was so phenomenal that it for a bit of time it actually fucked up the color of the sky.  http://www.skyandtelescope.com/press-releases/astronomical-sleuths-link-krakatoa-to-edvard-munchs-painting-the-scream/ I had not, that's astonishing! Why can't you see the shockwave in the water? Water is barely compressible, so if you're looking for the water to be kinda "punched" by the shock it is probably not differentiable from standard water-wave oscillation. &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juwtnTB1RCU

I wish real life was 1080p My life is pixelated as fuck.  With the refresh rate, it looks like I'm breakdancing when i walk across the room.  And I can't even see my penis in the shower; Just cleaning some peach cubes. Maybe you should upgrade First comment in video "ohhh conchetumadre weon" - chilean for "oh mother fuckerrrr dude" lol, i watched and started giggling. The words that came out of his mouth could not have been more Chilean. 

mah people Thanks for sharing the video.

So yeah, I would get the hell out of there. Ash rainfall is no fun. But I might be mistaken in how close it is and how dangerous that makes it. Any volcanologists around? Volcanologist here!  Get into a really cool pose.  You're going to be remembered forever. Your humor is as dark as the sky's going to be out in chile right now.  But imagine the sunsets! You'll have to.  I'd upvote twice if I could.  actually, a neat trick. If you first downvote the person, and THEN upvote them, they get 2 upvotes! Just did this. Can confirm Took me a while.  Realized I'm an idiot. I call shenanigans  [deleted] Wow, that's disturbing and beautiful. It's shit like this that made the cities of Pompeii think that Vesuvius's imminent explosion was a blessing from the gods rather than a sign of a horrible death to come.  Ride dirty as the fuckin' sky that you're prayin' to. [Bring it.](http://i.imgur.com/0UtqrdO.jpg) [Didn't work out for this guy.](https://youtu.be/xzI-k-ktYvk?t=38) A Farscape Reference!

Edit: [Scene, for those who want to watch it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo_tg_fSvqw) I've watched a volcano erupt around that distance twice in my life. We were fine. We kinda just sat back and watched during the way. At night, we also did, but looked much cooler because you can see the hot fiery glow of the tip in the dark. Ash rain was no biggie. But it did make everything dirty. Rains come eventually and washes everything away and before you know it things are back to normal. Where do you live, or have you lived to see a volcano erupt from that near by twice? If you don't mind my asking. 

I'd like to see such a sight for myself some day, but the odds are astronomically low to just happen to be in the right place when one erupts, unless you live by an active volcano.

I did see a minor burst of volcanic activity on the Pacaya Volcano in Guatemala, once, but that was a tiny blast.

___

edit: I remembered I had a [(not so great) photo of the blast I saw.](http://i.imgur.com/GKiR2gz.jpg) Tiny, as you can see. But it was a neat sight. I grew up in the Philippines, right at the foot of Mt. Mayon. [Here's a pic](https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmarchan/5200245771/) taken by my uncle back in '84. The second time was I think 1990. Mt. Mayon acts up, on average every 10 years or so. Few people live there, but those that live right on the foot of the mountain will evacuate the seconds they see all the wild animals book it out to the flat lands. Its an incredible sight. First you think the mountain is big. But then you see this giant plume of smoke get 10x bigger than it. Its quite an experience. I think the link you used was to a private or hidden image, but I snooped around your uncle's Flickr and found the related album: https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmarchan/sets/72157625450970150

Those are awesome photographs. And thanks for sharing the story, it must be quite the experience indeed.

Do you mind if I post this album to /r/PhilippinesPics? I think the folks there will like it. Ha! Thanks, I just fixed the links. You're welcome to share the album. All the other pics are mine, but the retro 80's pics, all my uncle (I was like 6 then) lol. Not to make it sound like I'm hating, but that mountain is the most cliche mountain ever, its just a triangle. lol, you're not hating. It IS cliche. Its claimed to be the most 'perfect cone' volcano in the world which is another way of saying, its a pretty damn good looking triangle. Where I'm from only volcano I'd be able to see is probably the super volcano under Yellowstone. And then it would just be a small ash butt that gets bigger and bigger until the volcanic winter sets in and we all die. 


edit: butt, not butt

edit: i forgot i have butt to butt. Yellowstone isn't going to be a big ash cloud, it's going to be a giant detonation, BOOM all at once It's amazing how slow the gas looks in the video. It almost looks like theres just a solid pillar of rock floating above the volcano. Well, I've seen 3 volcanoes erupt less than 80 kilometers away and the first one I saw was Hekla (in 2000). The others were Fimmvruhls and Eyjafjallajkull (2010). I can tell you that I did not come to any harm, even though the roof and lawn were covered in about .5-1 cm thick ash, but the lands South-East of my location saw some seriously brutal ash clouds and if you drove into one, you could see only about 10 meters in front of you and it turned day into night. You might remember Eyjafjallajkull as the volcano that disrupted flights in Europe. The rain did not wash it away until after a long time, but we were very lucky that it was fertile ash and not poisonous to plants. But the ash was far, far worse than cigarette smoke. In fact, I seem to recall that if you went outside for a few minutes without a mask, you would get very damaged lungs and it would be the equivalent of eight or 10 packets of cigarettes. It was brutal...

It's better to be safe than sorry. And seeing as the ash cloud is heading their way, they should try to be safe. The towns under the volcano had to be abandoned basically so that people wouldn't die... [Found one](http://imgur.com/xuffWEE) He taught me last year at the University of Iceland, absolutely fantastic guy! With that name he couldn't not be Well if your last name is already Thordarson, you may as well name your son Thor. That's a Patronymic, not a family name. 'Thordarson' literally means 'Son of Thordar'. Every person in Iceland has their given name, and their father's name with either -son or -dottir (daughter) for men and women respectively.  This works because they're already related to everyone on the island so they don't need different last names.  It's strange that the ash seems static in the sky, even when zooming in closely (at least on my phone). Lol at "ahh, concha tu madre weon!" I miss using Chilean slang. What does it mean? The literal translation is along the lines of "ahhh, the vagina of your mother, dude/bastard" (weon is an extremely slippery word in the chilean dialect). In english this guy is basically exclaiming: "motherfucker (dude)"  Our earth is really incredible. Fuck me sideways. What the fuck? Am I the only one who got [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQbDmCKGtuU)(NSFW) video as my upcoming video? It's got 22 million views... No, but thanks to clicking that I bet I'll get stuff like that in the future. When I first viewed the clip I was like... Oh, no cursing. So strange to see a video from Chile where no one curses, or says anything.

Then I realized my Bluetooth headphones had not connected properly, watched the video again... "Ah Conchatumadre..." after 5 secs.

Chile is a very special place. &gt;Chile is a very special place.

The weirdest part that I found about it, is that the elderly use the exact same slang as the kids. Wow, that's a great video. Awesome zoom in shots of the smoke.  This smoke has such a detailed texture Do we have a volcano guy? Volcano guy here! This is definitely a volcano. You can tell because of the way it is.

Edit: My first gold! That's pretty neat. That's neat! How neat is that?! You're a lot more concise than the other guy. I like that. We don't value conciseness enough. I want to see you more in future
 Somebody watches neature walks! Hi! I'll fill the role today.

20km evacuation zone. 1,500 people immediately evacuated. Apparently (from what I've heard from a friend) they're also considering evacuating 200,000 people, although I do believe it would have to get considerably worse for that to happen.

Anyway, the ash is going to be an absolute bitch to clean up. Forms a cement like mud when it mixes with water, so imagine that getting into your sewers and water management systems.

Also poses a considerable risk to Air Traffic Control as certain ash can really mess with aircraft engines. So if it continues to spew, we might see some big delays around South America and possibly other areas around the Southern Hemisphere (depending on quantity and winds).

Hope that helps!

Stay Safe

TheEarthquake(Andpossiblyvolcano)guy Air traffic controller here: we get specialized training on Volcanic Ash. The particles are extremely [abrasive, whatever] and very hazardous to aircraft. There's a good video on YouTube with the audio from when Mt. Redoubt blew and an airliner had flame out all engines. 

 http://imgur.com/VcRlKiB

Edit: A word Why do I only ever hear about these things erupting on reddit?  It literally just happened.  Like within the hour.  Chilean news tweeted it out about half an hour ago, Oh thanks, I had classes all day and just assumed it happened this morning.  Because you've never been outside? Is this that MMORPG I keep hearing about? It even has it's own sub, /r/outside. Meh, too many micro transactions and DLC. Clearly Pay2win. Yeah, some of the NPCs are real dicks too And there's no physics mods either. There are consumables that do fun things with the rendering, though. The explosion isn't loud enough that you can hear it across an ocean.  Because one of the primary functions of Reddit is to be a news aggregator? but cat and dog pics pushes them all out the way Geologist here, looks like a Plinian Eruption. Big, large, spews lots of ash, and violently explosive.

Think of it as someone who had been really really constipated for a long time. The kind of lava in a Plinian Eruption is felsic (silica rich, low iron content, very viscous, forms a thick lava dome....hence my constipation reference).

Now, imagine massive amounts of fart gas being built up in our constipated man. The same occurs before a Plinian Eruption. Magma is rich is gasses like carbon dioxide that builds up.

Going back to our constipated man, eventually alot of poop and fart gas builds up. As you can imagine, our man is in a lot of pain and discomfort, probably some damage to his large intestine and rectum. Similarly, immense pressures from volcanic gas and magma build up causes earthquakes to shake the surrounding area, mini steam volcanoes called fumaroles and phraetic eruptions to occur, the volcano begins to buckle and swell.

Suddenly one day, at the height of the constipated man's pain, he runs to the bathroom and pushes really hard. What results is a spectacular and disgusting poop eruption as chunks of poop and fart gas fly out of his anus. 

Similarly,  when the volcano's structure cannot take it any more a violent eruption like the one in Chile occurs. Sometimes the lava dome just explodes out. Sometimes (like Mt. Saint Helens), the while side of the volcano explodes out. Nevertheless, a huge ash cloud is sent up into the atmosphere,  violent pyroclastic flows run down the volcano at near super sonic speeds, lava flows run down the mountain, chunks of mountain fly everywhere, and pure chaos breaks out. Any living thing caught in a pyroclastic flow is blown away, incinerated, or both. If they survive they'll be covered with second to 3rd degree burns. If they try to breath in the hot ash they'll burn their lungs severely while volcanic ash (which is just tiny volcanic glass) cuts their respiratory tissues causing them to cough up blood....a terrible way to die actually.

Anyway, happy earth day everyone! :D I think you hit on exactly the right analogy for explaining this to reddit. Reddit and poop analogies go hand-in-hand.  Have some gold for that amazing analogy. 

-Fellow geologist Thank you for the Reddit Gold! I can't believe my first reddit gold was for a comment that used a constipated poop analogy for Plinian eruptions! This is scientific as fuck! #AINT NOBODY GIVIN A FUCK ABOUT XENU ESCAPING IN THE TOP RIGHT?!?! [ay madre de dios!!!](http://i.imgur.com/EQqqUB8.jpg) #**XENU BACKWARDS MEANS U NEX, SON!** I just spat out my water. Thanks for making my day brighter! Holy shit. The volcano distracted me. That is for sure what that is. Wait, can you explain the cosmology again? Did Xenu end up in a volcano or just the human souls?  Whoa, that Towering Cumulus or [Pyrocumulus cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrocumulus_cloud) that formed is intense! I bet that's going to make for quite the lightning show tonight!

And... Run. Also, all that snow still along the top of the volcano... Will melt, and fall down the volcano, taking rocks and mud along with it. There may not be lava oozing down the volcano, but there will be a landslide. 

Keep running. It's called a lahar!

Stay Safe

TheEarthquake(Andpossiblyvolcano)guy Serious questions op: Assuming you are outside the 20km zone does the impact your life in any way? Does it appear darker because of soot/smoke? Finally have you seen this before? 20km zone I assume is for life threatening danger cause that's quite small. Outside that will be dumped on by ash fall. It won't burn or anything, just have to wear dust masks outside and everything is gonna get ashy. Shit sucks.

I live 53km away from a volcano that was blowing several years back (see 1990's). One day I remember all the schools had to close due to heavy ash fall. Hey! I think it is me who you asking for.
I live in Argentina 100km away from the border with Chile. Something similar happened 3 years ago and it was awful. The sky turned black in the middle of the day and 20cm of ash covered the town. It was everywhere. We had to wear facial masks for a few days because its very bad for our lungs and throat. School was suspended for a week and the airport closed for 4 months, it really affected tourism. Bariloche (my town) looked like a black and white movie, as everything was covered in grey dust. We dont really know how big the consequences of this volcano eruption will be for us yet. If anyone is interested, [here's the BBC news article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-32425370).

And [here's a discussion thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/33j5um/thousands_evacuated_after_volcano_eruption_in/) in /r/worldnews. http://imgur.com/8tPs2p5 The Keymaster and the Gatekeeper must have gotten together.  This heralds the arrival of Gozer.  And remember people, if someone asks if you are a god, you say YES. [So... It just happened again. That's it the 2nd eruption we're done](https://imgur.com/a/jZyen) I recommend you to open 3 cans of GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE I took this picture (: OP is a good friend of mine and a frequent Reddit user (this is actually my first post)
I work as a flight attendant here in Chile We landed in Puerto Montt about half an hour before this whole thing started.
After getting to my hotel room, I put my uniform in the laundry bag and was gonna take it to the reception counter. When I left my room, I noticed about 3 people looking out the window. Naturally I looked, and found out about this shocking little number. 
I have a few more pictures, but I have no idea how to upload them, or if it's even possible (Reddit noob). Anyway, glad you liked the pic. This is the truth :) The scale of the plume compared to the volcano is astounding. Volcanoes aren't small. Reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=36&amp;v=njV9ski1gB4). The actual footage from inside the ash cloud starts around 2:09. So that UFO in the upper right dropped a bomb on that mountain? 

Edit: Shit theres a squadron of UFOs, three of them. It's well known that UFOs are the cause of earthquakes. It would likely take three to produce this kind of eruption. Fucking bastards.

 ALIENS It's been two hours and I can't believe that nobody has pointed out the obvious: somebody forgot to toss the virgin in.   

Remember everyone, although eruptions can look cool,  they can be dangerous. Just don't get too close to the lava or you could get burned by it.  Remember [this](http://i.imgur.com/PAzjLDJ.jpg) scene from The Return of the King? That was modeled after real lava. Peter Jackson was very adamant that he wanted the lava to burn things up just like it does in real life.

So yes, of course, enjoy the eruption by all means, but just be sure not to get any of the lava on your skin. It WILL burn you. K, and this uranium rod I'm holding is that safe to hold and nibble? I only know about lava. If it's anything like lava, it will burn your mouth before you even have a chance to spit it out.  I think I love you  So what am I so afraid of?


Oh, right; lava Uranium is safe to hold.   Not all uranium though. And lava, is it safe to hold? Lava is safe to hold. Not all lava though. That depends, how old is it? \#NotAllUranium [in Rod we trust.](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/8/8f/Carbonrod.png)  If you ever drop your keys into a river of molten lava, let 'em go, because man, they're gone. But wait...if you dropped them...you've already let them go.  whoa. Except Gollum would not have sank down in the lava as flesh and bones are much less dense than molten rock. But this is molten doom rock. It has a light, almost fluffy texture. Which I guess is sort of ironic given its name. I feel like people really should already know not to play with lava. My experience with floors has taught me that nothing good can come from touching lava. [Japanese hiker video from last year.]( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/japanese-volcano-eruption-survivors-heartbreaking-stories-victims) I like how you wrote this, like everyone in Chile right now is on reddit heeding your advice.  Villarrica last month, now Calbuco. Ah, spring in Chile, when the volcanos blossom. It's autumn in Chile. So the volcanos are just letting go of their magma.  Fall-cano foliage. I just love when the leaves turn all orange and yellow and red and firey.
 /r/popping would love this Run motherfucker As awesome as it is scary. Awesome in a literal sense... not so much in the colloquial sense. And literal in the literal sense, not so much in the reddit sense Me when I try to fart silently in class You fart ash? He farts volcanos If he starts shittin' lava, he needs to see a doctor. Hot liquid "Magma"  janitors would be cleaning the pyroclastic flow in your armchair You should see him when he farts flaming rocks.  Oh the old reddit switch...FUCK WE DONT HAVE TIME FOR THIS!! RUN EVERBODAAAY! No but it shmells like ash.  You don't? You don't? Does the 20km evac rule count aswell? OP, I'm really hoping you're reading this only after having already left for a safer place.

Edit: Dammit!  I was expecting [the song!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIBTg7q9oNc) There's earthquakes in Chile and near New Zealand almost every day. Who knows... the same tectonic plate appears to be invoved. Seems like awfully far away though. There were several minor earthquakes in Chili before the eruption as well. There are earthquakes everywhere all the time... yes but we had a 5+ around the same time, which isn't very common... not to mention ring of fire Looks like there's something wrong with your mountain.  http://i.imgur.com/ChADoG6.jpg Thanks, Obama.  [Photos taken from Puerto Montt](http://imgur.com/a/H9hw7) They are very lucky it's not a windy day and that the wind is not blowing in their direction.  Does anyone know where this falls on the VEI (Volcanic Explosivity Index). not sure if this answers your answer, but from 60 active volcanoes in Chile, this one is the third most active. That doesn't answer his question, unfortunately.  He wanted to 
know the force.

Edit: It does somewhat, in that infrequent eruptions of volcanoes are normally on the higher end of the scale, but since there are frequent volcanic eruptions, I'd say under a 5. Well, considering there is a picture, I'm going to rule out anything above a 6.

Considering /u/vaalenz said it's frequent, I'm not a volcanologist, but I'm going to say "Under 5". Run, you fools!  I live there. Puerto Montt, Chile.
Tonnes of ashes on the way to our city and nearby places.

Must say, having my facebook news feed with literally 300 pics of the same cloud with different angles is funny tho. The funny thing is, there could be a lab somewhere who managed to clone a dinosaur and put it on the back of a trailer driving on the highway, nobody would presume it was real. THE PERFECT CRIME There are ~~3~~ 4 movies showing why this would be a bad idea. Jurassic Park, King Kong, The Land Before Time III, and Schindler's List.  "I could have done more. I could have saved more raptors." I would watch this.

Post-Jurassic World Earth would be filled with dinosaurs until one pterosaur (who isn't a real dinosaur) failed in art school and decided to exterminate all the dinosaurs. The Triassic-Reich lasted for 14 long centuries before the allies stepped in and figured out their beak-code. It was a gruesome war but Adolfosaur was finally defeated. Countless dinosaurs died and memorials were erected in their honor. The Normandy Invasion with T-Rexes. I would watch the shit out of this movie! We all would. We all would. Krieger God damn Sharp Tooth! Schindler's List??? Enjoy the gold, I laughed so hard.  Thanks, there's nothing funnier than Schindler's List, right? *high five* And if movie 4 makes a lot of money, we're in for at least 3 more. Is there a law against cloning a dinosaur?

Edit: I am aware you cannot clone a dinosaur. It's called a joke. There are probably all sorts of regulations on genetics research, so people don't go releasing genetically modified mosquitos into the environment. 

Making a dinosaur wouldn't be illegal if you do it with all the proper permits, but doing it secretly would be.

This is of course all outrageous speculation.

EDIT: Guys, I know people are releasing genetically modified mosquitos, that's why I used it as an example. My point is that not just any schmuck can do it. Where can I apply for a permit to clone a dinosaur? I'm asking for a friend.  Until it blinks, then the shit's going down. But this will end up in FB saying it's real and government are hiding them. Like and share if you oppose animal cruelty! Didn't they come to the conclusion dinosaurs, being of bird descent, have feathers? Some came to the ~~*hypothesis*~~ ~~*theory*~~ *hypothesis* that all dinosaurs *may* have had feathers, big difference.

~~Edit~~ ~~Edit~~ Edit You shut your whore mouth.  [Fluffy T-Rex is ~~glorious~~ fabulous.](http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/188/7/8/fluffy_rex_by_arvalis-d7pmir4.jpg) But shit, it was 99 cents. 

Edit: I would like to thank Darwin, for this gilded award. Without him, we'd all be the same. 

Edit 2: [memed](http://i.imgur.com/DPLLoOI.jpg) I love everything about how your mind works. And now that song is stuck in my head right before a 4 hour flight. Peachy.  It looks like a pimped out Chocobo. Fluffy T-Rex is FABULOUS!  I corrected my error. Is that why they're extinct? Too ummm... *fabulous*? I like how there is an extra from Mad Max for scale. It is most likely t-rex had feathers. It's a theory, yes, but a theory backed up by a large body of evidence. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus#Skin_and_feathers Theory is always backed by scientific evidence.  *Hypothesis* is what nonscientific people are thinking of when they hear "theory" and think "unverified conjecture." Wouldn't birds be of dinosaur descent, not the other way around? Not necessarily true with big dinosaurs, or at least they wouldn't have been heavily feathered.  Elephants and rhinos still have hair but they're not furry like smaller mammals.  Larger dinosaurs would probably be similarly lacking in feathers. But mammoths mastodons and woolly rhino had a lot of hair so size is not the only factor on hair.A dinosaurs size may not have be the factor on feathers.  There were no polar ice caps during the Cretaceous and very cold conditions would have been absent outside of the highest mountain ranges.  Even the high arctic had crocodile-like animals living there which would be impossible in more recent climate conditions. I've spent *a lot* of time studying this topic. From my understanding we only have strong evidence and reason to believe that some [Therapods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theropoda), more specifically the subgroup [Coelurosaurs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coelurosauria), had feathers or feather-like covering. There's some speculation that feather-like structures may have existed in other (non-Therapod) groups, which very well may be true, but the fossil evidence is *very* weak. If you want to know which dinosaurs we're *definitely* sure had feathers, check out the [Maniraptoriformes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniraptoriformes).  I think that was velociraptors specifically: http://www.amnh.org/our-research/science-news/2007/velociraptor-had-feathers You know how people do those pranks where their passengers are sleeping and they see a truck being pulled backwards and they try to scare them? This would be  stepping that prank up.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prv0Sam_828

Man you can see it and be 100% sure it's being towed, and it still looks creepy as hell and would freak anyone out. I've got a friend who's been doing this kind of shit to his wife for like 10 years now. I have no idea how he's still married. Married? I have no idea how he's still alive. I bet she's planning the prank to end all pranks, his funeral lol Final words.  "GOT YOU GOOD!!!  FUCKER!!!" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDs2wrq7xpI That last prank could've ended pretty badly. Poor guy.  So very stressed out for our amusement. That... is a very focused and hard working employee. ...and his body was never found He died as he lived. Sleeping on the couch. Someone call the CSI team: we've found our killer. My favorite part is the ending, as her hand covers the screen in silence, and he says "it was being towed" all nonchalant like that explanation was going to set everything straight. Good thing he was only video-recording-and-driving rather than texting-and-driving.  This could have been so much more dangerous. Imagine the reactions of all the little kids this truck passed by.  Probably shined a massive light in it's eye or some stupid shit. It wobbles! https://twitter.com/japortega/status/586983421232070660

 "See mom, I told you they still exist!" You mean She. 

"all the animals in Jurassic Park are female. We've engineered them that way."
 Did somebody go into the park and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts? Is that true? Ive actually never seen the movie, dying to though. Is it so they dont reproduce? Dude gwatch Jurassic park right now DI-NO DEE-EN-AYE! I thought you were miming out the theme tune, that was very confusing Yes, the reason was so that they didn't reproduce in an uncontrolled way. Yes, but didn't they use some kind of frog DNA where that particular species could change sex? omg what is wrong with you?  GO WATCH IT!!!! Bc life finds a way Life, uh, finds a way. I have a digital copy, I'm tempted to take my card information off my account and let you watch it.

&gt; Dr. Alan Grant: A turkey, huh? OK, try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous Period. You get your first look at this "six foot turkey" as you enter a clearing. He moves like a bird, lightly, bobbing his head. And you keep still because you think that maybe his visual acuity is based on movement like T-Rex - he'll lose you if you don't move. But no, not Velociraptor. You stare at him, and he just stares right back. And that's when the attack comes. Not from the front, but from the side, from the other two raptors you didn't even know were there. Because Velociraptor's a pack hunter, you see, he uses coordinated attack patterns and he is out in force today. And he slashes at you with this...

&gt; A six-inch retractable claw, like a razor, on the the middle toe. He doesn't bother to bite your jugular like a lion, say... no no. He slashes at you here, or here...

You know, I'd always wondered why that kid was randomly in that scene, but I never got around to Googling it. I thought I'd look it up after reading your post and I found this scene that sort of explains it but was cut from the script (maybe it was in the book too, I dunno):

&gt; *The Volunteers are from all walks of life, dinosaur buffs. Three or four of them have CHILDREN with them, and the kids run around, like in a giant sandbox.*

&gt; *Grant, Ellie and a Volunteer walk down the hill. Grant spots a KID kicking dirt onto one of the digs. He notices and frowns.*

&gt; **GRANT**  "What's that kid doing?"

&gt; *(to the kid)* "What are you doing there!? Excuse me! Can you just back off? This is very fragile! Are you out of your mind? Get off that and go find your parents!"

&gt; *(to Ellie)* "Did you see what he just did?" 

&gt; *The kid stomps away, pissed off.*

&gt; **KID** "Asshole." 

&gt; **GRANT** *(to Ellie)* "Why do they have to bring their kids?!" 

&gt;**ELLIE** "You could hire your help. But there's four summers of work here, with the money for one. And you say it's a learning experience, sort of a vacation, and you get volunteers with kids."

Ha, could you imagine being a little kid in the back seat of your parents' car on a road trip and seeing that thing as you pass it? This reminds me that the new Jurassic is coming, and now I'm excited! Looks pretty awake to me. Imagine pulling alongside this, with your kids sleeping in the back seat, then start screaming "It's alive, it's alive!". I wouldn't do that, but I've heard of people who would. Wtf is that??

 that's an amazing ad campaign. It might be wise to increase your following distance a bit... just in case. Walking with dinosaurs was just a long con so that one day government officials could transport live dinosaurs during the day, without raising any attention. "It's animatronic". I call shenanigans.

The new Jurassic Park part of universal studios in Orlando FL is being made I wouldn't be surprised if this was for the theme park just made in a different state. Jurassic Park in Orlando isn't being expanded. The new Addition being built next to Jurassic Park is the new King Kong ride. It's a new King Kong ride, but I'm assuming they are going to work in Dinos as it's rumored to be based off the most recent kong flick.  Um..Are you talking about the new ride construction right next to the JP section at islands of adventure?
Cause sorry to burst your bubble, its not a new JP attraction being built.

It's a king kong one.
You can already tell now looking at construction picture's they are building skull island even Oh.. :( Is this part of the Discover the Dinosaurs attraction?

Five year old me would be losing his shit seeing that.  I love this Imagine being on shrooms and just seeing that thing pass you. would be quite scary if it were animatronic and did 'wake up' and try to escape its chains every few miles That would be great for JP viral marketing.

So cool how much rotor wash is still effecting the ocean 100' below it. That helicopter looks like a cartoon beaver.  Never noticed that.

This was one of my favourite things to land on. [Because it was there.](https://youtu.be/nqZz2XD6j64?t=95s) Touch. 

I just thought there was some sort of strange, Canadian trend of people getting stranded on sea stacks. "Stacking," or something. Kind of like the blackout game. 

Like, maybe a few 12 year-olds did it once and died. Then the news picked it up and it became an actual trend for a few months and the coast guard had to go through a bunch of new training exercises, much to the chagrin of officers who saw it as a passing fad and didn't like putting their trainees in such danger to prevent something that wasn't even that common or lasting of a problem. So maybe there was like, a conference or something where high-ranking members of the guard had to make their case and waste a bunch of time and tax-payer money. And maybe that just made it an even bigger deal, which news shows capitalized on even though it was their fault to begin with. We take planking very seriously in Canada.

Most likely this pilot got into Vortex Ring State. Looks like a helicopter version of the Wienermobile. Helicopters do not fly, they beat the air into submission.  Isn't that a Chinook?  Easy way to tell is to count the landing gears- Sea Knight has 3 (two in the back, one in the front) Chinook has 4 (one in each corner) Smaller than a Chinook. The U.S. navy also flies them as the CH-46 Sea kight where the Chinook is the CH-47

thank you. what causes these pillars/erosion-resistant-rock in the ground to form (before they are exposed)?  The layers were deposited individually, one atop another. Different deposits are more resistant than others. But what, specifically, causes these rocks and not, say, the rocks directly adjacent to them to be erosion-resistant? Is it the chemical composition of the rock? Is it the way different strata are connected? Is it something to do with the fluid dynamics of waves where some parts are exposed to more erosive force than others? Is it purely happenstance?  Sedimentary rocks each have an environment of deposition. Specific lithologies can be tied to a different depositional environment. The resistance to erosion typically depends on the mineral content of the rock and surficial aqueous geochemical processes that operate on the rock. Mechanical weathering also plays an important part in reducing the grainsize of the rocks. A sedimentary facie can be though of as a distinct rock unit or geographic boundary defined under certain conditions of sedimentation (related to depositional environment). Walters law of facies states that vertical changes in the strata reflect lateral changes in the depositional environment. In a sense each time the sea moves further inland different sets of rocks are deposited. When it regresses or moves away from the coast line a different set of rocks are deposited. Sea level changes can be tied to different sedimentation processes that produce different sedimentary facies. These stack on top of each other in geologic time (simplified view) and produce the layer cake view of strata.

Shales aren't well lithified and tend to be slope forming strata (more easily eroded). Dolomite and limestone are more resistant and often are cliff forming strata. Sandstone is often resistant to weathering too. Resistance to weathering depends on sorting (how the size of grains is distributed through the rocks), mineral composition (feldspars easily weather to clays, quartz is resistant to weathering (dominant mineral in sillisiclastic rocks), and calcite weathers easy in the presence of carbonic acid), the actual grain size and geometry of the grains, the nature of bioturbation and other freeze thaw processes that may mechanically separate the rock, pore space and fluid chemistry, and on the nature of the cement of the rock. Lichens also can produce acids that act as chelates that further weather rocks lol. If u want to know more let me know.

Over time I think the force of waves exposing the strata would average out so there won't be certain areas of the structure that were more differentially eroded than others for rocks from the same formation (lithology). If anything there would be pore network differences in the rock and differences in geometries of sedimentary structures that would allow for a preferential erosion of a specific area of the geologic formation. Already weathered areas are more susceptible to further weathering so they may experience increased rates of destruction. How *ero*tic [Dn Briste [Album]](http://imgur.com/a/Qga8P) You rock Headlands that jut outward into an open body of water such as an ocean leave the land formations unprotected against years of wind and wave erosion. As the water smashes up against the headland rock, the erosion process begins. Waves chisel away at the rock and over time a cave is formed. Another factor of the erosion process that forms sea stacks is wind. Both wind and water pound heavily on the rock pieces to crack and weaken the stone.

Waves continue to smash into the cave throughout the years, breaking pieces of rock away slowly. Cracks and weak places are created due to the amount of force with which the waves smash into the cave, especially during storms and swells.

Eventually, the cave will give way and the water will drill its way on through the back of the cave, thus creating an arch over the open section. The arch may survive the destructive forces of the waves and break away to reveal one large stack of rock. This is the sea stack.

 The thing that gets me is why was this piece the one that survived, instead of the piece that used to be right next to it. Stronger rock  These would form starting with a crack in the seacliff, most likely caused by large forces on the overall landscape(probably tectonic or buoyant forces). Then the crack allows a space for erosion to occur in a nonlinear fashion. Then eventually you get peninsulas that collapse into islands like in the picture. Not just stronger rock but more intense wave force gets directed where the sea cave eventually opens up because of the way the wave gets bent around the point . So the part left standing has experienced less intense wave force action.  It's sedimentary my dear, Watson http://i.imgur.com/mxnUml5.jpg In 1336 the Irish went through a mass hysteria regarding the rocks on their island. It has been referenced in several history books as the great sediment tragedy of the 12th century. The Irish threw rocks into the water 24 hours a day for well over a year. More than 90% of the population chipped in, causing a giant rock like structure to appear in the water.  Can confirm Source: am 12th century Irish peasant. Bloody Strongbow. 14th century No.  He is correct.  This was before the Great Century Renumbering of 1434,  when King  Maoilriain ordered 2 centuries to be added because he thought living in the 13th century was unlucky. Hey you're 100% right and I'll acknowledge you, but I won't edit my post. My logic is sound. Can confirm. [Am Strongbow.](http://i.imgur.com/fWo5xpG.jpg) Can confirm, am drunk Uh, Dun Briste (the piece of rock in question) actually separated from the mainland in 1393 according to the Annals of MacFirbis.

That's pretty close, you may actually be a bullshit wizard. /r/explainlikeimcalvin needs you. ^ Seems legit That doesn't sound right but I don't know enough about Ireland to dispute that.  Yo just referenced you for my PhD thesis cause you're legit as fuck bro This is facts. Certain types of rock are more resistant to erosion. An excellent example of this are the rocks found in the Arizona desert. The pillars that you see are the magma tubes from ancient volcanoes that are harder than the surrounding rocks and have thus eroded far more slowly. This may not be the case here but it may be something similar; harder rocks remain while the soft ones wash away.  So I googled that and it shows me Devils Tower. Looking at that, can you imagine what the first person to ever see that thought? Not knowing that nature could make something like that it would look hand carved. Like a giant did it. Wow.  big mouth chickens eat all the land around it This is consistent with what my Kentucky school book says. Magnets Fucking Magnets how do they work Well, about 4,000 years ago people were really bad... Do you mean sedimentation or erosion? or both? Imagine the ocean was a lot higher a long time ago and sediments were deposited over time. Sometimes sand was deposited because it was near the shore, sometimes it was silt because it was in the deep sea. The different layers appear based on different depositional conditions. Eventually all these layers were exposed and eroded away, it ends up isolated because it is cut off from the mainland through erosion. In the thumbnail it looked like a piece of layer cake. &gt; layer cake

That's literally the term we use for nice planar stratigraphy like this. Layer Cake Geology!  I came here for the chocolate cake myself. [/r/misleadingthumbnails](http://www.reddit.com/r/misleadingthumbnails) Anything is a layer cake if you believe hard enough. That's what I thought too. The cake was a lie.  Same here:

Ooh! Is that German Chocolate cake? 

'click'

nope, not cake This is basic sedimentation. Those are sequences of sandstone, shale, and some limestone.  Shales are only deposited in deep oceans while sandstones are deposited near shore.  Limestones are deposited only in shallow marine waters.  You may ask, then why does the sequel switch or repeat? Well, that is due to transgressive and regressive sequences (Basically changes in sea level). The more resistant and white rock is likely limestone while the thinner beds of dark rock that seem more eroded are shale and there is certainly some sandstone in there too.  Every change in lithology (rock type) is representative of a change in sea level, up or down.  These see level changes are generally caused by glaciation events and plate tectonics.  This section may also be affected by isostatic rebound which is when a heavy weight is removed from the land so "floats" up to equilibrium.  The weight in this instance would be a mile thick glacier or ice sheet which is obviously no longer here.  I will gladly answer any questions. How many years are there from grass to ocean? He can probably explain better as I am just starting to hit my upper division GEO classes, but most likely anywhere from hundreds of thousands to millions of years. We've only just touched on large scale glacial / interglacial time periods so this may be wrong, but it seems that they happen (and I believe would provoke behavior that he is talking about) every [~hundred thousand years](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Ice_Age_Temperature.png/480px-Ice_Age_Temperature.png).  This doesn't take into account the plate tectonics aspect of his reply as I haven't covered that extensively currently. The lowest layers date back to [350 million years ago](http://magnumlady.com/tag/downpatrick-head/) when this area had a tropical climate.

[These](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous#Tetrapods) were some of the fuckers crawling around when those lower layers were deposited. To go a bit further, if we were to zoom into the sandstone we would be able to see a general shift in grain sizes as we move vertically up/down the section. Generally, this shift in grain size is also indicative of transgressive/regressive cycles. Are the sand grains coarse? You could be a lot closer to the depositional environment providing sediments into the basin (or the shoreline). Are the sand grains finer? These sediments may have traveled a lot further than the coarse grains and could be indicative of an area more distal from the shoreline. Do you have shale? You could be even more distal in an area starved of sediment... Or you could simply be in a low energy lagoon near the shoreline that would contain the same type of sediment. At this point you'd have to look a bit closer to distinguish the two. Almost 6,000 years of geological history right there!  Glory be PRAISED! Well the world is only 6,000 years old... thatsthejoke.jpg Roughly. Give or take 4.5 billion years. http://i.imgur.com/GhGyKpc.gif Who is this lass and does she happen to work in any sort of film industry?

Azkaban It's disguised so Muggles think it's just a plain old rock. Sea stacks like these are what the Greyjoys built their "Castle" on, with bridges between the Sea stacks (one was on the mainland, from which bridges then ran). You don't know what's [below](http://imgur.com/0lFDFrt) it. Fat stacks, brah Chunk Error Does that mean that all the water used to be that high? How does this happen?  Water was higher and lower at times, and the land itself moves in all directions, including up. :-) A large amount of land in the north is still 'rebounding' from the weight of the ice sheets on it 10,000 years ago.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound Earth is fucking crazy. Remind me to never move there. But it's the least crazy of its neighbors  A very long time ago (Ordovician or Silurian periods) it was under the sea, yes.  But those sediments were uplifted in the mountain-building episode that produced the Appalachian and Caledonide mountains during the closure of the Iapetus and Rheic oceans, long before the Atlantic was there.  The Earth looked [something like this](http://blogs.nobl.k12.in.us/hurstes/files/2014/02/image-281axpi.jpg) at the time.  Ireland was part of Avalonia (ignore the red arrow in that picture).

Once the Atlantic subsequently opened up, the ocean has been eroding into the cliffs and exposing the older rocks along the coast, forming the sea stacks. Probably uplift.  The water wasn't that high, the land is rising.  It happens a lot more and in shorter periods than you'd think (but still on a geological timescale, you usually don't see land suddenly jut out of the water like in Japan this past week). Wait, what happened in Japan? http://dutchsinse.com/4252015-land-rising-out-of-the-sea-in-hokkaido-japan-rose-300-meters-near-1000-feet-overnight/ http://dutchsinse.com/4252015-land-rising-out-of-the-sea-in-hokkaido-japan-rose-300-meters-near-1000-feet-overnight/ I hope I'm not the only one who wants to build a cottage on top of that [Buseyary Sleestak in Garyland.](https://coedmagazine.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/gary_busey_creepin.gif) Former Geology TA here - couldn't lecture about sea stacks without accidentally saying 'Sea Snacks'. Woooow! It looks like you could fit a whole Zelda dungeon in that thing! Things like this are probably one reason why modern geology started off in that area (late 1700s/James Hutton), at first to try and prove the Biblical Flood record, but eventually the conflicting data found couldn't be ignored, as it showed magnitudes of difference in age. It was a tough choice, tossing out a long accepted book's history for some painfully obvious hard data. Sadly, the modern Creationist viewpoint is actually a 20th century regression thing, blatantly ignoring all that great science. Can we make sure that Askaban isn't in there? Ultimate hotel location? I think so. I thought it was a piece of multi-layered chocolate cake at first glance.  Thumbnail looks like cake I'm experiencing a massive OCD induced rush of endorphin right now..

..so satisfying  You silly muggle, you found Azkaban and don't even know it. the thumbnail looks like a slice of chocolate cake /r/GeologyPorn  I want to live on that rock.

I wanted to swipe that thing. Dat first layer...damn. All of earths history in one picture Looks like the wall in time bandits  Mmm, Sedimentary Sandwich.  
Mayo or maybe some spicy lava to go with? After a few sedimentology classes, seeing that makes my heart flutter    Dat erosion!  I didn't know Ireland was an ocean. I thought this was multi-layer chocolate cake from the thumbnail :/ Seeing something like this makes me want to go rock climbing.  Cake island.   Looking at that rock formation is so stratisfying  Looking at the layers, you see a variety of deposits over the years. Some appears a blonde colour, probably beach sand. Then there are the blacks, perhaps volcanic, or fossilized wood, like coal, then there's white, possibly chalk. Is there anyone who could analyse this cross section of thousands of years of deposits? the darker colors are usually indicators of deep and/or stagnant water, the grays/greens are shallow or moving waters, and the reds/browns are extremely dry. 

Halfway through there does look to be a layer with decent amounts of volcanic ash mixed in, but it's hard to tell. 

The bottom layers are millions of years old, it's amazing and quite hard to comprehend to know you're looking at something so old.  There's absolutely no way to tell from this distance whether there is a volcanic input to the stack. That being said, it's a shallow - deep ocean sequence so it seems highly unlikely that it would have a sub-aerial volcanic component (ash; from the air) in the middle of a sub-aqueous sequence (underwater). Ash could of been laid there in the shallow period, but as I said, it's hard to tell and I was going off the chalkish appearance.  Thanks. Yes it's really very interesting. It's also thought provoking to see how careless nature is toward these historic relics, just slowly destroying them, and recreating a new layer, somewhere else. This rocks. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

That looks super old. Does each layer means like a decade or a century? Probably more than that. Would need a geologist to tell.

EDIT 2: Noted that link was added. I *knew* Archimedes was fucking Illuminati. but why male models? Seriously? I just told you! Inception bwaaaaahonnn Plugged lakes can't melt ice caps. That may may is dank.  No no no.  My Grandfather showed me long ago that he is the one that created the oceans.  I watched him pee off a boat and into the water.  He said he has done this more times than he can count and that it created the oceans over time. Seemed legit to 5 year old me. Wait a second, My grandfather told ME the same thing. One of them has to be lying. Maybe they crossed the streams? How did you know that our grandparents were Ghostbusters? Maybe y'all are the same person? Split Reddit Accountability Disorder? Maybe the grandkids are cousins. There are 4 oceans so Obviously there was 2 other grandfathers also making oceans. cousins?
 It literally *is* one way the ocean fills up. Yep! It also acts like a fail-safe valve, since obviously the ocean could never fill about that lake. So at most we only ever have to worry about ~20 feet of rising ocean level. It would be a lot, but still manageable. Anyway, god had this particular lake installed after the flood, as part of his covenant with Noah. Some people therefore believe that this lake is the source of all rainbows, but of course that's just silly. ohhhhhhhh [Island in a lake in an island in a lake...](http://www.earthlymission.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vulcan-point-island-2.png) Pretty sure that's a Total Annihilation map It's in the [Philippines](http://www.viralnova.com/vulcan-point/)
