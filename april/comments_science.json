I strongly believe that there is a way to help the lower functioning Autistics and i felt we have wasted a lot of time on this issue. \n\nImagine feeling that you genuinely don't belong on this planet, you can't relate to any of the humans on it, and they refuse to help you understand yourself. It sucks. \n\n**Response to threaded questions:**\n\nMale aged 26, Born in the United States. Due to a troubled childhood i only received what the hospital gave me at birth and what was required by the State of Wyoming. I never received follow up vaccinations or boosters until the age of 19 where i was required to get Tuberculoses Shots and a few others for leaving the country. My vaccinations in short, are terribly outdated. As a Graduate student of Microbiology i would encourage everyone to get their children vaccinated. \n\nAs for those curious to the condition i would be happy to elaborate. As i was also a victim of child abuse and unfortunate circumstance, my experience will differ than that of a loving family. (Separation of Autism and PTSD) I must however express my distaste of most Autistic/Aspergers communities as they focus primarily on the family of those with the condition, and often misunderstand my people and focus on us as a second interest. \n\n\nIn short its a battle of self awareness and something about those of us you call \"higher\" functioning is the key here, something in us is different than our lower functioning kind. I don't know what it is but its been too long that we have wasted recourses bickering about ways to eradicate my species and prevent our existence. I think its time we put forth effort into understanding and helping those who need help. Its hard to live in this world for anybody, we try but i don't know if we belong here. Many of us if given the chance and correct environment could contribute to humanity in great ways, but often we are left to waste away in overloaded and uncontrolled states of what is debatably \"consciousness\". \n\nFor parents. A few basic milestone dates may be of interest to you. \n\n- Vocal at age 4. No prior attempts at language. Dissociated conversations. No baby talk. Started reading at 5 with high level of comprehension which helped me become very articulate for my age. Mispronunciations of certain words persist to this day but its a limited list which i work on. By age 9 i could hide any difficulties. Age 14 began studying undergraduate texts. \n\n- Coordination inapt. Walking was difficult as i can recall with precision to the age of 3. I could walk at age 3, however i couldn't mimic humans well enough. Walked much like a penguin until age of 7. I have several issues with my right leg due to not walking properly but i train in submission grappling and play several instruments. \n\n- I understood that humans were living conscious entities much like myself at age 14. It was quite an experience. Before that its hard to explain what i thought people were, i just felt that i was the only one alive. It could be an enhanced awareness of my developing brain that allowed me to be conscious of the changes. I would however think that children normaly become aware of this much sooner. Before that humans were apart of the pattern, i made calculations about future events and responded to them in a manner that my goals could be achieved. \n\n- My mind is never off. I currently use Cannabis to elevate this and can elaborate on request. I can recall the times faintly before i awoke. Its hard to explain. Its a deep pit of chaos from sensory stimulation and over anxiety to the point of non communication. In that place we are not human. My mind glitches when i try to remember what it was like and how i came out of it. This is often referred to as being \"overloaded\". I get overloaded from time to time and i have identified causes and created systems to avoid it. It must be said that another state exists that to me was the great dark, i feel that many lower functioning Autists are trapped in this place. Its pure hell. I have often wondered if a loving home can fix the dark, as i was forced to learn mimicry in order to survive. In that place its hard to achieve consciousness, its as if you are trapped in a tempest with only moments to realize you exist only to pulled back under into the obscurity of thoughts and calculation. I have seen it in the eyes of children with autism and you can see it in earlier photographs of myself. Its a battle of regression and progression and circular thought.  \n\n- I stopped yelping at high frequency noises at the age of 12\n\n- I stopped snapping my teeth together at age 14 but did so again from 17-19. (I have a canine bite)\n\n- I stopped clawing my arms and legs at age 9\n\n- I stopped hearing radio voices also at age 9\n\n- When i first received prescription eyeware at 14 i went into a deep depression. The world was too much and i often refused to wear them. I now wear them while awake and can carry on normal activities. \n\n- My chameleon effect is mostly automatic now whereas in my childhood it took great personal perseverance and couscous effort to maintain the facade. A side effect is however i always wear a mask and i do not know what is underneath. Underneath is the great dark and i refuse to venture there. (This is how we mimic humans).\n\n- Showing empathy is still hard for me to do. I started smiling Naturally (or it became an automatic process) at age 14 with great practice with a mirror. I can understand how others feel by observing the micro expressions in their face or subtle fluctuations in the voice but its problematic because most humans are not aware they are doing it which leads to conversations they are not ready for because they don't realize their own emotions. I am married which has put this to test. \n\n- I am extremely loyal to the few i keep close. Its always been that way. \n\n- I must be in control of the schedule and am most comfortable with planned activities. If its short notice or if a sudden change happens or if someone new becomes apart of it, i tend to overload.  Communication is key for any autist. \n\n- Sleep and anorexia: I managed to sleep a full 8 hours a day at age 18, i overcame anorexia during ages 18-21.\nSleep is very difficult. I sleep at 65 degrees and utilize a system of fans and ice packs to achieve this year around. I can't currently afford a weighted adult blanket so i use several thick blankets and my lovely wife holds me. I have found that pressure at the shoulders and feet/legs is the best. The fan is mostly to create a white noise so that the pattern of stimulation is constant and i can achieve sleep. I have found that stability of senses while sleeping is the best approach. \n\n- Becoming stuck in circular thought for hours is very common to this day, in comparison to the days spent in endless repeats as a child. \n\n- Bright lights no longer turn my brain off. \n\n- Info dumping is very common. I use learning as a coping tool and must teach myself something fairly constantly throughout the day. \n \n- Never the eyes. Its too much. I can force it now but it will **NEVER**  be natural to me. \n\nHere is an excerpt of my answer to ~~a previous~~  many questions about the eyes:\n&gt; Well to me eyes speak. They deliver concentrated information that is unbearable. The countless computations that glitch my mind when i look into someone's eyes makes me tremble is if at a great height. A high pitch that you can ignore deafens my mind with its intensity. I feel as if i can fall over with the weight of it. Eyes are windows to a person, i don't understand humans and there is too much unknown information being relayed and processed. Even now just thinking about it my brain starts to form circles. The intensity of emotion that is portrayed is too much at once for my mind to keep up with the chameleon. If i look into eyes my mask melts and i can't remain functional. \n\nHere is an excerpt of my answer to questions regarding the thought cycles:\n&gt;It took years of self observation to even realize the loops existed, as a part of a theory i had on why i annoyed people. I eventually learned with great effort to stop it for the first time 3 years ago. I struggle with this daily and i've never mastered control but i can say that i am now aware that it exists. A large contributor to the cycles is my analytical nature founded on early independence. I was forced to observe and understand humans so that i wouldn't die. Because of this i repeat every permutation of possibility that i can imagine to calculate the best decision for me to make. Sometimes there is no clear answer, or several viable options and so the cycle repeats, over and over with the same results. At times its simply too much possibility for me to handle and so in ignorance my mind repeats previous conclusions.\n\nHere is an excerpt of my answer regarding questions of  self identity:\n&gt; I have no self. The self that i think i am is merely a construct of the various masks coming together. Much like how people act differently in varying situations i too change from place to place but its not superficial. There is a being under all of it that controls and maintains a line of structure but i can't express that being, i can only express the manifestations it creates to exist in a stable format. That lack of self expression is what makes me endlessly lost. I am not who i am.\n\nTo elaborate on my understanding of humans as living entities: See my reply to this comment. (maxed characters)\n\n**Due to character limits on this comment, i have started another threaded to this to continue elaboration of subjects at request.** \n [Link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/33czht/study_of_95000_children_finds_no_link_between_mmr/cql7xtk)", "gilded": 3, "score": 1121, "created": 1429641894.0},{"body": "Thank you so much for sharing this.

I would also argue that the hypothetical posed by Felix (formation of life being a common occurrence in the right conditions) is unlikely and not an assumption we should make if you want an honest scientific discussion. \n\nFirst, the conditions that spawned the origin of life do not exist anymore on this planet. It has been a very long time since the existence of the common ancestor that all life on Earth shares. It has been observed that this life-form existed at least 3.5 billion years ago, as we have found [stromatolites](http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/origsoflife_02) indicating a relative timeline of microbial life. Regarding the atmosphere at the time, if I can quote [Dannel Yeo and Thomas Drage](http://draget.net/hoe/index.php?p=p3), about whom I know nothing, \n\n&gt;\"[a]t 4.0 billion [years ago] H2O, CO2, and nitrogen (N) were the dominant chemicals. Cooling of the atmosphere causes precipitation and the development of the oceans. By 3.0 billion CO2, H2O, N2 are the dominant chemicals. O2 begins to accumulate.\" \n\nToday, the atmosphere is ~78% Nitrogen and ~20% oxygen, with plenty of other gases filling the remaining 2%. Although life has thrived alongside the development of the Oxygen in our atmosphere, we have not seen any evidence that it would be helpful in spawning brand new forms of microbial life.\n\nMy second point would be that new life may still 'occasionally' spawn on Earth, however, we are dealing with a very sparse set of events on a large-scale timeline, and these occasions would be unlikely to occur during humanity's reign, and even less so during our era of understanding. Add on to that the the most likely places for this to occur could very well be at the bottom of the oceans, a place that we are still unable to adequately observe, and it starts to seem very unlikely that we would notice a new Domain* of life unless it were to thrive for millenia alongside us. Of course, it is also possible that this process has been occurring in the background, and we may be on the verge of making such a significant observation.

An example of surface weathering chemistry is formation of iron oxides (rust):\n\n&gt;Oxygen is also cycled between the biosphere and lithosphere. Marine organisms in the biosphere create calcium carbonate shell material (CaCO3) that is rich in oxygen. When the organism dies, its shell is deposited on the shallow sea floor and buried over time to create the limestone sedimentary rock of the lithosphere. Weathering processes initiated by organisms can also free oxygen from the lithosphere.

Developed on a world with very bright localized star/moon configurations. That combined with their genetic \"slouch\" and a socially ingrained reflex to not look up (for fear of the mighty Targoon-Sah who lived slightly higher than the sky and visited a genital pox lasting no less than 3 years upon anyone looking up and meeting his gaze) kept them from ever caring about anything outside their planets surface.  \n It wasn't until they had developed quantum teleportation to get from the dry arid wastes of the shahaad desert, to the persistantly monsoon plagued burnatta zone, (essentially using the two for eco-friendly washing and drying) that they thought,.. \"Hey, we could hop BEHIND the head of Targoon-Sah, thus avoiding his gaze and the ensuing embarrassment that has plagued us all at one time or another!\" (The genital pox of the Amgdravinians was distinctive in it's regular erruptions of a purple fog that smelled vaguely of earth cabbage)   \n\n20 Amgdravinians died before they thought to send a camera, 20 more (trying to retrieve the camera) before they thought to send a torgle flea, 20 more trying to retrieve the torgle flea, and finally one Amgdravinian decided to build a box with a shuttered window on it. (For surely all the others had appeared, Targoon-Sah had turned his gaze on them, and from that distance, the punishment would surely be a million genital poxi and would thusly result in death). The shuttered window would allow enough time to see Targoon-Sah, and close it quickly before he could swing his gaze to the pod, then a return trip and report could be made. Luckily  Amgdravinian construction techniques were quite advanced. They had been working with Amgdra sub-nanotube construction for some time and nearly everything was built with this material. In essence the pod was a *mostly* air tight indestructible shell. The *mostly* was more than \"none at all\" and so this particular Amgdravinian had enough time to make a return trip to tell of experience of appearing, Targoon-Sah making him feel light as a torgle flea hatchling, and then violently trying to suck the air from his room.   \n\nThus space being, and additionally being a vacuum was discovered but wasn't interpreted as such. The Amgdravinians discussed it for some time and finally decided that considering their near immortal lifespans, 60 Amgdravinians dead was 59 too many (No one liked Pretesh the umbrella vendor) and they simply gave up trying to get one over on ol Targoon-Sah. Any radio transmissions they received after this were simply interpreted as Targoon-Sah trying to lure them back to to his domain to steal the breath from their lungs which it was decided was like candy to him.   \n\nIn apology for their transgressions a monthly hunting party would risk further wrath looking up long enough to capture several of the highbeters (basically giant floating air filled jellyfish) to teleport into space for Targoon-Sah to suck the breath from. While this pleased the Amgdravinians and greatly confused the highbeters, it also had the unfortunate side effect of thinning the highbeter populations. As a communal creature their newfound confusion, decreased numbers and the occasional feeling that somewhere far away someone was doing very un-natural things to them, eventually caused their extinction. As the highbeters were one of the keystone species that maintained the atmospheric cycle, their abrupt absence caused global warming to occur. (Not like Earth global warming which any child knows can manifest in many things other than actual temperature increase, but rather a literal and drastic rising of temperatures planetwide.)\n   \nWithin 30 years all the Amgdravinians were either dead or dying. Towards the end they no longer gave two squirts of purple fog what Tagoon-Sah had to say anymore so they frequently donned several layers of their best reflecto-glass, and stared out into the sky. Had all life not been eradicated within the several months that followed, it is assured that they would have looked for ways to teleport to their moons, and eventually to other worlds that they would have identified as habitable for Amgdravinians.

For a long time, a skull similar to that of Camarasaurus was incorrectly set at the end of Apatosaurus/Brontosaurus. This was mainly because the skull is generally the first thing to detach and and get destroyed after a vertebrate dies, so you usually don't find big skeletons with skulls attached. Generally you can tell the difference by the more elongated skulls of Apatosaurus which contrast the more bull-dog like Camarasaurus. However, this actually doesn't bear directly on the controversy around the name of the animal.\n\nThe Apato/Bonto naming thing actually stems from an unfortunate (but now relatively obsolete) convention in the practice of naming animals. Historically, the first person to name an animal generally got \"priority\". So even if Joe Schmoe discovered a crappy fossil in his back yard and published it in a journal no one has heard of, his name would still be the preferred one, even if later someone gave a much more comprehensive discussion of the same animal (being unaware of Joe Schmoe) and provided a different name that was widely accepted.\n\nThis has been particularly troublesome with dinosuars, and something exactly like his happend with Apato/Brontosaurus. The discovery of apatosaurus was based on a really crummy fossil published in an obscure journal that no one read (in fact, the name, meaning \"deceptive lizard\" ~~refers to the poor quality of the type specimen~~[my bad, /u/LoyalGarlic is right on that one]). On the other hand Brontosaurus was a truly magnificent find, one of the largest dinosaurs ever discovered at the time, and remarkably well preserved. It made a splash and people latched on to it.\n\nIt was only later that someone discovered that it was actually the same thing as Apatosaurus and given the rule of priority, they deferred to Apatosaurus.\n\nFortunately the rule of \"priority\" is much less strict now, and an exception would probably have been made in the case of Brontosaurus.

Now Tyrannosaurus rex was originally conceived as two genera, the other being Dynamosaurus imperiosis.  Only because Barnum Brown happened to use the name T. rex earlier in his paper than D. imperiosis did that name become standard.  Now it appeared that M. gigas was the real official name of T. rex, and that Tyrannosaurus would go the way of Brontosaurus (until today apparently).\n\nSo the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature had to do something, because they'd already killed Brontosaurus, there would be riots in the street if T. rex was announced invalid as well.  So they made up some new rules that allowed for an exception.  The rules were that a name that had been accepted as official for 100 years, and had been referenced 25 in peer reviewed papers by 10 different authors, would be considered valid over the original name.\n\nAnd thus did Tyrannosaurus rex narrowly avoid being renamed Manospondylus gigas, which to be fair isn't a terrible name.

But they absolutely could be, and the argument has been made, since the *Tianyulong* discovery bridged some of the cerotopsian/theropod gap. \n\nIt's worth noting that theropods basal to coelurosaurs, namely *Sciurumimus* described in 2012, also has evidence of fuzziness, bridging the gap a bit as well.\n\nAnyway, if we find fossils from earlier strata with preserved filamentous integument that bridges the ornithischian/saurischian gap further, then it's likely sauropods are either secondarily featherless or preserved something similar that have not been preserved in specimens using phylogenetic bracketing.\n\n\nIndeed, it we ever find such evidence, it will support the hypothesis that proto-feather-like filamentous structures are basal to all dinosaurs. And if that's ever the case, I think we'll start seeing musings of feather like structures being basal to all avemetarsalia (that's everything more closely related to birds than crocodiles, including pterosaurs), since it's clear that pterosaurs had a filamentous fuzz called pycnofibers, covering their bodies.

The answer lays in how the Communist Party of China manufactures its legitimacy as the ruling party of China. \n\nDuring Mao Zedong's time, the CCP earned its \"legitimacy\" by defeating [\"the reactionary Kuomintang government backed by U.S. imperialism\"](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-5/mswv5_01.htm) as Mao himself put it in the opening of his \"New China\" speech on September 21, 1949.\n\n[After a series of devastatingly foolish and destructive campaigns by Mao,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_campaigns_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China) the CCP had a severely tarnished image in the eyes of the Chinese people. Left with a desolated economy, [Deng Xiaoping decided on advancing economic reform as China's savior,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform) claiming, \"let some get rich first.\" \n\nOver the past 30 years, China has flourished and the CCP has taken all the credit for China's successes. However, much hasn't changed politically during Mao's time, as the CCP has built itself on a singular idea: the CCP is the savior of the Chinese people against foreign aggression during Mao's time and the CCP is the savior of the Chinese people against poverty under the economic reform period. \n\nGDP growth and the CCP are so inextricably linked at present, that any change in the economic status of China might spell the demise of the Communist Party through \"social instability\" (rioting and demands from the populace). Why does the CCP care so much about being in power? Because the rampant corruption in the system in China ensures that [being in power is extremely lucrative.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-01/chinese-families-pay-16-000-for-kids-to-pass-army-entrance-exam)\n\nEnergy is the supplying force behind the entire socio-economic-political apparatus in China.

I feel like they're obvious enough points that the authors couldn't've failed to notice it, but I don't see them addressed in the key section, [\"Ingredients Preparation\"](http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/9/e43.full#sec-2):\n\n&gt; Mackerel and squid were selected as sushi material, as both are known to possess Anisakis and are used frequently for sushi. One week prior to the experiment, both mackerel and squid were purchased at a market in Osaka prefecture, and they were frozen in a freezer at \u221240\u00b0C. Two days prior to the experiment, the same mackerel and squid were purchased at the same market and were kept in a usual refrigerator. The frozen fish were moved to the refrigerator on the night before the experiment and were defrosted there overnight. For mackerel, Masaba, the vernacular name for Scomber japonicas, caught at Wakayama prefecture was selected. For squid, Kensaki-ika, the vernacular name for Photololigo edulis, caught at Tottori prefecture was selected. The species and the site of the fisheries were identical for both the frozen and unfrozen ingredients. On the morning of the experiment, 2 sushi chefs cut mackerel and squid into sushi-sized pieces. They also cooked sushi rice (brand name, Koshi Hikari, made in Ishikawa prefecture), and the same rice was used for every piece of sushi for the experiment. \n\nTwo red flags here:\n\n1. If they merely bought all the ingredients from the same market, how do they know for certain that the ingredients hadn't *already* been frozen and defrosted at some point in the supply chain? Obviously, if they had, then they are not measuring the taste difference between frozen and unfrozen, but frozen once &amp; frozen twice. They don't mention verifying the non-frozenness all the way back to the original fishing boat, or any verification; it sounds as if they simply assume there is no freezing, which may or may not be reasonable, but is something that should be checked as it is plausible and completely destroys the study if they're unlucky.\n2. The methodology doesn't live up to the billing as a blind randomized experiment. If they bought on different occasions, then they're *comparing entirely different catches*, aren't they? They're comparing catch A (which was frozen) with catch B (which was fresh), not the frozen half of catch A with the unfrozen half of catch A.\n\n    This is being advertised as a randomized trial, but doing it this way destroys the randomization! The difference between groups is now not due solely to the intervention, but reflects the day to day variation in tastiness of catch as well as any causal effect of freezing; perhaps the batch that got frozen was from a good catch, and the fresh batch was a worser batch, and that's why no difference appears to show up.\n\n   (It would be like trying out a new drug on the patients sitting in your clinic at the moment, then waiting a year and trying placebo on the current batch of patients; comparing the two groups of patients' outcomes may be relevant info since they have the same diagnoses and come from the same neighborhood, but it would definitely not constitute a randomized trial because your patient groups will systematically change over time and this confounds the comparison...)\n\n    It would have made more sense to buy one big batch, freeze half of it, immediately defrost it, and eat it. (Waiting a few hours/weeks doesn't add much, since all chemical reactions slow down considerably at \u221240\u00b0C and most of the damage in freezing/thawing is done immediately; if you freeze fish badly and ice crystals shred it, then the fish is bad the minute it hits the icebox, it doesn't take another day to suddenly go bad.)\n\n&gt; Individuals who eat sushi more than once a week were also excluded from the trial, as they were judged to be gourmets, beyond the average Japanese palate.\n\nThis also isn't helpful... If you're trying to make the case for *mandatory* freezing for *everyone*, restricting your sample to ordinary eaters is irrelevant since they probably wouldn't notice in the first place and it's the gourmets who will suffer. Such a range restriction also reduces the sensitivity of the study further; if you showed gourmets don't notice then it follows that average sushi eaters won't notice either, but if you show average sushi eaters (probably) don't notice then you still don't know whether the gourmets will notice.

But after my first round, I called my doctor in a mild panic, demanding a neuro consult and afraid that it had spread to my brain, because I was not just distracted, I was genuinely confused and having trouble with complex tasks that I used to breeze through. He gave me my consult, although he suspected it was just chemo brain, and he was right. I was still on short term disability at that point, and I began to genuinely fear that I was losing my ability to do my job. My last job with the company was a promotion based on self taught coding skills that involved me producing very complex reports that could basically boil things down to the level that a 6 year old could read them, so naturally they wanted me to produce these reports for the senior leadership. It was extremely stressful too, because I got the job for work I had done and taught myself, their demands quickly blossomed into much more complex stuff, and I felt like a teacher who was only one page ahead of the students in the textbook for the longest time. But now I was genuinely panicked because I did not think I could recreate it any more. I called my boss, and begged him to save my code on a drive somewhere, or to not turn in my laptop (too late), or to burn it onto a CD for me. After all, this was my resume now, if I chose to stay in that field of work, and I did not get my old job back. He did not do any of the things I asked, and I have not been able to return to work yet, and it has been 5 years. Many people do not understand my fear of this, because they assume that since I created it once, I can do it again. But much of it was complex stuff that I created, and I had a set of basic templates that could be adjusted to apply to so many different things. That is where you get true efficiency in a job like that. It is chunks of code that you save and build on and nurse into powerful stuff over months or years, plus one-off oddball things you may only need once in a blue moon, but when you need them, there is no easy substitute. Well, the asshole did nothing to save it for me, not even keeping it on a server somewhere for me if it violated company rules for me to have my own copy of it. If he had just done that, I could at least use it again in a different position in the company, if/when I return to work. Now I have nightmares about returning to work, and just staring at a screen unable to do anything. I tried to recreate some of it, but it felt like it was gone.
