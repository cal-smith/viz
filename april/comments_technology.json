It's much harder to point to something like Citizen's United which, having the benefit of a politically coercive name, deals with something you can't touch and isn't tangible. Sure, it's easy to pick up a dollar bill but when you think about money what you're really thinking about is the principle behind money, which is trust. If you were to ask someone on the street which one seems worse, free flow of money or internment/Jim Crow laws you'd most likely get the response claiming internment or Jim crow laws is worse. \n\nThis is why Citizen's United is probably the worst case ruling in US history. It's insidious and masks the manipulation and corruption it enables with the thinker's imagination of being in the position of the CEO who could use Citizen's United to further their own subjective social morays. \n\nWhich is why things like Jim Crow laws and forcible oppression never last. It's easy to rally behind causes that aim to degrade those kinds of practices. The most insidious form of oppression is convincing someone that a specific policy or idea is in their best interest when it's actually not. That's politics and you can always pick out the clever politicians by looking at how they word their proposed legislation - usually this comes in forms of legislation developed by think tanks who employ psychologists, behaviorists, and lawyers. Mind, language, and behavior. \n\nOn a tangent; I have a personal belief this is why philosophy has been so demonized and pointed to as irrelevant. At its heart the science of philosophy is a search for wisdom which translates into the search for understanding. You can further extrapolate that along with understanding comes the ability to critically reason. So when you hear someone say \"philosophy is irrelevant\" what they're really saying is \"critical reason is irrelevant\". The only reason someone would claim critical reason is irrelevant is if they fear not being able to manipulate others. \n\nSorry about the wall of text :/ \n\ntl;dr money is hard to argue against but physical oppression isn't due to human empathy. \n(Full disclosure: I am a senior in undergrad in philosophy)", "gilded": 0, "score": 8, "created": 1428582293.0},{"body": "And Australia is just starting one.

Corey Doctorow explained it really well in his book Little Brother:\n\n&gt;If you ever decide to do something as stupid as build an automatic terrorism detector, here's a math lesson you need to learn first. It's called \"the paradox of the false positive,\" and it's a doozy.\n\n&gt;Say you have a new disease, called Super-AIDS. Only one in a million people gets Super-AIDS. You develop a test for Super-AIDS that's 99 percent accurate. I mean, 99 percent of the time, it gives the correct result -- true if the subject is infected, and false if the subject is healthy. You give the test to a million people.\n\n&gt;One in a million people have Super-AIDS. One in a hundred people that you test will generate a \"false positive\" -- the test will say he has Super-AIDS even though he doesn't. That's what \"99 percent accurate\" means: one percent wrong. What's one percent of one million? 1,000,000/100 = 10,000 One in a million people has Super-AIDS. If you test a million random people, you'll probably only find one case of real Super-AIDS. But your test won't identify one person as having Super-AIDS. It will identify 10,000 people as having it. ***Your 99 percent accurate test will perform with 99.99 percent inaccuracy.***\n\n&gt;That's the paradox of the false positive. When you try to find something really rare, your test's accuracy has to match the rarity of the thing you're looking for. If you're trying to point at a single pixel on your screen, a sharp pencil is a good pointer: the pencil-tip is a lot smaller (more accurate) than the pixels. But a pencil-tip is no good at pointing at a single atom in your screen. For that, you need a pointer -- a test -- that's one atom wide or less at the tip.\n\n&gt;**Here is an application to terrorism:**\n\n&gt;Terrorists are really rare. In a city of twenty million like New York, there might be one or two terrorists, maybe up to ten. 10/20,000,000 = 0.00005 percent, one twenty-thousandth of a percent. That's pretty rare. Now, say you have software that can sift through all the bank-records, or toll-pass records, or public transit records, or phone-call records in the city and catch terrorists 99 percent of the time. In a pool of twenty million people, a 99 percent accurate test will identify two hundred thousand people as being terrorists.

I am in a neighbourhood of various Islamic ethnics. Thus if any one of them has a cousin or whatnot who turns up to be up to no good, I will be on more than one node of their network of contacts. Do I then get no-fly'd?\n\nTo me this is all old school policework. You watch for the most blatant of crimes and wait for people to rat out their buddies. But when you do get a good lead, you follow it. This might involve wiretaps, searches, and whatnot but if the lead is good any judge will give his blessing. But if it is just a fishing expedition then the lead must suck and this is just bad policework.\n\nSo what these crazy laws and violations are all about is bad policework. A great example would be prisons. Generally all their communications are 100% available for monitoring. This is a high concentration of a small group of criminals. Yet all kinds of communications result in all kinds of crimes involving the prison and things outside the prison. \n\nSo if the police can't even stop the criminals when they have no privacy, no real rights, and have been concentrated into a very restrictive location and environment; what hope in hell do they have when none of these conditions aren't available? Even if they are able to completely eliminate our privacy to the point where they are allowed to randomly search our homes the example of prison shows that this will not stop terrorism any more than it stops prison crimes.\n\nMy personal paranoid view of why they want these laws is not to prevent terrorism in the first place but to go after people who pose a threat to the status quo. Today's Martin Luther Kings. People who propose reforming Wall Street. Politicians who propose reforming the NSA. These are the threats that they want to go after. I think that most of them know that a few guys plotting mayhem in some desert somewhere are basically way outside their ability to thwart unless they are given explicit directions as to who and where which basically means that traditional techniques are closing in anyway. \n", "gilded": 0, "score": 2, "created": 1428543521.0},{"body": "IP-Address just says where something was happening, not who was actually doing it.\n\nIf my car was part of a crime, but they only had my license plate that doesn't prove I was driving the car at the time.", "gilded": 0, "score": 2469, "created": 1428697269.0},{"body": "Lawyer in Florida argued that in court over the cameras that ticket you via mail when you run a red light.

Obviously fiber has a bit more overhead associated with it, since you don't need a clean room/van and specialized technicians to install copper coax . . .\n\nFiber can be, and normally is, cheaper than copper for outdoor and regional network backbone (see bottom). People don't know that. Depending on [how many fiber strands, signal wavelength, singlemode vs multimode, and what kind of reinforcement you want](http://www.siemon.com/us/white_papers/13-07-08-light-it-up.asp) it can be cheaper than copper. [Overall costs will vary](http://www.ecmag.com/section/miscellaneous/copper-cabling-really-cheaper-fiber-optic-cabling) depending on if you're [replacing cable/upgrading](http://www.belden.com/pdfs/techpprs/10gbase_t2.pdf), [creating](http://www.cablinginstall.com/articles/print/volume-10/issue-5/contents/optical-fiber/horizontal-cabling-costs-fiber-vs-copper-calculations.html), or [extending a network](http://www.cablinginstall.com/articles/print/volume-11/issue-10/contents/design/media-converters-continue-to-extend-budgetsnetworks.html).\n\n\n/u/Titty_Sprinkle is right about *regional costs and installation*. Some [smaller studies](http://www.ctcnet.us/CTCCostsForAnchorInstitutions.pdf) show that costs indeed vary depending on existing structure, region, and municipalities. See what was researched on [Verizon FIOS](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Terrence_Mcgarty/publication/237378204_Fiber_to_the_Home_Capital_Costs_and_the_Viability_of_Verizon%27s_FIOS/links/53f767130cf2823e5bd6e610.pdf) from another company focusing on the New England area. Also check out [Texas A&amp;M](http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/files/grantees/texasam_infrastructure_application_revision_6-14-10.pdf). It's not cheap to install in mountainous areas nor creating in-ground conduits (vs telephone poles). [Termination hardware is much more expensive and requires more training](http://www.cablinginstall.com/articles/print/volume-19/issue-1/features/trends-in-fiber-optic-cabling-termination-styles.html). I can terminate a jack in under a minute on a good day and an RJ-45 costs less than a quarter, if even that. Tools are much more simplistic, repairs are cheaper, and fixing mistakes is quick with little impact to connection performance.\n\nNow, home-to-home installation/drops. Fiber-to-home is, unfortunately, expensive as said. Copper is cheaper by a long shot. On top of that, your home network is copper ethernet anyways. It makes more sense to use that in order to cut out the cost of another media converter. People who want fiber dropped right to their home don't understand how damned expensive it is: the shorter the fiber run, the more expensive it becomes. Installation costs (&gt;$169) are justified given the materials, labor, and splicing required.\n\n_____\n_____\n_____\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Fiber, by foot, is cheaper by the mile because:\n * It takes less space to match the bandwidth of copper\n * Fewer signal repeaters required overall\n * Fewer cables to pull results in less labor\n * Datacenter-to-datacenter can be \"future-proofed\" with extra strands (still low-cost)\n\n* Fiber can be cheaper when:\n * Upgrading equipment\n     * SFP (small-form factor pluggable modules)\n     * Increased bandwidth, no extra cable\n * Installing a new datacenter\n     * Relatively fewer equipment = less heat, less cooling systems\n * Space between distribution closets (i.e. equipment divided between floors in the same building) is small\n * Cable volume could cause EMI problems for copper\n\n* Fiber is more expensive when:\n * Terminating connections\n     * Training employees\n     * Buying termination and testing equipment\n * Pulling over short distances (esp. less than 1000 ft)\n * Replacing an existing infrastructure \n * Replacing damaged cable\n\n\n* The ugly truth about fiber:\n  * To-home connections are unfeasible\n  * Current copper networks can increase bandwidth equal to that of fiber (ex. 10 Gbps)\n  * LIUs/Fiber termination racks have varying jack types; copper (ethernet) is standard across all modern implementations\n  * Homeowners don't really need 1 Gbps^+ connections, meaning that current copper infrastructure can remain with small upgrades\n  * Home-visit repairs would increase in cost due to the rise of training technicians (i.e. pay raises)\n \n\n_____\n_____\n_____ \n\n_____\n\n**HARDWARE**\n\nIt's a nightmare.

Modern tractors have impressive functionality that is tied to things like sensors in their fertilization tanks and GPS for example. Tractors now are capable of metering out precise doses of material at specific points in a field. A farmer can just about write a script, install it, run it and sit back and watch movies on the in-cab theater system while the tractor does ALL of the work.  \n   \nThe software/hardware mixture allows a farmer to save a lot of money on materials when he couples the modern tractor with his experience in reading the earth and his crops, and a few fairly cheap soil samples.

Having said that though, and granting that John Deer sure does look very piggish in their efforts to \"keep\" their software, the real bad guy is the Copyright Office that will/could/probably will allow them to do it legally.

The specific section that is causing this insanity is 17 U.S. Code \u00a7 1201 or simply Section 1201 of the DMCA. The initial reasoning behind this section was to create civil and criminal penalties for the circumvention of DRM. \n\nMedia companies such as film companies wanted to make it illegal to circumvent the encryption on DVD's to limit the ability for pirates to access the files. What makes this inadequate is that these encryption schemes can be broken in a matter of days after release and all it takes is one copy leaking for it to make it to pirating sites. The rationale is to deter piracy but all it does is raise the barrier for normal consumers by making it difficult to make legitimate and fair use copies for personal reasons. That's what it's all about. The average pirate isn't going to purchase a second copy of a movie if they lost their disc. A less tech savvy person may just purchase that second disk. \n\nThe problem with all of this is that the intended purpose has been perverted by manufacturers to extend copyright into areas that had never before seen copyright protection. As software begins to be integrated into every facet of our lives, companies have started to aggressively pursue extended copyright protections on their products. In the case of automobile manufacturers, many are attempting to use copyright to force buyers to only use their certified repair shops and technicians. It's essentially forcing consumers into having a limited choice in repair and maintenance so that dealerships can make more money. They do this by claiming that the software is proprietary and that unauthorized access constitutes copyright infringement. What makes this particularly bad is that manufacturers are starting to make it impossible to perform maintenance without access to the central software. The manufacturers claim that unauthorized access could cause accidents or unsafe operation of the vehicle that could open them up to liability, however, this already the case as you could just as easily go and cut your break lines and slam into a car. Manipulating code in a harmful manner negligently would follow the same tort standards.\n\nThe most absurd example is the Keurig 2.0 example that puts DRM on the k-cups so that only Keurig approved cups can be used in the system. If another manufacturer were to make a product that circumvented that, they could be forced out of the market under threat of copyright suits. This type of abuse has been reigned in by the courts with cases such as [Lexmark International v. Static Control Components](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexmark_International,_Inc._v._Static_Control_Components,_Inc.)\n\nThis always boils down to companies abhoring true free market competition. They want to lock consumers into their ecosystem to avoid competition as much as possible. However, they are perverting copyright law to do so and it's ending up with absurd results. Courts are skeptical and hesitant to grant expansive interpretations of copyright laws to products that have never needed copyright protection before.

Now here we are finally on the verge of doing something about it and every other post is a negative buzzkill. To all of you pessimists: you're playing into the NSA's hands. In fact you're echoing the exact words of the NSA astroturfers that pervade these threads. So either shut the fuck up, or stand up and do something about it, because spouting negative defeatism puts you on the side of the NSA.\n\n[So call your representative.](https://fight215.org/) Tell them they will never receive your vote or your donations again if they renew Section 215.  I don't care if it seems like your voice doesn't matter.  There are 5 million readers on this sub, if everyone does their part we make progress.\n\nIf you are a software developer, [volunteer](https://www.restorethe4th.com/volunteer).  If you are an artist or designer, [volunteer](https://www.restorethe4th.com/volunteer).  If you are a salesperson, [volunteer](https://www.restorethe4th.com/volunteer).  If you value the freedom that so many have died for, [volunteer](https://www.restorethe4th.com/volunteer).  The next time this opportunity comes around, Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush is going to be president, and the Snowden leaks will be 7+ years in the distance.  Let's not blow this people.\n\nOne hundred years from now, people are going to recall this unprecedented surveillance state and ask why nobody did anything about it.  Don't be the German citizen who said nothing when the Nazis came to power.  And *definitely* don't be the person who dissuaded others from taking any action at all.\n\nEDIT: **People are asking what to say to your congressperson.  Here's a start:**\n\n* Bulk collection has had [\"no discernable impact on preventing acts of terrorism\"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-phone-record-collection-does-little-to-prevent-terrorist-attacks-group-says/2014/01/12/8aa860aa-77dd-11e3-8963-b4b654bcc9b2_story.html).\n\n* This spying program [hurts the United States economy](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/how-nsa-mass-surveillance-hurting-us-economy).

It's hard to know something exists when it has been obfuscated purposefully from the start.\n\nSo to combat all five sides of the five eyes, awareness needs to occur in the masses. I think John Oliver's interview with Snowden did great numbers for this cause by putting it in terms of \"can the government see my dick pics?\"\n\nOnce one piece of the five eyes has been removed, then it becomes an accepted possibility that the people governed by their respective governments are able to make a difference on the matter.\n\nBut it's not that simple. Even after the PATRIOT Act is removed, there will be other pieces of legislature or executive orders that need public attention and revocation before a measure of privacy is restored.\n\nKeep in mind that the opposition is fond of and will protect its power and abilities, and will stop at nothing to continue to the best of their ability. \"Repeal the PATRIOT Act? Cool, we will just have to figure out another way of 'legally' obtaining our goals.\" is likely their frame of mind. Everything done so far reeks of it. Anything we do, they're likely going to try to find a way of subverting or nullifying it. So there will be plenty more struggle afterward. \n\nSo to answer your question, what do we do about the other  five eyes?\n\nContinue fighting against the grave injustices that we feel is being allowed to continue until there is no more work to be done. It's all we can do.\n\nI will ask you this, though: What is the alternative reality presented if we do not struggle against this situation?

The U.S government sued 4 of the biggestt tobacco firms in 1999 (including Phillip Morris). They argued that the negative impact of tobacco caused a greater reliance on government health programs. As a settlement, the tobacco companies agreed to allow greater government regulation + pay a compensation fee every year (effectively a tax). Companies with highly negative externalities are only going to open a can of worms on themselves if they sue using ISDS mechanisms. And as it stands in the Australia case, Phillip Morris is being accused of \"treaty shopping\". They invested in the Australian arm after the plain packaging legislation passed...

It is designed to prevent governments from taking control of industries after foreign companies invest in the development of that industry in country. It isn't perfect and needs to be handled better.

Pirates usually wouldn't be customers anyway (or can't be customers due do international licensing).\n\nLets review all the ways movie studios are idiotic and behind the times and hemorrhaging money that have nothing to do with piracy.\n\n1) Not releasing everywhere in the world at once. Or trying to limit distribution to certain countries. We have the internet. We live in the information age. This is inexcusably bad business. All the buzz and hype of people talking about a movie is global thanks to the internet. Why would you not take advantage of that?\n\n2) Not releasing movies for sale as soon as or very shortly after it is in theaters. Why make people wait even more? Why have to spend additional money on advertising something you already advertised and built a ton of hype for? If your movie is bad do you think people will forget that it is bad and buy the Blu-Ray anyway?\n\n3) Charging stupid amounts for digital rentals. Redbox kiosks shouldn't exist (at least in any areas with half-decent internet). There is absolutely no reason for a digital rental to cost more than getting a physical disc out a machine and all the business overhead that goes along with that. If it were a dollar a rental I would rent a movie a night without even thinking about it. At $5 a rental I am waiting for it come out on Netflix. It isn't even about the money. I can easily afford it but it feels like a ripoff price.\n\n4) Charging more or the same amount for the digital version than the disc version. Are they trying to irritate their customers? They are just encouraging me to wait until it is on sale in stores so I can get both digital and disc versions for less money. Just because some people are willing to pay sky-high prices doesn't mean that is the price-point that will make you the most money. It is Econ 101.\n\n5) Charging more for the HD version and/or not making it obvious you aren't purchasing the HD version. What the fuck are they smoking? Do they want people to have a shitty experience with their product? Yeah you might get a few people accidentally buy both but you are irreparably harming your relationship with your customers. The only reason to not always show the HD version is the customer has a slow connection in which case you let them choose to downgrade.\n\n6) Charging the same price for all the movies in the theater. I might pay to see Star Wars in theaters at current ticket prices, but there are plenty of good movies that I won't pay to see in theaters that I would if they quartered or halved even the price. Even if it is just for the Matinee showings they could at least get more butts in the seats. Are they trying to make sure as few people see the movie as possible? Are they so stupid they think more people seeing the movie in theaters will will hurt Blu-Ray sales because people will have seen it already?\n\nI could keep going but you get the point.", "gilded": 0, "score": 2, "created": 1429520921.0},{"body": "So, I actually completely agree with you, and rarely and i mean RARELY ever pirate anything.
