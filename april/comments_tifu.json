Well because they were snow tubes there was a layer of vinyl or whatever over the hole in the center. This, we all soon found out, turned them into giant suction cups if we so wanted. Getting one stuck on the ceiling was of course an impressive feat. \n\nOne day after we all get done hitting the hill after lunch we return our tubes. I did my traditional tube slam smack on the wall. Only this time immediately after, a really weird alarm goes off. \n\nSomehow, in ways I don't know or give a damn about to learn, the vibration of the tube hitting the wall caused the fire alarm to go off.

Yet I am totally unfazed because I know I didn't pull a fake alarm, I did something which caused an alarm to go off, but it wasn't even an accident. It was that I did something totally unrelated to pulling an alarm and it just so happened to set it off.\n\nIt took like an hour or two for them to give up on making me \"feel bad\" and take responsibility for the wrong I had done.

You should bd able to imagine a group of kids doing things like OP to Reginald for similar reasons, to get a reaction. Most parents always said just ignore bullies, which is stupid advice because the bullied just keep it up, just like OP. Reginald has tried to ignore it for 4.5 years and maybe he only felt a little betrayed or hurt or humiliated each time but it built up maybe even it was building since he was 5 and started school. I know the pain of being the brunt of really stupid supposedly harmless fun, i always felt attacked (because I was) i never felt a part of a group instead I felt APART. I was a nice person who wad kind and helpful and withdrawn because my soft side was seen as a weakness by those who for some reason wanted to hurt me instead of leaving me alone. I spent years in therapy and i put that stuff as well as the physical and emotional abuse I got at home behind me. The only reason I am talking about it now is because I feel some empathy and understanding for Reginald who deserved better from someone who supposedly liked him. In therapy i came to understand that some of my bullying was most likely thought of as harmless fun not really intended to hurt me. There may have been some who actually liked me and chose a poor way to try to show it. I also know that some where kids worse off than me who were angry and felt more powerful by bullying someone weaker (i know this is so because years after school one of my oppressors did apologize and explained why they were so angry and hurtful. She got \"saved\" so felt the need to tell me). I don't want OP to hate himself for being so shallow that he could not see how some people find such words terribly embarrassing and would create in their mind where someone hated them and wanted to humiliate them in this private terroristic way.

He should say too that he realizes he needs to learn from doing such a terrible thing however harmless his intentions, and say he will get counseling. Maybe OP will only need to go to counceling once Or twice but at least he could talk it through to make sure he really does understand the consequences of what he did and make a plan for moving forward.

The boss isn't sure he can trust you around the public anymore, there goes your nice sales job \"Jones, we need someone to sort all these paper records and scan them one by one into digital format. It shouldn't take more than a year or two and you get your own office in the records room in the basement! We know you are the perfect man for this job\". I am a nice guy usually, so that would be my typical response. Do that childish stuff after I've warned you or on the wrong day though and I may just get wrong on you though. Seriously, too much is too much. He should learn a lesson and be glad Reginald actually is a nice well balanced guy cause Reggie might just as likely have flipped out and shot him, or found out who he was and silently pissed in his coffee for the rest of their career, or had any other of a various range of really bad responses. It is elusive to me how people think no one deserves their ass kicked for mind games and harassment anymore, or even chronic disrespect and verbal abuse. Mind games and harassment hurt a person a lot more than any beating someone could give you,  if you have driven them to the point of violence. \"Push me too far and I might become violent\" is basic human nature but all you bastards feel you should be able to mentally torment a person with no retaliation. That just makes a world full of bullies and bullied people seething inside with the buried anger of a coward who has never been taught to stand up for him/herself and when all the rage comes out, finally, as it must, they hurt their loved ones, their parents,  their spouse and kids, or their animals, and in some extremes they go and blow away a crowd of people. I don't condone any of that, point is it all started when those people were tormented by assholes but not allowed to lawfully confront their tormentors. Non confrontation ensures that no problem will ever really be solved in our modern culture because people won't behave in an \"uncivilized\" manner any more. Civilized people are under the control of the authorities, literally, that is what the word means. Civilized people are allowed only orderly feelings, ones that won't disrupt their ability to make a profit for the real masters of the world while they live in debt and penury. Just forget about all that crazy stuff though, go watch a ball game and take another pill.

Denton is best known from this period of his life for the 1966 televised press conference in which he was forced to participate as an American POW by his North Vietnamese captors. He used the opportunity to communicate successfully and to confirm for the first time to the U.S. [Office of Naval Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Naval_Intelligence) and Americans that American POWs were being [tortured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture) in North Vietnam. He repeatedly blinked his eyes in [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) during the interview, spelling out the word *\"T-O-R-T-U-R-E\"*.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/j3P5ZSa.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:JeremiahDentonSenate.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^United ^States ^Senate ^election ^in ^Alabama, ^1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Alabama,_1986) ^| [^United ^States ^Senate ^election ^in ^Alabama, ^1980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Alabama,_1980) ^| [^United ^States ^Senate ^elections, ^1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_1986) ^| [^Donald ^Stewart ^\\(Alabama)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Stewart_\\(Alabama\\)) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cqpmvas) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cqpmvas)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "score": 156, "created": 1430088496.0},{"body": "I still don't understand why his captors didn't clue in that he was blinking WAY too often.", "gilded": 0, "score": 77, "created": 1430098090.0},{"body": "The only thing I can think of is either they knew he had been tortured, so odd tics/behaviors wouldn't be so...odd.\n\nOr\n\nHe may have affected an odd eye blink while practicing his morse code eye blink prior to the \"interview\"  meaning they would have gotten used to him blinking weirdly over time and chalked it up to that weird American or maybe we broke him.", "gilded": 0, "score": 158, "created": 1430098803.0},{"body": "They thought it was from camera flashes.
