Once designated, a country remains a State Sponsor of \n    Terrorism until its designation is rescinded in accordance with statutory criteria. In Cuba\u2019s case, the\n    applicable criteria require the President to submit a report to the Congress at least 45 days before the\n    proposed rescission would take effect, justifying the rescission and certifying that (1) the Government\n    of Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding 6-month period; \n    and (2) the Government of Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international\n    terrorism in the future.\n\n\n    As part of his December 17, 2014, announcement of policy changes related to Cuba, President Obama\n    instructed the Department of State to undertake a review of Cuba\u2019s designation as a State Sponsor of \n    Terrorism based on an assessment of the available facts. After a careful review of Cuba\u2019s record,\n    which was informed by the Intelligence Community, as well as assurances provided by the Cuban\n    government, the Secretary of State concluded that Cuba met the conditions for rescinding its \n    designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. The Secretary of State therefore recommended that the\n    President make and submit to Congress the statutorily-required report and certification.\n\n\n    As the President has said, we will continue to have differences with the Cuban government, but our \n    concerns over a wide range of Cuba\u2019s policies and actions fall outside the criteria that is relevant to\n    whether to rescind Cuba\u2019s designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. That determination is based on\n    the statutory standard \u2013  and the facts \u2013 and those facts have led the President to declare his intention\n    to rescind Cuba\u2019s State Sponsor of Terrorism designation. More broadly, the United States will continue\n    to support our interests and values through engagement with the Cuban government and people.\n\n\nRead more: http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/texttrans/2015/04/20150414314662.html#ixzz3XL6IYrgy\n\n---\n\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 **Kerry on Proposed Lifting of Cuba\u2019s Terrorism Sponsor Designation**\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\n\n\n    14 April 2015\n\n    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE\n    Office of the Spokesperson\n    Washington, D.C.\n    April 14, 2015\n\n    STATEMENT BY SECRETARY KERRY\n\n              Recommendation to Rescind Cuba\u2019s Designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism\n\n\n    In December 2014, as a critical component of establishing a new direction for U.S.\u2013Cuba relations, the \n    President directed the State Department to launch a review of Cuba\u2019s designation as a State Sponsor of \n    Terrorism and provide a report to him within six months. Last week, the State Department submitted a \n    report to the White House recommending, based on the facts and the statutory standard, that\n    President Obama rescind Cuba\u2019s designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.\n\n\n    This recommendation reflects the Department\u2019s assessment that Cuba meets the criteria established by \n    Congress for rescission. While the United States has had, and continues to have, significant concerns\n    and disagreements with a wide range of Cuba\u2019s policies and actions, these concerns and disagreements \n    fall outside of the criteria for designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. This review focused on the\n    narrow questions of whether Cuba provided any support for international terrorism during the previous \n    six months, and whether Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international\n    terrorism in the future, consistent with the statutory standard for rescission.\n\n\n    Circumstances have changed since 1982, when Cuba was originally designated as a State Sponsor of \n    Terrorism because of its efforts to promote armed revolution by forces in Latin America. Our \n    Hemisphere, and the world, look very different today than they did 33 years ago. Our determination,\n    pursuant to the facts, including corroborative assurances received from the Government of Cuba and \n    the statutory standard, is that the time has come to rescind Cuba\u2019s designation as a State Sponsor of\n    Terrorism.\n\n________ http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/04/240687.htm\n\n\n   \n\nEdit: More links\n\n**Background Briefing on the Report Required To Rescind Cuba's State Sponsor of Terrorism Status**\n\nhttp://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/04/240697.htm\n\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 1272, "created": 1429042594.0},{"body": "Just out of curiosity (and though I'm a history guy this may be a stupid question), why is it 2015 and we have official documents that look like they were done using a typewriter in 1960?\n\nIt may just be the font, but still.

In particular, in Sydney, it's the Inner North Shore and Eastern suburbs residents who demonstrate the highest rates of non-vaccination in the city. \n\n[This article from the Sydney Morning Herald only last year](http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/rich-suburbs-have-low-immunisation-rates-research-shows-20140326-35iy3.html) showed that \"affluent suburbs have the lowest immunisation rates\". Specifically \"only about 80 per cent of five-year-old children in [wealthy] suburbs such as Manly, Paddington and Annandale are fully immunised\". Compare this to complete overall vaccination in Australia to 97% and it becomes clear that in those with higher socioeconomic status, is where this particular problem lies . \n\nThe upper class doesn't need, nor qualify for, Family Tax Benefit A (welfare). And so this law will not affect them at all. And that's concerning because they are our biggest problem group, statistically, in failure to vaccinate. \n\nSo, who will this law affect? Poor families who rely on welfare. These which include Aboriginal rural families. \n\nDo poor/middle class families avoid vaccination? No that has been shown to be a systematic problem in the upper class. \n\nSo why do we see some non-vaccination among the poor? This bearing in mind that 97% of Australia is currently vaccinated as at 2015. \n\nMaybe they're working two jobs to make ends meet and haven't got around to vaccinating their kids.  \n\nMaybe their GP (family medicine practitioner), or vaccination center, is hours away from their home because of their rural location. This is the case with many Aboriginal communities and their problematic doctor shortages. Moreover the doctor shortages in all Australian regional and rural environments is a massive concern. [This article in The Age newspaper in 2012](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/no-doctors-in-the-house-20120626-210fg.html) states that \"in 2009 one million people in Australia were unable to see a doctor because they could not get an appointment when they needed one\". That's almost 5% of the entire population who couldn't see a doctor purely because of a shortage. How many of these people wanted to see a doctor to vaccinate their child? How many of these people are poor and will now lose their welfare purely because of where they live? But Abbott probably thinks that [\"that's the lifestyle choice they made and it's their fault for making that\"](http://www.smh.com.au/national/tony-abbotts-lifestyle-choice-remark-leaves-everyone-hurting-inside-in-remote-indigenous-communities-20150313-143lh7.html). \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're just lazy. But what proportion of poorer people are not receiving vaccines for this reason and not the other two? Are all poor people just lazy?  \n\nSo what will Tony Abbott's new law achieve in terms of improving population health? \n\nThe rich group will remain un-vaccinated. And because the majority of anti-vaxxers are rich that 3% of unvaccinated children in Australia is not going to significantly reduce. It would probably increase, as it had in previous years, as the rich continue to avoid vaccination on principle. \n\nOn the flip side, poor people who didn't vaccinate because they were busy or were just too far away from a doctor will lose a chunk of their welfare. From the article this is \"worth up to $15,000 per child\"; a huge amount of money for a poorer family in Australia. And that's going to make life harder for the parent/s and, ultimately, their child. \n\nFunnily the whole point of this law is 'to protect the children' and all it seems to be able to do is harm them. \n\nBut then it could be argued that these parents could stop what they were doing and immediately vaccinate their child. And, as a result of this, the welfare tap will open again. So it's not a big deal right? \n\nThis is true but welfare in Australia is paid fortnightly. It will take at least two weeks before a family is paid their benefits again. And that's assuming the entire bureaucracy that is Centrelink (welfare payment office) works smoothly. For a family living paycheck to paycheck that could be incredibly problematic. \n\nAnd that's why this law is nothing more than political posturing by Tony Abbott, and in its essence, is stupid. \n\nIt cannot possibly increase vaccination rates as it avoids the the problem group; the rich. Rather all this law will do will increase the financial stress on poorer families and remote/rural Aboriginal families. It may even lead to even poorer health outcomes amongst these groups. \n\nHopefully parliament will veto this law. And hopefully the law will be amended to be something like \"if you don't vaccinate your child we won't process your tax return\" or how about \"no vaccination, no negative gearing for you\". The rich will respond to that one rapidly. And then we could finally see 99% to 100% vaccination in Australia. \n\nBut good luck with that ever being passed. \n\nAs it stands now this law is utter tripe. It's purely self serving for Abbot in two ways. One he receives political kudos for being tough on anti-vaccination, when at its core it does nothing. And two he gets to reduce the safety net which has been the underlying basis of his entire prime ministership. \n\nRemember this was the same guy that wanted to charge people to see a doctor. \n\nGood fucking job Tony. \n\nCannot wait til the next election. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 1, "score": 203, "created": 1428838981.0},{"body": "Immunization professional for a US state puplic health dept. here.

I worked with the \u201cgovernment agent\u201d to set-up a continuous packet capture device that was monitored by the FBI.  The silliest thing is that servers were not using https, which would have required a key-exchange to get the man-in-the-middle configuration setup.  They were able to grab the passwords (which is terribly easy to do via http) into the locked exchange sites to monitor the exchanges on a 24 hour basis.\n\nThe fact is that these types of sites can be flipped nearly instantaneously at the drop of a hat, in fact our company guaranteed a one-hour delivery time for new customers.  You pay, an hour later your root password is available for a new box freshly installed for you.  The problem here is that if the server owner had any clue that they were already under \u201cgovernment scrutiny\u201d they could have wiped the drive, swapped DNS, and had the server up likely in an entirely different country in a manner of hours-minus government involvement.  Very similar the whack-a-mole Piratebay server hunt.\n\nThe companies problem is that when their customers found out, and reacted much like this thread that were \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201chad no business ethics\u201d for continuing to provide service via the company and other web-hosting message boards (similar to this reddit thread.)

In effect, you've reduced freedom of speech to a weird rule that the government has to follow for some reason.\n\nThe first amendment reflects a broader principle which I'll call \"the freedom to be wrong\". It means that one's ability to communicate an idea should not depend on how good that idea is perceived to be, or indeed how good it is. (something which lynchy boycott mobs do not seem to support, I might add)\n\nThis may seem conceptually foolish, but it's rooted in an important understanding: we are all wrong about some things.\n\nIf I knew which things I were wrong about, I would change my mind about them, but I don't.

My solution can't be to just stop being wrong about things, so I'll go with the second best option:\n\nWhen I'm wrong, I want to be wrong *gracefully*.\n\nAnd that means when I argue, I do it cleanly, and I do it in a way that allows for better arguments than mine to defeat me. I don't use threats of violence, I don't use social pressure, and I don't use threats of financial ruin.

So when I try to determine whether or not boycotts are a good tool for political change, I ask myself \"how would I feel if I'd organized a boycott against companies that supported gay marriage?\". The answer is pretty shitty. How would I feel if I'd published a list of companies hosting pro gay marriage websites? Also pretty shitty.\n\nTo me, free speech means that I am committed to making a world where dumb people feel safe communicating their bad ideas. Partly because it's the right thing to do, and partly because we are all sometimes dumb people with bad ideas, and a world where boycotts are how we get things done is a world where loud ideas triumph over good ones.\n\nGold!
