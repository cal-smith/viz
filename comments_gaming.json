The battle grows and grows and the server eventually drops A D and L to server 4 so that it only has to focus on system X.

There are a lot of mixed opinions on Destiny and it varies largely by maturity. So I may get downvoted by a lot of other Destiny fans but IDGAF. I have logged somewhere around 600 hours and I also work at a large game studio in Central US and this is my view of it. \n\nDestiny looked to be this amazing game. Trailers showed off amazing scenarios and drove the hype train to a crazy speed. But in hindsight, they drove it a little too fast for too long.\n\nDestiny as a whole does not appeal to many audiences. It is MMO like, but mechanically suffers from a lot of things that drive those players away. No in game trading, loot tables are terribly low, the loot fro doing extremely difficult end game content can be extremely lack luster and the whole game is driven by RNG (Random Number Generation). And that exhibits a HUGE grind that actually pays off very little and that whole grind comes down to chance at the end of the day. It has MMO qualities but is really unpolished in terms of MMO mechanics. \n\nIt tries desperately to appeal to the Casual player but can end up driving them away along with the hardcore players. When I say this I mean how you advance to higher levels. Once again this is determined by RNG and it does not weight the performance of the players to better loot. (this whole game is about loot, btw. Think Borderlands.) So Joe Shmow can join a game at the last second and get one of the best guns in the game while the top performer can get absolutely nothing. Bungie, by using RNG tries to make it so that the casual player can play for an hour or so and most likely get something to advance themselves and a Hardcore player can play for eight hours a day and maybe after three days get a decent piece of loot. The randomness hurts a lot. There are also seven different types of currency and multiple tiers of upgrade materials that are horribly unbalanced. \n\nIt drives away the traditional FPS fans as one can play through endgame content and get significant advantages to players who only want to do multiplayer. This can be in terms of weapons, armor and perks to each of those. There is no real way for the PvP only person to catch up to people who do both. \n\nIt has a plethora of bugs and weapon imbalances.^1 There are bugs and glitches that have existed since day one and still have not been fixed. On top of that, It appears that their priority has not been on fixing bugs that may the game more difficult/unplayable but rather fixing \"Cheese\" Strategies (to cheese is to make a intended difficult fight into a trivial one by using various exploits. Not actually cheating, but purist will call it cheating.) caused by an oversight in coding or thinking. So it is a punishing experience for the players when Bungie will make the game harder and not fix the issues that make the game unintentionally harder. \n\n1. The weapon balances are actually pretty balanced; however, they give the illusion on imbalanced because almost all of the maps for you into tight corners where weapons like shotguns and machine guns are skewed to do better. The whole game is mostly designed like this which makes these types of weapons very good at their job, especially in PvP.\n\nEverchanging Bungie opinions. In one instance they want to focus on teamwork and on the next they isolate one player to do the lead role. On one hand they want players to creatively complete difficult content, but on the other if it is not how they envisioned, they will patch it out.\n\nDestiny is addicting, but not necessarily \"fun\". The gameplay is repetitive and rarely brings anything new to the table. The story is almost non existant in the game. To really get the story, you have to go to Bungie.net and read these special cards you earn in the story called \"Grimore\".\n\nBungie made a solid game. Graphically, it is amazing. Beautiful, dynamic and animations are pristine. Mechanically is is a bust. Gameplay is repetitive but Bungie's mantra is \"30 Seconds of fun.\" and that nails the hammer on the head for gameplay. The game tries to appeal to everyone and by doing so it pushes a lot of people away.

The \"Be the Zombie\" mode is loads of fun, and playing as the zombie is awesome, although it isn't balanced very well at first (the zombie has a skill tree, you have to get kills to progress, and against 4 humans that can potentially be very difficult until you've leveled up) it does get better as your skill tree progresses and you gain new abilities.\nThe parkour is relatively fluid, and it feels kind of like a mix between Assassin's Creed and Mirror's Edge.\n\nCombat is fun, and SATISFYING but can be difficult (which is a good thing) if you get yourself in a bad situation.

Suikoden III: It was years after I had put the game down before the final dungeon (but never finished).  I had multiple saves, but none of them were backups; the saves were only made for landmark occasions in the game.  So here I am, years later, having read the manga and was stoked to finally finish the story.  I decided to load an older save to view the scene where you decide who would be the true successor to the Fire Champion but then decided not to after all and just continue with the final dungeon.  For some reason, I thought I went into a load screen, but I had gone to a save screen instead... and instead of loading the final dungeon, I saved over the final dungeon.  This was only bad because I had actually only really started to grind and collect characters after the earlier save. :(", "score": 1},{"body": "During the day maybe 5 out of a 100 zombies you see will be the fast zombies.
