If you have a can near you now it's probably an 80% chance that it was made by Ball. Quality is as expected, generally good, but you can tell their goal is volume. Necks aren't clean and straight in most cases, but the printing is top-notch. You will see *some* dents at the base, but not a huge amount.\n\nNext up in volume is going to be Rexam. In the industry they're considered the short-bus. If you get fired from another competitor you'll probably end up at Rexam. This shows in quality. The thickness is inconsistent, the printing is mediocre, and the necks almost always have a bunch of marks on them. Dents are common-place all over but look at the edge of the top neck and the bottom edge. Huge volume because they're cheap.\n\nNext in volume (in the US mainly) is going to be little-known MCC. This stands for Metal Container Corporation, which is actually owned by Anheuser-Busch In-Bev. Basically they produce enough so that they can control prices a bit when they buy from Ball. The quality here is impressive. The necks are clean and generally a bit sharper than anyone else. Dents are reduced to almost nil, if you see many it's likely from the filling/packing process.\n\nDoes anyone actually give a shit? Not really.\n\nEdit: totally overlooked Crown as it isn't relevant where I live, though IIRC they are on par with Ball for quality. Thanks /u/NerdHearderBrit for that reminder. It's been years since I've seen a Crown can pop up where I live, they don't have any plants in the region where I live.\n\nEdit again: Shit this blew up. Since people seem interested and are asking a ton of questions I'll throw in some more random information about it.\n\nFrom what I can find MCC is making about 45% of the cans that Anheuser-Busch is using. The rest they buy, *mostly* from Ball IIRC.\n\nNow, if you want to annoy or impress people there's a nifty trick about location that makes it fairly easy to guess who made what cans in your area without even looking. When the cans are made they are shipped by semi-truck to where they will be filled, so companies *really* don't like to truck them very far as it's basically a truck full of air. Start doing some research on where each manufacturer has plants and you can nail it down pretty damn quickly. For instance MCC (the one I'm most familiar with) has only 5 plants in the U.S. If you're near one you'll see more of their cans. You're looking for Arnold, Mo., Jacksonville, Fl., Mira Loma, Ca., Newburgh, N.Y. and Windsor, Co. The closer you are to one of those the more likely you are to see their cans.\n\nTo get *really* nifty you can learn who makes the aluminum bottles and *how* they make them. Some manufacturers use basically an extrusion process where they smash the hell out of a pellet of aluminum in a male/female mold and it makes 90% of the shape in one shot. Other manufacturers went the direction of forming each part one step at a time, IIRC the process is about 30 stages wherein *most* of those stages are used to form the neck.\n\nAlso, just out of honesty I picked up all of this second-hand from my dad who is in the industry working as an independent contractor all over the world.

That's because the body of the shirt is knitted as a tube in the round. This is the fastest way to produce knit fabrics, because no stops are necessary - the machine keeps rotating while the fabric is pulled down. There are 1-2 thousand needles all working at once, and if you have 30-50 packages of yarn attached to the machine, you're knitting 30-50 rows every time the machine rotates (imagine that each new row is staggered slightly behind the row below) - which it does multiple times a minute. Now you know why t-shirts are so cheap! But, the machine size is fixed, you can't make the circle larger or smaller. So do they have different sizes of machines to correlate with different sizes of t-shirts? \n\nNope. That would be a waste of money for the company because the machines themselves are so expensive. So instead, they alter the tightness of the yarn being threaded into the machine. If the yarn is tighter, the tube of fabric will constrict when it exists the machine, resulting in a smaller tube (small sizes). If the yarn is loose, the fabric will not constrict so much, resulting in a larger tube (large sizes). This means that small size shirts are more tightly knit, and have a higher cover (kind related to thickness-how much can you see through the fabric) while larger sizes are looser and have less cover. Fabric cover doesn't translate directly into product quality (there's many other factors), but it is considered - you don't want a see through shirt. \n\nAnd that's the dirty secret behind your t-shirts.

And the cloth will normally be made larger and then compacted (pre shrunk) to the proper tube size after it is knit.\n\nBut here is the thing...

It's VERY cheap (compared to how expensive razors are), and they send them through the mail. You can get them to send you razors every month or every other month, and you can cancel at any time. Since I shave my head, I tend to replace the razors every 3-4 weeks (while honing them on my jeans), because it's much easier to cut your head than your face. I have a bulk supply of razors now that have been adding up, so it's nice to have. I believe they send 5 two-blade razor replacements for $2 a month (or bi-monthly), 4 four-blade replacements for $6 a month (or bi-monthly), and 4 six-blade replacements for $9 a month (or bi-monthly). I personally use the four-blade replacements for my face and head, and I only pay $6 every other month. They send you a new handle every year. \n\nAlso, try running your razor on your jeans with a new blade, and don't start now if it's not new. Run the razor forward about 20 times BEFORE and AFTER you shave. Also, for best razor maintenance, try and keep it as dry as possible after shaving to prevent any minor rusting (most people replace their blades before they get that rusty, but even minor rust can mess up your shave. You can do this by shaking the razor vigorously in your sink to get the bigger water particles off, and then blowing on it to try and dislodge the rest.
