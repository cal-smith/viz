Play around with the sliders to get different relaxing ambient noises. My personal favourite is wave just past half, a couple of notches on wind and birds about a third along.  Shit doesn't work. I maxed everything, yet I couldn't be less relaxed.  Now I've got birds tweeting in my ear, a TV left on static, people talking everywhere. The window is open, it's fucking raining and the god damn crickets won't shut up. How the hell am I meant to sleep like this? I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A CROWDED MALL, SOMEONE HELP ME. YOU STUPID BIRDS IT'S A GODDAMN MONSOON OUTSIDE SHUT THE FUCK UP Oh my god! What are you people doing?! Can't you see that this coffee shop is on fire?!?!  Hey! Thanks for the mention.

This is a website I use to waste time I just gave myself the worst fucking headache.   That was fun. aka. What small websites can reddit eat today?  ##**Gobble gobble** I can't find a single working link in this thread yet. MORE BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD https://www.geoguessr.com : You get dropped somewhere in the world and have to guess your location based off the google earth pictures. Great way to spend a Friday afternoon at work I played this with about 10 geologists whilst in a very small, remote field camp. Killed our comms connection, but was worth it.  did they do good? Thankfully, they weren't english teachers. They did well :)  although, getting dropped in the middle of a forest with nothing for km in either direction is hard Sweet site. I found this after 15 minutes of being "lost"... (NSFW) http://imgur.com/ArP9V4C His head is blurred, but his head isn't blurred. If i had to have one blurred, it'd be my face And I always thought those signs were to watch for people opening umbrellas. Now I know its for pissing rednecks I was collapsing posts, just thinking I should post this and it popped up. Thanks for sharing it! This is a real gem of the internet.

When I first played it, I remember thinking, "I wonder how they manage to find places that are so beautiful and interesting. Do they have some kind of fancy algorithm for selecting the best ones they know their users would like?" The answer, of course, is simply that we live in a beautiful, fascinating world. Fuckin Australia...  Seems the reddit hug got it :\ www.INeedAPrompt.com : Generates a random writing or drawing prompt from over 400 adverbs, adjectives, verbs, nouns, and locations.

For example:

&gt; "A monk who is being held hostage by a likable tap-dancer on a busy Monday."

831,601 prompts generated so far, and counting.

You need to be aware of this site because I made it.

Edit: Wow! I wonder if I can un-suck the code a bit before this bad boy hits a million prompts. Thanks for the interest!

Edit edit: Nope. "An attractive, clever mime who is messily singing a love song to a fashionable, lonely alien in a disgusting public bathroom."

SOLD. "A nun discovering a new world with an oompa loompa."

Thank you for this one. *Oompa loompa doompity doo*

*Stuck on an alien planet with you*

*Oompa loompa doompity dee*

*With your goddamn vows of chastity* "A Star Trek enthusiast in a shouting match with a Wookie."
HAHAHA "A Senator protesting against a stormtrooper."

OMG! Prompt bot wrote Ep IV! Is it actually a tank full of manatees? Be honest, OP. Make it an app.  [deleted] "A basketball player quickscoping an ewok."  

ACCEPTABLE http://www.romanticallyapocalyptic.com

One of the most well drawn, well written webcomics I've read in a very long time. Under each page is a longer piece of narration for people who like the story, but it's very readable even without it.

It's also very long. Since nobody replied to you, I'll just leave a thanks here. I'm really enjoying It. I think they're all off reading the comic  I really really like Romantically apocalyptic. If anyone wants something a bit less surreal, [Stand Still Stay Silent](http://www.sssscomic.com) is another well drawn, good story apocalypse webcomic.

edit: fixed link. I should not type links. I should copy paste. Have you read "A Red Tails Dream" by the same artist/writer who is doing "Stand Still, Stay Silent"? If you haven't yet, I HIGHLY recommend it, as it showcases their artistic ability in ways that "Stand Still, Stay Silent" just never could. I *love* "A Red Tails Dream". I caught it when it was about  half way through the moose arc, read up to that point before the day was over, then followed the updates religiously. Sadly I didn't have the money to buy a hard-copy. :( If you haven't read it before, Gunnerkrigg Court is very good as well and in a similar style  I used to follow it. Then it got too absurd for me to enjoy the story.   :(

Ava's Demon,  String Theory, Octopus Pie, Hark! A Vagrant,  Bad Machinery, The Abominable Charles Christopher are also very good comics.  read the journals under the comics, they'll clear up the absurdity with explanations of sorts I have to show some love for Questionable Content.. one of my favorites. We crashed it. Holy wow! I've completely forgotten about this comic! Used to read it back in 2011-ish, I think. Thanks a lot for the reminder, much love to you buddy.  [I Fucking Don't Understand Science](http://ifduscience.com/)

It's an "I Fucking Love Science" parody website.  &gt; Europes least interesting island.

I'm not happy. Not happy at all. Seriously how could you say Iceland is Europe's least interesting when the Isle of Wight is a thing that exists Ha! I love their post tags...'fucktard', 'Probably Japanese Revenge for WWII', 'Never Ending Pasta Bowl at Olive Garden', and 'Outback Steakcancer'. It's like /r/shittyaskscience for the whole Internet! I really dislike "I Fucking Love Science".

It just panders to pseudo intellectuals who read a headline, share it on facebook, and want to appear learned.  http://explosm.net/comics/3557/ Yeah, I'd much rather be pandered to here on reddit as well. It's clickbaity as shit too. I used to agree, but then I realized that it does kind of promote science. Maybe it does not portray it correctly, but at least it gives it more credibility. Anything that makes people side with the scientific consensus on global warming rather than the hoax people who point out that it's snowing is good in my book. Maybe we need to accept that a lot of people lack the interest or mental capacity to base their beliefs in reality. I would rather have these people be right for the wrong reasons than wrong for the wrong reasons.

I would greatly prefer it if IFLS and others could showcase real actual science and get a similarly large following, but I'm afraid that is just not realistic. www.findtheinvisiblecow.com 

Please don't ask. Hi. I made this, and I'm pleasantly surprised it still gets shared :)

I hope you make bank on this website, buddy. This is the kind of stupid thing the world needs more of I think. COW COW COW COW COW COW COW! moOOoooh. GOAT GOAT GOAT GOAT GOAT GOAT GOAT GOAT GOATGOATGOATGOAT SKER SKER SKER SKER SKER I am actually laughing hysterically right now cause of this stupid website RIP my ears. IS THERE REALLY A COW?! YES THERE IS A COW 

protip: listen very carefully yea you get points for finding the cow, theres also a hard mode where your cursor doesnt change to click when you are over it. makes it more interesting I made the huge mistake of clicking the "Community" button on the bottom left... And no, reddit, Khan Academy no longer counts as a small website. IS MAYONNAISE A WEBSITE www.mayonnaise.com Well shit. http://shiiiit.com/ Apparently I give exactly 4 shiiiits about that website. That is well above average. TIL mayonnaise is a website.

But what about horseradish? It's real but very disappointing 

http://www.horseradish.com Welcome to the wonderful world of domain squatting. 

One of those things that really **should** be illegal from a moral standpoint, but hopefully never will from a legal &amp; political standpoint.  That was not what I expected. What about codecademy?  

Hey I'm gonna learn how to be a rockstar programmer.  aka go through first basic lessons, learn nothing, give up, continue losing at life.

Every fucking thread Hah, I got 40% of the way through python but now everytime I go back i can't remember what i learned and fall on my face. I would highly recommend using a learning program called Learn Python the Hard Way if you're interested in learning.  So start over? Repetition is good for learning, and you're not losing anything by starting over if you're having no success by not starting over. * http://www.CamelCamelCamel.com : You can submit any amazon url here, and it will show you a price history of the item. Great tool to know if you're actually getting a deal or not.

* http://www.TeamFrugal.com : Lots of good resources here to save money, and to find cheap products that are just as good/better than their expensive competitors. 

* http://www.AGoodMovieToWatch.com : The title speaks for itself.

**EDIT:** /u/CHIEFKEEFBANGBANG has removed the site from his list. I'm sure that he didn't know that the site had malware, and was just trying to provide a good website to people as well as answer OP's question. There is no need to let him know anymore, and no need to do any witch hunting. I've removed that website from the list. You're a straight up doll for showing me www.agoodmovietowatch.com I hate trying to find movies I like and failing at it. The first five I randomly selected there are ones I've seen and like a lot. I'll be using this like three times a week. Thanks a bunch. If you are interested in finding good movies, I created www.whatisonnetflix.com it gives you the highest rated movies from Imdb, Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic that are streamable on Netflix.

Edit: Sorry guys - only US content! I'm planning on adding multiple regions on my next release! I actually used your website last week to pick a good movie, ending up watching silence of the lambs. It puts the lotion on itself. Good job sir.  I really hope he uses this review to promote his site.



*"It puts the lotion on itself."*

*-SteakKing* Also,

http://shityoucanafford.com/ - Skymall for people on a budget (Everything under $20) i use the camelizer extension for Chrome which puts a little camel in the url bar when you are on Amazon which does the same thing when you click it

edit: as in, I bought it, came to this thread two minutes later and facepalmed. Ahh, good old Rasterbator Seriously though. I've rasterbated a few times and the finished products have come out awesome. I'd highly reccomend it for anyone who wants to liven up their room on a small budget. I want to watch you rasterbate. http://fuckinghomepage.com

It's not what it sounds like.

He WOULD be the guy doing that, hahaha. Smashing his leopard? What? I think you have the google chrome extension where it changes the word "keyboard" to "leopard". "leopard" to "leopard" is what I see, but I'm pretty sure it's keyboard now, given the context. Try hitting "alt" 3 times. There's a fun little perk. That's awesome. There's got to be more Easter eggs. Caps lock three times for the opposite NOW I'M IN CAPS. SHIT Shift five or more times is the best easter egg!

Not enough people know to use [ninite.com](https://ninite.com/) so by some scale it's small.  If ninite has it, you should probably use ninite to install and to update it.  

~~Very different type of site, but [massdrop.com](https://www.massdrop.com/) just gets better the more people who use it. Users there vote in what products they like, then massdrop contacts the vendor and uses large audience size to get lower prices.  The more people who use it, the better it becomes.~~  

Edit:  I originally suggested massdrop, though I've only had one experience with them.  Their business model intrigued me and I thought it'd get better the more people who used their service.  Though my only experience of them was good, it was just a single incident.  Comments &amp; PMs from other people who've used the site have now made me leery of them, so I'll retract my recommendation of them.  I stand by my other site recommendation though, I'm a sysadmin by trade and ninite is solid through and through. Since I have discovered ninite, there's been a 90% work load reduction for me and the IT department. Yeah, it's amazing. Now setting up a new computer is just download tiny program, run it, go make some lunch, eat it, come back and everything is done and magical!

 A Wholesale marketplace for Wholesalers, distributors and retailers to sell directly to each other with the lowest transaction rates and membership rates. I have created this and I am running this whole site all on my own with no outside funding and I really believe it can be the biggest and easiest to use wholesale site online. I am even currently working on a app where you can manage orders, inventory and everything else you can do on the site all from your phone. I hope to be done with that by the end of the month. 

I just really want to provide a service that I know would make wholesalers and retailers lives easier. I hope this meets and exceeds expectations.  I seem to be a little confused. Is this for the average consumer or for companies?  This is for companies, I am also working on expanding to the average consumer as well so companies can sell directly to everyone and handle everything all from one spot, I have it all set up and ready to go I just need to a few more members and a better server and I will softly launch that as well! 

 any special pricing for your fellow redditors?  Perhaps all the hits from this site crashed your pricing page because I'm getting an error when I visit. Oh my goodness it has! This is great/scary because I underestimated the traffic the site can handle. It looks like I will be needing a server sooner than later! 
But yeah absolutely I am offering 6 months Premium membership for free and just for redditors, use promo code "REDDIT" and I will knock off $75 off Premium PLUS Membership so it is only $200 for the year! 

Please bear with me as I need to contact my host and see what we need to do to handle this surge of traffic. I thank you all for visiting and if you have any questions or feedback I would greatly appreciate it as well. Thanks again!  Thank you so much, you are awesome for offering us a discount :)  I'm definitely going to look at the site further and see if we have relevant products for the platform/network. If it's ok I'll inbox you if I have questions (or feedback)! Yes please feel free to inbox me with any questions and feedback and thanks again for checking out the site!  i run a smartphone/tablet parts wholesale business i really need something like this that works. you wont believe how hard it is to tweak existing ecommerce services for wholeseller needs. are you available for hire? please dm me if you are available and affordable :) &gt; YourWholesaleSpot.com

Looks good! But you need a favicon! Thanks I am getting one up now!  Can you sell alcohol on the site? no sorry,currently we are not prepared to handle food and beverage wholesalers, especially alcohol. In the future it might be a possibility, we just have to look into the legal aspect of it and how we would handle orders.

 How about www.spacebuckets.com. Its a community of friendly DIY indoor gardeners :) "Gardeners" I didn't realise we had a website?! Here I am following some subreddit like a chump I am! I dont trust it. It's got that *look* What look? Give us a chance, we're a welcoming bunch. I meant the link, anything on Reddit that has space____ is a risky click Not anymore :) /r/SpaceX?

For Fun:

* http://www.nationstates.net : A great website that was originally marketing for a book but now is a website that simulates a nation and various issues. The real fun however starts when you join a region with other people and join their forums. Been playing for about 4 and a half years now and the site is 10+

* http://www.thehiveworks.com/ : A bunch of comics that share the same advertising network, most of which are top quality. I recommend Paranatural and Prague Race to start.
 I... I forgot all about nationstates... my poor poor people... I forsake them.. I fear they have all died. Haha, yeah. Mine actually ceased to exist. I focus on the forums more so than the actual decisions. Regions tend to have their own sort of politics, but all with real people! Which region did you join? Just started a new nation and created my own password protected region. ;) Hey join a cool region. You know all those spammy telegrams? There's nerds who send out all those spammy telegrams who are fun to hang out with :P I highly recommend the book, too! Jennifer Government is a lot of fun, and somewhat scarily prescient. I actually found it at my local library which would've never heard of such a thing under adult fiction, it's good. NS' forums are okay - I certainly appreciate its unique running gags and well-known posters like Ifreann that give it a culture and sense of community, not to mention a surprisingly efficient mod staff (I say good as someone who got an instant day ban). But that lack of reddit karma makes it hard to judge whether your post was received well or not, and really the culture isn't all that different from reddit. That said, the RP forums can be good fun. 

EDIT: NSG isn't bad, but reddit is better. NSG works as a starter forum I guess, but it isn't big enough to have reddit's diversity while being too big for posters not to get drowned out in a popular thread. If you're looking for a good time in a smaller community, I'd suggest the Warlizard gaming forum.  I have like three posts on NS forums. Are they fun besides the RP side? I usually spent time on each region's offsite forums.(Usually a zetaboards.) Defenders and Raiders tend to be fun to hang out with. So much polotics, and with purpose, it feels like you are inside a government.

Also what's NSG? Did you edit the wrong post or is it some sort of acronym. NSG: NationStates General forum. And while I don't do the political game with with the World Assembly anymore, I do appreciate the discussions and debates it generates (I never got involved in raiding/defending so I can't judge that besides the scandal with a Mod trying to raid an RP region, that you should look up for yourself - look for 'Liberate Haven'). I bet the owners of your second link were annoyed that someone claimed whorepresents.com before they could. Also, if you like nationstates but don't want to leave reddit, /r/nationwars is fairly similar. Eh. I didn't like the actual roleplaying and pretending you were building a nation much. I liked the community more lol.

There are hundreds of well-written &amp; well-researched articles on various topics, although it does tend to focus on art and literature. came here to post this.  I like to keep this bookmarked on my phone's home screen because it's often relevant.

http://theamountoffucksigive.com/ The key ingredient in Pepto-Bismol is bismuth, a metal 86% the density of lead, hence the weight of a bottle of the stuff. Bismuth is used because it is toxic to some bacteria that cause diarrhea (along with some other nifty characteristics), but a genius science teacher I had in junior high told me the weight of the bismuth allows it to displace stomach contents very effectively and reach the source of your problems.  Bismuth also makes your poop black. Good to know ahead of time.  Turns your tongue black as well...also good to know ahead of time.

The bismuth reacts with sulfur compounds in things you may have eaten recently...making black looking stuff. The samples of cleaning products are much more potent than the stuff you buy.

My dad's company makes the spray bottles they use. They send samples to test the sprayers because the over the counter versions are more watered down. If you send them an email saying you like their products they will often send you samples in the mail!   If you watered it down yourself, how much would you need to make a full bottle? The "strawberries" and "peaches" in Quaker Instant Oatmeal are actually flavored dehydrated apples. The "blueberries" are flavored dried figs. - Learned that from reddit a year ago. Suddenly, I understand why the front of the box has fine print that says "Artificially flavored fruit pieces."

I wondered why artificially flavor the fruit?!  It's because it's not the right fruit!

I imagine it's done for texture/dehydration/rehydration reasons. I think its just a money reason because i have a dehydrator and make oatmeal with my dried fruit constantly. Its delicious, and the fruit lasts a long time. Gorilla glass was developed in the 60's and no one had any idea what to do with it until we actually started using smartphones that need it. 

They're selling it to us as a cutting edge product, but really it's 50 years old.  My family is from Corning, NY, where the Corning Glass Works makes Gorilla Glass.  Because that was "THE job to have" in town, most of my family worked there at one time or another.  

My great grandmother was displaying the awesomeness of Gorilla Glass to her neighbors back in the 60's.  She threw down a dinner plate in the street.  Several times actually, without it ever chipping/breaking/cracking.  Then one day she threw it down, it hit a rock in the street and it chipped a TINY piece from the edge of the dinner plate.

She took it to the glass works and they replaced it immediately.  

All Corningware was like this.  Look at the bottom of your plates. Some of their stuff was indestructible.  She used to tell me, "If it's a Corning, it's for life." (well it used to be, sign of the times they were bought out and now all of their products are shitty knockoffs and they won't honor anything beyond a 1 year warranty) They weren't really bought out. They sold off all of their consumer business back in the late 90's, but still hold a small stake in it.  The new company (believe it's world kitchen) replaced the original formula with a cheaper, but less durable one.  Hence the reason there is a 4-5 year span that sucked.  Supposed World Kitchen re-launched it in 2009, but it's still inferior to the older products. It's chemically hardened glass. Other hardening methods have been known [since at least 1625.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Rupert's_Drop) *Double Stuf* Oreos actually only have [1.86 times the filling.](http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/21/us/oreo-high-school-experiment/) My whole life is a lie!  Trader Joe's generic Cheerios is made by General Mills. They are Cheerios. most "generic" foods are second line goods from the same manufacturers who make the branded goods. Thanks. I have been trying to compile a list of the store brands that are as good, if not better, than the name brand! All Kirkland products (Costco) I make their 425 sheet, 30 roll bundle of bath tissue, and it's better than anything else we make in the paper mill.   :) Your stapler has two different settings: one to keep your papers more or less permanently bound together, and one to keep them loosely attached if they need to be separated again. To activate the "loose" setting, push and rotate the little metal plate on the bottom of the stapler.  I had wondered what that splaying plate was for! And this rarely used setting is referred to as "pinning" the paper. You can also use it to pin other things which are normally pinned, like fabric. I knew about the second setting but I never knew what it was for. I thought some people just liked their staples like that. Pet food labels  
  
If the product's label statement is a single listed, unmodified ingredient (Turkey, Pork, Chicken, etc) it has to contain at least 70% of that ingredient.  
  
If it uses a modifying word (Chicken entree, Salmon dinner, Beef stew, etc) that percentage declines to 10% for wet food and 25% for dry food.  
  
If the modifying word used is "with" (with beef, with chicken, etc) it declines to 3%. [deleted] Neutrogena Facial Soap -- the old-school yellow liquid version that comes in the pump container-- gets out every fucking stain known to man kind. 

I figured this out when I was 14 because, as you likely know, periods and 'accidents' due to periods happen a lot during this age range. To not embarrass myself in a house full of men, I'd try to get the stains out before putting my underwear in the laundry. The facial soap worked wonders (way better than the 'just wash with cold water method). It got me wondering what other sort of nonsense it could get rid of. 

I gathered a number of different fabrics and smeared motor oil, lipstick, marker, juice and soy sauce on them, and let the neutrogena sit on them for a while. I swear to sweet jebus, the results were amazing and worked way better than most of the laundry products in my house. 

I imagine it also likely cleans the skin well too, but I never used it for that. 

Edit: Many are asking for a link so here you are: http://www.walmart.com/ip/10805054?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;adid=22222222227010341275&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=40843488152&amp;wl4=&amp;wl5=pla&amp;wl6=78657043712&amp;veh=sem

Edit 2: Thanks for the Gold! I had no idea this story would garner much more than a 'gross, periods'. But you guys have been hilarious and awesome.  If you just saved my favorite cardigan from its foundation stain I'm going to bake you some fucking cookies.

Edit: Guys! I haven't even bought the soap yet! Damn. Will update when I have the results though.

Edit 2: Let some of the soap set in overnight, added a bit more this morning and through it in the wash. I could still see some streaks of foundation when i pulled it out of the wash. Currently waiting for it to air dry so I can see if it even helped at all. I did use the store brand though, not sure if that makes a difference. I may pick up the name brand while out today and give that a whirl. I am documenting it, and will post pics when it's all done. Please update  Seriously, I want to know how those cookies turn out. I think it will. I remember trying it on lots of my makeup, and I'm almost positive I did it with foundation. Good luck!  You, are a true scientist. Science, turning shame into knowledge since periods happen. Duraflame logs were created in 1968 as a by-product of California Cedar Products, whose main business was producing wood slats for pencils. They were looking at a way of reusing the sawdust from making 4 million pencils a day. They hit upon the idea of combining paraffin and the sawdust and extruded the mix to make the product we all know and love.

2.  Buy Louisiana Lottery scratchoffs showing unclaimed top prizes

4.  Profit...maybe 

Update: [Let's see how this goes.](http://i.imgur.com/NdSXLSB.jpg)  According to the Louisiana Lottery Website, [this ticket](http://www.louisianalottery.com/scratch-offs/863/50x-the-cash) has 2 big prizes left out of 4, with 71% of the tickets sold.  It also has the best approximate odds of winning at 1:3.31.

Update 2: I didn't win a damn thing. If you have a high efficiency clothes washing machine and strictly use Tide HE detergent and cold water, your washing machine will quickly grow stinking, rash-inducing fungus. That's why P&amp;G invented a special Tide HE Coldwater formula. But they never told anyone what they knew. So most people are still using the regular Tide. 
Solution: If this is you: buy the Tide Coldwater, an occasional bottle of a different brand, or occasionally run a hot water load. 
*source- family member of a P&amp;G chemist.   you can avoid this entirely by leaving the door open after you empty a load. you have to let the washer air out / dry out to prevemt mold and fungus from growing. IF you are actively trying to conceive, lube lessens the survival rate for sperm.

&gt;Research has found that vaginal lubricants are toxic to sperm and interfere with the role of the cervical mucus.

EDIT: DON'T RELY ON LUBE ALONE TO PREVENT PREGNANCY YA DINGUSES.

EDIT 2: thank you to the 55 ppl who have commented about preseed. TIL there's lube for TTC.  There is actually a lube called Pre Seed that helps the sperm move to the egg better.  It helped me and several friends conceive.   Pre Seed might be the unsexiest lube name I've ever heard.   so you got your friends pregnant, quite a harem you have there. Instructions unclear, she's pregnant in two places now.

Mandatory gold edit: thank you, random peep! move her someplace she isn't pregnant then. Instructions unclear, everywhere is pregnant now.  Mr. Clean Magic Erasers.

Order it early, and like any order from China, you forget about it after a week.  Then, one day, it's like Christmas in Feb/Mar!

edit:  Gold, awww thanks :)  I don't know what that means/does :O Melamine? yeah, they are basically just a special kind of foam that's really good at scraping shit off.  billions of little bristles essentially.  When you are using a Melamine sponge, be aware you're basically using extreeeeemely fine sandpaper. It is also used in sound proofing. So if I covered my walls with these things I could have the orgy of my dreams without pissing off my next door neighbor who goes to bed at like 8pm on a Saturday?

EDIT: My neighbor is a lady, I'm a homosectional. I have no intent of inviting her to the muted orgy. Nearly all 'wasabi' consumed in America is actually horseradish, food coloring, and additives. Actual wasabi is rare and difficult to grow in most environments. Joke's on them.... I love horseradish I don't think this is really a "secret" but men's razors are usually a lot cheaper than women's and wayyyy better. I feel like more women should take advantage of this Yeah but the handle doesn't smell like raspberries, and as a strong independent woman, that's important to me. My girlfriend is all about her subscription to Dollar Shave Club. I really can't understand why that company doesn't try marketing to women. I used to subscribe to DSC but then another redditor told me that their razors are from a company called Dorco. So now I just buy them in bulk from Dorco for a slightly cheaper price, rather than waiting for a cartridge each month. I do like the shave butter from DSC, though. It's good stuff! There are 3 major aluminum can manufacturers competing in the U.S. To find out who made your can look for a small logo that will be placed near the bar-code in most instances. 

Ball is easily the biggest, and their quality shows as well. If you have a can near you now it's probably an 80% chance that it was made by Ball. Quality is as expected, generally good, but you can tell their goal is volume. Necks aren't clean and straight in most cases, but the printing is top-notch. You will see *some* dents at the base, but not a huge amount.

Next up in volume is going to be Rexam. In the industry they're considered the short-bus. If you get fired from another competitor you'll probably end up at Rexam. This shows in quality. The thickness is inconsistent, the printing is mediocre, and the necks almost always have a bunch of marks on them. Dents are common-place all over but look at the edge of the top neck and the bottom edge. Huge volume because they're cheap.

Next in volume (in the US mainly) is going to be little-known MCC. This stands for Metal Container Corporation, which is actually owned by Anheuser-Busch In-Bev. Basically they produce enough so that they can control prices a bit when they buy from Ball. The quality here is impressive. The necks are clean and generally a bit sharper than anyone else. Dents are reduced to almost nil, if you see many it's likely from the filling/packing process.

Does anyone actually give a shit? Not really.

Edit: totally overlooked Crown as it isn't relevant where I live, though IIRC they are on par with Ball for quality. Thanks /u/NerdHearderBrit for that reminder. It's been years since I've seen a Crown can pop up where I live, they don't have any plants in the region where I live.

Edit again: Shit this blew up. Since people seem interested and are asking a ton of questions I'll throw in some more random information about it.

From what I can find MCC is making about 45% of the cans that Anheuser-Busch is using. The rest they buy, *mostly* from Ball IIRC.

Now, if you want to annoy or impress people there's a nifty trick about location that makes it fairly easy to guess who made what cans in your area without even looking. When the cans are made they are shipped by semi-truck to where they will be filled, so companies *really* don't like to truck them very far as it's basically a truck full of air. Start doing some research on where each manufacturer has plants and you can nail it down pretty damn quickly. For instance MCC (the one I'm most familiar with) has only 5 plants in the U.S. If you're near one you'll see more of their cans. You're looking for Arnold, Mo., Jacksonville, Fl., Mira Loma, Ca., Newburgh, N.Y. and Windsor, Co. The closer you are to one of those the more likely you are to see their cans.

To get *really* nifty you can learn who makes the aluminum bottles and *how* they make them. Some manufacturers use basically an extrusion process where they smash the hell out of a pellet of aluminum in a male/female mold and it makes 90% of the shape in one shot. Other manufacturers went the direction of forming each part one step at a time, IIRC the process is about 30 stages wherein *most* of those stages are used to form the neck.

Also, just out of honesty I picked up all of this second-hand from my dad who is in the industry working as an independent contractor all over the world. He knows more about cans than I could *ever* spell out, but if you have really specific questions I can try to dig up some more information. I'm special! My monster can is MCC. I will now begin a life of aluminum can snobbery. The coke can on my desk is Rexam, and somehow that made me feel like a loser just for drinking it.  hahaha

I have a Ball coke can. I must be better than you. Loser. This kind of knowledge reminds me of the styrofoam cups people purchase from fast-food places all the time. There's information on the bottom that no one really cares about, but it tells you a lot about the cup (and can save you from being cheated if you know how to read it).

http://i.imgur.com/2aBI0A1.jpg

Starting at the top, we have the logo (in this case, DART). Dart is the leading manufacturer in styrofoam, food-based products so you'll see these pretty much everywhere), and to the left, a common recycle logo.

The real information is toward the bottom. The dual sets of triple digits on the right side is informative, but not something the customer can use, it just tells the manufacturer where the cup came off of which mold/machine.

At the bottom you'll notice some numbers, followed by alphabetical characters, and then more numbers. The first set of numbers (in the picture it's 14) is the amount of ounces that cup can contain.

The letters are simply the "style" or shape of the cup. Like ID. J is a standard cup shape. The popular ones you'll see are AJ which are designed to fit in car cup holders.

The final numbers correspond to the lid size you need to fit it. However there's a lot of dispute over who supplies the lids so everyone ends up messing each other up. The real information most people would use is that first set of numbers.

Does anyone actually give a shit? Not really. Hydrogen peroxide will clean bloodstains out of just about any fabric in a matter of minutes.  Pretty much take care of the colour for you too..... The base flavor component for Mountain Dew is orange juice concentrate.  If you read the [label](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Fch1k8Td18c/TGTAhfJ6SuI/AAAAAAAAAEI/DwgNCenYapg/s1600/SoftDrinksCitrisOthers-PepsiMountainDew_large_nutrition_25542.jpg) it will tell you, but some people still wonder what flavor Mountain Dew is.  It's HFCS and orange juice paired with citric acid and sodium benzoate.  It's Slurm.      That's horrible! (Sips from his Mountain Dew can.) HeadOn is a homeopathic remedy, meaning it's nothing but wax. No active ingredients.  if you pay attention to the commercials, you'll notice that they never claim the product does anything.  It's great you can sell a product that does nothing. It's only a problem when they pretend and imply (without explicitly saying of course) that it does something. I'm still fine with [this.](https://smthree.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/pet-rock.jpg) My pet rock was ran over by a car a few years ago :( the car kept going That's the saddest story that ever made me burst out laughing at work.

Like when you wear a hat for too long, and it gets all sweaty and gross. Had to look up [the commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_SwD7RveNE)...you're right And it is applied directly to the forehead. I posted this a few months ago, but I felt it's relavent.  
  
Pandora stores the location to current song you're listening to in your browsers cache, so if you're using firefox, you can go to about:cache, find the song and right click / download it.  
  
 Step 1. ) Open pandora in firefox.  
 Step 2. )Type about:cache in new tab.  
 Step 3.) Click "List Cache Entries" under "Memory Cache Device".  
 Step 4.) Under cache entries in the KEY Column you'll see something like this:
 http://audio-dc6-t1-2.pandora.com/access/?version=4&amp;lid=1593138665&amp;
 You know this is the right file because it has a large file size... the one I selected was 2299723 bytes (all other entries were under 10,000 bytes).  
 Step 5.) Left click this link.  
 Step 6.) Right click the link at the top of the next page and save it as whatever.mp4   
  
You now downloaded the song you were just listening to on pandora.   
  
**Edit:** Holy crap my poor mailbox. I'll try to respond to your guys questions, but damn there's a lot of them.  
Secondly, Yes I know there are way easier ways to get songs. The topic of this thread is "secrets of widely used products", to which Pandora is a widely used product, and judging by the thousands of upvotes, and comments; they don't exactly advertise this. This is especially useful to those with a subscription to download higher quality music. :)

EDIT: For those that root your android phone, you can also install Xposed and download songs from the app straight to your device via Pandora Patcher.

EDIT2: For those asking about Pandora Patcher, it's been removed from Xposed repository due to it blocking ads (which is frowned upon by Xposed developers).  You'll have to get a copy via Google.

Other things Pandora Patcher does is block ads, enable unlimited skipping, downloading songs, enable pulldown controls, and enable HD music if you're a Pandora One subscriber. I always thought it was weird that Sunny-D listed canola oil as an ingredient. Something is very off putting about it. 

Edit - Yeah, I get it, Rapeseed Oil.  Most every processed drink has some kind of vegetable or canola oil to make it go down smoother.   Ensure is basically milk protein,  a multivitamin and canola oil. I doubt the reason to use canola oil in Ensure is entirely to do with how it goes down. You need dietary fat or else you'll die, so it's no surprise to find some in Ensure. The reason baby onesies have the unique "foldover" oval-type opening for the head is because it is very stretchy and easily goes over the baby's entire body. Meaning, when the baby poops so much it goes out the diaper and up their back, instead of pulling the onesie UP and over their head and spreading the poop in their hair, you pull the onesie DOWN scraping the poop off their back and taking off the onesie over the diaper. Damn, I have read this 19 years too late! Now I'm not forced to smear shit all over newborns! Very relevant username. *brb* buying condoms Ford Motor Co in the early 1920's produced a lot of lumber scraps and waste at their factories.  So much, they decided to burn it and resell it as charcoal.  This is now Kingsford Charcoal. Something I didn't understand about charcoal was: How can charcoal burn if it's just burnt wood?

It's actually not burnt wood. They [heat the wood in a non-oxygen environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis), so some of it vaporizes, leaving behind just the parts that burn efficiently.

If they burned the wood, they would just get ash.

Edit: Yeah, the heating process is called [Pyrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis), as a few people have mentioned.

Edit: A few people have said you can do this with cloth too, to make charcloth. Neat. I saw a really neat video about traditional ways of doing this, I don't remember where though. They made this massive mound of timber stacked in just the right way, then covered it with earth, and lit a fire inside. Just enough oxygen that it smoldered for days and cooked the wood, then they dug it all out. Amazing!

edit: Here is one that shows it, I saw a much longer one before though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtoA8AfrDg0 Another cool thing about Ford was that he was sick to death of money grubbing shareholders who didn't care about anything but profits.  So he put his son in charge of the company and had his newspapers print that he was starting a "new" car company that would compete with Ford.  Not only was everyone worried his son couldn't handle the company, now his son would be competing against Ford himself.  Ford did this to devalue his company so he could buy it from the shareholders on the cheap and have complete control.

Edit:  If anyone reading this feels compelled to enlighten me on Fords anti-semitism, you're the 8th to do so. Would this be illegal today? yes, selling and buying shares as a major shareholder requires announcements and approval from both the board of directors and SEC weeks in advance. 

Ford's scheme would have been the dumbest thing ever. Telling everyone you are starting another company mean while the news announces that you are buying the largest portion of your company to date.

*Lemon scented, and bacteria free vag!!* It was actually a politely worded ad- it was marketed as a pregnancy preventer.  

"Clean" and "fresh" meant "gets all the sperm out".

Using those cheap latex gloves you can buy just about anywhere are a cheap AND INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE WAY OF PULLING OUT PET HAIR. You simply put on the glove and rub your gloved hand in circles over whatever surfaces (couch, carpet, pillows) that have unwanted pet hair. It pulls it up in a convenient-to-throw-away ball. It's a million times better than using a vacuum. 

I have an Aussie that sheds like a maniac and I break out when there's too much pet hair floating about. This has seriously done wonders for me! Fool proof way to clean up pet hair:

1. Put on as much black clothing you can
2. Get ready to go to something important ( interview, concert, etc.)
3. Walk around your house and avoid all furniture

This will pick up an inordinate amount of pet hair.  Armor all.

Ex car detailer here. This was the absolute worst product in car detailing existence. It does nothing except make your dash slimey, prone to getting very dirty very quickly and (under heat and sunlight) can cause the dash to crack. 

We hated armor all especially because it was a nightmare to remove completely. 

So yeah, your car dash looks glossy for a bit. Or slimey. Whatever. It's also shit. 

-----

**EDIT:** Since everyone is panicking and wondering what should be used instead, I'll repeat what I said below somewhere. Use a dash mat or use nothing. The dash mat will actually protect your dash. No liquid substance will ever protect your dash from the satanic treatment of children and makeup and keys. You're going to sell that car in 5 years - do you really want to wipe slimey shit all over the dash every week in the hopes it won't degrade over time? (It will)

There are some great products for making your dash look shiny in a non glossy way. Swissol make the best, if you want to be that dork who buys $100 cream for his car interior. Maguires are pretty good for consumer available products. Get something that's not glossy or slimy. 

But I still say fuck it and use nothing.  What would you recommend instead? Just clean with a damp cloth and if you want to put something on the plastics use 303 Aerospace Protectant. Stoner Invisible Glass for the windows (it's ammonia-free so won't harm your interior plastics or window tint).

Also tire dressings:
&gt; Goodyear adds antioxidants and antiozonants to the sidewall and tread to help
prevent premature aging from ozone and weather exposure. There are many products on the market that
are advertised to clean tires and to improve appearance and shine. Since many of these may remove the
antioxidants and antiozonants, we do not endorse any of them unless the tires are to be used for display
purposes only. Play Doh was originally sold as wallpaper cleaner in the 1930's until classrooms started using it as modeling clay and it eventually became rebranded as a toy in 1950's. FYI; The reason, why people needed to clean wallpaper, was because back then most homes were heated through coal chimneys. The black coal dust would accumulate on the wallpaper. ...and in their lungs. So, if I inhale play-doh, my lungs become sparkling clean?  Does this mean I can take up smoking again? It was originally branded as Work-Doh. But that name didn't really work doh   

Gold edit: I wanted to personally thank the person who gave me gold, but http://youtu.be/LvKkZhhnuFk It's also fucking delicious.

You only need one alka-seltzer.  
In the 60's a marketing director told the company producing alka-seltzer that he could double their sales.  He did this with the now iconic phrase plop plop fizz fizz in a jingle.  Till that time they had only recommended a dose of one, and this jingle was about rebranding it as a pack of two.  They did in fact nearly double in market size very shortly after releasing this jingle, mostly attributable to people now taking two at a time.  It marks the beginning of larger serving sizes to increase sales. There's a guy in their board meetings biding his time to propose his revolutionary idea of plop plop plop plop fizz fizz fizz fizz. I've got this crazy new idea to improve shaving razors but I'm waiting for the right time. Now with 0 blades! Keeps your beard thick and full!  The dollar no shave club. For pennies a day we'll send you no razors, so you can keep your beard strong and full! In the same vein, you only need a pea sized amount of tooth paste. Adverts show them using way more than you need. While the marketing scheme is most likely true, the idea of "you only need one" is not.

Because Alka-Seltzer contains active drug ingredients the allowable dose is controlled by the FDA; they didn't just take the usual dose tab and put in two.  They halved the active ingredients and doubled the non-active to make two tabs.  You still need both if you want the full dose of meds.   From one of the marketing team involved in the pitch:  
&gt;"We met an attractive doctor at Miles [Laboratories], Dorothy Carter, who demonstrated to us that in order for aspirin to break through the pain barrier it often required two aspirins, not one, to do the job. As aspirin is one of the ingredients that make Alka-Seltzer effective, we asked her if two Alka-Seltzers would be better than one. Yes, two would work better than one.

&gt;But the directions on the package said to take only one. And all the old Speedy commercials demonstrated only one fizzing in water. [We] did a little dance with Dorothy Carter in the laboratory."  &gt; We met an attractive doctor

Off to a great start there. How else am I supposed to describe a broad?

 The Slinky was invented in 1943 by Richard James, a naval mechanical engineer, when he was [developing springs that could support and stabilize sensitive instruments aboard ships in rough seas.](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slinky) He knocked one over on accident and saw how it took a few steps and then landed upright. 

You can also use one to make the [blaster sound effect from Star Wars.](http://youtu.be/aqtqiuSMJqM) Also fun to note that if you hang a slinky from one end and then drop it, the lowest coil of the slinky stays still until the spring compresses.   What's happening is that the spring is compressing at a rate such that the center of mass is accelerating at 9.8 m/s^2 

Its really cool to watch.

Edit: video - http://youtu.be/8UimHnsWSBc The Hitachi Magic Wand is sold as a personal massager, that's kind of right.  It's actually no longer branded with Hitachi because the company didn't want to be connected to vibrators, it's just called the "Magic Wand" now. Interesting how they didn't want to be connected to it since they make the arguably best product in that market.


edit: thanks for 1000 comments about vibrators Hitachi produces tons of other products as well, so it is understandable that they don't want to be called "that company that make the best vibrators"  I couldn't name two products Hitachi makes.  I can name one, though. Motorbike engines. Some people use motorbikes as gigantic vibrators that get you coming while you're going places.

Sewing Machines. Their industrial sewing machines are really good.  Some people use industrial sewing machines as vibrators. It's a surprisingly common after market mod for end users to remove vibration dampeners.

I do not know if they still make washing machines.

Power tools like saws, power sanders, angle grinders and screwdrivers. 

They make excavators. They make bulldozers. They make cranes. They make construction equipment.

They make trains, railways, traffic management systems.

They make airconditioners.

They make security cameras. They make microscopes.

They make lab equipment. http://psg.hitachi-solutions.com/masterplex

They make robots.  They also partner with GE to make nuclear power plants. Nuclear power plants and personal vibrators.  Now we need to combine the two... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi

TL;DR - They make *fucking everything* from tanks to financial agreements. My friend says its because cam girls and others in the sex industry started to refer to them as "my hitachi" so they wanted to nip that in the bud
 Every time I see "Hitachi" on a piece of construction equipment it makes me giggle. The Hitachi jackhammer Off to Ollivander's! I originally got it as a massager for my boyfriend because of his back pain. It never occurred to me that people use it for that reason. I've never been able to achieve a clitoral orgasm anyway so maturbation was just not something I ever, did. Or thought about. 2 weeks later I'm home alone and make eye contact with it, and for whatever reason got super horny. I felt silly. Looked away. Looked back at it. After a few minutes of debating I realized hey no one's around so even if it's silly who cares it's just me here. I grab it, scoot under the covers to hide my shame from the empty bedroom, and off I went. I was 23 at the time. I've never in my life experienced an earth shattering orgasm like the one that blew my mind about a minute in. Basically spent the next few months literally using it every chance I got. Just got home from work? Boyfriend is 10 minutes away? It's Hitachi time! Funny story. This happened when I was about 8. 

My parents used to have two massagers in their room. One was for massaging, and one was, what I now know to be, a magic wand. I was using the magic wand on my back and my dad came in and yelled "AUNTJAEMIMA NO." and then dropkicked me.  
I was obviously pretty traumatized, and he didn't want to have the talk with me yet, and so he bought me a bunch of shit. I'm 19 now, and I asked him if he remembered when he dropkicked me and he started cracking up.  

Edit: It would actually explain why magic wands immediately turn me off whenever I see them in a porn.

Edit 2: I also found one of those pill vibrators in their closet when we were moving. It fell off the closet shelf as I was taking a box down, and I freaked the fuck out. My mom walks in and sees me mortified with the vibrator on the floor and she freaks the fuck out. My dad walks in and starts laughing.

Edit 3: My room was directly opposite theirs, and when I was a kid I had a lot of trouble sleeping. Sometimes I'd just lay in bed and my parents would check on me to see if I was asleep, and I'd pretend that I was sleeping. Every once in awhile I'd hear a really quiet moaning, and I literally thought that shit was a ghost. It wasn't until I found the aforementioned pill vibrator that I realized what the fuck was going on. I told my dad about it, and you know what the motherfucker tells me. "Auntjaemima, ey, auntjaemima, ey, I still got it." 
Keep in mind I'm Korean. 

Edit 4: lmao

Edit 5: My highest rated comment is about child abuse. On a related note: things like this are why I find the systematic assfucking of Adrian Peterson so damn laughable.  I didn't read your username and I thought your dad just had the funniest exclamation ever.

 Found my wife's throwaway.  Oreos are actually a knockoff of another cookie called Hydrox. One of the few cases where the knockoff was more popular then the original. Well yeah. Hydrox sounds like a toilet cleaner. ^^^Hail ^^^Hydrox.  Clean one skid mark, two more will take its place.. The skid marks are easily cleaned but they will return, and in greater numbers. Or a diet pill. Thinking of Hydroxy Cut  And they're vegan. Most baby carrots that you buy in the grocery store are not actually baby carrots, and should be labeled as baby-cut carrots. These carrots start out as regular sized carrots that may have some cosmetic issues. They are cut into pieces and then put through a peeler. It's misleading marketing, I guess, but it's ~~actually a pretty green~~ thing to do, because otherwise the unsightly carrots would probably just get thrown away.

Edit to add: [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNy948H2ta4) a video showing how "baby carrots" are made.

Edit: Apparently not terribly green. Just an assumption on my part.

Edit: To all the folks asking "Do people really not know this?" just scroll through the comments and see how many people were surprised by this information. Additonal carrot fact:  Carrot skin is perfectly safe to eat and doesn't have an unpleasant taste.  You just have to wash the carrots well (as with any vegetable).  It saves a lot of prep time to just leave it on. Many of those "As Seen On TV" products are mostly just common items that you could get for a fraction of the price at the hardware store.

Put some asshole's name on them, and they are suddenly worth $300.00 Food products that specifically advertise high antioxidants are essentially BSing people out of their money. There's natural antioxidants in almost every semi-healthy food and advertisers know that people will buy it because it sounds healthy.  To add to yours, the label "all-natural" is bullshit and meaningless (legally and logically). 

Legally the term 'all-natural' isn't recognized by the FDA so anything can be all-natural. 

Logically, anything can be all natural because we are in nature. 

Also, all-natural doesn't equal good for you. For example, arsenic, lead, and hydrochloric acid are all-natural.  WD 40 kills wasps

 Google returns several links (GameFaqs, EnGadget, IGN, etc) that says this is true. This is not a joke.

One promotes female self-confidence by re-defining beauty while the other advertises itself using highly sexualised images of females. They also own Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream which promotes highly unsexualised bellies. Ice cream is for after sex, or when getting no sex You'd be surprised at everything unilever owns. Next time you're in your bathroom, check all your shit, and then look at your hair sprays soaps and shit hell even some deodorants. If you're from the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, or China and have no clue of what Axe is.

It then boils it down into a simple document with step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce that bug or error, which you then can email to your PC Tech/ IT staff/ family member that's good with computers. Peanut butter gets gum out of your hair. Clothes, pillows, and blankets sold by large retailers are usually saturated with formaldehyde or a similar chemical when manufactured and shipped. This is done to deter insects from eating the cloth, mildew, and provides a more pressed look. Prolonged or repeated exposure can irritate the skin it contacts. Wash cloth items you buy or let them air out if you are unable to wash.

Also a chemical that manufacturers spray on pine (wreaths, christmas trees, garlands) before shipping to keep them preserved and add to the natural aroma can cause all sorts of irritation simply by breathing it.

 Most soap is not actually soap. In order for something to qualify as soap, there must be a certain percentage of ingredients, most notably of vegetable glycerin, which is a by-product of the soap making process. Since vegetable glycerin is super great for your skin, most mainstream soap companies will actually separate the glycerin and sell it at a higher rate (for things like lotion, conditioner, and even vapor liquid now). Then they replace it with chemicals and detergents which essentially do the same thing but way more shittily. I think the FDA has actually passed some regulation on what can be called "soap", which is why certain companies will refer to their products as "beauty bar, cleansing bar, etc". Dove has even tried to market "beauty bars" as being better than boring old soap, but don't buy it- they are just trying to cover up the fact that they are using inferior ingredients.
SOURCE: I used to work for a natural soap company that did not do this Most over the counter sleeping medication (sleep-ez, zzzquil etc) is just repackaged Benadryl which is an allergy medication. Diphenhydramine HCL is the active ingredient in Benadryl and just so happens to make you sleepy as fuck (some people more than others, also you can build up a resistance). 

So don't buy the overpriced 20 pack of sleeping pills for the equivalent cost of a 50 pack of non brand name Benadryl. You're just throwing money away. 

PSA: Never drink after taking a Benadryl unless you like blacking out after three beer. Unless you're broke... In which case go for it.  I may be the only one who finds this extremely interesting, but it's about how t-shirts are made. 

So, ever notice how most of your t-shirts don't have side seams? That's because the body of the shirt is knitted as a tube in the round. This is the fastest way to produce knit fabrics, because no stops are necessary - the machine keeps rotating while the fabric is pulled down. There are 1-2 thousand needles all working at once, and if you have 30-50 packages of yarn attached to the machine, you're knitting 30-50 rows every time the machine rotates (imagine that each new row is staggered slightly behind the row below) - which it does multiple times a minute. Now you know why t-shirts are so cheap! But, the machine size is fixed, you can't make the circle larger or smaller. So do they have different sizes of machines to correlate with different sizes of t-shirts? 

Nope. That would be a waste of money for the company because the machines themselves are so expensive. So instead, they alter the tightness of the yarn being threaded into the machine. If the yarn is tighter, the tube of fabric will constrict when it exists the machine, resulting in a smaller tube (small sizes). If the yarn is loose, the fabric will not constrict so much, resulting in a larger tube (large sizes). This means that small size shirts are more tightly knit, and have a higher cover (kind related to thickness-how much can you see through the fabric) while larger sizes are looser and have less cover. Fabric cover doesn't translate directly into product quality (there's many other factors), but it is considered - you don't want a see through shirt. 

And that's the dirty secret behind your t-shirts. Smaller sizes = slightly better quality.  &gt; So, ever notice how most of your t-shirts don't have side seams?

i don't think I have one t-shirt without seams on the side. Hi, I work in a textile manufacturing company, making tubular-knit cloth and tee shirts. We're one of the few such companies remaining in the United States. 

The process to make the cloth is as you described, we use big machines that knit cones of cotton or polyester yarn into a "tube" that becomes the body of your t shirt.

However, we do use several different sizes of machines, to make various sizes of these tubes.  And the cloth will normally be made larger and then compacted (pre shrunk) to the proper tube size after it is knit.

But here is the thing... Regardless of which size you buy, we have to make sure that your shirt meets the yield requirements of our customer, when they order the shirts. So if, for instance, they want the cloth to weigh 6 ounces per square yard, we make sure that ALL the cloth for that customer weighs that much, regardless of the garment size. YMMV, this is just how we are required do it. After shaving, run your razor forward against a towel about 20 times. It will sharpen the razor and make it like new. I'm going on 10 months with the same razor. Before that, I had a year on a disposable razor. It works and it saves you a ton of money.

Edit: It hones the blade. It doesn't sharpen it. Thank you for the explanation below. The actual time you extend your blade will vary depending on how much you have to shave but it will definitely extend the life of the blade saving you big bucks if you buy premium razors.  It doesn't actually sharpen the blade, it hones it. Removes burs and straightens out folds of the metal. 

It's similar to when you see chefs use the metal rod against their knives, it's not sharpening it, it's honing it.

*EDIT*: Alton Brown shows a really good example of this: [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVCM5BfeA8c#t=286) If anyone else is wondering just what the difference is, apparently sharpening involves removing material, whereas honing just reshapes material. Don't use a towel, but use jeans. 

Edit: Tips! I've been shaving my head and face a couple times a week for the last 4-5 years, so I've picked up some things. If you shave regularly, invest in Dollar Shave Club. It's VERY cheap (compared to how expensive razors are), and they send them through the mail. You can get them to send you razors every month or every other month, and you can cancel at any time. Since I shave my head, I tend to replace the razors every 3-4 weeks (while honing them on my jeans), because it's much easier to cut your head than your face. I have a bulk supply of razors now that have been adding up, so it's nice to have. I believe they send 5 two-blade razor replacements for $2 a month (or bi-monthly), 4 four-blade replacements for $6 a month (or bi-monthly), and 4 six-blade replacements for $9 a month (or bi-monthly). I personally use the four-blade replacements for my face and head, and I only pay $6 every other month. They send you a new handle every year. 

Also, try running your razor on your jeans with a new blade, and don't start now if it's not new. Run the razor forward about 20 times BEFORE and AFTER you shave. Also, for best razor maintenance, try and keep it as dry as possible after shaving to prevent any minor rusting (most people replace their blades before they get that rusty, but even minor rust can mess up your shave. You can do this by shaking the razor vigorously in your sink to get the bigger water particles off, and then blowing on it to try and dislodge the rest. Do this before you hone your blade against your jeans (also so you don't get water all over your jeans). Don't use jeans, use a smooth leather belt. or your arm, which is essentially just fresh leather Just shave one time the right way and 20 times the wrong way.

*Clarification: Many perceived products that many think are ice cream are not. Example; Breyers and Nestle often sell frozen desert products in place of ice cream products. This does not mean these companies don't produce ice cream but that it is not all real.  Lou: I went to the McDonald's over in Shelbyville the other day.

So much of that show was lost on me when I first saw them, rewatching old simpsons is my favorite thing. I still notice new jokes from time to time that I hadn't picked up on before. Aside from maybe You Only Move Twice, or monorail, it may be my favorite. I don't get how ~~Duff Gardens~~ **Selma's Choice** doesn't make the tops of peoples' lists. 

Spoilers:

It's got the grandma's will being read.

Homer and the sandwich.

TWO characters turning green.

Jub Jub's introduction.

Patty and Selma at their finest. 

That song.

Lisa being the Lizard Queen.

Homer eating that fucking sandwich.

Homer eating that fucking sandwich. Two more feet, and I can fit it in the fridge!  Awesome episode. "give her these,... then these,... and then these." 
  
"thank you doctor. "
  
" oh I'm not a doctor! " whats the name of the episode?

Edit: "22 short films about springfield" S7 E21, credit to /u/m0rd1  "22 Short Films About Springfield" thank you! Calling /u/Squalor- Is this the one where Lisa builds that small robot and when it explodes Homer catches its head and closes its eyes?  No. That's an episode called Trilogy of Error.

"Linguo dead?"

"Linguo. Is. Dead" I thought it was just the chief wiggum stories that were pulp fiction references. I'm pretty sure Steamed Hams didn't make an appearance in the movie. *Yarrr! Have ye tried a Baltic squid? They can suck the bolts out of a submarine's hull.* What episode is it? It's from an episode called "22 Short Films About Springfield"

http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/22_Short_Films_About_Springfield I just watched it because an entire simpsons episode that references Pulp Fiction sounded fun, but it's no quite. The episode is called 22 Short Films About Springfield and about 3 of the stories are Pulp Fiction references, so not quite but kinda yeah. People, if you feel this is (or isn't) a Pulp Fiction reference, [here is the scene for comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pkq_eBHXJ4). There's another one in that episode, wiggum and snake chase each other into a pawn shop and then milhouse walks in and finds a gimp mask. It's great  Royale with Cheese What is this from? When I worked at KFC we were told to not refer to Krushems as milkshakes, since they are a "dairy slush". Also no one ever cleans the Krushems machine. Delicious.  The fuck is a krushem?  A dairy slush from KFC. Not a milkshake. Goddamnit I love the Simpsons. They bundled a joke about a reference into another joke. Brilliant. ...this is the second reference to a single Simpsons episode in one thread, and it's a completely different reference


Simpsons did it, folks  I've got donuts.  I know what I'm getting, some donuts Whats with the season 7 Simpsons references in this thread?! I made enough gazpacho for all! You don't win friends with salad!  Idk the mix looks/tastes/smells/goesbad like cream... Yeah it doesn't just melt, it goes all frothy and filmy, not chunky like you'd expect. That doesn't mean it's cream. It also *doesn't* taste anywhere near as good as real ice cream. "Well, I know what I'm gettin': donuts!" Anyone have a link to this? What episode is this from? It's from an episode called "22 Short Films About Springfield"

http://www.snpp.com/episodes/3F18.html

Edit: Sorry, this is a better link: http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/22_Short_Films_About_Springfield yes, there are Pulp Fiction references, but the title of this episode, '22 Short Films about Springfield' is a direct reference to the film '32 Short Films About Glenn Gould' Mmmmm.....frozen partially hydrogenated soybean oil. I accidentally left a tub of the store-brand stuff on top of the fridge over night.  It separated into about 50-50 clearish liquid, and whitish liquid.  The clear stuff was heavier.  I didn't dare open it. I scream, you scream, we all scream for frozen partially hydrogenated soy-bean oil!
 True ice cream in infinitely better. Had some of this in Venice beach post tongue piercing. It never made it into my mouth (thank Pete) because I poked it with my thumb and it didn't melt, just made a thumb mold. Just no. As long as it's not Palm oil glahhahagghghahagag. But it's 99c only! important to note is they usually have to print the labeling WITHOUT the words "ice cream"unless it meets a certain specification. otherwise you'll see "frozen dairy desert" or some such. if it says ice cream it's probably safe to eat, the other stuff just tastes like blood.

e: this applies to lots of things. .. i get suspicious by default if a product doesn't specifically say what it is. sunny d never claims to have much or any juice, lots of butter things are "butter*y*", etc. American slices - legally, we're not calling this cheese. There's even further sub-categories -- "Pasteurized Process Cheese", which is still made from cheese and a set list of optional ingredients, "Pasteurized Process Cheese Food" which is at least half cheese and the rest is similar optional ingredients and dairy byproducts like whey, and "Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Product" which basically has no rules at all (this is what Kraft singles or Cheese Whiz are).

That said, despite how much I hate the taste of things like Kraft singles, I have had some Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Product that was pretty tasty before.  Italian-cheese flavored with a bit of a sweet note to it and melted quite nicely. Like how most holiday chocolates are actually "chocolate flavored candy".


Fuck you Palmers and your brown wax. It tastes like...blood? What?  I have tasted many frozen-flavored fake desserts and none of them have tasted especially like blood. I am curious about this too. Maybe he's getting all his frozen desserts in vampireville. Same with "chocolaty".   Cheeze with a z. [deleted] I noticed this with laundry detergent and liquid fabric softener.  You have to look for the fine print to make sure you have the right one. Also the size that most people perceive as the "half gallon" is no longer a half gallon.  They rounded the corners and tapered the sides to reduce the volume. This avoided a significant change to the overall height and width that people would notice.  "CHOCOLATE**Y**" chips! Like cool whip. Its just oil and a bunch of chemicals. It is beyond me how anyone picks that over real whipped cream.  Eh... Cool whip has a completely different taste than whipped cream though. I consider them to be totally different products, and they each go with different foods.

For instance, on a chocolate pie: whipped cream without question. Cool whip on a chocolate pie would be disgusting IMO.

But on jello: cool whip, definitely. Whipped cream would seem too... "rich" on jello.

Now if you told me that I could only have one for the rest of my life, I would pick real whipped cream over cool whip. Because whipped cream is fundamentally better. But again, on certain foods I prefer cool whip.

Wow I can't believe I just wrote all that about cool whip. Cool hwip I feel as though I am one with you.  I have two reasons.

Dairy causes my digestive system to behave like some terrible flume ride hastily assembled at a state fair.  You aren't sure you're going to make it, there's brown liquid everywhere, and there will probably be crying by the end.

Pecan pie. cool hwhip Besides the ice cream thing (looking at you Breyers for fucking up Vanilla Bean Ice Cream with your non-dairy bullshit), "wyngz" is another fun one.

http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/02/04/wing-less-wyngz-the-new-fast-food-favorite/

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyngz Oh god, wyngz &gt; it's probably safe to eat

i mean it's still food This is all very true but the picture on the box still depicts what the average person would deem as ice cream. Not saying it as a defense but still not a fair play in my mind. Some stuff also calls itself frozen milk, which is also pretty bad. Source: I worked the frozen/dairy section at a grocery store. But even ice cream has gum in it now  Or things that are 'chocolatey'...

Shudder... i know! i wont buy ice cream from the grocery store anymore because of this! 2006 was a sad year for me. that's the year i discovered bryers are a bunch of lying fucking assholes. they sell me oil and foam under the guise of being ice cream.

*edit maybe i should clarify. I have an awesome organic farm about 45 min away from me. I buy my ice cream from them when I have a craving now. also because it's so far away, I enjoy it more because it's a special treat now. There's still good ice cream out there. You just have to read the labels, or even better, make your own. Yeah, it's not even close to a "majority".   Considering hand-churned ice cream is a pain in the ass to make if you don't have a machine and haagen-dazs costs about seven bucks a tub in my area, it's worth admitting to yourself that mcdonald's ice cream cones taste just fine and save yourself time and money.

Making frozen yogurt is much easier too. Machines are pretty cheap and readily available. They start under $30 new, and they pop up in thrift shops pretty regularly. You do need to plan ahead a bit for your ice cream, but the quality difference is just ridiculous. Like everything else homemade, you'll just have to weigh for yourself the quality vs effort. I was not much of an ice cream fan, and I always thought those machines were mostly novelty. Then, my sister made some, and it was delicious. No comparison to what I thought of as ice cream beforehand. Just read the labels in the grocery store. Even the crappy Cub I usually go to has some real ice cream. Just find the ones where the first ingredient is cream.  If it's called "ice cream" on the label there are federal requirements of how much cream must be in there. But yeah Bryers switching to "dessert" sucked. Reminds me of this epic post:

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/20m9wp/what_productitemappliance_will_you_never_ever_buy/cg4ob7o I think some of the more traditional bryers flavors are still ice cream. I doubt the recipe is the same as it used to be, but things like vanilla and chocolate still say ice cream on the label. Hey, your username rhymes. It does! Wasn't the entire marketing campaign of Bryers built around the fact they use real ingredients while their competitors used stuff like "polysorbate 80"? Like, their commercials had little kids trying to read the label of their competitors and then read theirs. Theirs was always "milk, cream, sugar, vanilla" or whatever. Not all Bryers varieties are "Frozen dairy desserts", there are still some that are "Ice Cream."  Their "natural vanilla" is still very good in comparison to most in a grocery store.

Natural vanilla ice cream ingredients: milk, cream, sugar, tara gum, natural flavor.

Breyers extra-creamy vanilla frozen dairy dessert: milk, sugar, corn syrup, cream, whey, mono and diglycerides, carob bean gum, guar gum, carrageenan, natural flavor, annatto (for color), vitamin A palmitate, tara gum.


 Unless you are lactose intolerant like me Ben &amp; Jerry's is still real. Same with Brigham's, if they sell it in your area. Some of Turkey Hill's are too, but not all of them. Blue Bell is. I might be biased because I live in Texas, but I only buy Blue Bell. You my friend need to find [Blue Bell](http://cdn.bluebell.com/what_were_crankin_out/our_ice_cream.html) cause that shit is fantastic! I would love to try that, but i'm canadian, never heard of it before. looks great though. I'd recommend trying Chapman's ice cream then. It is the best ice cream I've found that is available widely in grocery stores in Canada. Fuck yeah Chapman's represent Blue bell is great but it's only available in certain states. I was not aware of that. All I know is that it's here in NC and I love it! Some of the best Ice Cream I've ever had and we make our own as well.  It's in Indiana as well. I live in Houston and in like 3rd grade you got to go to the Blue Bell factory in Brenham. Also, if you have Blue Bell available and get anything else you are crazy. I have to ship it up to the north because I don't live in Texas anymore :( you can order full gallons of it through Outback Steakhouse, it's pricey but it's Blue Bell  I think it's a southern thing. I've lived in Mississippi and Texas and a few of my Northen friends have no idea what it is. Same thing with Krystal/Whitecastle I bought some this year and it seemed like it was less dense and more whipped. Very disappointing. I stick with Ben and Jerry's now.


Seems like companies are doing this with mayonnaise, too (less dense). I can't find one that seems normal (or what used to be normal).


On the same subject, it seems like paper towels are going to shit, too.  If you have Kroger near you chances are you can find Graeter's. By far the best ice cream I have ever had. Plus the chocolate chips are more like chocolate chunks.  Found the Texan. 

Source: Texan who is also obsessed with Blue Bell.  Blue bell made me realize that most other store bought ice cream tastes like plastic.  Last I checked, the only real ice cream is B&amp;J and Haagen-whatever. Turkey Hill still makes real ice cream.  Their regular line still has more milk and cream than other ingredients, and their all natural line has no additives at all. personally, once i'm playing those prices for ice cream, i'd rather buy local made from the farm. (which is what i do) Just buy Ben and Jerry's and Hagen-Dazs and you'll be fine. Gelato my friend.  Your taste buds will thank you for it.  i want to try this, only ever seen it down in the city though. someday I had an argument a year ago with some old fucks who still believed that Bryer's is real ice cream. Before they were bought by Unilever they had an ad about their all-natural ingredients, and I guess after a certain age people just stop trying to update their knowledge of the world. I had just come from the store and read the labels, but somehow I was still wrong...
 What?  I'm 28 and remember that commercial.  I always bought Breyer's natural vanilla on the rare occasions I buy ice cream, because the ingredients are basically milk, cream, sugar, and vanilla bean.  Am I an old fuck? That's not for all flavors. You gyus are all wrong. Breyer's does sell real ice cream, they also sell frozen dessert...Just fucking read a label. Specifically, I was arguing that I saw fake Breyer's at the store. They were arguing that *all Breyer's* is real. Not all of Breyers is frozen dessert. And Turkey Hill's ice cream really is ice cream.  It happened when they were taken over by Unilever (that's right, the soap company). They still do make a "natural" line but it's hard to distinguish and it's still not as good.

I don't know if their sales went down, but they definitely lost me as a loyal customer. That's why I only ever buy Haagen Dazs. It's a little more expensive but it's one of the few that you can buy at the grocery store that are actually ice cream. Bryers used to be so good.

So sad now.

My friends Ben and Jerry will cheer me up. Doesn't change the fact that double churned 'ice cream' tastes really, really good.  To be honest I never bought breyers before they changed formulas.  If I'm gonna pay an arm and a leg for natural ice cream I may as well get ben and jerrys in my mind.

Their new formula is a lot, lot more affordable for poor college students. Is Ben and Jerry's real ice cream? Do you not have a Publix or a Ben and Jerry's near you? You can still find proper ice cream. Just look at what it's called and the ingredients You should see if you can get raw milk ice cream from them.  Bryers' natural vanilla flavor is real! Not so fast there - Bryers Vanilla is just Milk, Creme, Sugar, Tara Gum, and natural flavor. Not exactly a bunch of oil and foam.

http://www.breyers.com/product/detail/113591/natural-vanilla
 There are still a few brands that produce real ice cream. If you find one that just has milk, cream, and sugar as ingredients (plus the flavorants), then that is the real stuff. Probably won't be as good as your local farmer's though. their vanilla is so good :) I really do enjoy it. their version of chocolate is more like dark chocolate. it's very rich!

they also do fancy flavours. stuff like green tea ice cream. i'll leave that for the specialty restaurants in the area that serve it. (i've had it and it's good, just not for me) Hint for spelling the word 'dessert'...there are 2 of the letter S, because you always want to come back for seconds.  Which country are we talking about here? I'm pretty sure they just sell actual ice-cream in my country. I was going with the United States and Canada. It is very common to see Frozen Desert here with Ice Cream. They look identical but unless you look at the box, you would not know. The taste is close but not perfect by any means either. I am amazed how many people never read the labels.  Not just the ingredient list, but the actual label on the front of the container.   People are lazy and don't want to spend time reading. We are all about colors to identify what we want. And also the companies are pretty sneaky about it. I wouldn't have known if I didn't read about it on the internet. It's in small print and it certainly resembles ice cream... most people don't assume companies are trying to trick them.  To be fair, they're all in the same freezer together. The aisle has a giant sign that reads "Ice Cream." And the pictures on all the boxes definitely look exactly like ice cream.

It's easy to get focused on what flavor you want. Plus you're not suspecting that someone has replaced the ice cream with fake ice cream. To be fair, it's in small print down at the bottom of the container saying "Frozen Dessert". Where I live even the shittiest store brand ice cream is made from milk, cream, and sugar. whew. thank you Turkey Hill - just had to check my tub of Dutch Chocolate. Ingredients: Milk, Cream . . . Turkey Hill is the only one I buy. Despite the weird name. I love Turkey Hill, always so cheap too. Thank you Kroger! So it is vegan. Not to mention the  high fructose corn syrup. Say what you will about it, but that stuff does not belong in ice cream. Yet its in almost every thing I found this great little Amish place in Sarasota that sells realllll Ice cream.. so delicious  Yep, nothing beats the real stuff. Fortunately for me, there is a company headquartered nearby me that makes fantastic gelato and sorbet, both of which are made without any oils, corn syrup, colorings, or preservatives. So yummy. Y'all motherfuckers need Kawartha Dairy So damn good! Getting me an ice cream maker is probably the best decision wife's ever made. OMG the difference! That's why you only go with Blue Bell.  Only in states near Texas!

Never move North. You'll lose Bluebell, Mrs. Bairds, chicfila, shiner, and who knows what else. I hear Gatorade isn't as big a thing up in the frozen North. Dairy Queen also uses non-dairy "frozen dessert" in their soft serve machines.  The mix doesn't need refrigeration, and it's also mold-resistant so that if you forget to clean out the machine one night when you close, it's still safe.  Petroleum byproduct is also an added ingredient, which I was told was to prevent gumming up the machinery, minimize melting, and give the soft serve a smooth texture.

Source: I worked too long at Dairy Queen Please tell me blue bell isn't on of these. It'll just ruin my day if blue bell is a lie :( Blue Bell is normal ice cream. Some of the flavors are even more pure. I want to say the natural vanilla bean flavor is just milk, cream, and sugar (plus something gum). Dessert has 2 s's. Like you're going back for seconds.   This is why it doesn't really melt if left in the sun.  Eew. Breyer's A little awareness is all it takes to make sure you get the real deal.

When you buy ice cream, avoid anything that says "frozen desert" or "frozen treat" or any variation on "light and fluffy." Real Ice cream will say "ICE CREAM" on it. And when in doubt, you can check the ingredients. Not in the US. It might look like ice cream, but it's never called that if it doesn't actually have dairy in it I've seen frozen desert with the ice cream, but it's hardly the majority and I always check the labels. In Canada anyway.  Holy crap. Frozen desert. Awesome.Got any pics? I noticed this a few years back while working a second job at walmart. I thought the reason they couldn't call it ice cream was because there is a very strict definition of what actually constitutes ice cream in America and it has to do with the amount of Milk Fat to calories or Milk Fat to actual fat in the product. Because a lot of companies like Bryers add candy bars and chocolate and other fattening ingredients to their "ice cream" it increases the calories and fat in the product and therefore does not meet the standards for what constitutes as ice cream, hence the frozen dessert tag. Yup! This is correct.

Its why the only ice cream I buy explicitly says "Ice Cream" instead of "Frozen Dairy Desert" This is an american thing. Canadian as well. I was at a grocery store when Breyer's was transitioning, found a container of Breyer's Rocky Road Ice Cream and one of Breyer's Rocky Road Frozen Dairy Dessert next to each other.  Must've spent 10 minutes trying to figure out the differences. To my knowledge, only Breyers is consistently "Frozen Dessert". Most brands are still Ice Cream.

I also live in Wisconsin, so who knows. I started paying attention to this recently. Breyers is the worst. Most of theirs is not labelled as ice cream. The only flavors that can pass as ice cream are the really basic flavors, like some of the vanillas and strawberry. The rest are "frozen dairy dessert." 

The store brand, which is also much cheaper, is actually more natural, since it's actually made from cream and sugar.

They should really teach kids how to read ingredients lists in elementary school.  There's also these things called ["quiescently frozen confections"](http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/question499.htm) that some people know as Popsicles.
 So that's why I can buy a gallon of cheap ice cream for $2.50, but making a gallon at home with heavy cream costs $19 just for the ingredients. Finding real ice cream is tricky, but not that difficult.  just don't buy the cheapest stuff.  For sure one product you don't buy on the cheap side. Food is one thing I never compromise on. I don't think gelatos are susceptible to this. Gelato is better anyways. I always make sure to check that before I commit to buying. Frozen dessert is gross. Don't mind this at all, prefer the artificial stuff really dollar for dollar and if sales are any indication so do most people.  I just try and forget about the fact that I'm eating an imitation product and enjoy. This is actually a good thing for people who have milk allergies.  Alton Brown, king of cooking, taught me through his show that you can find good ice cream by weight after you've ruled out the fake frozen dessert crap. Good ice cream will be heavier than bad ice cream, because it has less air in it.  It's not a majority.  Breyer's is the only one I've had recently that is branded frozen dairy desert.   WalMart brand does it as well. There is more than think. I was just in Wal-Mart last week and was actually surprised at the amount of ice cream brands that were actually *real* ice cream because I had also been led to believe that a "majority" were now frozen dairy dessert.  At least 8/10 were real ice cream.   http://products.nestle.ca/en/brands/ice-cream/confectionery-frozen-treats/oreo-frozen-dessert.aspx  
  
Nestle is also guilty of it and there products are often carried in WalMart as well. well, maybe in the states. There'd be riots if that was the case in europe. My girlfriend and I just got some of this on accident.  We always get real ice cream, but we hastily bought some of this bullshit because it was on sale and didn't realize what we've done until we got home. That's one of the many reasons I love Blue Bell. It's made with real cream and is beastly ice cream in general.  What on earth?  That's just not true.  What brand name ice cream are you thinking of?  Dreyer's, Blue Bell, Ben and Jerry's, and Haagen Daaz account for almost all sales and all their ingredients start with Milk, Cream, Sugar . . . So called brand ice cream people know and like. Companies like Breyers and Nestle do it all the time and they are two of the biggest producers of frozen desert/ice cream in the market. Majority?  I don't think so.  Citation needed. hence why I called it so called. I need to know if this applies to Ben and Jerry's. No you're safe there. Ugh, yes, and it is so NOT the same taste.  Read labels carefully, people! Dairy Queen sells "Cool Treats" now, not Ice Cream.

 In Canada, there's very few products labelled "ice cream" in the supermarket freezers now. Apparently to be ice cream, it needs to be: not less than 36 percent solids, not less than 10 per cent milk fat, or where cocoa or chocolate syrup, fruit, nuts or confections have been added, 8 percent milk fat, and not less than 180 grams of solids per litre of which amount not less than 50 grams shall be milk fat, or, where cocoa or chocolate syrup, fruit, nuts or confections have been added, 180 grams of solids per litre of which amount not less than 40 grams shall be milk fat.

Source: http://www.novascotia.ca/just/regulations/regs/disch3.htm I can easily tell if an ice cream brand is made with actual cream/milk or not...because I am lactose intolerant. XD

Fake ice cream is my kinda ice cream! I'm a man, but I love using women's shampoo. The products available for ladies are vastly superior in every way. They leave my hair looking and feeling silky smooth, and I smell so, so good. A couple of people have asked me what I use to keep my hair looking so nice and I just feel fabulous. I'm currently using Summer Passion by Herbal Essences, but I also have a Chanel one for special occasions. Because I'm worth it. The complete opposite for razors. Ladies' razors are just crap compared to those for men. Yeah, my wife uses men's razors and I use women's hair dye and shampoo.  On top of using men's razors, I also use men's shaving cream for my legs. I have ultra sensitive skin. Something about the thickness of the cream really helps reduce irritation. Plus it's generally cheaper. I think the cream is made like that because beards are actually a bunch of tiny razors that grow on your face.  dude fuck hair dye. ive been gray since i was 25 and ive been killing it. i have my own show on cnn and everything Wolf Blitzer?  Anderson Cooper Saying you have your own show on CNN is like bragging about having a show on Public Access television. How many hot women are on public access shows? CNN definitely have hottie's that I use for my fap sessions. My wife uses *my* razors. I always have to search for them on the countertop or bathtub. Not that I'm complaining. I'd rather a smooth wife than easily located razors any day. Word up. This is how me and my SO do it, and it effectively halves our costs on toiletries. &gt; hair dye

Why?

(edit) Holy shit guys it was just a question, not trying to judge, I guess I should have said:

Hey man (I'm assuming, you could be a lady or transgender or non gender identifying, I don't know you), it's a bit out of the social norm in most countries for biological males to use hair dye. While I may not agree with the taboo I am still curious and felt like asking: for what reason do you use hair dye? Are you an actor, model or part of some other profession that your job requires or encourages a non natural hair color or do you just like the way it looks?

Jesus tits, Reddit. No problem -- because I started getting gray hair at an early age (late teens). So I dye it out of vanity. I'd probably look good with salt and pepper hair, but I prefer to look younger. 

Men's hair dyes have a very poor selection -- basically blonde, brown, black. Women's have dozens of shades in multiple brands, and there are frequent sales. 

By using women's I'm able to find a shade that matches my natural color (light ash brown) and generally pay $2 or $3 less per box.  If you can, you should stop using the box crap and use the stuff professionals use. $5 for a tube of dye and a bit more for a crap ton of developer. It's cheaper and lasts longer. I started going that route when I had to pay $20 for crappy box dye because I had so much hair. It's kind of an investment but if you dye it all the time it's worth it.  To dye his hair of course. I think guys dye their hair for the same reason as girls. Because they want to. Parks and Rec S03E06

I thought you were kidding, but that is really the name of the product... http://gillette.com/en-us/products/razor-blades/fusion-proglide-flexball-razors/fusion-proglide-manual-razor-with-flexball You fell so hard for the marketing and you weren't even the target demographic. Gillette would call that a win. You sounded just like an ad. I would go out and buy one but I get 4 razor heads every month for $10 at dollarshaveclub. I currently have about 15 razor heads. Too many. You can change it to every other month til you catch up or at least stop accumulating so quickly. I like Mach 3 better You know, everyone mocks the whole "MORE BLADEZ" thing... but it's actually a darn good razor.

I own both a Mach 3 and an old-fashioned safety razor. I use the safety razor exclusively on my face, but the Mach 3 is much easier to use and gives a better shave on my head.
 At what point was I supposed to stop reading in the Chris Traeger voice? do you not read everything in his voice? I prefer Sam Seaborn however.

Annnnnn Perkins! I like the dorco version of the mach 3.  Much much cheaper.  Same razors the shave for a dollar shave club guys sell.  Their three blade is basically a clone of the mach three.

Amusing that the dollar shave club guys motto is "stop overpaying for razors" when they are reselling dorco razors at a (admittedly small) premium. does it really work well on the lady bits? I feel like I'm having a crisis about what to do about that area. I've tried self waxing... it's not super pleasant. Shaving with the razors I've been using, I can do it once or twice when they're brand new and never again b/c of the razor burn.  I couldn't help but read that in their voices. You can LIT-TRILY hear them talking. I have never lied about anything in my life. Though, I suppose you could construe camouflage as a lie. Ha I just saw the new episode too! Best line of last night's episode. But I thought what Donna did for Larry was great. Spoliers man! Now i'm pre awwing to something i don't even know about yet?! I spoiled nothing. What Donna did for Terry is still a mystery.  Ann Perkins! () I don't know who to believe anymore.  As someone who shaves his head I can definitely say that lady razors work far better at contours. not for me.  schick extreme 3 disposables are the best i've found for shaving my head - they're flexible in the center.  concave fits my round head best.    

i tries Venus blades on my head once - very bad idea.

howeveri use the Venus handle with Mach3 blades for my face.  best handle i've found. I used Venus blades on my face once. It was a mistake I won't make again. Ann's character is so lame after the first couple seasons Ben replaced her as the straight-man to Leslie's antics so she kinda became useless. boooooooooooo Double edge safety razors for life! Really? I found that women's disposable razors are much smoother than men's back when I used disposable razors. /r/wicked_edge shameless plug. I have a Merkur 39C slant bar razor that I've never been happier with, gives me an absolute perfect shave. EJ89 user checking in.  I love that thing.   So my wife kept cutting herself every time she shaved her legs with her venus pink whatever the fuck. So I decided that I would try shaving her legs with my Merkur 34C + Feather blades and smoothest shave she has ever had and no cuts. She now uses my safety razor and lathers her own hot foam because it is just so much better.

The only time I use crap razors is when I travel, because heaven forbid I bring my shaving kit on a plane... I might shave someone to death... Yet half the time they are still more expensive because since im female I must obviously want it to be pink or some other color. Its like here pick through a rainbow to find the cheap uncolored ones. And dollar shave club is NOT worth the savings  You mean NOT worth the shavings, right? Amiright? 

I'll see myself out Agreed. I switched from Gillette's three-blade razors to DSC's three-blade razors and they were way worse. Must be why my wife constantly steals mine! It's like, hey, if your razors suck, QUIT FUCKING BUYING THEM! Buy the men's ones! It's not rocket science. Quit stealing mine so when it's time for me to shave I'm stuck with some bullshit hotel single blade(I never find out she stole them until I'm in a hotel)! 
 Go talk to her instead of us! Also for womens deodorant. Men's deodorant works 10x better and costs the same or less than womens. I didn't believe my wife when she kept insisting my razors were better. We now have two men's razor handles and only buy men's razors. I still haven't learned the valuable lesson that I'm always wrong... And shaving cream. Women's is also a ton more expensive.  Proud man here, doing the same thing. Get compliments all the time!

Edit: I'm being asked what kind I use. Herbal Essences, that orgasmic smelling purple Aussie stuff, and right now I'm using Keratin Complex. It has protein in it for hair, feels fucking amazing. Girls are jealous of my hair all the time.

Edit 2: Those asking how I buy it? At a cashier like normal. Idgaf what they think about what I'm buying. Or self checkout for those who are still timid. Superb. It warms the cockles of my heart that there are others out there like me. 

I only discovered the luxury of women's shampoo by accident. I had just finished depositing my regular 7am poop one morning, when I realised I had no toilet paper. Now, it's amusing how the simple removal of a toilet roll can turn one into prehistoric man - I was about to begin bashing empty shampoo bottles together in an attempt to make a makeshift poop shovel, when I actually read the text on one of my girlfriend's bottles. The blurb on the back said that the shampoo contained a "sensual blend of Sicilian citrus" and there was some more talk of Bulgarian rose and jasmine and whatnot. I used her shampoo that evening, and it was *incredible*. Resultant of the various scents that were exuded, when I closed my eyes, I genuinely thought I was bathing naked in the tropical forests of Panama while birds chirped merrily and dappled sunlight shone through the canopy. And the rest, as they say, is history.

Another thing that I like to do, mainly after shaving, is use my girlfriend's Montagne Jeunesse peel-off face mask.  As some of you will have experienced, if you apply PVC glue to your fingers and let it harden, you can peel off the gluey skin that forms - that's what the face mask is like, but it feels ten times as good. But how did you clean your ass? I can't go into detail, but it involved a shower curtain and an ornamental set of flowers.  He doesn't know how to use the 3 seashells 

Edit: Wow Thanks for the gold! For those who don't know the [reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdnuOa7tDco)
and here are some [instructions](http://i.imgur.com/GUBaZX3.jpg) on how to use the 3 seashells What happens when you have diarrhea? Seashells make for excellent cups.  Tea party anyone? I'm still waiting for the great Franchise Wars to leave us with only Taco Bell for restaurants. Well in case he forgot and anyone else for that matter...

http://m.imgur.com/gallery/NAI0SoG I can never figure out how to use the third Trapped in only room in the house with a built in ass washing system (shower), destroys shower curtain and flowers (?) with dung. 

__
 Instructions unclear, curtain and flowers stuck in ass. Did you not have tissues, napkins, or paper towels, either? I love you. Ah, the ol Macgyver cleaning I had to use a similar solution. Except I was on a train in Taiwan using one of those hole toilets. You could just wash it.  But there was a shower right there. I lost it at 'makeshift poop shovel.' Hope you find it. Good ol' Zylver, always around to ask the probing questions! [deleted] Asking the real questions  Lather asshole with shampoo and rinse. I shave between my asscheeks in order to [keep the area clean](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BTaPSuZCcAAAsLB.png:large), so I regularly use conditioner on the area (conditioner softens the hair and will reduce the itchiness or irritation of freshly shaven areas). Head and shoulders, the kind with almond oil smells good and works quite well.  But a stubble will destroy your toilet paper...  I started using women's shampoo after I started growing my hair long in high school.  Ever since, girls have been complimenting my hair constantly for years, short or long, because I learned how to take care of it.  I get asked if I straighten it, what shampoo I use, etc.  I've had cashiers at places I've never been say they like my hair.  Using women's shampoo was the best hygiene decision I ever made. I'm stuck on how you thought you could clean your ass with a "poop shovel" created by bashing two shampoo bottles together. Can you draw me a diagram or something? Guys, if you're going to use your girlfriend's products, PLEASE replace them. The stuff we buy and use is often EXPENSIVE and it's also a super big bummer when we go to use something but it's empty cause someone else has been in it. :P That face mask sounds expensive! I hope your paying your share, I'd be so peeved if my boyfriend used my expensive cosmetics :( I don't know what you normally do with and around your butt hole, but shampoo bottles in no shape or form should really ever be around there. Patrick Bateman, is that you? I got that vibe too. haha. That shampoo was so mesmerizing that you never cleaned your ass?! Do you mean Elmer's glue? The PVC glue I use at work does not come off very easily.  You never told us how you solved your original problem; I kind of want to know how that worked itself out. You should also use moisturizer and eye cream.  And sunscreen. So, you shampooed your asshole? This closely resembles the whole Patrick Bateman monologue in the beginning of American Psycho. Doesn't that just warm the cockles of your heart?

Warms the shit out my cockles... my cockles are burning... OK, the less I know about your cockles, the better. You sound like /u/_vargas_ But did you wipe? People need to know.  What brand do you use?

Asking for a friend... Hairy bearded man here.

I love Fresh's products, particularly their chapstick and body wash, but it's costly. 

Ojon has awesome awesome shampoo, again expensive, but it's all natural products and one of the most effective cleaner's I've used in my hair. Do make sure you buy the correct version for your type of hair (curly, oily, dry.)

I also use LaVanilla deodorant, the summer one, grapefruit, and now the lemon one too. I hate the feel of aluminum in most deodorants (except for suits on hot days), the difference is mind blowing. /r/myfriendwantstoknow I'm currently using Summer Passion by Herbal Essences, but I also have a Chanel one for special occasions. Because I'm worth it. Bro, the Aussie one (purple bottle with kangaroo) smells *amazing*.

And it's competitively prized. You'll never go back. That is seriously the most awesome smelling shampoo and it is *so* fragrant. I used it my freshmen year of college and it would make my apartment smell nice as well as my hair.

I might need to go back to it... Give hanz de fuko a try. It's women's shampoo for men.  My wife and I both have long hair.  She started using Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner.  That shit is the BEST. STUFF. EVER. I use Aussie myself, and it's fabulous. I find Aussie stuff leaves my hair flat and lifeless. John Freda all the way. If you have facial hair, conditioner makes it soft and your lady will appreciate it more.


Edit: Yes, shaving with hair conditioner is better than shaving with shaving cream or shaving gel. Moisturizes the skin better, too. Try shaving with it.  How can I shave my beard with my beard? I'll tell you when you get older. RemindMe! 10years "Learn to shave your beard with your beard" Dammit, now I'm actually gonna have to come up with a good tutorial on shaving beards with beards. I'm going to go ahead and be that guy, and suggest /r/wicked_edge.

$30-50 for a double-edge safety razor that'll last indefinitely, $30 for a brush that'll last a decade or longer if you take care of it, then around $30 a year for soap/cream and blades after the initial investment, and you'll get a closer shave than with a cartridge.

It's rarely talked about because it's usually thought of as a masculine thing, but a double-edge also works great for legs, etc. for the ladies (or guys who like to be silky smooth, if they're into that). I've actually thought about going this direction with razors, as I've read that they  cause less skin irritation than the supermarket ones.  They do, once you get the technique down. You have more control of the angle of the blade relative to your skin, and there's only a single blade vs. 3-5 in a cartridge.

The trick is to get the angle and pressure down. It isn't more difficult than shaving with a cartridge, just different. You can't use the same amount of pressure or you're going to have a bad day...the weight of the razor should do the shaving.

The best thing to do to get into it is to get a decently rated double edge razor, a decently rated brush, then grab a blade sampler on Amazon for a few bucks and see which you like best (different blades are better for different people) and then grab a bunch of them.

In my opinion it's very worth it...the results are better and after the initial investment into the brush and razor, it's much, much cheaper. I use Tresemme conditioner. It works perfectly and it's cheap as hell. This is why I use Doves all in one. Shampoo, shaving cream, conditioner, something else, I think transmission fluid, maybe? Anyway, it's great stuff and costs like 4 bucks a bottle. And expensive shampoo isn't as expensive for men since we typically have a lot less hair to wash. My girlfriend uses like 5 times as much as I use, maybe more. Chanel has shampoo?
 Chanel doesn't have any hair care products, but they do have hair 'mists' which are just perfumes for hair.  You go girlfriend.  me too. I use John Freida "dream curls" shampoo and separate conditioner. Love it. Garnier Fructis Mofo! I can't tell the difference, I assumed it was just marketing. That way you can sell blue minty smelling shampoo to men and pink flowery stuff to women.  I think at the drug store/grocery level ($5~ or less), it's probably all about the same. The higher end stuff is definitely nicer and worth the money most of the time though.  My husband and I both have thick wavy hair that is hard to control.  We have gotten some strange looks in the shampoo aisle debating the merits of the products.

Edit: John Freida Dream Curls is the shit. Maybe its for men

Maybe it's maybelline I use Clear for women. I used to have dandruff and tried every single men's formula and Clear for Men was actually pretty good, then I saw my wife had some of the women's version. works WAY better, and is a superior shampoo and conditioner. Now i just use that, and she uses my razors. You're absolutely right and I do the same! I love you, ariiiiiiigold, and you are worth it.  Pantene all the way! Pantene is actually pretty bad for your hair. It basically costs it in wax so it looks shiny. It has the highest silicone/wax based ingerdient content of any drugstore shampoo brand. The waxy coating can get old, and over time with heat styling and other wear and tear it will actually make your hair brittle and it leaves little white balls where your hair snaps. So if you switch shampoos, it will start to make your hair look dull because its stripping off the wax, but after a week or so it will be gone and your hair will feel way better!! 
 Guys usually don't straighten or blowdry our hair, and whatever the silicone does makes my hair a lot more tame. It would be that or hair products, and the shampoo makes my hair feel a lot more natural.

Pantene apparently has a silicone free shampoo too. Also try those non-sulfate shampoos. Very nice!  I'm a man, and I use Tresemme Luxurious Moisture. I love it. I use my wife's Skintimate shaving cream and Venus leg razor to shave while in the shower. Don't give a shit. Tools are tools, regardless of the packaging. Is your name Scrappy Coco?  Funny you say this because men's moisturizers are typically far better than women's.  Methinks it's because they need better moisturizers to compensate for shaving.  But plusbelle... Arigold? Fitting. There are men who still use men's shampoo? Dear lord why?! Not everyone wants to smell like a fruit basket I'm a woman who uses men's Old Spice. It's so much better than any woman's brand I've used and it smells amazing! The shampoo I use is $15+ a bottle. I get the bed head stuff and it's fabulous and 100% worth every penny. I have really long hair which I try to only wash once or twice a week. When I moved in with my boyfriend, he tried it out and loved it. It lathers nicely, it smells like candy and cake and wonderful things and it makes hair look and feel so nice.  I am using baby shampoo,i like how it rinses so nice,and my hair feels so clean.And i don't use shower gel,i use regular soap for body.I hate shower gel because i can't rinse that fucker and feel all slimy and dirty. I buy my brother shampoo and conditioner, and he always requests the "girly stuff". Ever since he switched (previously used whatever "manly" brand) his hair has gone from straight, damaged and poofy to wonderfully shaped curls, and it's really helped his confidence! It's worth it to spend the extra couple dollars boys! Herbal essences should really start a line for men.  YES. YES. YES!!! Agreed on the shampoo, also I used that scrub wash with the Apricot shells in it. I used to only get to use it when I showered in a lady shower. Now its for when ever I want.  I often get compliments on my hair as well. I haven't used shampoo in years. Maybe he's born with it.... Really, you don't need shampoo at all. It's kind of a scam. Just rinse your hair out with water. I use Herbal Essence but never considered it a woman's product, I mean other then maybe the name and label is it any more useful for women then men? 

I would like a reason my man boobs have grown other then winter weight :( Science please help me You should definitely try to look for one that's paraben and sulfate free, it'll say it right on the bottle.  These shampoos still smell great and are much better for your hair than shampoos that have those ingredients :) Pro tip: shampoo your pubes with that shit too. I knew a guy in college who absolutely swore by the women's brand of deodorant known as Secret. Said it works better than any popular mens deodorant.  Herbal Essence is one of the cheapest hair shampoos in existence and destroys your hair.  Just because you think its advertised towards women doesn't mean it's not the cheapest shit there is. Deodorant/anti-perspirant too. Women's deos are less aggressive, don't murder your clothes, and don't smell like a Michael bay wet dream. Currently using dove cucumber and tea tree, bit powdery smell to start off with, but then I smell like a lovely gin and tonic all day. Also they are generally less aggressively fragranced so it doesn't fuck with my choice of Scent.  &gt; A couple of people have asked me what I use to keep my hair looking so nice and I just feel fabulous.

There it is. Really? I just use my bodywash for my head and body. I get plenty of compliments on my hair.. Yuuuuuup. Sometimes I do things that are good for me, but I always do things that are good to me.  This is especially true for beards!!  I don't know why all men shampoo has to stink and work like a piece of shit. Should we not hate you because you're handsome? Not to mention they're cheaper for better smell/feel. Garnier fructis. Idk if it's necessarily for women but boy does it make my hair soft and smell great.  Herbel Essences is **SO** expensive!  When I used my gf's shampoo for the first time, I was amazed by how nice it was. I felt glorious. The best part about going home on Holiday is that my sister will have her shampoo and condition in the bathroom and I can steal it to shower. 

I should buy my own... I bought lady deodorant on reddit's advice, and it actually works, goddamn. I used to think my stank was too powerful. Turns out every mens' deodorant is a hoax, even the 10 dollar clinical protection kinds, but lady speed stick is the real deal.... Pantene forever for me. Also, if the ladies cheap razors are cheaper I'll buy them. I don't give a shit if their injection molding machine was loaded with pink pellets that day. What do you think about Amway's shampoo?

I've been using it for around 10 years and am too afraid to try something else because the dandruff might come back. :) When I used to have hair in my teens I was all about the conditioner. I fucking love coconut scented shampoo. Even the off-brand shampoos smell great. I like women's shaving cream, it smells like wherever Strawberries go when they die.

I guess strawberry heaven. It smells like strawberry heaven. Nice try, Herbal Essances spokesperson  Shampoo is better. I go on first and clean the hair. 

Nooo fool. Conditioner is better. I leave the hair feeling silky and smooth. 

Stop looking at me swan.  That is a gateway to sucking dick right there. I use Garnier Leave In Conditioner for my beard. Well yea...how the fuck else are you going to look that damn suave Ari Proofreading &amp; copy editing. No one reads an article and thinks, *Wow, there were no typos in that.* I live in New Zealand. The quality of journalism here is appalling. If I make it the whole way through an article and there are no typos, I actually do think that. Well, unless it's other proofreaders! Seriously, get three of us into a social situation and watch how quickly the conversation becomes boring to everybody but us. 

Nothing more embarrassing than a fellow professional noticing mistakes in your editing...  I do, and I thank you.  you save me from cringing all the time.  Sound Ops. I work in tv and trust me, if no one mentions the sound after the show then you did good. Nobody notices unless something sounds like it shouldn't.    Seconded. And this goes for pretty much every job in event production and theater.

Nobody notices the soundguy until there is feedback or a mic isn't on, the lighting guy until the stage is dark when it shouldnt be, or the riggers until something breaks and someone dies.

Thankless jobs that we all love to do. I'm a stagehand and props tech - there's a reason I have a t-shirt that says "If You Can See Me, Something Has Gone Horribly Wrong". Theatre tech here, where can such a shirt be found? [This site, backstageteeshirts](http://www.backstageteeshirts.com/nontech.html) has been around for ever.  You can find good shirts and rude shirts, but tons of em. 
 All TV production, really. We're the only ones who can recognize a really nice camera move, but any asshole can point out a wonky camera move.

(Some of our camera ops are wonky.) As a Live Sound engineer so much of this. No one knows I'm there until a huge squeal of feedback is heard or something craps out. Then they all turn their heads and look at me. I'm like its not my fault the singer decided to stick his mic in the drummers wedge. Hey man, I just wanna say, I have played upwards of a few hundred shows in the last few years, and I always make a point to thank the sound guy. You guys can make or break a show for a band who is trying to put on a great live performance and there is nothing better than a sound guy who knows his shit. You da real MVPs.  It's always the talent that fuck shit up  As much as I would like to say its the talent that always fucks shit and pretend that I'm an infallible engineer that doesn't make mistakes, but that would make me a robot. For example I was running monitors for a fairly well known Pop Punk band from the early 90s. The singer loved to cup the mic and stick it straight in the wedges as well so the EQ was absolutely nuked. In addition he was really deaf so his wedges were loud. Loud enough I could have turned them around and used them as the house PA. Anyway I take my position and unmute all my mixes and inputs and a huge squeal was let out immediately. Turns out that the patch tech left the microphone sitting a foot away from the wedge pointing at it instead of away from it. Was my fault for not checking especially because of how loud those wedges were. But yeah, artists do some dumb shit sometimes. Maintenance people, line men and plumbers. 

It's extremely rare for someone to say "Wow Bob, look at those power lines and streets free of flowing human waste" Maintenance should be like this in any production facility.  The ideal would be to give the team enough time to regularly check each machine for any upcoming problems and fix them before they break.

Unfortunately the model for most production facilities (at least in America) is to run everything until it breaks and only give an overworked maintenance guy enough time and resources to rig it to work for another week or so.  

This cycle goes on until something catastrophic happens and they are forced to either replace the machine or tear it down to replace the parts that finally broke beyond repair. &gt; run everything until it breaks and only give an overworked maintenance guy enough time and resources to rig it to work for another week or so. 

Basically my job description.  Anesthesiologists. Remember that one time we had to open you up from pelvis to sternum to save your life? No? Good :) Well, even if you fuck up I might never know.  Yeah but your family will. They don't have to   

()  Uh shit I gave this guy 500m g of morphine instead of 500 mg.

I'm sure he'll be fine. &gt;Nurse Roberts: Doug wanted me to give this patient five hundred thousand milligrams of Morphine. I thought I'd check with you before I killed a man. That's 13.2 gallons of morphine. 

Also 50 liters, but I thought it was funnier as gallons. Yeah, I'm not a doctor or anything, but I'm pretty sure having 13 times as much morphine in the bloodstream as blood wouldn't be good for your long-term health. Hi!  Layman here!  

This is true.  Don't inject a bathtub full of morphine into your bloodstream! DON'T TELL ME HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE He's not telling you how to live, he's simply telling you how not to not live. That's the exact line I was thinking of.  Good man. And you're usually the coolest in the room. I can't count the amount of times anaesthetists have calmed me down before surgery or just chilled with me after telling jokes and chatting if they notice me in recovery.  How many times have you had surgery if you're losing count? O.o 

Though I had some serious surgery in December and my Anaesthesiologist was the shit. He explained things in such great detail and laid out contingencies he had planned in case he needed to adjust things, I felt really safe. A metric fuck ton. Orthopaedic issues from birth. The x-ray tech told me to start refusing xrays unless I was in serious pain due to the amount I've had. But on the plus side my surgeon gets to present my case at conventions etc because of my relatively rare experience with my condition and his giddy face is kind of adorable because I'm a health science geek too and totally get it. I'm also a medical anomaly, my left eye vision went from 'a bit crap' to 'holy shit I can't see proper anymore' which panicked a whole lot o opticians and ophthalmologists trying to work out why an otherwise healthy 17 year old was losing vision so rapidly.

Turns out I had a scar on my fovea centralis that to this day has not been explained, and not a single person that has looked at my case has been able to justify. Once my brain began to compensate, and the scar stopped growing (so I was able to deal with the damage to my vision) the doctors became quite excited to look and discuss my case with me. 

Photos and images of my eyes have been presented at several conferences, and a few specialists that were coming for conferences in the UK asked my permission to come have a look at it. The two current leading theories are that it was either a severe allergic reaction, or a parasite that doesn't usually live in humans got into my system and got itself fucked in my eyes. Both of these have been presented and caused arguments as people think both are rubbish. 

So yeah, if any trainee doctors hear about a British teenager/adult male who had a sausage shaped scar grow across his fovea centralis that was me. I have had trainee doctors sit in on my visits and are quizzed for a diagnosis which is amusing to watch as they are cautiously trying to not be wrong, when they could say anything and probably be right.   He's the surgeon. 
 Shhhh... only sleep now. Air traffic controllers. Not nearly enough credit for keeping things organized and on time. It is consistently ranked as one of the world's more stressful jobs.... Is there something else we can do for you? Well when one of you crashes two plane into each other cause their heroin addicted daughter died in her sleep, YEAH, of course we're gonna notice.  Ah shit, you saw the episode of Mr. Rogers too? Audio Engineers. People think musicians and bands just play into a tape machine once and they're done. A raw recording sounds nothing like a finished record and most people don't realize this. The only time the average person even thinks about the recording process is if something sounds bad. Same goes for filmmakers.  I've been in a recording studio for a week and a half now and I can't get the sound of the fucking click track out of my ears. And you'd be surprised how many bands have misconceptions about how hard recording a record is too. If you wanna record an album that sounds good you better be prepared to spend an entire day just setting up mics for a drum set, a whole afternoon picking a few vocal mics for the singer, a day mismatching guitars, amps, and cabs. Hours and hours playing the same song over and over again. And then a few more hours playing the same song some more. Plan a few extra days for vocals cause you're probably gonna need to rest your vocal chords after singing that chorus 87 times in a row. 

Now all the while that the band is exhaustingly trying to sound good enough for an album, there is this patient, energetic, knowledgable, creative person placing the mics, picking the cabs, amps, guitars, and drum heads, and trying not to let his ears bleed while the band gets their shit together; giving pointers and ideas to the musicians the whole time, dealing with musicians and their fuckin blown up rockstar egos. 

And then, once the band is finally done, that nice person has to sit in a chair for two weeks and adjust volumes and EQs and compressors and limiters until it sounds just right. 

And then that person's name gets printed very small on the back of the record.  Audio Engineer here. Just want to say people like you make our jobs so much easier. The ones who understand are always a pleasure. In a large hospital: pathologists, autopsy technicians, cleaners, orderlies and admin staff. Most of these folks work tirelessly in the background, and without them a hospital would be brought to a grinding halt.  don't forget building maintenance.  Nothing is getting done without reliable plumbing and power supply.   You forgot medical laboratory scientists. Modern Dr.'s wouldn't know shit without having lab values. 

And its okay, we're used to being forgotten. NO ONE EVER SENDS FRUIT BASKETS TO THE LAB 
:( The gift shop were fresh out of "thanks for identifying my cancer" cards. Sorry.  Good quality designers. That's the entire idea behind good design: if you designed it well, no one will notice because it will simply work like it should. The biggest compliment I've received (designer &amp; food/product photographer when needed) "that look yummy."

They forgot it was a photo and it made them hungry. Felt great. Street cleaners / janitors don't get nearly enough credit.

EDIT: Thanks for gold! People just don't realize how much shit they throw in the streets That is disgusting. They got rid of toilets here in philly.  Everyone just throws the shit out the window from their apartments and houses now.  Every 45 minutes a truck with a vacuum contraption on it comes by to clean the streets. Cuts back on water usage though.

Edit: Well this took off. There's nothing true about this statement.  Philly guy here.  Can confirm.  The crapvac just drove by a few minutes ago. I...don't believe you Some would call that "medieval". And I would respond by saying that they had fucking plumbing in the Middle Ages. And somehow still some of the nicest people I've met have been custodians. 

My freshman uni dorm custodian was there every morning having to deal with gross bathrooms and vomit filled trashcans (or walls) but was always the brightest smile in the hall and always offered to help us with Spanish for those of us that needed it. 

Before we all left for winter break we tried buying her a gift but didn't really know what she wanted so we bought her a gift card to Target. She came back with a bunch of snack food from Target and left it in the lounge for us to eat during finals. (': She sounds like a lovely lady.  Someone puked in the urinal in my freshman dorm hallway and our custodian - nicest lady in the world - withheld all the toilet paper until the kid came and cleaned it up. We cheered for her.

But ever since then, I kept a spare roll in my room. As did everyone else, I imagine. I'm a janitor and seriously people never notice how hard I actually work. Someone once told me my job isnt that hard because all I do is clean. My job has to be perfect and if i forget something everyone notices.  work as facility maintenance (read: custodian) at a public library.  The people in circulation act like I have the dirtiest job but they're handling books that frequently come from filthy households / children.  We frequently find bedbugs in the books and they don't wear gloves or anything.  The only thing my hands touch when I'm working is the inside of a latex glove or a mop handle. I always say this. Just go in to the break room at any job and see what a disgusting mess it is. Now imagine a whole city where there more people and it's easier to get away with being a slob. Now look down you street and see that there isn't just a landfill covering the sidewalks. 

 I am a courtesy clerk at a grocery store. Not sure if people know what this is... But it's shitty as fuck. I clean the break room. Me. Help. "we have a code brown in the restroom."  Please don't make me...  better than code red. 

(((( ;)))) [deleted] I was about to say, I loved being a bagger at kroger. Got moved to cashier for a year hated it, got supervisor and quit. Because fuck you kroger for paying supervisors shitty wages. in Japan they make the kids clean the school until they graduate.  
We have groundskeepers for things like, pruning the hedges or oiling doors or changing lightbulbs, but the toilet cleaning, floor sweeping / waxing / mopping, blackboard cleaning, window cleaning, taking out the trash, etc. is all done by the students from grades 1-12. That's super cool. Wish we could do something like that in the US but you'd just get a whole bunch of snotty parents saying stuff like, "I don't send my kids to school to learn how to clean toilets, my kid's gonna be Dr. Actuary Attorney at Law, PhD, blah blah blah special snowflake blah blah blah you'll be hearing from my lawyer blah blah blah get your ass fired" and then their faces melt off from overheating because they're actually robots sent by aliens to torture us all as some sort of evil cosmic joke.  Was in Toronto international airport. The floors were like fucking mirrors, so when I saw the guy; putting all effort into his next scuff on the floor. I promptly told him shit was sheen. Poor Scruffy... Scruffy gonna die the way he lived. The star that shines twice as bright, burns half as long But we sure notice them (I am a janitor currently). People who hate their jobs/life/situation seem to enjoy taking it out on the man. To narrow that down more they take it out on their place or work/the building. To those people you are not doing anything to "the man" you are only showing individuals like me how big of a jack wagon you are.

Edit: added a word and fixed stuff. &gt;don't get nearly enough credit.

They do. It's called street cred. 

 I did janitorial for years, I used to say, "it's a good day if nobody notices you."   Being a lobby boy He anticipates needs before the needs are needed.  Zero was already getting the stool by the time Gustave realized he was going to steal the painting.

Edit: *Thanks for the Gold* As someone who fights with other people regularly to make sure IT has the right budget for compliance purposes this is what I have actually heard:

"Can't we just put all IT into the cloud?"  
"Can't we just outsource all of IT?"    
"If we did a 20% reduction, I'm pretty sure no one would notice."    
"Can't we just buy insurance to cover being hacked?"  
"Do we actually need people on site for IT things?"  

My response is always the same.

"So who do you think protects the network, protects all of the company's intellectual property, makes sure self servicing works and keeps every other employee productive? It's not us." "Why does this power plant spend so much on maintenance? We haven't even had a meltdown before!" "Why do I have a life insurance plan anyway? I haven't even died yet!" &gt; "So who do you think protects the network, protects all of the company's intellectual property, makes sure self servicing works and keeps every other employee productive?"

Stonecutters? We do! We do! Who keeps the servers cool and safe? Who puts the users in their place? We do! We do! Who holds back the electric spams? Who blocks Mark Zuckerburg's.... programs? We do! We do! [deleted] &gt; "Can't we just put all IT into the cloud?"

One of our Marketing guys wants to do whatever he heard about on some technology blog. This couples with my absolute favorite comment (which often comes from Marketing) "Why can't we just switch to Macs?" 


&gt; "If we did a 20% reduction, I'm pretty sure no one would notice."

My work did this about 4 years ago. The next morning one of the Unix servers went down. They had fired the Unix admin the day before (she didn't do anything to it, this was a coincidence) and we were dead in the water. They asked her to come back for one day (and got a big Fuck You from her) and ended up paying a contractor out the nose and had to set up a yearly contract that was something like 70% of the previous employee's pay and only did maybe 10% of what she did. 

We never fully recovered from this. Even today we have problems that can be traced back to this. Good for her. I would have said sure, but pay me 10x what my hourly was with an 8 hour minimum. "I will absolutely come back to consult for a day. My going rate is one thousand dollars per hour." I tend to explain IT as a multiplier for company wide productivity. If IT is done poorly, multiply company productivity by &lt; 1. If it's run ok, multiply by 1. If it's run exceptionally, multiply by 2 or even 3. Assess the impacts of a 10%, 20%, or 30% productivity reduction across the company versus slashing the IT budget and it becomes hard to justify. I've always seen IT as oil in the engine, myself.  With good oil, the engine will run smooth as a baby's ass.  With bad oil, or no oil at all, even the best engine (and **especially** the best engine) will seize up and break apart. All things IT If everything is working, no one knows why hey bother keeping you around, if stuff is broke no one knows why they bother keeping you around. I know what the fuck! It's not like we do nothing when there aren't issues! We're working on important stuff!

(Sometimes we do nothing when there are no issues.)

But you don't keep a soldier around just for the fighting. You pay him for the waiting too. &gt; But you don't keep a soldier around just for the fighting. You pay him for the waiting too.

Totally using this when my boss wants to send me home because it's a slow day. I think firefighter is a better job for that analogy. Those guys can sit around for DAYS without doing anything, but if they aren't around the city might burn down. [this always makes me laugh.](http://m.imgur.com/a/iJD8f) and my friend who is IT says it hits home. 

Edit: [part 2](http://m.imgur.com/a/B9wqU)

thanks /u/scroom38 "who is this?"

" it's death :-(" This is one of the greatest things I have ever read. Make sure and go into the comments and find part 2 as well. It's just as good.  I laughed, I cried.. I realize IT is like some not-so-secret cult of servants to a thankless kingdom. Ah man, good laugh at 5 am. But god help you if us dumb ass end users can't print or get on YouTube because a network bridge crapped out or whatever. Then we act like were on the Hindenburg.

Sorry on behalf of all the people who would never say it. Hey I cant seem to print Youtube. Can you help me out? Thief That's because they usually take one or two high valuable items that one wouldn't notice missing right away. The thief that takes your 50" HD TV is a bad thief because right away you'll notice it's gone. The thief that takes that one expensive ring from your jewelery box is a good thief because you wouldn't notice it till weeks later probably.  The thief that steals the one expensive ring you ordered for your fianc from the truck that's delivering it to the jewelry store and replaces it with a convincing replica is George Clooney.  But he can easily be tricked into giving up his Nespresso - What Else? We have an entire series of commercials to explain why George can't be trusted with things. I knew a guy that did this with my beer.  Up to four of them could be missing, and I wouldn't have noticed.  He fucked up when he took an almost empty bottle of whiskey that I'd been saving.  We are no longer friends.   Admittedly used similar tactics on my older siblings as a kid. It'll be obvious if I steal a tonne of candy from them. But if I steal a bit of Ella's, a bit of Bas's, a bit of Henry's, and a bit of Cal's candy, none of them will notice.

Then you take the opposite tactic for blame.  Jack Black described a good roadie in the opening scene of Brutal Legend like this.  A good roadie knows his whole job is to make someone else look good, keep someone else safe, help someone else do what they were put here to do. A good roadie stays out of the spotlight. If he's doing his job right, you don't even know he's there. Once in a while he might step on stage just to fix a problem, to set something right. But then before you even realize he was there or what he did, he's gone.Eddie Riggs The best roadie is invisible: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPlYFBzD8o Looks like a 1 man F1 pitstop team Didn't Tenacious D have a song called "Roadie" on their "Rise of the Phoenix" album?  They sure did, and it's pretty awesome!  Public Health.  For the most part, many public health jobs are the epitome of this statement.  If we do our jobs, you don't get sick.  Being that you can't disprove a negative, no one knows we did anything.  The only time we get press coverage is when people do get sick and then feel the need to blame someone for not protecting them. Kinda surprised I had to go so far down to see someone say this. I think to put things in better perspective, examples would be ebola and the measles outbreak. If quarantine measures and the public health system was strong, ebola could never have gotten so rampant and made global news. The measles outbreak shows what public health measures had been keeping at bay for DECADES before crazy vaxxers destroyed all of it.  That's software testing in a nutshell

Edit: Thanks for the Gold kind stranger!  Hey QA,

Thanks for making me look good. 

Sincerely,
Programmers

Edit: wow. First gold ever. Thanks!!! Hey, how much does it make your blood boil to hear the phrase "I can't believe the QA department didn't catch that"?

Hey, you know what? Maybe we *did* catch it, and some jerk overrode our objections and shipped anyway, because their bonus was on the line. Or maybe we missed that one minor bug, but we found dozens and dozens of much more serious problems.  We got *literally* yelled at and publicly shamed on our company facebook by our boss for not catching a bug that prevented any users from making a payment. We searched for the problem, despite being convinced that there were no recent changes that could affect our payment system in any way and that a bug like that would not go through our testing. A day later, the boss let us know that the problem was at the payment provider's side, he silently deleted the "shame post" on facebook, but didn't even apologize or correct himself. Also, for the next couple of months, he kept mentioning that we "recently let some major problems pass to production", even though he knew full well that it wasn't our fault and that it started after the production release... Oh man this really gets me. I've only been doing the job for less than a year and i already know the pain. Bassist Hey man, at least you're always needed. Everyone is always looking for a bassist.  'Hey man I'm looking for a bassplayer for my band, you play bass?'

No, i do play the guitar though

'Same things minus two strings, you up for it?' People who say they can play bass because they play guitar tend to be pretty shitty bassists. They can do a job of it, but they ain't the same as an actual bass player. Even though the raw skills are transposable between the two instruments, there's a certain amount of technique you have to build on each one. Hence why I can play chords, and write songs, and noodle on a guitar, but I sound pretty shitty, but on the bass I can control pretty much exactly how I want to sound, because bass is the thing I like playing most and worked at hardest. My friends who are guitarists can shred on a guitar, but put a bass in their hands and they'll hit the right notes and keep the right times but still sound pretty sloppy. You can definitely be great at both, no question about it, but a ''filler bass player'' (a guitarist who will pick up a bass when needed) isn't the same as the real deal. The same way a bass player who can be the filler rythm guitarist isn't a s good a s the real deal. This feeling is too real. As a drummer for 21 years, I would like to extend some appreciation to you and all other bass players for holdin it down and keeping my groove in that fat, fat pocket.  My thanks, bass friend.  Us drummers would be nothing without you guys!  Its cool how like the drums and bass are kinda a team. And the bass ties everything together. Drumming is hard as hell. A good drummer is hard to come by. My hats off to you guys cuz I can't even keep the simplest of beats on the drms. my two best friends are both bass players. me and one of them have been in like 10 bands together, and singer/songwriters will sometimes just have us play shows with them because we have gained a rep so being a solid rhythm section. its really awesome. watching him play bass with me has taught me the difference between a person who plays bass and a bass player. a bass player is invaluable. Hey no probs, drummers are always my bass friends too! Heh, always thought this. People seem to only notice I'm there when I'm not there.  They don't notice when you aren't there. The only time they notice is when there is a break where all the other instruments play except you, and then you come in.

At that moment, they realize that you have been missing. Then they forget about you again. You may not even notice when they aren't there. But I've found songs always just feel... Empty, not full. The bass is very important to the overall quality of the sound. Try playing in a funk band, the bass really sticks out there. Stalking Dark but true. Your new couch looks lovely, by the way.  Civil engineers. How's your clean running water, your storm water system, your roads, bridges, drainage ditches, buildings, tunnels, levees, traffic signal system going today? Functioning properly I'm guessing. &gt;It is a great profession. There is the fascination of watching a figment of the imagination emerge through the aid of science to a plan on paper. Then it moves to realization in stone or metal or energy. Then it brings jobs and homes to men. Then it elevates the standards of living and adds to the comforts of life. That is the engineers high privilege. 

&gt;The great liability of the engineer compared to men of other professions is that his works are out in the open where all can see them. His acts, step by step, are in hard substance. He cannot bury his mistakes in the grave like the doctors. He cannot argue them into thin air or blame the judge like the lawyers. He cannot, like the politicians, screen his shortcomings by blaming his opponents and hope the people will forget. The engineer simple cannot deny he did it. If his works do not work, he is damned. 

&gt;On the other hand, unlike the doctor, his is not a life among the weak. Unlike the soldier, destruction is not his purpose. Unlike the lawyer, quarrels are not his daily bread. To the engineer falls the job of clothing the bare bones of science with life, comfort, and hope. No doubt as the years go by people forget what engineer did it, even if they ever knew. Or some politician puts his name on it. Or they credit it to some promoter who used other peoples money. But the engineer himself looks back at the unending stream of goodness which flows from his successes with satisfaction that few professions may know. And the verdict of his fellow professional is all the accolade he wants. 

Herbert Hoover
 &gt; No doubt as the years go by people forget what engineer did it, even if they ever knew. Or some politician puts his name on it.

He got that right - that piece of engineering is not called the [Savage Dam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoover_Dam#Design.2C_preparation_and_contracting)... IT.

It's always "Why are we paying IT?" Well, glad that you didn't notice. 

EDIT: [Relevant XKCD](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/academia_vs_business.png) Annual company party last week.

CEO spends 40 minutes talking about everything that's been worked on this year by each department.


Not a single word about IT. At our team meeting today we congratulated ourselves on a job well done.



Edit: holy shit, that is almost exactly what happened in the IT Crowd. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MmBF8J7MzI Do you work at Reynholm Industries?

"And this IT project couldn't have happened without the hard work of..... [dramatic pause]...... THE LAWYERS!!!! "And when you're talking about computers, how can you fail to mention..... ACCOUNTS!" This.

Write an amazing piece of code that saves your department shit loads of time and no one gives a fuck.

Email goes down for 2 minutes and you get abused. Sometimes I turn off and on the server because I'm lonely and want people to talk to me. Sometimes I let other people fuck up in preventable and easy to solve ways that are clearly their own fault to justify my own existence...

I could have prevented it, but then you wouldn't have to stop and actually acknowledge that you need me

Usually only for small things, dont want to let a company lose millions of dollars or anything lol I let them do it because I might get yelled at for trying to help before it's actually a problem.  That's usually the real reason for me as well.  Engineers and doctors are kind of dickish and will end up fighting every step of the way anyways.

Plus I kind of hate them now. " IT doesn't bring in money, so no bonuses for you this year."

The entire company wouldn't be able to fucking run if IT didn't do it's job. IT deserves ALL the bonuses every year. Just turn the servers off and be like "How much money do you expect to make now?" A few years ago in a bank which saw its activity pretty much doubled thanks to an automation project our team was working on (automated most of the traders' annoying tasks so they could focus on what's more important). A typical trader basically went from about 20 stocks analyzed in a day to 40+ thanks to our new app. It took us about 8 months to develop.

End of the year, traders got crazy high bonuses because of the business they brought (fair enough), IT got nothing because "the bank's current status required us to cut down on bonuses and we decided to focus them on business".

And this, kids, is the story of how I quit a job I loved. Absolutely.  The only time anyone even knows IT exists is when something is broken. This one hits home.

Currently writing stuff for a client who keeps casually adding on extra things they want the program to do. Super frustrating and stressful. Yet here I am on reddit. You really should shoot those requests down. 

Do what's defined in the contract/project scope and then get paid. Alterations are extra. 

Or don't, I'm not ya father. I used to have that quote hanging on my wall when I worked as a phlebotomist I'm fairly sure, under most circumstances, people are aware you've done something when they get a needle in their arm nah those are just the shitty phlebotomists. The really good ones will draw your blood and erase all memory you have of it, that's why you never know about the really good ones. Oh trust me, they're out there, waiting, hidden in shadow waiting for that fateful O- to walk by when they shall strike on the unwitting donor; leaving without a trace to return to the local blood bank. From google: Phlebotomists are people trained to draw blood from a patient for clinical or medical testing, transfusions, donations, or research.

Sounds like a damn good answer to me! Backup dancer. No one talks about right shark. If all sharks are right shark, no sharks are right shark...except for right shark. This makes no sense but it makes so much sense.  Power plant operators. Prison guards. No one heard from us unless we kill someone or they escape. We don't deserve a raise from state congress because we wernt having any problems about five years ago. Then we start having shortages and have minimum escapes (no fences, they can just walk off), then we don't deserve a raise because we can't do or job. Kinda went off topic, but it just seems like no one hears about us unless it's negative, then they deny our raise. You were the first one to really expand on your response which is what I was hoping for.  Thanks for keeping everything in order where you work! Sysadmin, or almost any IT job.  When everything is going smoothly, people are happy and it looks like you are goofing off.  They ask, "what is it you do here?"  
Shit breaks, no one is happy, people ask the same question. Dishwashers and engineers Men In Black  Well, first I was gonna pop this guy hanging from the street light, and I realized, y'know, he's just working out. I mean, how would I feel if somebody come runnin' in the gym and bust me in my ass while I'm on the treadmill? Then I saw this snarling beast guy, and I noticed he had a tissue in his hand, and I'm realizing, y'know, he's not snarling, he's sneezing. Y'know, ain't no real threat there. Then I saw little Tiffany. I'm thinking, y'know, eight-year-old white girl, middle of the ghetto, bunch of monsters, this time of night with quantum physics books? She about to start some shit, Zed. She's about eight years old, those books are WAY too advanced for her. If you ask me, I'd say she's up to something. And to be honest, I'd appreciate it if you eased up off my back about it.
 Or do you feel I owe her an apology? Thats a good shot, though Long snapper in football. 

Everyone takes it for granted that the ball will get to the kicker correctly. Nobody knows who the damn long snapper is until he screws up for the first time in his 15 year career and costs the team the game. Disregard the fact that he's throwing a football 15 yards backwards between his legs with pinpoint accuracy.

**Edit:** Alright guys! Love for the long snappers! As a Saints fan, I'd like to take this moment to thank Justin Drescher, our long snapper, for being the one part of our team that wasn't horribly disappointing this year. Get the rest of those guys on your level JD!

**Edit 2:** Ok guys, I get it. Y'all love some Jon Dorenbos. Yeesh. Philly is a weird place. I  am guilty of not even realizing that this was a special postion until the Super Bowl, when they introduced them at the beginning of the game.  Don't feel guilty. Many people who aren't bigtime fans don't recognise the effort that goes into the offensive line in general. Those guys can really relate to the theme of the OP Year before last, the Raiders lost their long snapper mid game. Later in that game, there were 3 punts that became turnovers because the guy long snapping the ball the rest of the game kept fucking up.  Same thing with the holder.  Most people never knew how vital it was until Miami/FSU in 2005. watch ace ventura: pet detective 

LACES OUT Untrue. People never noticed how vital it was until Dan Marino caused Ray Finkel to miss the game winning field goal costing the Miami Dolphins the Super Bowl. LACES OUT!! University of Michigan's  long snapper Jareth Glanda caught a touchdown  in the 2012 Sugar Bow, only reason I know who he is.

\*long snappers aren't even eligible receivers (passes they catch are illegal) but it was intended for someone  else and bounced off a defenders helmet Ya its amazing how they can constantly do that.  Like thats super far.  Ive tried long snapping, i could never muster the power or perfect the technique to snap it that far back That might be why you aren't a professional American Football player. Copyeditors. We're often deemed unnecessary and costly because writers can just spell check their own work for free. Even if they check their own work (they often don't), it's always better to have someone else perform an unbiased edit. Besides, spell-check programs don't detect word misuse, or cut/paste errors, or clichs, or just plain crappy writing.  Am a writer. Can confirm even after rereading several times there are /still/ problems. every single time when I wrote a paper for my university,
I re-read it like 3-4 times after I'm done to make sure that doesn't happen.
The minute I print it, I spot at least 5 more mistakes that I overlooked on the computer and that's not even all of them...
 Network Engineer. We're the back end of the back end of I.T and you don't see what we do until the shit is broken. Without us you you will literally have a terminal with the ability to do things only on your desktop. 

Our scope covers everything from phones, to wireless, to your email, to network security, to the servers and data-centres. Our concern isn't just on the internal processes where a lot of business IT is focused on. Our primary focus is on our DC,COLOs and WAN links for sites, which are all at the mercy of 3rd parties.  Our secondary concern is that of internal teams as they all rely heavily on us. The Helpdesk - with more internal apps and functions being upgraded and developed they are no longer local but centralised or cloud based, so we're having to hold their hand to get through the basic troubleshooting of "the network is down, i cant open 'x' application'. The Server team because of their basic network understanding they attempt to configure servers to LACP or PAGP without talking to the people controlling the datacentre, or they're used to the 'next, next, next, install' approach they don't normally think about layer 2 or layer 3 comms (I JEST).  The Project Managers who surprsingly plan, design, test and deploy systems into business with no real dev or uat environments and we're left on go live day to make it function as promised. And finally the end user who just assumes at the click of a button shit works. 

There is a bunch of other shit, we are concerned about, but you generally develop a 6th sense to the business and their requirements so you can plan or steer them like a horse with blinders to their desired goal.

But yes, only when 5000 people are unable to access facebook do they realise exactly what you do and how much the business relies on you.   Video editor.
Best work is when it's not noticed. 911 dispatcher.  Nobody even thinks of us.  No thanks or credit ever comes our way. But if we mess up,  it's all we hear.  You guys are the best.  Unfortunately it seems that often when there's a real emergency and a call is placed to 911, even though the dispatcher says "911, where is your emergency?" people are too upset to be able to first say *where* the problem is.  Always state your location first and foremost when calling emergency services.

I've had to call 911 so many times and the dispatcher has always been amazing, calm and able to assess the situation...over the phone!  I can't imagine what it takes to do that job.   They always teach us to say "911, what is the location of your emergency?" and it *never* seems to make a difference. The caller isn't interacting with you yet. They wait to hear a voice and start asking for help. The part where you take control starts later, although I understand the reasoning (and I always answer the phone this way -- in fact, I just did a few minutes ago, and again it didn't work. They provided the nature of the emergency immediately and ignored my initial request for their location).

I used the same line of reasoning when I worked at a pizza place that wanted me to read the specials as I answered the phone. I told them it was a waste of effort. The customer is thinking,"I want a pepperoni pizza and breadsticks," and the actual words you say aren't registering to them. They're just waiting to hear noise so they can start talking. People who want to order food and people in an emergency situation are the same -- they're the center of the universe for a moment and have to be gently coaxed to become willing recipients of information.  

I tried this one night by answering the phone with "Thank you for calling *business*, praise our dark lord Satan." No one reacted. For eight hours of answering the phone.  I think of officials.  Don't get any credit when everything goes well but you can be sure you will know when things don't Guess I was the only that thought you were referring to government officials... Nope. I definitely was thinking of government.  Medicare keeps millions of seniors alive.  Social Security keeps them fed.  The FBI keeps us safe (mostly, also spies on us, but very efficiently).  NASA takes us to space.  DOT runs the roads. DOE runs the nuclear plants (hear about many of them breaking down recently?  Hear about nuclear material being stolen?) The government should be at the TOP of this list.  It is EVERYTHING that is unappreciated. Yes, but they are unappreciated because of how wrong they do things. DOE doesn't run nuclear plants. The FBI does not keep me safe. NASA doesn't take anyone to space, anymore, ever. Social Security will be gone when I can collect, and Medicare should keep millions of Americans alive, not just seniors, but heaven forbid our government officials stop wasting our fucking money and just keep us fucking alive instead.  The DOE DOES run nuclear plants (I grew up in  Oak Ridge - it really was maintained by the [DOE](http://www.dnfsb.gov/about/where-we-work/doe-defense-nuclear-facilities).  The FBI does keep you safe, no matter what you may think about their other activities.  NASA is designing the Orion space capsule to take people beyond earth orbit, and is funding SpaceX and Boeing to take people to the space station.  Social security WILL be around - at worst it will pay 75%  While I agree that Medicare should keep all americans alive (I support Medicare for all too!), it DOES keep them alive, meaning that it is successful within the constraints placed upon it.  The idea that government is just waste is just a cop-out that falls apart as soon as any detailed analysis is applied, in my opinion. Yes I actually have heard of nuclear material being stolen.  I read it in the post just above this one.  Also FUKUSHIMA BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And..."When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all." Done. [deleted] If you think government isn't doing things rights on the whole, you've never seen how bad things can get... a government that actually failed to do it's job would bring entire countries to a grinding halt, they are basically doing everything that allows the rest of society to function normally. Exactly. James Joyce (not the Irish one) isn't known for his long career. He's known for the Gallaraga call. Yeah.... I think I could name 1 ref (Ed Hochuli) for anything other than bad calls that hey have made in the past, and his is for his super buff guns Didn't he have a terrible call on opening day a few seasons ago? Maybe?  I just remember him doing a college football game (LSU vs someone) and one of the players accidentally ran into him and lets just say the player felt the brunt of the hit.   It was a botched play involving the chargers, there was a fumble that he blew dead as an incomplete pass that cost the opposing team I believe. He has had a long and successful nfl career though and is known for being jacked. ya, he screwed the chargers out of a win over the donkeys by blowing a fumble dead that only had chargers players around it http://www.theonion.com/articles/ed-hochuli-first-down-signal-decapitates-player,9962/ thats funny, because I usually associate Hochuli with a single bad call like that gallaraga call The NFL refs got a lot more respect during the lockout which made it appearant how hard it was to actually ref football.  The replacement refs made you want the old refs back insanely badly. Touchdown Seahawks! The three yellow card ref retired because of one

I would never have heard of him otherwise And I still remember that terrible call he made in that one Broncos game in like 2007-2008.  Hochuli is the best! DETROIT REPRESENT Anf how Angel Hernandez is known for his career as a shitty ump Damn it Obama. 

 Wayne Barnes, rugby referee. An otherwise good referee, but the entire country of New Zealand will always hate him.
  
  
  
Source: 2007 World Cup Quarter-Final Fuck him. He is the devil. At least he isn't the super devil. He's got that going for him.  Yeah. And at least we won't be last one. I'd say Nigel Owens is known for being a very good referee. He's the exception though.  I think Nigels success as a combination of both his ability and his personality which backs it all up.  Perhaps. And maybe being a perfect example of why homosexuality and sports can be in perfect harmony also helps his image. His hatred for football (and particularly the Swans, as a Jack myself) annoys me a bit, but I have to give it to him that he does a lot of good for his sport.  He's not bad, but nobody can come close to God aka Nigel Owens. Have you seen Bryce Lawrence in Springbok vs Wallaby games? Got all worked up just thinking of that tool. I'm sure all Wales fans feel the same way about Alain Rolland as well.  It's sad to see that the hate is still strong 8 years later.  This is America no one knows what you're talking about guy Rich Garcia. Tino Martinez struck out in Game 1 of the 1998 World Series and you knew that damn well. I don't know, it's probably that things never go smoothly on that level. There is always something and because in a way they're the guy/girl for everything their work is never done.

I do know of some local politicians who do a good job in their position. Doesn't help that the position they're in are committies for checks and balances and the thing I find good is that they point out all the things that are wrong.

And so many would deserve some consequences for their mismanagement it's not even funny anymore. Surprised I had to scroll this far for your answer. I have to agree.  Inventory workers / stockers at all retail stores.

Can't sell something G if it isn't on the floor and you can't find it if it's not in the right place. I had to do inventory for papco which is just nuts and bolts kind of stuff, I wanted to shoot myself.  IT guys.  No one notices that your email is working just fine and your chat service is up and running again EVEN THOUGH BILL FUCKING DOWNLOADED LIKE 18 MALICIOUS PROGRAMS LAST NIGHT IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET SOME FUCKING PORN ON HIS COMPUTER AND MANAGED TO INFECT LIKE 8 OTHER COMPUTERS.  FUCK YOU BILL, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. I never liked bill. Kill Bill How the hell does Bill keep getting hired?  He's done that shit at the last 3 or 4 places he's worked... Time to get Bill fired. Theatre tech. Thank god, I thought I would be the one to say it  Offensive linemen Depends on the team. Sometimes, it's a fucking miracle when they actually do their job. Eagles fan? I as thinking more college, but sure. I'm not super familiar with NFL football recently. Bears fan. I appreciate good offensive linemen. Only because I've spent ten years without them. "Offside.. you twat!" Played LT and Center for almost 6 years. Guys, blocking schemes are alot more complex than you think they are. When youre perfect, you hear about it 5% of the time. One teenny miss or slower than usual pull and youre at risk of not starting the next game. And it's amazing because it's almost like we love the fact that we get no credit. Hearing "man that is a great running back" is the best compliment an offensive lineman can get! It's a pretty shitty job compared to the rest of the football team. Either you screw up or you don't, there's never any "wow, that guard really made that play work". There's just complaints about you fucking up or you're just irrelevant. Defensive line is so much better.  Are these people who repair power lines while making rude gestures and abusing passers-by? *Fixing a power line at the top of a pole*

"Hey! Fuck you!" "Oh, your here to fix the power line?"
 
"FUCK YOU" I disagree the o line always gets a ton of credit  How different are the skill sets between offensive and defensive linesmen?  How different is porn and water? When they do IQ tests at the combine, the highest IQ ratings on average are quarterbacks.  Wanna guess what the second smartest position on the field is?

See, defensive lineman do the same thing every time: Try to tackle the QB, or if there's a handoff, the runningback.  

Offensive lineman do something different every play, and it's a combination of running a blocking scheme, using strategy to fake out the D-lineman, and responding to however the play unfolds in realtime.  So one play, the O-line might have to force open a B-gap so the wide receiver has a hole for the ol' end-around play.  The next play, they might be subtly shifting for a screen play, trying not to give away the strategy.  The next play they might be just using brute force to contain the D-line and give the QB all the time he needs in the pocket to go long.

If you know a bit about football, next time you watch a game, spend a quarter just watching what the two teams' O-lines do.  It is a surprisingly influential part of the game that few people notice.  A bad O-line can lose a game, and a good one can create opportunities for winning.  It's definitely an aspect of the game almost everyone takes for granted. Everyone forgets your snapping the ball and blocking the blitzing middle line backer until you take a misstep or someone gets through or the ball boy didn't get a dry ball out and suddenly you exist and by god your asshole needs chewed out for fucking up 1 time out of 100's of snaps. What my Offensive Coach used to say to me. 
"No line, no shine."  And defensive backs for the most part DBs get picks, PBUs and tackles. They have stats. They can have glory. 

The offensice lines only stat is pancakes and most teams don't keep track of those anymore. And if they do, they don't get reported, the announcers don't mention them. A OL is a thankless job. The QB holds the ball to long and gives up a sack, the OL gets blamed. They take the heat and rarely get the glory.

A better comparison may be the full back. Blocks most of the time, rarely gets touches. Does the dirty work with little recognition.  That's why I said for the most part. If a corner shuts down a receiver you don't really anything about it but he let's up one TD and he's had a bad game What about courteous ones? Nearly any role within film making. Pre-production, on set, or post-production. The whole point of mainstream Hollywood film making is to suspend your disbelief and make you forget you're watching a movie at all, so if any aspect of the movie stands out too much, it's a bad thing. A major philosophy of camera operators, editors, sound designers, costume and set designers etc. etc. is that their work should be at the same time both noticed and completely unnoticed by the audience. It's strange aspect of working in film.

(There are exceptions to this, of course. Some directors like Tarantino and Wes Anderson have styles that are intentionally noticeable, but they're allowed to because they got big balls.) Film buffs and aficionados, as well as those who actually work in the industry definitely notice. But you're right, the general viewing public doesn't. As someone who has actually been an actor on film sets I do my best to make sure I notice the good, hardworking crew, and thank them if I have the opportunity. Beyond your creatives that you see on screen, people have to remember that film crews are large and there are a lot of people doing the grunt work that your general audience never sees, but they're all an essential part of the filmmaking process nonetheless. I first want to give props to the on-set crew: locations, transpo, grips and electrics, their rigging departments that prep and strike, your construction crew, script supervisor, medic, catering, crafty, SPFX and VFX (not the same).

But beyond that, can we give props to the people that run the logistics of flimmaking too? First the AD's who ensure the set-- the whole behemoth of it-- runs smoothly and on schedule. That actors show up, go through hair and makeup, are called to set on time, that each department knows what set up is up next and is ready to go, and while they're running the current day, they're also prepping tomorrow, the week, and beyond.

But the people that always, always, always get the shaft is the Production Office. You know, those people who work out of sight to ensure all of your equipment is delivered/returned on time, that the scout vans are stocked with crafty, that your construction crew has hand warmers when they have to work at 5am in below freezing temperatures. They manage the endless paperwork generated by each department and then distribute it to all to the appropriate parties to ensure your worker's comp claims are filed, that the editor's have scripty's notes, that the unions have their weekly lists, vendors have insurance certificates so you can pick up your equipment, and that the studio has the Production Report by 9am. Every day. And sometimes, they'll even track down that 40-by digi-green green screen at 8pm when all of the local vendors are closed and you've missed the FedEx deadline in California and you're doing it all in the middle of a tornado warning with no power or lights.

But hey, the office isn't an integral part of flimmaking. That's cool. Amen to the Production Office folks. My wife has been the POM. Not a glamorous job by any means, but absolutely essential for a well-run production. I'm a Senior Data Analyst for a major retailer. My job is to create attribute models for product categories, build processes to upload products into the product categories (with appropriate attribute categorization), and ensure satisfactory market representation and pricing (nothing crazy high, nothing crazy low).

I maintain this data so that store associates can look up prices and sell custom products to our customers.

whenever something is wrong, I immediately hear about it. when its right, I hear nothing at all.

***
a good hacker, a good developer, and a good analyst, are sort of like having a good wizard.

most of the time, it looks like they're just sitting around doing nothing important and just goofing off. some of the time, nothing could be further from the truth. some of the time, that's exactly right.

but a wise leader will keep them in their circle, so that whenever a good wizard is needed, they're ready to step in and save the day.

and even if they're mostly just goofing off, its still better to have them in your circle, than in your enemy's circle. Counseling.

Hear me out.

A lot of people (unfortunately) still don't believe mental illnesses are a thing. Counselors help those with such illnesses, and usually (hopefully) the person recovers. If someone honestly didn't believe that something like depression is a faked disease, then although the cured person has recovered a bit, it would seem like they got better just by "being happier" or some other bullshit advice that unempathetic people give, not because the counselor did their job. There really are not enough decent/well trained therapists/psychologists around. It would be a life changing experience for so many people. I visited a counselor long ago. I went with my then ex-girlfriend for a kind of couples counseling that dealt with the topic of our break-up.

Afterwards, I had a conversation alone with him. At one point he mentioned to me, "The thing about counseling is, my aim is to have the person walk out of here feeling like I did nothing and they did it all themselves, that means that I did a good job."

Basically, this counselor's strategy was to get us to open up with our problems and discuss them to eachother. He would prompt us with questions and sometimes offer advice. At the end of it, you feel a lot better and also that you did all the work, because in a way that is what the counselor was prompting you to do.

So yeah, 'when the counselor does things right, you won't be sure if hes done anything at all.' I used the "find" function just to see if therapists were mentioned in this thread (I am one).  I love my job and do not ever start any day expecting to be thanked - and when it does happened it feels great.  Every now and then it does get disheartening when clients/families just don't get the big picture and heap on the criticism (or, when clients are so ill they just don't have the insight to understand the therapeutic process) and it makes you feel like you're not doing your job correctly.  It's a job where, very, very seldom, doing things "right" lead to direct rewards for us. My family, especially my sister, don't think I have a real job because they don't believe mental illness is real. I'm sorry; I know how you feel. Mine thought I didn't work hard in school because of the same reason.  Even sans mental illness a ton of people who bash counseling or say its only for the mentally ill are seeking counseling for anything from sexual abuse to a bad breakup. But no one talks about it because its extremely personal. I just think its funny that if someone does bring up "I am/was seeing a counselor" people are always "what's wrong with you are you okay? Etc" when in reality probably 50% of people you know have or are seeking counseling currently.

 Fuck, I am eternally grateful counselors exist Counselor here, can confirm.  I'm sorry, I've got to go see a girl about a thing.  Fixing the world one broken person at a time is a thankless task.   Good teachers never get the credit they deserve or the pay.  I'd say classroom management is the one task that is never noticed, if it's done correctly.

If the whole class is a group of motivated, interest-driven angels, always looking for compromise, never fighting beyond banter, being respectful to each other - the teacher deserves the credit.

Think about it - you've seen stuff like "Big Brother" and those shows, right? You *know* that if you push 20-30 kids into the same room, they *will* start to weed out the weakest, and establish a hierarchy.

Yet we take it for granted that pupils are relaxed and comfortable in a classroom.

*That's* the big "done right, never noticed" of the teacher. Good point. One reason this is true is that classroom management is generally not recognizable in a meaningful way to anyone in a position to directly observe it (students). Admins drop in for sure, and perhaps they have general measures for it, but the students aren't really going to notice. Parents are probably only going to notice in situations where the management gets extremely bad. 

Teaching is such an interesting job. It's so hard to evaluate performance. Honestly it's really hard to even describe the things that a teacher has to do in order to perform their job well.  20-30? Pisssh amateurs. Hey, I'm just lucky I work in a well-funded school system. It's awesome. Then you're well recognised after all. Oh, we still bitch and moan. There's still plenty of things done by the ministry of education that we feel belittle us and our professionalism. They have literally mastered the closest thing to herding cats. I am a second year teacher, and two months ago I got an ear infection and was really sick from a combination of that and some other bug. I came into work after a day on antibiotics, thinking I could handle it, only to walk down to the office after a half hour in the building (20 minutes before school started), and ask for a sub. They called in the best sub in the district, a retiree who'd taught for longer than I've been alive,  and he said he'd be there by second hour. 

When I got his sub notes, he had written almost that exact phrase (which I'd never heard before). He had written simply "The ninth graders in your seventh hours are... Interesting. It was like HERDING CATS" with a bunch of underlines. 

Seeing your comment made me remember and I laughed.  Special Agent u/Skulder is absolutely right. I am a relatively new teacher and I honestly didn't realize that I had great classroom management skills until the head of my department observed class one day. Once the lesson was over, they had a weird look on their face--dumbfoundedness. She told me how impressed she was that I had so many 'troubled' students, yet she couldn't differentiate them from the group during our group work. Of course, not every class is perfect, but for some reason my students decided to show me respect from Day 1. Either I am one lucky son of a bitch or they were just ready to learn about Wuthering Heights. &gt; Either I am one lucky son of a bitch or they were just ready to learn about Wuthering Heights.

That's a great line. I struggle with classroom management - I run and ask colleagues about this and that all the time, but I mostly manage. 

But that feeling, when you pitch a topic, and you manage to appeal to each of them, *just right*, and they buy into the topic, want to learn more - aw yiss!

 Oh man! That feeling is the best! It is my nerd adrenaline fix.

I introduced an 'asylum' prompt for a Narrative/Descriptive essay in Composition I in which they have a mental disorder of some kind and are in an asylum or hospital, but they cannot divulge to the reader what illness they suffer from. The looks I received from the class indicate that some of them may try and use their beloved teacher as inspiration. However, the next day the majority of them had their creative juices flowing and were excited to write! This is just invigorating after seeing how much I am to be paid as an adjunct. I just don't really care, so long as I can get these kids to care about their writing and their future in college/after college. It feels so good when i plan a class and it goes smoothly. When the kids dont realize they're learning, is really when they learn the most. Or at least thats what i like to tell myself.

Mostly it just makes the day go by faster Not all the time. My highschool had none of those tired old cliches. People generally got along enough to do their work save for a few assholes that got in fist fights like once a year. We didn't have any real jocks or taped up glasses style nerds. Everyone did their thing, most people talked to most people. Unless you were a social retard and isolated yourself with your awkwardness going "but no 1 lyk mi /wrists" or smelled like a dumpster then you could talk with just about anyone.

Or maybe I was just a lucky kid and need to check my privilege, I'll never know. I don't know about highschool - I only teach grades 7-9 - but I know that teaching in a school here requires a bachelor of education (including didactics, pedagogy, etc), teaching at "highschool-equivalent" just requires you to have a university degree in the area you're teaching.

So I'm assuming that highschool has a lot less classroom management. Understandable. I can't really give an example of pre-highschool, it's all a blur to me. I can definitely see little kids being annoying AF, though. Idk how a teacher can handle them all day x.x &gt;I'd say classroom management is the one task that is never noticed, if it's done correctly.

I absolutely agree. During my first year of teaching, classroom management was something I had to learn basically from scratch. I was good with the subject matter, had plenty of creativity when developing lessons and activities, but classroom management was brand new to me because I had never noticed it in my career as a student. In retrospect I see it was the difference between good teachers and ineffective teachers. My first year was really rough because I had to learn it on the fly. To be honest, I would say it's because the kids still believe that Teacher &gt; student. The fact that the student places authority in the teacher to start with gives them the ability to do their job properly.

Managing that power however, and keeping everyone happy is another level of micromanagement altogether. Sorry, can't type a full response, I'm still laughing uncontrollably at the idea that "kids still believe the teacher &gt; student". Have you been in a classroom in the past few years? Children do not automatically respect the teacher, or consider them an authority.  I am a student, so yes. 

And I never said they *respect* the teacher right off, but they do place authority in their hands.

What's your experience to say differently? I'm a teacher.  Dat timely response

I personally dont know what the classroom is like wherever you are in the world, but maybe your preexisting bias is a factor here? I don't think "being a teacher" is a pre-existing bias when it comes to judging how students behave in a classroom. It's more like 'first hand knowledge' or 'knowing exactly what you're talking about because you live it every day'. 

And anyway, your evidence for student respecting a teacher's authority is that you're a student, so you have your own "pre-existing biases" going on there, and I'd say a student's opinion on how much students respect teachers is pretty much the definition of bias. Bias is the same on both sides, I would argue for, you would argue against. Neither understand the motivations of the other.

My point being, you walk into a classroom every year expecting your students to give you shit immediately, maybe your attitude is why they do so. Depends on your country and its values. We're taught teachers are equal to parents Which can be a problem as well when (depending on factors, of course) kids think "mommy and daddy are my friend, not my parents".  For this I'd refer to cultural values again and say when we're taught that we're also taught complete obedience to parents. Infact teacher=parent is often in context of obedience and respect Was a high school teacher for four years. If only students did place authority in the teacher ... I started with antagonistic students, yet still formed my classroom into a team. And when I didn't? Either got yelled ad by admin for disciplinary referrals or if I tried to avoid the yell-inducing disciplinary referrals, got yelled at for *not* making them.

Then I switched careers. Which is sad, because my students did actually learn from me and I enjoyed teaching. Admin was my issue, not the kids or the parents. My cousin quit being a teacher because of this. Admin was always on her back about discipline problems. Yet when she tried to write referrals and give detentions, the principal got annoyed.   Well, talk about things that actually happen. This is such a thing. And teachers know it, but they're so catty too. They'll say things like "Wow you got such good kids! Mine are brats." And the other teacher is thinking *it's called classroom management you fucking bitch!* Sometimes the kids are just well-behaved approval-seekers. The teacher has nothing to do with this a lot of the time. I dunno about you but even primary teachers here get about 50% more than the nations average salary. What country do you live in? New Zealand. Awesome I am glad there are places where teachers get paid well. I live in America and the pay varies state by state but it seems no matter where you go here teachers are not treated with a lot of respect.  Actually, BLS data shows elementary school teachers making over 20% more than average across all occupations.

First line on the first link... National average salary, all occupations: $46,440

http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000

Second link... National average salary, elementary and middle school teachers: $56,320

http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000 I wonder how it compares to other careers that require the same level of education. Teaching requires a college degree right? This article says "less than 60% of the average pay for full-time college-educated workers".

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-jennings/teacher-pay-us-ranks-22nd_b_940814.html Required a masters, too. 

Edit: or you to get one within an appropriate amount of time. My wife is a teacher and she had to go back to get hers. 

Edit2: requires a masters in some states. Thanks for the clarification! Teaching in most states at the high school level does not require a masters, that just gets you more money. You will eventually have enough credits that you may as well get your masters with all the continuing education that you are required to do, though.  It sure does, and to be 'highly qualified' (some No Child Left Behind nonsense), it requires a graduate degree, too. I'm a music education major so I'm trying to be a music teacher. Between student teaching for a semester and all of the other classes you have to take in addition to your basics most people I know don't get their bachelor's in less than 5 years. Plus it's not necessarily required but it helps tremendously to get your masters or even your doctorate. Average income for someone with a bachelors is about 57,616. So teachers are below that. Lots of teachers also have more advanced degrees, so it is skewed some.

http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm My friends that are starting out as teachers in the Midwest make about $30k a year, and apparently someone decided they didn't need a budget for supplies, so that now comes out of their pocket. My aunt retired after teaching for 40 years and I think she was just shy of $60k.

Me also spending 4 years in college would have pulled $70k in the same city. I moved west and make significantly more. 

My old English teacher told me they haven't gotten any raises in over 3 years. I've been on the job less than 2 and have already received 3.

I make sure that you can have an Internet connection out on the streets. They make sure a generation is well educated. Hardly seems fair to me.  My wife is an English teacher.  She started at $44,000/yr. changed schools after one year and makes $53,000/yr now, plus gets paid $1,500 for not using sick days, plus retirement fund, plus healthcare, and is given a few hundred stipend for school supplies.  She is set to get yearly cost of living increases and raises at certain levels.  She will make $75,000/yr within 10 years on the job.  She also gets summers off which is nice, never has to work on a holiday or weekend and has the option of teaching summer school for even more money. I have a relative who lives in the Northeast. When she became a teacher, she started at 45k a year. Average pay for teachers the area is around the 60k mark, and longtime teachers can make six figures. 

Average household income in that area, not individual, but household, was like 45k a year. 

Yea, there may be some parts of the US that don't pay their teachers as much, but there are other parts that pay their teachers very well.  I mean, I'm glad for your wife, but that's not anything like the ordinary teacher experience. My wife has been a teacher for 5 years, currently working at a private school in a Chicago suburb, and her taxable income this year was under 30k. She does get her healthcare free and summers/weekends/holidays, but she gets no stipend. One unique thing she does get is her school subsidizes our housing and utilities, since we live in a house owned by the church that runs the school. Our rent is pretty low and they take care of most of our utilities, so that probably adds another 5k/year or so. Most public school teachers (who are the vast majority of teachers) get paid more than private school teachers, at least where I'm from. Public school teachers have to put up with more shit as well which might be the reason someone would choose to teach private for less money. I want to go to there. http://www.courant.com/community/hartford/hc-teacher-pay-study-1230-20141229-story.html So Union? Not union.  At least not now, her first job was. Don't teachers get a tax deduction when buying school supplies? Yes they do, it helps reduce the cost, but money still comes out of pocket.  Its helpful but I don't think that covers the full cost. That would great if it were a tax credit. At that salary level, you'd get 15% back as a deduction, so if you spent $500, you'd only get  $75 back. That's also assuming you itemize your deductions and can deduct more than the standard deduction (which is nearly $8000), and I don't think many people at that salary are going to be able to itemize with that. You can only claim like $250. I usually spent about $2K. Here in NC, tenure has been taken away and salaries are $33k with an extremely flawed scale for increasing teachers pay. It's change to no raises for either 6 or 9 years.  30k is crazy considering low level undergrad interns in some majors make a higher hourly pay  Yup. My first internship after freshman year I made $18 an hour, which would be about $37k a year. Before my senior year it was $25 an hour plus housing. I think my W2 for those 3 months said $30k. If you're curious, we don't pay people based on how helpful their profession is. We pay them on how much money it makes and how hard it is to replace.

Its not difficult to become a teacher. Because getting ANY bachelors degree from an accredited university is nothing more than getting shitfaced all day. 

And they're practically giving the job to anyone, right? RIGHT? It may not be difficult to BECOME a teacher. But it is difficult to remain a teacher and do it effectively.  
&gt;do it effectively

yes

&gt;remain a teacher

no. the teacher's union is a hell of a racket.  I live in the midwest and I was planning on going to school to be a teacher..


damn. No. Dont.

http://np.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/2rj1r1/i_really_want_to_be_a_teacher_but_im_afraid_of/cngetgc Seriously, don't fucking do it.  Me fail English?? That's unpossible! A big difference is that your job is absolutely objective and if you mess up, its noticed immediately, and you are accountable for that.  In that light its also harder to find someone qualified to do it, because you will know right away if you accidentally hired someone unqualified.

However teaching is very nebulous and its hard to define who is an objectively good or bad teacher.  A bad teacher will often never be discovered, because they could be very nice seeming people but have no real ideas about how to best serve their students.   So we've built a culture where its very hard to fire a teacher, but the tradeoff is they don't get paid as high a rate as you might think is fair. Why is everyone so obsessed with finding the bad teachers? More time and resources should be going into incentivizing good teaching, training, and motivating kids. Not worrying about weeding out bad seeds.  Keep in mind that this is a huge problem with government/nonprofit work compared to private sector work. 

You may make 70 grand at your job, but if you were doing your work for a nonprofit, it would undoubtedly be lower. 

We, as a society, don't pay those jobs well, because since those people work for our donations they better be working on razor thin margins, which means they take a hit salary-wise.  The nation on average isn't required in most states to continue their education until they have obtained a Master's degree. 

Compare teacher's salary to others' that require the same education levels and we're at the bottom. 

When was the last time you walked into a building where 80+% of the employees have a Master's and their average salary was under $60k? Besides a school you've probably never visited such a place.  Science technicians all have masters and make under 50k. Teachers aren't special.  Uhm.. High school and lower teachers do not have masters. And as for college professors they don't generate any money and pretty much any unemployed masters student can just become a teacher. They're replaceable  Plenty of high school teachers have master's degrees. Yeah but it's not even close to required.  Haha fuck all these butthurt people downvoting. I know I'm right and no one has come even close to refuting anything I've said.

I'm a recent college graduate and I live in THE best schooling district in the country. I've seen the job ads for teachers, and no - we don't require masters.  Pretty sure it's required now. They made my wife go get hers. She's an elementary school teacher (but certified to teach through 12th grade).  No, it's not required, it may be in your state, but not every state.  Yes, yes but teaching requires a college degree and a special teaching certification (at least in my hone state of CA). You need to compare to the average salary of college graduates with an extra year of industry specific training. Teachers aren't paid anywhere near enough. All jobs are paid according to their monetary value, not because of how useful to society they are.

Athletes are paid well because they bring in billions.

Doctors are paid well because its a LONG, expensive, and difficult route.

Teaching is any 4 year degree and a certification in some states  Man, you're just a dick. Aren't you?  How come? Sorry am I supposed to be heaping praise on the wonders of teaching?

Edit: it's not that I don't think teaching isn't valuable. It obviously is. But it's not a restrictive profession whatsoever But he is right.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Finland#Teachers I'm not talking about Finland. I'm talking about the US Based on that logic, I should still be earning more. If you add up all the lifetime earnings of all the students I've worked with thus far, you're talking tens of millions.

Let's assume my average student earns $25,000 (US) annually. Multiple that by 25 years of work. Then multiply that by 25 students (even though I work with 3 to 4 times as many students every year). Then multiply that by my 13 years thus far.  You know good and well that those are different circumstances.  You teaching someone that mitochondria is the power house of the cell did not result in them getting a B.A in History and earning 35k a year as an administrative assistant.

120 million people watched the Super Bowl, not including the thousands of dollars for each ticket.  The Super Bowl influenced writers, broadcasters, coaches, hosts, hotels, airlines, advertisements, etc.  That's a direct impact of the players.  

I'm not saying that teacher's aren't important. I agree that they're probably one of the most important professions, but it's incredibly difficult to distinguish the bad from the good (you can thank teacher unions for that). 

17ish kids on my Facebook are now teachers. There is only one Lebron James, and his move to Cleveland bumped up Cleveland pretty substantially.  People flew in to see him play vs the Heat and they now actually sell out crowds (which probably resulted in more stadium staff being hired, more purchases of food/beverages, just more money flowing through the city than usual).


 I have so many problems with the implications of that data and how you're using it to make the argument that teachers are paid enough--shit, more than enough. Even 20% more than enough. Ridiculous. 

Any teacher Ive ever known works at least 60 hour work weeks. Average that out with my 33,000 salary (with a masters, by the way) and I make $11.00 an hour as a VERY highly qualified professional
who works in the evenings, run my own club, tutor every other day after school, and get the shit kicked out of me every time I see a kid fail and can do nothing about it. 

I love teaching, but we do not get paid for what we do.  Teachers I know have to come in to meetings on Sundays work 9+ hours and are treated like poo. They work more in that 9-10 months than most do in office jobs or anywhere. They get assaulted , treated like dirt from parents to administration and are forced to go by standards and lessons people that don't know there kids. People in here think they all get big city 100k paychecks and nonstop vacations.  My mother is a teacher and she makes around 45,000 a year. It depends a lot on where you work, and because of this a lot of teachers in this country are vastly underpaid. As  teacher I won't make that kind of salary until I'm 30 years into my career. Base salary in Texas is around $27,000 my district pays more than that I make $42,000. When I worked at a smaller district I only made $32,000. You also had to remember that they also went to 4 years of college in order to make that extra.   Averages are great if you are above the average, my wife is a teacher making well below that average, approximately 20k below the average and roughly 10k less than the average of all jobs.  hahahahahahahaha no wait...hahahahahahahaha those numbers are so skewed it isn't even hahahahhahaha funny. Most teachers start off well below 40k and even below 30k. Maybe you will make it to 50 after 25+ years service.  I don't know what to tell you. It's based on the national data. Yet I hear 400% more complaints about their salary on Facebook  I'm dating a high school French teacher who has her master's. She has a yearly salary but only gets paid 75% of it because the legislature here had decided that teachers only work 9 months ot of the year,  even though they are required to do something like a month and a half or two months of summer school teaching. Its bullshit and I do not envy her in that regard.  Especially in Wisconsin. Thanks Scott Walker. Yeah I would've never even thought of becoming a teacher if the pay was near obsolete, I'm not nessacerily doing it for the pay but it does factor in a lot. I ... really hope you're not an English teacher? my first thought when i read his comment too

Its "necessary" It's, not its. Unlike most other words (cat's, douchebag's, m'lady's) the possessive form of it DOESN'T contain the apostrophe, the contracted form (it is) does.

Of course, the truly pedantic would also take issue with the use of obsolete in the parent comment by /u/redbate ... unless there's some volunteer teaching revolution going on, teacher's pay is not in any danger of obsoleting. But I think I get the gist of what was being said there? Don't ever teach in the US, you'd be in for a very rude surprise. I started an after school job thinking hey, I like kids, and then BAM, how in the hell do teachers control these kids all day long?  &gt; no matter where you go here teachers are not treated with a lot of respect.

I don't agree with this sentiment at all and am wondering why you think that. Are you talking about something more akin to occupational prestige?  I'm a (public) high school teacher in Switzerland and the wages start at $125k in my town. Just because they're paid well doesn't mean they're happy. We had a bunch of striking 5 years ago because teachers were complaining they weren't getting paid enough Churr  But then again, our median salary is like 38k or something.  I'm a fellow kiwi, and have always heard that teachers here are paid pretty piss poor wages for the job they do.. [They strike if they don't get what they want.](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/4255743/Teachers-on-strike-again) Granted that was a while ago.

[To be fair though the agency that pays them sucked.](http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/novopay-fiasco-heading-court-5465050) **REPRESENT** They get a nice deal here in Canada too. They have a higher than average salary in Denmark as well, but not by 50, more like 6-28% depending on how long you have been a teacher. Brb, moving to Middle Earth. Well, fuck. I guess I'm moving to new zealand.
 Kiwi fucks. Yes that seems to be how they reproduce. Yet they still fucking complain! You should come to Luxembourg. Teachers get an average net salary of 76k and they're still complaining. http://www.wort.lu/en/politics/9-700-public-school-teachers-luxembourg-state-pays-1bn-on-teacher-salaries-annually-54c2735b0c88b46a8ce520d4 This is nearly true in Massachusetts as well. 

http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/state_report/teachersalaries.aspx

They make about 15k/year more than the median household income for the country even if they are the sole provider for their household. They make around 6k more than the states median household income.  Probably Fairland, Land of the Fair.  My daughter's first grade teacher in California makes over 100k. Yep, I went to public high school in California and a good amount of my teachers made over 100k, one of my math teachers made about 115k.  In somewhere where the poverty line is $80k? Does your child go to Laguna Elementary?

I'd like to see a salary schedule, and they are public record that can typically be found on the Board of Education website, that shows this.  When you say "even" primary teachers. Do you mean primary school teachers? Just because the content is a lower level doesn't mean it's easier to teach it to the relevant age group.  Yes but it used to be that secondary school teachers were paid more, however the pay is now the same. Nice because I teach 8th grade (and am highly qualified in my state no less) and make less than 28k... seems fair, since they are giving you a future for the nation. &gt;Even primary teachers

Why do people make this distinction? Primary teachers are important as fuck, and the job requires a post baccalaureate education, just like other higher levels do. It's also not any easier, nor does it require any less intelligence than the higher levels. Same. Here in Singapore teachers get pretty good salaries plus good job security as long as they don't fuck up big time. Plus, from what I hear the bonuses are huge. Like, "my P.E. teacher drives a convertible" huge. Yeah a lot of the teachers I've talked to own shit ton of houses which in turn leads to more money. Where did you get your statistics about the national average?  I didn't realise it was only $28k.  Because as a primary school teacher, I was paid about $42k. What kind of qualification did you have? I'm going to be in group 3+ so it's going to be 72.6k You realise that's the maximum, right?  And it takes years to get there? The average teacher would be a Q3 (I was also a Q3+) which starts at 46k.  I haven't taught in primary for about 5 years, so either I was misremembering, or salary has gone up, or both.  But working from $46k, your statement would hold true if and only if the average salary in NZ was $30, and I still find that hard to believe. Plus summers off It doesn't work like that. I'm from a family of teachers and the standard is they have about 3 weeks off tops and then it's back to work even when the kids aren't there. I've spent 20 years of my life watching my mum go to work at 7am and coming home after meetings and working to 7-8pm at night. Teachers often work over the weekend too and over the smaller breaks. Teachers don't stop working when the school day ends. My aunt is a teacher. When i was young over the summer we would do awesome stuff. Most teachers get the summer off. That would make sense in America. In New Zealand our summer holidays tend to be a lot shorter, and the hours average out very similar to your typical working professional.  Even US teachers get payed well, depending on the area. Yea, some crappy ghetto school in Ghettoville, USA won't get much funding and the teachers won't get much pay. But one of my teachers showed the whole class that the avg. pay for a teacher was like ~$40k a year. The avg household income is $50k. One teacher, on average, makes almost as much as an entire working household. Another teacher told us the METHOD in which they get payed. Either everything within their 9 working months, or less each month and stretch it over the year so they don't have to budget during the summer. If I can get $40k a year for 9 months of work and then get a summer job doing...whatever? Serving, probably...that's a pretty nice chunk of change. No one seems to realize that. None of my teachers ever complained, though I'm not from Ghettoville, USA. I disagree, perhaps they don't get paid enough but if it's a teacher doing a truly great job, the kids will recognize it and appreciate it You're going to leave it up to a bunch of children to determine whether a teacher is doing a good job or not? Yeah, I was going to say, the most well-liked teachers at my school were the ones who were considered "cool" because they were friends with the cool kids, fucked off on their Facebooks for half the class, or let the class watch a movie every now and then because they were hungover. The ones who actually knew their shit and did their best to prepare us for college and the real world (far too few) were liked by the nerds and other overachievers but were panned by everybody else for actually assigning hard work. I guarantee that would translate into poor student evals for the truly good teachers and good ones for the lazy but cool teachers. I had a teacher who spent half the period shopping online. Had another who just joked around with the students all period.

Both were very popular. Your argument is extremely valid and relevent, I don't disagree that these types of teachers are "popular."
I see 3 types of teachers [at least 3 worth mentioning] 1)teachers that try to prepare students for college and help them pass the course (generally aren't liked) 2) teachers of your description who are popular but don't really teach (are well liked and and probably only respected by the students they're friends with) 3)The teachers that can teach all the required material, teach non-requires but still important material, connect with students to deliver a lesson that will stick with them, and make a lasting impact on students lives
#3 is the type of teacher I was referring to I get appreciation from students &amp; parents.  From the general public and government of my state/city, not a bit, but for the people whose lives I impact directly, I do from time to time. I don't understand. Students, parents, coworkers should all be showing you appreciation if you're doing a good job but what is it that you're expecting from the general public? The point I'm trying to make is that teaching is a vilified profession.  I'm not expecting to be showered with flowers from onlooking strangers.  I'd like a modicum of respect to be given to the profession from the public at large and just a pretense of support from our government officials. Unfortunately many professions are like this.  Absoutely. My history teacher for example is an absolute legend, and come final project time, there's no way I would ever leave the school without some sort of sign of appreciation. Bur the parents won't. I'm not to sure about this one. I'm always hearing about school teachers on the news. Good ones and bad ones.  Inspirational teachers get credit. Organized, consistent teachers who can keep a classroom controlled get no credit.  I disagree that they belong in this thread, I reckon teachers doing their job well will have a very noticeable impact. I still remember my two best teachers over my entire school life very well and even my parents could tell they were different. They didn't just teach the curriculum, but also a little life wisdom and discipline that still comes back to me once in awhile.  Where do you live!? There are *plenty* of people who think teaching is one of the most important jobs, that they should get more prestige and pay, etc. Yeah, it gets repeated on Teachers' Union commercials all the time. When I lived in NY State they were on the radio daily protesting everything. Good use of union dues, huh? 

 I dunno, the kids love the good teacher more than the crappy one. As /u/hopsbarleyyeastwater [points out](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2vlvc4/futurama_once_said_when_you_do_things_right/coizx0u), teachers in the US get about 25% above the national average. A few of my teachers in high school are making over 100k/year. Obviously this is once they have a masters degree but that's still a very respectable salary and I don't really think they should be making any more than that, especially when that's something like over double the average national salary.  A lot of careers don't the pay they deserve- and work all year round.  I guess parents of children that do well, want to assume it is all on the childs merrit.  But they'll forever have a students gratitude. My teacher from 2nd to 5th grade taught me more than any other teacher hands down. She shaped the type of student and subsequently the person I became. I still keep in touch and regularly tell her how great she was.  Disagree, my classmates and i entered our awesome calculus teacher into a country wide most Inspiring teacher competition and she won. She got $5,000 for herself and $20,000 for the school. I think she also got some random stationary, prints and a S4 but i cant remember.  That's totally not true. Good Teachers are forever praised.  I can't speak to the salary but that's not the question at hand.  I live in a border city on the Canadian side.  More then half my graduating class of teachers didn't get Canadian jobs right out of the gate.  0 of them went to the states where they were begging for teachers.  Mind you it was also Detroit. Currently doing my teacher training. Man the amount of balls you have to juggle to keep the class going. Then you have one kid that fuck it all up and its all your fault. At present I'm part English teacher, part councillor, doctor and mechanic all due to parents not bothering with their kids.  I beg to differ, good teachers that the students can relate to while they still learn the required knowledge get LOADS of praise from the student body. Even if it may go under the radar.  Honestly I'm starting to feel like teachers have the biggest persecution complex of any profession.  Maybe it's that quote, "those who can, do.  Those who can't, teach."  I dunno, I have a number of friends on facebook who are teachers and they are constantly posting images to explain how under-appreciated teachers are. I don't think this is completely true, good teacher do not get paid near enough at all. However all the good - amazing teachers I have had, I cannot do more to let them know how much I appreciated them and the effort they put in to help me get good marks in my exams.

Might help that my mum is a teacher though. That wasn't the question though, people definitely notice the good teachers. It shows in all the standardised tests as well as the attitude of the kids The gym teacher at my high school made 100k when I was there. Not all teachers are underpaid.  But it's so difficult to distinguish who the good teachers are. And a lot of it has to do with the environment they're in.  The entire teaching world is kind of messed up though, and contributes to why people feel apathetic toward teachers. First off, areas like mine are overcrowded with wannabe teachers because of how well they are provided for. They get tenure, pensions, and 3 months off a year, all of which are unheard of for 70% of the rest of the country. I live in NY (suburbs outside NYC) where teachers get paid fairly well. Starting salary without a Master's can be around $50K, and only goes up with a Master's and more college credits above that. "We have to deal with your kids"- good, no one asked you to become a teacher. If you don't enjoy doing it, then don't because the rest of us are tired of the bitching. 

I have friends who are teachers and they constantly whine about how long it is between vacations, constantly being tired, how jaded their coworkers have become, etc, etc. Both of my parents were teachers though and I do have a great respect for the ones who love their jobs and do them right. You can always tell when a teacher is passionate, and while no one should expect a cheery, happy teacher 100% of the time, teachers are too well taken care of here to complain about pay, vacation, or  receiving some sort of thanks for doing their job. Sorry for the rant. Because unions demand that the bad teachers get the same pay. Go to any high ranked suburban high school, all the teachers have master's degrees and all make 100K+ a year Good teachers make people think they're teaching themselves. because that's what leads to long-term retention.
 Depends on City/State, but you are often right. Some places pay very well.  I happen to live in Arizona where they are paid terribly lol. That may be, but I feel like at minimum, the student of a good teacher will feel like they did something. 

The teachers I consider good are not the ones who I feel "did nothing at all" as the question states. IMO, if you're a teacher, and your students feel you do nothing at all, you're not doing your job correctly. This will probably get very downvoted, but here we go. 

I live in the Midwest and my sister finished her student teaching in December 2014. She has been job seeking since that time.

The base salary for teachers (where she is looking) is very comparable to other professions for college graduates with a variety of different majors. The schools she is looking at working for are starting right around $37k per year and that's in South Dakota (notoriously poor at paying its teachers). 

Combine that with the fact that they are given at a minimum 8 weeks off during the summer (when teachers can supplement their income with another job if they so choose), and the fact that they are given so many days off during the year for Christmas break, thanksgiving break, Easter break, and every national/banking holiday; teaching doesn't seem so bad. 

With regard to the recognition I'm 100% on board with you. It is an admirable profession and should be treated as such. However, I'm not sure the financial downside is as bad as some will lead you to believe.  &gt; Good teachers never get the credit

The operative word being GOOD. How many of your teachers were truly good? How many of them can you HONESTLY say that you learned a lot from them and your time in their classroom was truly valuable? Because I bet you can count how many of those teachers you had on your right hand. Most teachers are meh at best and fucking retarded at worst. Guess that masters degree means fuck all when it comes to teachers knowing what they are talking about.

Additionally, you always hear about the salary teachers get and that's it's too low etc. But what they neglect to talk about are their sick benefits. Health insurance, retirement pension and guaranteed 2.5 months vacation. Man I wish I had 2.5 months vacation. Fuck, I wish I had a week of vacation. And let's not forget tenure! That's right. As long as a teacher doesn't fuck one of their students they CAN'T be fired.

But honestly, teaching is a dying profession. With the internet, it's now possible for one person to teach hundreds of kids from ALL OVER THE WORLD. It's already started happening in university. In 30-40 years the classroom will be unrecognizable from what it is today. We won't need as many teachers and we can finally stop hearing them bitch about how little they're paid when there are so many other professions that have more hours and get paid way less. That's not what the question was... It's an important point, but not exactly on topic. This thread is about jobs which, if done well, will go unnoticed. I remember every good teacher I've had since kindergarten. Even bad teachers leave a huge impression on students lives, and even have frequent contact with some parents. Teachers are the opposite of what this thread is about. 50-70k and summers off. 

It's a pretty great job.  Yeah, but working about 60 hours a week for the rest of the time. There's a lot of people who work a lot more and get paid a lot less. Without every holiday and summer off, benefits, and a rewarding job environment. 

I honestly can't see why teachers complain so much... Are you serious? 'Good teachers' get a SHIT ton of credit. Maybe not the pay, but they get noticed. However, shitty teachers go unnoticed due of the ratio of good to bad teachers.
 But..you get summer vacation and winter break. yes [deleted] part time? I think he's referring to having the summers off as well as a break around Christmas and, in Massachusetts at least, a week off in February and a week off in April. This is on top of their vacation and sick time. Officially their hours are 8-3 here with a half hour lunch (6.5 hours) but some (usually the younger teachers) will stay after. The mediocre tenured teachers high tail it out right after the bell rings, same as the kids. 

My parents both work in the school system (not as teachers but admin staff) and don't get anywhere near the respect or pay that the teachers do.  Supply and demand. There is more supply of teachers than demand, so the pay is reflective of that. If you want more money, please choose another profession because supply and demand is never going to change.  Yup, I've got nearly 60 students on program with me and all that gets noticed is when one quits or is behind on their work. 

To clarify,  I deliver NVQ's in the UK. Pay is shit too.

That being said, I'm sat here while one of them is doing 2 hours work of tests on my other laptop so I can surf reddit. Scandinavia does it well. Teachers are at the same level as a doctor  Highway Engineers Referees and Umpires My idea exactly. It's not just about making the right call, it's about being merely a vehicle for the rules and taking your personality out of the game (especially in soccer). &gt; being merely a vehicle for the rules and taking your personality out of the game (especially in soccer).  

that's wrong for football. the rule of football is very vague (relative to basketball or hockey) and ref has a lot of freedom to interpret the situation and apply the rule accordingly. not all ball touching hand should be ruled handball, depending on whether it's intentional or not (according to the ref), application of yellow card also often depends on the referee's discretion (e.g. if the game turns aggressive, he should card more harshly to reduce aggressivity), etc.  

it's not only about making the right call, that is true, but because it is about positioning (out of the way of the play, but good enough angle to see what happens), gaming management (harshness or leniency in foul and cards), ability to read the flow of the game (giving advantage or blow the whistle), etc. Football* With basically every decision they broadcast slow motion replays so they are always praised for their good calls and crucified for their bad calls. What often goes un noticed is when they are running around and trying to concentrate for 90 mins and how hard that is. Talking about football (soccer) if you didnt notice.  ability to read the game, ability to position themselves so not getting the way while getting good angle, game management (foul/card), etc Yeah concentrating on doing all of that With the exception of WWE  True. But there's always someone who thinks you're not doing a good job.  Everything they do or don't do, someone is going to be pissed. Good refs are amazing.  Goalies*

When you make a good save, you're just doing your job. When you miss a save "rabblerabble-goalie sux-rabblerabble" As someone who plays in goal, I know exactly what you mean. It's the most psychological position in the sport, because you're not running around with no time to remember your screw up.

I always make a special effort to congratulate the goalie after a game I go to watch. It makes a hell of a difference. Already been said idiot State legislation.  Watch this clip from John Oliver to know what I'm saying https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIMgfBZrrZ8 That was funny but also deeply frightening. Most of Last Week Tonight is like that.

...after watching everyone laugh at that picture from GOT where the actress has a green proxy dragon with markers on it, someone said "I wish there was more CG, though, actually... I love the dragons"

you have no fucking idea how much CG is in Game of Thrones- or any movie, really- and that's exactly how we want it to be.  Someone posted a video on r/movies that showed a ton of the visual effects shots in Wolf of Wall Street. Really drove this point home. I [just watched this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmt-g-qSVsY) yesterday actually, talking about that exact thing on GoT.

HBO just aired a [day-in-the-life of Game of Thrones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9Mi17nLflY) production also that shows how complicated that show is to produce and the myriad people it takes to bring the show to life.

Those 2 videos are a good way to spend a lunch break. I just realized I haven't sneezed in about four days.

Maybe this is really happening. Not really. I sneezed 30 minutes ago. Sorry. So it started as of 15 minutes ago.  Just sneezed, sorry And so it begins.

Laying in bed with sick girlfriend she just sneezed.

Will update

Edit 10:32 2/12/15

She just sneezed again! 

Edit 10:38 2/12/15

Another documented sneeze. Code name "Ol Faithful" continues to sneeze at regular intervals of about 6 minutes. I'm pretty sure she was sneezing between the first two updates too it's just I was watching Captain America: The Winter Soldier and it's a pretty dope movie 

Edit 10:46 
 
She sneezed again and coughed right after. I asked her how she felt and she didn't answer so I was like if you're awake don't say anything so I'm pretty sure she's just mad at me. Or sleeping. I do have Captain America on pretty loud. And I've totally been staring at Scarjo's ass the whole time. But it's about more than that I think- she's ready for serious commitment that I'm just not sure I can handle right now (10:50 another sneeze/cough) I don't know I guess it feels like we're both going the same path in life and we have similar views and opinions and senses of humor and everything and we match each other perfectly but I'm just not sure. I don't know. I'm scared to be that open with someone. You let someone into your head and they judge you they can leave you and break you and it hurts man. It hurts. People are animals but maybe she's not. No she's definitely sleeping now.

Edit 11:03 2/12/15

She's throwing up in the bathroom now, girlfriend has the flu. Shit is grossssss. For some reason I haven't gotten sick at all though even though I've been with her a lot, my mom thinks it morning sickness but also that's just my mom (I hope) Captain America still going strong. How can someone be happy if their two biggest fears are commitment and dying alone? I don't know what I'm doing with my life

Fuck

She just sneezed again. I'm signing off. This has been too self reflective for my taste and I try go long periods without acknowledging my problems directly. Thanks guys. &gt; How can someone be happy if their two biggest fears are commitment and dying alone? I don't know what I'm doing with my life

This is a goddamn work of art. Hats off to you.  This is better than jenny. Keep it coming OP! This turned out to be quite beautiful. Science, man... :') Everything you wrote there made my day better probably very quickly. some people have allergies and sneeze a lot-they would notice individuals, maybe they would think it's odd after a couple days. But having that translate to a global understanding and acceptance is unfathomable. I think it would go like this. A bunch of allergy sufferers would realize they all have suddenly stopped sneezing, perhaps through an online message board for people with bad allergies. It'd start spreading around online, not quite "viral" because no one would give a shit at first, but it'd get mentioned on big internet hubs like reddit or 4chan.

While this is going on, individual hospitals/medical centers/doctor's offices would start to notice that no sick people sneeze anymore. Eventually someone in one of those offices would come across the online rumors and start connecting the dots. My best guess for the flashpoint here would be when an employee of the CDC hears the rumors. 

Once the CDC finds out, it would be days before everyone knew. But I have no idea how long it would take to get to the CDC. It we think in "orders of magnitude" like days/weeks/months/years, my best guess is many weeks or a couple of months (perhaps depending on how close to peak allergy season in the US or Western Europe the cessation occurs). 

Amazing question btw. A followup that I just thought of might be this: what is the most recent date at which you can be reasonably confident that humanity would *never* find out? I guess you'd have to go back to the first widespread record of sneezing, because if it sticks around in legit medical textbooks, then eventually (even if it's 100 years later) people are going to read those books and say "wtf is a sneeze, I have literally never seen anyone do that."  &gt;  but it'd get mentioned on big internet hubs like reddit or 4chan.

DAE not sneeze?? Then a post asking that would result in answers exactly like in this one.

"Shit... I don't know... when was the last time I sneezed?" we need to start /r/nosneeze as a place to post that you just sneezed. that way, if you're ever unsure, you can check the subreddit to make sure that the world is still sneezing. Then naturally /r/nosneezecirclejerk as comedic relief from our sneeze-less judgement day.  You know you're in a good /r/AskReddit thread when an entire new sub spins off of it.  This is going to be on Buzzfeed in about 20 hours Excellent answer, followed up by an excellent followup question. Imagine if we all had lost the ability to sneeze a while ago, but still had that buildup feeling. You know how much it sucks when you're just about to sneeze and then you can't? So if that just happened every time you would have sneezed otherwise. How would such a phenomenon be interpreted/discussed? "Hey man, you know that feeling when you really have to.... do something with your nose or face or something but then you can't?" "Yeah that sucks I hate that" As soon as Kleenex stock starts going down. They have other uses (   )

Edit: Thanks for the gold, anonymous benefactor! Kleenex suddenly starts being sold exclusively in Adult stores, and advertising on porn sites. Kimberly-Clark buys Vivid Entertainment. We can still blow our noses, you know. Yeah, we only stopped sneezing god knows when, let's be realistic. Oh senpai, your nose-mucus... it's everywhere. i try to keep an open mind, but that's the strangest fetish i've heard in some time. You guys don't wipe anything other than sperm and snot?  Sure...blood. Not mine though...wait. Someone has their red wings.  In my entire life I have never seen a person that realizes they are about to sneeze race for a tissue. Who the fuck uses kleenex for sneezes? People working in hospitals might notice a little quicker, seeing everyone with illnesses stop sneezing at once. My bet would be a couple days, assuming the government doesn't try to cover it up or anything. Good in theory, but as a nurse most people in the hospital aren't really sneezing. My thinking is that a day care worker or elementary school teacher might notice it first. Or someone with a severe allergy to cats or something.  Yeah, it would definitely be all the people with allergies first "Huh, that's funny, I'm *not* miserable right now. Something's not right..." No, you're still miserable but now it's even worse because you *can't sneeze*. You don't *lack* the symptoms or need. Oh God it'd just be the eternal need to sneeze, but you never could Ah... *aaah*.... *ahhhhh*... 

***WHERE THE FUCK IS MY SNEEZE AND WHY DID IT CANCEL***

It's such an odd sensation.  And when the sneeze cancels it still goes on cooldown, so you need to wait to cast it again.

Just infuriating. With 7 billion people in the world, I'm sure there is someone, somewhere, who is doing research specifically on sneezing. Maybe they pay test subjects to sniff pepper and then measure the force of their sneeze, I dunno. Anyway, that sneezologist would notice right away and put the word out. And his time to shine would come. He would be world famous, and die surrounded by loved ones and admirers. For that one moment he gets to be the guy at the beginning of a movie who wears a lab coat and gets to make press conference speeches. Yeah, but he would probably lose his funding when there was no one to sneeze for his research. If everyone in the world stops sneezing, I'm pretty sure "world's foremost expert on sneezing" would have all the work he wants.  &gt;sternutologist

:)  You do whatever you want, but if I get that job I'm printing "sneezologist" on my business cards. What an insidious government plot that could be. Truly could be a cover up on a huge scale. Aliens at Roswell, the grassy knoll shooter, and now nobody sneezes anymore.  Well, *someone* is bound to overreact though.  
*This lack of sneezing is mentioned indirectly in Revaluations! The end is upon us!* 2 Kings 4:35

&gt;Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. [Wow, that's a actual verse too.](http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-35.htm) Google "sneeze Bible". Shh let the magic be magical. *magical bible sneezing* *sneezing magically into the bible* ***bless you***
 never thought I'd see those particular 3 words in 1 sentence. I was Googling for Bible verses when I had to sneeze. Now you've seen it again. What is it with the fucking number 7 and the bible.  Every other goddamn story has the numeral 7 or 40 in it.  What the fuck. They are both symbolic numbers. 7 is a sign of completion or fulfillment, and 40 is a sign of renewal or cleansing. There are a lot of symbolic numbers in the bible. 7, 12, 40, 3, 6, 50, 10 and others. And the Lord spake, saying, "Thou shalt sneeze seven times, no more, no less. Seven shall be the number thou shalt sneeze, and the number of the sneezing shall be seven. Eight shalt thou not sneeze, neither sneeze thou six, excepting that thou then proceed to seven. Ten is right out. Once the number seven, being the seventh number, be reached, then wipest thou thy face of thy booger. It's not meant to be literal. It's a sort of old-timey slang. Similar to nowadays when we say 'forever' we just mean a really long time.

3, 7, and 40 are the frequently used numbers to denote short, medium, and long-ass times. 40 generally doesn't mean the actual number 40, in context it kinda means "until it's done"/"a large number". It's the highest single digit prime number. In many theologies, this means something significant. TIL the Bible has a section about adjusting the value on things
 Yup. I'd be confident in saying that it'd take 3-4 days. First day, barely notice. You'd notice patients not sneezing midway through the 2nd day, and by the end of the 2nd day you'd have mentioned it to a coworker, who likely noticed a similar thing. 

Day 3- by mid-morning, you'd be curious enough that you'd try to get a patient to sneeze. Post suction, nasal spray maybe. You wouldn't resort to pepper yet. That lunch, you'd be joking with coworkers, and someone would jokingly do a line of pepper. Nothing. Someone else tries. Still nothing. Within 5 mins, the cafeteria looks like a failed drug rehab meeting, everyone's eyes are watering, and someone's calling their mate at another hospital and asking them. They confirm, and someone notifies the national health board. Either that night, or the next morning, this has been reported in a bunch of first world countries. Not long before it's being talked about on breakfast shows and evening news. #sneezegate is trending on Twitter, people are failing to adjust to having to blow their nose far more frequently, and people with hay fever are practically rivers of mucus and tears. This sounds like the last season of Torchwood. After a quick search I found that scientists are still actively researching the physics of sneezing and its* implications on infection prevention. I'm sure they would notice very quickly that their participants no longer sneezed at whatever stimulus they use to enduce and study sneezing. As scientists they would also be likely to look into their observations further. 

http://math.mit.edu/~bush/?p=1873

Even if they were not running a study at the time, the researchers who work on these problems would be hyper sensitive to the subject. I imagine they would notice fairly quickly and be very curious to look into it. There are people who think about sneezing for a living:


&gt; Were trying to rationalize the droplet size distribution resulting from the fluid breakup in the respiratory tract and exit of the mouth, she says. That requires zooming in close to see precisely how these droplets are formed and ejected.

http://cee.mit.edu/bourouiba I don't know whatever stimulus they are using, but could you imagine if it was something unpleasant? What I mean is, if they just have a robot that puffs air at you and it induces a sneeze, no big deal. But if they have some poor guy in a chair with his nose wired up to some big board that they use to have him sneeze in specific ways, and when it doesn't work they just keep turning up the juice on this poor guy? or "Well, three tablespoons of pepper didn't work. See if he can get four this time". "Just keep staring at the light Mr. Jones, another half an hour should usually do it".

Tragic. RIP in peace non-sneezing sneeze tester. This is starting to sound like a Doctor  Who plot.  I read this about 5 minutes ago and my nose hasn't stopped bleeding since. Please help. You think this is funny but there are like 10 people with bleeding noses reading this and freaking out Yep, I'm one of them. WTF Your nose, of all noses, shouldn't be bleeding! *Oh God it's happening.....* Like me right now. No seriously it's bleeding. Mine was bleeding a bit earlier, but I think that was because I accidentally inhaled some powdered benzoic acid in the lab earlier. Hasn't bled since, so it hopefully killed any eggs that were in there.  Keep me updated damnit!

A+, pal. It was mediocre, around C++ I C what you did there.

Though the A is for Assembly. It's pretty basic, really.  Eww, I just realized that undoubtedly some people must sneeze while their noses are bleeding.  Now I'm terrified.  Thanks. I have done this. It gets messy r u ok (_`)

 Why is /r/historicalwhatif private?  The owner went on a power trip over trivial things.  We are trying to start the new one over at /r/historywhatif but it has been slow going. This is the deepest shit I've read all day. I'm perplexed by this. Would we even realise? I can't remember the last time someone sneezed, could it have happened already? when did I last sneeze? OH GOD that's what I'm saying man.  I haven't smoked in weeks and I feel like I've got a contact high from that question Can confirm. I'm high right now and I think  this is some profound shit, man!  I sneezed less than an hour ago. We need to set up a headquarters to monitor and lapse in sneeze reports. [6] I just sneezed. And will probably sneeze again within ten minutes. Yay, allergies! That's how we'll know. People who have allergies won't sneeze. They'll be the first to know and soon the world 9 min old post, did it happen yet? 11 minutes. It had to have happened by now. The government got to him first. Oh no, it's worse than we thought. Humans aren't losing the ability to sneeze, our governments are simply cleansing away all those who do sneeze. 

E* we're all done in now, I just sneezed. I only hope the underground resistance is able to carry on the fight we died uncontrollably blinking for.  Yup. You and I would notice pretty damn fast the moment we're sweeping or vacuuming and not a single sneeze occurred. Do you also sneeze when you look into a sunny sky around midday? That's a thing. Shit, I'm sober and my mind is still blown by this. But what of your nose?

Edit: Something something thanks, something something Howard Stern's penis. You hit a fucking home run today I sneezed this afternoon, so we're probably good.  
For now... I think you're lying because I can't remember the last time I sneezed. OP is clearly a rogue government scientist that has decided to tell everyone the top secret research that governments perform to maintain control of the world. I sneezed earlier today as well.. Has anyone sneezed since then?  have not sneezed sense op posted, so i think we can safely say humans can no longer sneeze, confirmed here first I can confidently say no. Oh well, civilization had a good run but i'm gonna celebrate our new lizard overlords with some good old fashioned looting. it's like Children of Men but for sneezing

it's **Children of Nose** The Mucous of Men makes *so much more sense*. I laughed at Children of Nose, then laughed at Mucous of Men and realized how stupid Children of Nose really sounds. I can't wait to see the cinematography for that.  A 10 minute long shot of Clive Owen walking with someone sneezing and everyone staring.  I have allergies.. I would know within a few days and realize something was up...

Edit -added "and"

Edit 2 - I didn't realize many other people sneeze all the time... I thought I was bad..  thanks for the comments Same here.  I think that's how it would work.  People with allergies would realize within a couple days, comment on it to other people, other people would start going "you know, I haven't sneezed in a while either" and word would spread until it became clear. I sneezed 9 times last night before bed. But that was 24 hours ago... Maybe that was my body ridding itself of every last sneeze it had in it. 

Just think, maybe there were other things we stopped doing but never noticed and we can't notice them anymore because we don't do them? 

We need to set up a 24/7/366 (extra day just to be safe) hot-line where we can call and log our sneezes.  Don't panic, I sneezed earlier today. 
I somehow managed to get some bacon and cheese omelette up my nose and ended up walking around the house looking up at the ceiling with a weird look on my face.
When I finally sneezed it all shot out, or evaporated in my nose somewhere.
Either way, I sneezed, so we are still sneezing. How do you know that wasn't the last sneeze ever? You could have been the last person to sneeze. A lot of times I sneeze if I look in the sun's direction, so I would probably realize after a few months. Most definitely by Summer. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photic_sneeze_reflex &gt; The condition affects 1835% of the population

Wow, I though it was everyone. I guess I should consider myself lucky, because it's super convenient if I'm on the verge of a sneeze that won't come out. Just look at something bright and away you go! This actually made me look like a fool many times before I knew about it.  I, too, thought it affected everyone, and more than once when someone said something like "argh I really need to sneeze but can't" I would respond "just look at the sun!"

People looked at me like I was fucking crazy, but never said anything.  It wasn't until a few years ago that I learned about photic sneeze reflex, and suddenly felt like an idiot for all the times the above situation happened. &gt;&gt; The condition affects 1835% of the population

And this is the first time ive heard about it.

 Apparently it's something they test for in fighter pilots. Can't be colorblind. Can't sneeze when looking into the sun. annnddddddd I'm 0 for 2.

 Yes, but now you can join the ranks of the photic vanguard and be forever vigilant...watching and waiting for the day when the sneeze stops.   I would realize pretty quickly because of this. With all the snow reflecting the sun in my face I'd be the savior who figures it out. Is this like a twist on that movie The Children Of Men"??? That'd be good. At the end all of the soldiers put their weapons down as a sneezing man comes staggering out of the building. They weep. Fuck that. Shoot him!!! We don't want that shit spreading!! And mankind forges ahead into the darkness No it's like the twist from Shawshank Redemption. When he opens the box and its his wifes head?? Then the wife looks up at him and says "Bruce Willis was Rosebud the dead sled the whole time" and she sneezes?? What a tortuous condition that could be (if interpreted a certain way): you still felt like you had to sneeze like you normally would leading up to a sneeze, but you never could get the release that comes when you let out that sneeze. Damn dude. This was my first interpretation of the question as well. You've got that tickle in your nose, but your body is powerless to take care of it. Your eyes are watering, your sinuses are stinging, every breath you take leads to a tiny prickle of pain... I think we'd notice pretty quickly. Calm down there satan. Day 1:
People with chronic sneezing are having a good day. 
Day 3:
Success kid meme posted on reddit:
- Title: 15 years with allergies every day
   Rest:  Three days without sneezing. 

Amazing feedback, bunch of people claiming it is happening to them as well. 
Everyone becomes more sensible to the subject. 

Day 5
Random dude posts it on Facebook and gets x3 likes he usually gets and a few comments. 

Day 10 
Someone else posts some non-allergy update on Reddit and everyone gets batshit crazy, people starting to ask when was the last time someone sneezed. 

And once we get to that question, its just a matter of a day maybe before some news stations in the world start going with it. 

. 

A problem I can forsee is some dickheads will falsely claim they have sneezed just to get attention. 

And if we get to the realization that no one is sneezing anymore, Im afraid the Republican party will try to sell that climate change is good for you.

Edit: a word. First gold ever! , thank you dudes.  If it's a legitimate sneeze, climate change has ways to try to shut that whole thing down."  Plus, with the way she dressed ^(so inadequately for the cold weather) she was asking for it I fucking love sneezing. Its a full body instaboner when i sneeze a couple times in a row. I even get jealous when i hear other people sneeze. So i think i'd definitely notice if I or nobody around me sneezed.  

Sneeze.  I am right there with you. Fuckin love it. Especially when you sneeze like 5 times in succession and your eyes water and your nose just goes numb, like you didn't even have one.  I found the sneeze fetishists. What the fuck is happening here This is just a decoy. Hiccuping has already stopped worldwide. ...has anyone hiccuped? OP, how high? I'm guessing he's anywhere from 5'5 to 6'3. Playing safe with averages and a range, I see. /u/Dudwithacake, I'm going all in with 5'3. That's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em. HU-man Version 1.0.2.3778 OTA update. 

-----------------------------------

OTA update will be released tonight. It will apply once HU-man is in a sleep state. 

Patch notes:

* Fixed a bug where HU-man would seize and a convulsive expulsion of air from the lungs through the nose and mouth occurred.
 
* Optimized cognitive recall. 

* Added framework to resolve fatal peanut response error observed in some units. We anticipate pushing out the RC to selected participants in the 2016FLU patch. 

Known issues
----------------

* Bio-waste excretion from sphincter is on average 43% thicker requiring several cleaning cycles. In the mean time we recommend the use of a wet wipe to help reduce the time required to clear waste. If possible use a jet of water to clear any waste that clings to the skin. 

* Known issue where the sphincter muscle will open and stay open requiring the HU-man unit to use a scoop to clear bio-waste. If this occurs kindly do the needful. 




 As someone who is going to die sneezing... Pretty quickly. You'll all call me crazy for awhile though. "We can't sneeze I tell ya!!"

 I sneeze 40 times a day. Put me (and several witnesses who know me) in a room with an hour for a cat. They'll spread the knowledge. I'm *extremely* allergic to them. But it also has to be confirmed to be everyone in the world. 1 down, 6,999,999,999 to go.

Edit: I was never missing any 9s. What are you talking about? *looks around nervously* After reading this thread I have become super aware of how weird the word "sneeze" is. I'd realize it as soon as sunlight hit me and I didn't sneeze. Same deal here. First time I walk out on a bright day, I'd know. You are the third person to mention this. 

Can you illuminate? 

Bad pun was intended, to my dying shame. It's an actual observed phenomenon called photic sneezing, or Autosomal dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst (ACHOO) syndrome. (I'm not making that up.) It's not well understood, but it affects 18-35% of the population and can be genetically inherited.

Source: the totally credible sources that the Wikipedia page uses. Also, my nose. I would run up to people in Manhattan frantically gasping for air whilst grabbing someone by the lapels shaking them violently asking them "Have you sneezed today damn you!" When sunlight touches me, I sneeze. Happens every time I expose myself to sunlight after being indoors.  Holy crap, other people do this, too? I thought I was the only one. There are people in this world that have life long sneezing fits.  They would know immediately.  yeah, but everyone would have to believe them. I feel like this is the important point that keeps getting forgotten. I've seen you repeat this so many times. xD I can hear the cries of zebra hoofbeats and Occam's beard now. ~~10 hours then. Good discussion.~~

Jesus Christ.  

 Quite the leap from "My life-long sneezing fit has ended" to "All of humanity has stopped sneezing." If someone who wasn't sneezing told me they used to have a life-long sneezing fit, I probably wouldn't believe them. They would know though, and it would make the local news during the last 20 minutes when they have nothing to talk about.  If hiccup girl could make the national news for hiccuping, a sneezy could make the news for miraculously not sneezing for the first time in 26 years.  Then, everyone is thinking of sneezing, and a few more people come forward.  At that point, I think people would catch on. You're right, it would go viral fast. People would be actively trying to sneeze and not able to,it would be on the news within hours. so jealous of those people. i sneeze like 1x a week and i love it. if it's an inopportune time and i have to muffle it, my day is ruined I have no insight at all, but I think this is my favorite question posted to AskReddit in a long time. I liked the m&amp;m's one, when they tried one week without NSFW questions  yup The first people to notice will be those who are plagued by sneezing often. And even then they will just be happy they personally arent afflicted anymore and won't consider it to have effected everyone. Even when pointed out, most people will be like "huh, yeah I havnt sneezed in a while. odd" then move on with their life. It's going to take years to decades for a formal study to look into it.  I'd say with social media and people writing about anything, it wouldn't take so long before it gets in the news. I'd say a week or 2.

I can picture a bunch of people on twitter or facebook: "Wow fantastic, I haven't sneeze in days"
Then slowly they would notice each other's comments. Then some not so important blogger would write about it. Then more and more important blogs would, then celebrities would come forward. And Bam! People listen to celebrities's shit. News start talking about it and people get scared. 

Studies starts around the world. Someone elsewhere mentioned that there are scientists that study the 'physics of sneezing'. They'd notice pretty quickly that they can't get people to sneeze, so i doubt that it would take long for a 'formal' study to realize. Maybe a couple days before those people are confident it isn't just localized to their area.  I just sneezed A good proportion of the population sneezes whenever they go outside in bright light. After a couple of days, many people with this condition will notice for themselves and mention it to friends, who may also have this condition. Not long after, there will be a large network out there of people who are weirded out by their lack of sneezing.  One of them makes a post to Reddit, and every news outlet shoves it on their front page: "Weird condition preventing people from sneezing. Are you at risk?"

So about 3 days. I intentionally look into the sun or a bright light several times a day for this reason. If I can't make myself sneeze I freak out. I think I'd notice within 4 hours tops. I've also got a hyperactive photic sneeze reflex, but usually if it's just been activated it will be an hour or so before it's activated again. I usually feel like I'm in an enlightened minority when I demonstrate this trick. Would be cool to be the first ones on the case. WE COULD SAVE LIVES! I think those of us who can actually demonstrate the reflex are in a very small (and enlightened) minority - nowhere near the 30%-18% often claimed. I sneeze pretty instaneously when I walk outside after being in my office. Even if there is cloud cover. If I didn't, I would be weirded out. I might test it once more but would probably say something after that. 

Agreed. 3 days tops.  A large majority of the world might not notice for years, but somewhere out there, some type of sneezologist would notice within days. Hell, he/she probably already tried to warn us before it happened. But did we listen? No.  Oh man, damn, that's a crazy and interesting question. I think there's like a 60% chance that we wouldn't notice for decades.  I can just imagine telling my grandkids about the golden sneezing days of yore. Honestly, yeah. Sneezing feels good. I would miss it. "It was so satisfying, the feeling of relief. It's like when you have to pee really bad and then you do, the best" "When we had something in our nose, rather than waiting for it to fill up so we could blow it, we would risk death and shoot air out of our nose to get rid of it. "Grandpa what's a sneeze?" Decades?! I'd give it a week or two, tops.  Allergy sufferers would notice within a couple of days or a week. It would defiantly come to light from doctors and patients very quickly.  One day we will reminisce about it  i think there's like a 0% that you're right people would see old videos and when somebody sneezed they would be like, what the hell was that Sneezing panda I think the first people to realize would be people running allergy medication testing. Those with allergies would notice immediately. I sneeze at least 4 or 5 times a day  Lucky bastard This is honestly the most thought provoking question I have ever seen... And it's about sneezing... What if we humans used to be able to sneeze wax out of our ears and now we can't?  hahaha, please tell me your stoned right now Probably not that long. All it would take is a hypochondriac to realize he/she isn't sneezing anymore, then they'll go to their doctor about it, and the doctor, annoyed, will try to induce a sneeze to get them out. Once he finds that he can't do it, he'll try it on other people until it is eventually determined that they can no longer sneeze. Multiply this situation by the X number of hypochondriacs out there and it'll soon circulate the world.

How long it will take them to prove that we all did indeed lose our ability to sneeze is another story though. You can't exactly jump to the conclusion that the entire world lost its ability to sneeze very easily.

EDIT: also, I sneezed while writing this. So we're still good on my end. I thought about something along these lines recently. Who is the last person on the earth to wish someone else a happy new year each year?  How late in the year does that happen too?   i'd hear about it on reddit before i'd notice If you have someone on speakerphone or where others can hear the conversation  let them know. A cab driver was on speakerphone in the cab the other day, and he wasn't making light conversation he was coaching his brother in law through a pretty fucked up divorce.

I just sort of sat there like "fucking hell this is better than tv" &gt;  "fucking hell this is better than tv"

you're not setting the bar high there, buddy. It's ok James Cameron will save us and raise the bar.  And if at all avoidable (ie, if you're not driving or otherwise using your hands), don't indiscriminately use speakerphone if you're in the presence of other people who aren't part of the conversation. I have a brother-in-law who takes every single phone call on speakerphone, and then everyone else just has to shut up and listen until he's done. It's super annoying.  My mom used to do this! When she first got her phone hooked up to the car, if you called her, the car automatically put the call through the car's sound system (essentially putting you on surround sound speaker phone). Halfway through the conversation, I'd say, "Are you with other people?" And she'd say, "I'm driving, talking to you through the car!" Let me know that first... My dad does this all the time. I can usually tell these days though, by the way he sounds.  My dad puts his phone on speaker and yells into it like it's a walkie-talkie. But he's usually alone when he talks. I agree you can usually hear if it's on speaker.  If you're in a group and you are sharing a funny picture or joke written on your phone, pass it to everyone, not just 1 or 2 people. It saves the utter awkwardness of someone inching forward to see the photo, only to have to slink back into their chair. Its like leaving someone hanging Yeah, it's just like when others join the group include them in the joke or conversation. It's rude to just socialize with one person.  I agree. It makes everyone else that didn't see the pic/joke/video super self conscious and totally kills the mood. I can't agree with this more. Coming from the one who's always left out... Log out of your account after you're done  And if someone left theirs logged in accidentally- log out for them. But not until you changed their Facebook profile info to say that they're gay. [ http://i.imgur.com/skeWow2.jpg]( http://i.imgur.com/skeWow2.jpg) LPT:  On someone else's computer?  Use private browsing.  It automatically logs you out, doesn't track anything, and they can stay logged in to their accounts. Don't get upset if someone doesn't reply immediately to a text/FB message or any other type of message on a social network.

Sometimes the person is busy even though the app shows it online, or maybe that person doesn't want to speak at the moment and that's fine.  Those times are when I hate facebook's 'message seen' thing. I feel obligated to respond, because I can't just say 'I didn't see it.' I don't know about the mobile version, but I leave Facebook open all the time while I'm on reddit. If you just click the tab but not the message window, you can read what was said without them knowing you read it. I used to do that. On Android, you can also pull the notification panel down and read most of the message without reading it. On smartwatches you can actually scroll up and down through the entire conversation and it won't tell them you saw it.

But now I don't care. If they make a big deal about it I just laugh at them and say I was busy. Worst. Feature. Ever.  I know right? Who in their right mind *wants* that as a feature? The only reason I can come up with is that it applies social pressure to less active Facebook users to open the page up in order to respond. Once the page is open, the chances of being distracted and going through your news feed/group pages, etc, would be higher.

Or I'm totally wrong, who knows. "sorry, I was on my way someplace/in the middle of something and meant to respond when I got where I was going, and got side tracked" is usually enough. 

I'm set to appear offline all the time. Avoids that problem. If someone says "Why didn't you answer? It says you saw it." I can play dumb and say "I don't know, my app was probably open in the background and marked it seen" and they backtrack and say "oh, well okay."

Also, in Chrome there is some extension that doesn't mark it seen on the desktop.  Don't remember the name.   I am just horrible at this. I often take several hours to respond to a text. But it depends on the situation. 

We're making plans for this afternoon? I'll respond very quickly. This is an urgent conversation and should be dealt with ASAP. 

You send me a funny picture? Meh. I'll wait until I have something witty to respond. Or sometimes I just don't feel like talking. It might be a few hours before I respond. And I think that's okay. 

We live in a culture filled with instant gratification which means people want texts back immediately, which I think is silly. Without phones, if I'm not feeling social, I can stay in for the night. No problem. Everyone has those days. But, suddenly, I'm handed a phone and I'm obligated to be social at all hours of the day because it's 'rude' to not respond to a text message instantly. Doesn't seem right to me.  I have a very simple policy that I'll get back to you when I get back to you, and if you would prefer that I get back to you faster, you can always go fuck yourself. Sometimes I get irrationally mad at this, and then I take a second and remember wait I do this all the time, sometimes you're busy, can't think of a response right away or just don't want to be social at that moment. I think there's a lot of open areas regarding phone usage (and by phone I mean smartphones). 

I still don't understand why people think it is a good idea to suddenly stop in the middle of the sidewalk and reply to text/instant messages/check Facebook/whatever you're doing on your phone, blocking the way for everyone. Just take a few side step and stand next to a wall or something, don't do this in the middle of the road.  If you are about to post a photo online, make sure it isn't something that you'll look back on in 5 years and think "Why the fuck did I do that?"

Edit: When I posted I actually wasn't thinking about future employers seeing your photos (which is also an important thing to think about). I was thinking more along the lines of posting embarrassing photos that give your friends and family material to pick on you for years. I don't know if this counts as etiquette, but I will strongly urge my son to privacy protect his online posts and photos, and to be judicious with what he chooses to write about online, even privately. I wonder if his generation will be much more privacy savvy after seeing the mistakes of my generation. My husband is still finding stuff he wrote in forums when he was a teenager, and occasionally asks to have it deleted.  &gt;I wonder if his generation will be much more privacy savvy after seeing the mistakes of my generation.

They'll be worse, because they're growing up with zero social expectation of privacy. We see kids being idiots online with ours mouths agape; they see normal behavior. On the plus side, imagine how entertaining election season will be in 30 or 40 years. Billy once cheated on his girlfriend, his senior year of high school. He also called his first boss and insufferable cunt, he must be against small business owners everywhere!  Having watched my 12 year old cousin Instagram my grandmother's memorial service, I would say proper social media etiquette during fucking funerals.  Just in general... There seems to be a confusion about what should remain private. It is NOT OK to post about your 12- year-old's first period on Facebook.  Some dude i know snapchatted his brother's circumsition... Some say he used "snip" chat If he's Jewish we've been doing that shit for years. Creepy ritual circumcisions are photo album fodder for us Interesting that you say that. As a Filipino,  we take videos at wakes and funerals, among other crazy things (mah jong and karaoke at the wake). When my grandpa died, I wasn't able to go to the Philippines and we were sent pictures and videos.  I'm from the Midwest  (currently east coast), and funerals in my family are very similar. We play marbles, sing karaoke songs, watch funny tv, laugh, joke and eat.

We also take pictures of the person who passed if we can, record the services on cd, and touch the body of person who died (hold hands, rub arms). We are unfortunately not death phobic in my family. I wouldn't say "unfortunately." American culture generally treats death as a taboo. The study of death (and dying) is called thanatology. It deals with lots of aspects surrounding death. But it's not something we hear about in the U.S. because we're so afraid of death. I think the way you and your family deal with death - more like a natural part of life - is a healthy way of honoring your deceased loved ones, and for respecting life. Just my opinion though... I say unfortunately because we've had three members of our family die in the last three years, and multiple aunts and uncles before that. Not because we have a healthy understanding. I appreciate the opinion though, and thanks for the info on thanatology.

 I went to this death exhibit at a museum a couple years before the death of my brother, about how it was done in Victorian times and the traditions that followed. It was interesting. Study helps for me, I think. Did they take a selfie with the casket Also, proper etiquette to NOT Instagram you and your friends in suits in front of the funeral home with the caption "funeral swag". 

People are dicks.  The world is changing so quickly that many of these responses probably won't be relevant by the time our young children become teenagers. But the fundamentals will be the same - be thoughtful and polite; treat people in the way that you think they would want to be treated, which is probably the way that you yourself want to be treated. 

That aside, my answer would be: if you're out with your friends, don't geo-tag anyone without their permission. Maybe they don't want anyone to know they are where they are. 

Edit: Thank you so much for the gold!!  Geo tagging is a stalker's dream come true. I saw a video where this guy looked up geo tagged photos in his area and tried to find the people in the photos. Then he would come up to them and call them by their names and mention details about their lives. I thought it illustrated that point so perfectly. Creepy as heck. 

Edit: Here is the article and accompanying video for anyone who is interested: http://www.businessinsider.com/jack-vale-social-media-experiment-2013-11 Then there was the whole www.pleaserobme.com thing. 

Basically you could see which houses were empty because someone geotagged themselves away from home.  Link? [Here ya go](http://www.businessinsider.com/jack-vale-social-media-experiment-2013-11) "Thanks for invading my privacy; I'm calling the cops if you do it again."

What a dumb ass. This, so much this. That guy is an idiot if he thinks that he had any invasion of privacy whatsoever.  The **Golden Rule**. Loosely translated throughout the world, "don't be a dick to anyone because you wouldn't like it if they were a dick to you." I thought the golden rule was "those with the gold make the rules". So make them You've made a terrible mistake.

EDIT: Thanks BTW! Tldr: don't be a dick Can we invent some sort of rule about YouTube parties? Like when you're hanging out with friends and it devolves into people showing one "omg you have to see this video" after another? Or am I the only one this happens to? i completely agree! one video is fine, but when it snowballs into two hours of rugbys greatest tackles at a bbq, i will have an issue. I think that now, as an adult who is no longer new to internet videos, I would find it weird. However, I remember when the ability to watch an endless stream of hilarious videos online was a new concept but the ability to share those videos in an effective manner on social media wasn't quite there yet. Back in those days, getting together with 15 of your 8th grade classmates on the weekend and sharing the videos you had found during the week one by one on Ryan's dad's computer was the more exciting equivalent of /r/videos or whatever. Even worse is the "hang on, no, that's not the right video.  I'll just try these other twelve that look like they might be the right one..."  


If you're showing a video, you have one chance.   1. No videos longer than 10 minutes unless approved by group vote.

2. Replays only by group vote approval.

3. Bad video plays are punished by a skipping of the player on the next round.

Basically I'm just rehashing aux cord rules.  Just go with those. I think it's more like 7 minutes for aux cords though. 10 is a little much. [Relevant xkcd](http://xkcd.com/920/) Did the bot die or something. Or am I just unaware of how bots work... /r/AskReddit bans all bots. If you ask someone to watch a video you are obligated to watch a video they suggest. Maybe I just have cool friends, but I've been at gatherings (not really big enough to call them parties) where this has happened and I've never minded.  Always double check the veracity of your information before you spread it.  Snopes.com is your friend. Or is it....
 [Good question](http://xkcd.com/250/) If you do not have headphones, turn the fucking volume off on your phone in public. 

No one wants to here the background music to a phone game your playing or your phone making some obnoxious messaging noise every 50 seconds.

Edit: I mean in places like the bus, the library, or any other place where many individuals are gathered and don't want to be bothered by your unnecessary noise.
 Oh my god, I was admitted to the hospital last year and a side effect of one of the drugs they were pumping into me was a slight headache. The visitor of the patient next to me was playing Candy Crush on her phone with the volume full blast.

I almost stabbed her with my IV. 

EDIT: I was so doped up that I couldn't pull back the curtain to tell her to knock it off. And the needle of the IV was still in my arm, I'm sure it could've been used as a weapon. 

EDIT X2: Okay okay, I get it. Can't stab with IV. A million people telling me, I believe you!  I've been stabbed with an IV. You should have done it. Candy Crush is what will return them back to the hospital later on. The mental hospital, anyway. 

^^^bejeweled ^^^or ^^^nothing  Nah man, Bejeweled is fucking *drug*. Back in 2008 I bought a copy of Bejeweled 2 (before my days of real PC gaming) and played it whenever possible. 

In six months, I had "beaten" endless mode. I had so many fucking points man, it was ungodly. Beating level 252 (I believe) in Endless triggers the credit sequence.

I haven't been back. I'm gonna go on a limb and say it was either 255 or 256.  Why do people play Candy Crush with the sound on? I play the game myself, but the music is less than amazing and the  sound effects are nothing special. I enjoy it more playing without the sound. I was in a public bathroom once and this guy gets into the stall next to me. I don't know what fucking device he was using, but it had the best speaker I've ever heard. Unfortunately, he played "Like A G6." And his crew, from the door, sang along. And, this being an extended bathroom visit for both of us...fucker puts it on repeat.  Droppin dookie in the loo


(thats a shitter)


When we poo we do it slow,


Long and bitter.


Droppin bombs in the throne while 


we blarin out G6


Then we stand, turn around

 and take a piss Thanks for making me cringe from memories I have long repressed.  
  
While in the army, I had this guy who was socially demented. He created so many awkward situations by violating so many social rules or by being so obviously fake and cliche. My initial response was to hate this guy with my entire core, but my more thoughtful side felt bad for him, which caused me to be his only 'friend'.  
  
I mention being in the army with him, because his being in the army was a significant tool he would use to embarrass me. He's the kind of guy who would walk around in his uniform in public without good reasons, talk loudly about 'badass' training or deployment events, talk about how hes no hero, just looking out for his fellow battle-brothers and doing his duty to his country.  
  
Because we came from the same city, I had to travel with this guy when reporting to the unit. He would use his shitty phone to show me some music, usually ICP. He would play it on the speakers, while sitting in waiting areas, on the bus, or on the plane. He would be glancing around, trying to see who all is paying us attention.  
  
In his mind, he thinks everyone is looking on in awe as two 'badass' soldiers in uniform talk about kick-ass army stuff, with 'sick metal' music playing as the soundtrack to our 'super cool' lives.
  
I tried to drop so many social cues for this guy to stop. I'd suggest we turn it down so as to now bother others. I'd start conversations with other people so that I would be too busy for him to show me his ICP music. The obscene profanity, sexuality, and racial slurs blasting out for all to hear multiplied the factor of uneasiness I felt being associated with this guy.   
  
As we got closer I felt more confident telling him bluntly to stop stuff like that, and why it was disrespectful. In the end, I was glad I stuck it out. The guy had a terrible childhood, no real upbringing, and was extremely insecure. Despite his lack of social awareness and immature self-centered perspective, he was a genuinely nice guy who I believe to this day would throw himself on a grenade for others.  
  
There's usually more to someone than just an obnoxious or disrespectful delinquent, but dear god, I have never been as embarrassed in my life as he made me feel at times. You sound like a really nice and patient person  Came here to bitch about speakerphone conversations... Leaving with some real feels instead. That was a really nice story, man. Yo wtf I dreamed about reading this  Your dreams are dull as hell. 

Flying? Nah, let's browse reddit. I was on the bus a few years ago playing plants vs zombies. I had headphones in, but the sound was a little weird. Muffled almost. Upon further investigation, my headphones were not fully plugged in and I was broadcasting my game to the bus. 

Have never been more horrified.  I love my father dearly. And he has been working with computers and phones for over 30 years - yet I'm so embarrassed when he plays Words with Friends on high volume on public transport. Why, Dad, why? You should know better! I'm deaf so I don't have to worry about this shit but my husband says the worst are the people who need to learn how to turn the fucking keyboard sounds off!

It always seems to be older folks that do this. People that are competent enough to constantly be texting, emailing etc but not competent enough to realise that said sounds can be turned off!

His parent's are both 65+ and are really proud of their ability to use their laptop, tablets and smartphones. They're constantly on facebook, chatting to overseas friends and family as well as texting or emailing people and they use their tablets in public a lot.

We swiftly taught them how to mute keyboard sounds and turn down the volume of their notifications before someone flipped out at the constant "click, click, click" and beat them to death.  Okay, has anyone else ever seen the douches that walk down the street playing music from their phone or whatever on full blast? Like carrying the boom box on your shoulder thing. But headphones and headphone jacks on devices are so common nowadays that it's just not okay anymore. No one wants to hear other people's crappy music. (Also, for some reason, it's always the same kind of music and it's always stuff I don't recognize and it's always terrible?)

This kind of thing is uncommon but not unheard of on my college's campus. This may be one of the most original questions I've seen all day on here. Good job.    
     
I'd say this one: If you post a question on a forum, then find the answer, it is common courtesy to post the answer in said forum for future reference.  Or don't delete your post after your question gets answered. There is ALWAYS someone else with the same question Yahoo Answers has a place in all our hearts [One of my favourite XKCD's relates to this...](http://xkcd.com/979/) On the other hand, when that *one* result on google works though. Like that post by a guy who starts off by saying how all the results he found didn't have a solution and he's got a Phd and 20 years experience in the field and just decided to do it himself and record the process. This man is a hero.  So, I own a laptop that has an integrated graphics card. It's a neat machine for gaming - but unfortunately, AMD stopped supplying new drivers for it. Then, they forced a driver update on me that completely fucked the normal display up. Distraught, I was able to find a forum thread that was about a year old with a guy who not only had a similar issue - but custom-built a version of the most recent driver that worked on the card. I was floored, and started to install. To show my appreciation - I made an account and said thanks.

A few hours later, I get an email that the post was replied to. I go in, and the guy who made the driver replied - and offered to help me with any issues during the installation. Being an idiot at computers, I took him up on the offer. This guy from Egypt walked me, step-by-step, through a custom driver installation. It was better help than I've ever gotten out of actual customer support, and this guy was doing it FOR FREE - for god knows how long. The world needs more people like him. I honestly expected this to end up with..."and he led me through installing a virus that allowed him to steal all my bank details and I had to change accounts and start saving all over again."

Or something along those lines. Ya the few times I have trusted people to help me I have been screwed. Kudos for finding someone who cares. Best ones are those who post "fixed it" under their posts afterwards but DON'T SAY FUCKING HOW!  And they always lead with "nvm". Well I do mind. I mind it a lot. I did that once. Then three years later I had the same problem and could not remember what i did before. After searching came across my post and I raged hard at my younger self for NOT PUTTING THE BLOODY ANSWER IN. I think I can speak for all of us having been in the same position: "Serves you right!" &gt; Google problem  
  
&gt; Three results

&gt; Any other google search results are russian torrenting forums, NASA/USGS image directories containing raw dumps of random characters and words, or just seemingly random pages filled with useless shit   
  
&gt; Sudoku  Seriously, I hate the "use the search bar" answers. If I could search for it I wouldn't be asking! What's the point of forums if you can't ask? Either that, or, if the answer is in the forum post itself, append the title with something like "[SOLVED]" Proper phone usage when amongst friends.  This is more like social awareness imo, sometimes my friends will be talking and other times we're all on our phones so it's not weird to be texting or browsing reddit when everyone else is "Now honey, always remember to be a good boy and seed your torrents!" "Mrs Puff, you forgot to seed the torrent for tonight's homework." I'll seed once these shitty isps give me some god damn good internet.  If you're filming something, do it in **LANDSCAPE**. 

EDIT: To everyone replying about how they dgaf and film in portrait anyway, I've tagged you as, "Actively supports ISIS". WORLDSTAR!

Edit: yeet! Yo, hold it horizontal.  Holy fuck. Vertical video drives me nuts. Most especially when the frame is 1/3 sky, 1/3 foreground, and 1/3 actual content AND THE CONTENT is horizontal, so the OP has to pan back-and-forth. For fuck's sake, kids today and their iPhones. I tell ya. Spatial awareness. 

Our population is growing but our planet is not. We as a whole need to realize how much space we need versus want. 

Also, don't park your fucking cart in the middle of the grocery aisle and act surprised when I say excuse me for the eleventyth time for fucks sake.  stock boy here. Literally the most annoying thing in the world is the cart thing. When people give me the "why did you move my cart" look, i just wanna punch someone of equal height/weight to me.  I worked produce for over 2 years and this shit happen almost on a daily basis. After the first half year I gave up and stopped asking. As long as they no longer had a hand on their cart and were a few feet away, I'd pretty much always grab it and move it over to the side with a nice bang to make sure they heard. People won't confront you in my experience. If they do, just tell them it's not their cart and not their items until they check out and walk away. WAL-MART IS NOT YOUR PUBLIC FORUM, PEOPLE. Watch the caps, they take up more space than regular letters. [deleted] Dont watch what other people are doing on the computer, its bad manners to sneak behind someone and stare like if you are judging. If I hand you my phone to look at a photo, don't swipe left or right unless I say there are more photos. I always zoom in the photo a little when showing someone a photo on my phone. That way, when they swipe, they reach the edge of the photo, not the next photo on my camera roll. That's a good trick. That's why every other photo on my phone is a dick pic Right, that's why NO DONT SWIPE RIGHT I think that's what they were looking for Seriously, it's fucking nerve-racking having people looking at my pictures.  You never know if they're one swipe or ten swipes away from a picture of me in front of a mirror with my dick tucked between my legs and feces smeared on my chest. Shit, I wanna party with you. You sound fun. Party? That was at my brothers funeral.  Dora the Explorer needs to change the reason for why Swiper shows up. Then little kids will get the message. SWIPER, NO SWIPING! This or just, don't go through people's phones in general A friend asked to "see" my new phone the other day.  I obliged, and the first thing he did was open Tinder, then Snapchat.  You're not looking at my phone.  You're snooping through my shit.  That's how you lose phone permission forever. It's also how you lose friends.  Your friend sounds like a scumbag This girl I work with that I have a massive crush on handed me her phone to show me some pics of her vacation, then had to walk away.  

As she leaves, she says "don't swipe!  I have private pictures on there!" Winks at me and turns around.

She just leaves that device sitting at my elbow.

Now, I am ridiculously attracted to her, but I'm also an almost-honorable person. 

She leaves it there for fifteen minutes.  Fifteen minutes of me dead-eyed staring into the middle distance, trying to remind myself why I have morals to begin with.  A quarter hour of staving off base, carnal animal desire, digging my fingernails into my armrests.

She comes back later and picks up her phone and says, "you didn't snoop, did you?"

"No."  I hear the word leadenly fall out from my stress-sweat beaded face.

That night I ate an entire pizza because I used up my whole fucking reserve of self-control in fifteen minutes.


EDIT: for all the people saying I should have looked -- she is, as myself and several others in my workplace know, in a steady relationship with someone.  I admire her, but I'm not moving in on anything and disrespecting someone's relationship. if it makes you feel any better, there might be scientific evidence to support your story:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion Is this why I think it's okay to go to Five Guys after every time I go for a jog? It's always okay to go to Five Guys. Girl: I gave Johnny free nude pics and he wouldn't even look. I'm so fat and unattractive.  Or "I think Johnny might be gay." "I heard he was pizza-sexual" Get him someone who is pansexual and you got yourself a deep dish pizza! "That guy is a real pizza work!" Damn, guess you can't have your manners and break them too. Jesus. 

You're a strong man. Respect where it is due.  Well in this case they have my permission but mofo, I said look at this picture not the whole album. Here's a good idea. Take a photo of them, preferably through a window or some other sneaky place. Give them the phone, and when they try to snoop through your pictures, **BAM!** Your friend when he or she is watching television at night, reading a book before bed, washing the dishes, etc.

That'll teach 'em a lesson! I used to have a picture of a scary clown in my album. Caught a few snoopers out with that one.  Sounds like a really creative way to get your phone broken. Which is why he *used* to have it. Believe it or not, clown related droppage isn't covered under Apple Care.  You were meant to see my cat and not my pussy My personal one is ask before you post a pic of someone on Facebook or tag them in a photo. There is a setting (on Facebook at least) where you have to approve tagged photos before they appear publicly on your page. 

Edit: RIP inbox. I get it, of course this doesn't keep the photo from showing up *anywhere*you can't just keep someone from posting a photo just because you're in it. It's just so it doesn't appear publicly on *your* page to strangers/anyone who doesn't share a mutual friend. I have a friend who used to DJ karaoke nights for bars in the area.  They assumed it was ok to use their Facebook account to promote their own business.  They would post where they were working and then tag their entire friend list in the post. 

I don't care for karaoke, nor do I care for people tagging me at bars I have never been to.  So, I asked this friend to stop tagging me.  They didn't stop.  I asked again a couple more times, still tags.  I wanted to block just that one person specifically, but I couldn't block them without unfriending them.  I thought unfriending was too harsh of a reaction, so I set my profile privacy settings to request all posts to be approved first.  

The notifications and requests were very annoying for me and quickly became a hassle.  I decided that I didn't want to have to approve every single post because I trust all my other friends, so rather than letting one bad apple spoil the bunch, I went and deleted the DJ friend.

TLDR; personally having to screen and approve all posts is a pain in the ass.  Also, don't abuse personal networking for business. I think if you ask them not to do that anymore and they still do, that's grounds for unfriending, even if it doesn't reflect how you feel about them as a person. Those types of people are *incredibly* annoying. Yep, which is great, but it doesn't stop them appearing on other pages and if you've a lot of mutual friends it can be almost the same thing.  Little Timmy, if you don't stop sending candy crush invites, you're grounded. Timmy's actually looking to install malware on extended relatives' phones and steal their credit card information.

Timmy is trying to go to college, you fiend.  "And that's the story of how little Timmy got stuck down a well." YES. Katy Perry's *Dark Horse* started playing on the radio at work and a girl said, "This song makes me want to be a stripper."

I responded, "If I ever did that, I'd have to do it in reverse: pay me to put my clothes *back* on."

I get home and find she's tagged me in a post saying: "Bringing out my inner stripper with PessimisticOptimist1." Had an overzealous friend like that in high school. Every time I said anything sarcastic to her she'd turn it into an "inside joke" to broadcast all over her social media. I blocked her from ever tagging me in anything.  I was 16 and a junior in HS when one of my female sorta friends who was a senior turned 18. 

We weren't that great of friends but she facebook chatted me saying she was 18 and wondering what to do. 

I assumed she was sorta bragging and looking for attention about being 18, and implying that she can buy tobacco, go to strip clubs, and visit 18+ websites. 

I just said "go buy porn"

And she posted to facebook "LOL owlsrule143 wants me to buy porn! I don't even like porn!"

It was so embarassing, because I didn't want people thinking that I was a perv and was talking about porn with this girl. I asked her to remove it and she refused for a while.  That reminds me - A while back, when MSN was still a thing, I was coming down off some serious hallucinogens, I was talking to an old school friend, spouting some cringeworthy nonsense - you know, classic hippie bullshit.

I didn't have facebook at the time, but heard from another friend that she'd copied and pasted the entire conversation into a facebook status for all my friends to see.

Not cool. Not cool. How do we get older people to understand this? Old relatives think because they have a camera on their iPad, they can post any picture. I don't want the most unflattering pics of me posted when you're fiends with my SO's ex dammit.  If you're not a nice person online, you're not a nice person.  Put your damn phone away when dealing with someone whose trying to do their job. Waiters, bartenders, cashiers, doctors, toll both operators, mechanics, salespeople, checkout clerks, etc... they are all trying to do their jobs and in many cases are trying to help you. It is not only rude to be on your phone while dealing with live people, it makes it much more likely that there will be a mistake, and if you're on your phone, you'll get the blame whether the mistake was your fault or not. That while respect is earned, not given, it doesn't mean everyone starts with a 0. To that end, there must first exist mutual respect no matter what. And no, respect does not just mean "I won't kill you and shit on your porch," it means "I talk to you nicely and give your opinion proper weight."

Respecting someone younger/in a lower position also doesn't mean kowtowing to them, it means not dismissing them or appealing to your authority when things are about to not go your way just because they have a valid concern.

^\#projecting^just^asian^parent^things Recycle properly. Do not be wasteful with energy and other polluting resources. A mentality to conserve should be more important than it is today.

When I lived abroad in S. Korea, that being environmentally conscious was the subconscious norm shocked me the most. **Put your phone away when you're talking to someone.**  

Seriously. It's basically telling someone that Twitter or Facebook is more important to you than them. Don't do it.  Post about others as you would have others post about you.  I am a waitress, and in the past 3 years I have seen a huge shift in the way children behave in restaurants. There once was a time when ill-mannered children ran around and spilled things and couldn't sit still for the life of them. Now, when I serve large groups of kids, aged 6- 13, every single one of them is glued to their tablet screen. Sure, I don't have to worry about them causing any trouble, but I basically have to yell at them to get their attention and ask them what they would like to drink. Parents need to teach their kids that it is rude to be distracted in this way in many social situations.  Building on that, table manners in general. Chewing with your mouth closed, not talking with food in your mouth, etc. And even how to properly set a table, my little cousins only know because I taught them, I know because my grandma taught me. If you find an "AskReddit" that's good enough to write a response to, it's common courtesy to leave an upvote Say "gg" at the end of any online game.  No gg no skill.  gg nube 2 ez I fucking hate you. I always stay silent, because it always feels like a taunt when the highest scorer says it. Very sneaky humblebrag. Dont be a troll and abuse people online because there are people behind all these insulting usernames and "anon" tags and telling them to kill themselves or that their mom is a whore may affect some people. The occasional jokes can be funny and all and sometimes people do need to grow a thicker skin, but just remember that a lot can be avoided by not unnecessarily attacking people.

Edit: I've gotten some hate for this comment so let me copy here what I wrote a bit further down, which perhaps got a little less exposure:

&gt; I understand the humor and think its funny too, even here, the occasional "nigger" and "your mums a whore" can be funny. And like i said, it doesnt faze me. But we get carried away with it and forget that theres a person behind the screenname. Some people do it maliciously and try to hurt others because the anonymity dehumanizes us. I wasnt saying "im a unique snowflake and dissenting opinions oppress me" and I wasnt saying "bad words hurt my virgin ears" or even that I want everyone forever to stop using insults, I was just saying that directed malice becomes so much easier and we should probably tell our kids to think about what they type in the future.   
That said I will also teach my children to toughen up an to realize that people will call them cunts and tell them to kill themselves for any little weird idea and that they will get insulted left and right and to take those insults with a grain of salt too.   
I heard it once as someone complaining about all the PC bullshit and zero tolerance in schools and they compared it to a football game. When you fear you might get hurt, you train harder and toughen up to be able to take the blows from the other team, you dont ask the ref to tell them to go easy on you. And I agree 100% with that sentiment, but what I wanted to say was that we shouldnt then add spikes to our suits in an attempt to pierce the other player's protective uniforms, and then justify it by " their helmets dont let me see a face so I can dehumanize them."   
The anonymity is the helmet and the normal tackle, with all the hurt and injury that it may bring is normal, but some people go excessively in an attempt to hurt others.   
Sorry for the rant but a lot of people missunderstood what I was trying to say and I had to clear it up. I didnt mean that any ol' insult should stop and in no way intend for that or even see that as a possibility. I sometimes try to imagine what it would take me to have the courage to say half of what the trolls online say. And then, when I realize Id be awful at telling people how they're cancer, I dread the thought that these people are probably somewhere in my daily life. [Your nightmare come to life](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2cpgy4/update_i_32f_just_discovered_my_husband_34_of_six/) Wow. That's surreal. Thanks for the link. Preach.  Anonymity can be useful to allow you to explore your thoughts and find your voice - be thoughtful, creative, witty, funny, etc. - without fear of repercussion.  But there's a catch.

Louis CK described it as him watching his kids texting insults, feel the joy of being cruel without seeing the look of pain on the other person's face and thereby losing their ability to empathize.

The catch to anonymity is that if you're not careful you can lose your sense of empathy.  And when you lose that you become a troll.  Don't be that way.  If anything, try listen and see if you can learn or, when possible, help others learn. One of the things I'm noticing the most is parents these days think it's ok to hand their child an iPad or tablet while at the dinner table or in the presence of people talking to them because keeping them distracted is their solution to discipline problems. It's incredibly rude,  they're not even bothering to show them how to be courteous in front of adults, they get a pass to stick their faces in front of a monitor to play angry birds or whatever just because it's harder for them to actually parent. 

*edit* since I woke up to a load of responses this morning with some agreements and dissidence, I want to clarify when I say that shoving a tablet/ipad in a kid's face while at a restaurant is not even remotely close to giving them a coloring book for entertainment. [It's been noted academically that tablet use as a solution for distraction is no bueno](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/01/toddler-brains-research-smartphones-damage-social-development). It should become customary to respond to your elders text in full sentences. My 15 year old can have entire conversations in acronyms I have never heard of.  I text in complete sentences. My dad sends "w r u" when he wants to know my location. One of my aunts does this as well. Damn kids of yesterday huh..  My mom is the same. 

Her: "hey bb grl u wna go gt sum dnr l8r?

Me: "Not if you don't start texting me in complete sentences like an adult would."

Her: "lol! txting is hard." It's even worse when your elders try and use acronyms, I've gotten texts from my grandma that i've just been like what the fuck.. and then had to call her to clarify. Just realized perfect way to get your grandson to call you. I'm on to you grandma.. My parents butcher English when they text me. You have an iPhone, there is literally no excuse to use "r" instead of "are" etc etc Maybe your parents are just pirates. Same, I usually always write in complete sentences to try to convey my meaning as close to how I want it as possible. Meanwhile my parents text like a 12 year old girl with their phones. Also if you're using anything that has autocorrect, take a glance at it before you hit send to make sure its comprehensible. My wife just types and hits send. This once led to a text reading "Ninja hospitality" when she was trying to tell me "mom is in hospital." [deleted] [deleted] I don't care if people read my history, they can do as they wish, Reddit isn't personal and I only share information that is open. Be polite on the internet even if you're anonymous.

No need to make this brilliant place a hostile environment.

Also, don't post nudes. For the nudes I feel it is more like  grade school snacks.

"If you want to have a snack you have to bring enough for everyone"

Not that I believe you shouldn't be allowed to have your own personal cookie without sharing, it's more: If you are gonna show it off (eat your cookie infront of others/ send nudes though unsecured means such as the internet) then you better be prepared to share it with everyone. 

Edit: Finished my post since my fat fingers thought it would be a good idea to hit the post button. Disagree on the last point. All in the visual wankbank &gt; Also, don't ~~post~~ leak, hack, steal, etc., nudes.

If you want girls to continue to take nudes, treat those nudes like they're the holy grail. Fuck you and your opinions. That makes me sad in the pants. I thought it was pretty obvious it was a joke response. Sorry to make your pants sad. =/ They forgive you Look at OPs mom, you will be happy in the pants.  Unless you are visiting /r/gonewild But...why not? Don't tell me what to do idiot &gt; Be polite on the internet even if you're anonymous.

Whose anus are you living in ? The porn industry wants to have a word with you. &gt; Also, don't post nudes.

Unless you want to. Probably a good idea to not show anything that can identify you, though. Unless it's /r/gonewild :) Mmm with you up til that last part.. I wish we lived in a world where everyone had nudes on the Internet, instead of a world where the scariest thing in the world was having your nudes on the Internet.


The philosophy seems weird to me. So are Pornstars basically no longer human beings? Since the most dehumanizing thing in the world is to end up with images of your nude body on the Internet, Pornstars are kind of ipso facto non-humans in this view? &gt;Also, don't post nudes.

EVER.  

It blows my mind how scared people are of others seeing their nudes.  Just don't take them!

What you do in your private life is completely up to you.  But know your risks, and know when it's worth it to take them.

Your husband/wife is a soldier/businessman/women and he's/she's going away for awhile?  Sure send some nudes, then delete them.

Your boyfriend/girlfriend in high school/college misses you?  NO. Texts are a notification, not an obligation.  Unless the person texting you can't call because the person trying to kill them will find where they're hiding if they do. When and when not to send dick pics.  Should i send one now?  Yes. Oh, okay. [Here you go.](https://i.imgur.com/lAGzeMj.jpg) Risky click of the day More obscene than a penis, if you ask me Id have to confirm, send it to me and ill rate its sendability Never send dick pics unless asked. Never send dick pics ~~unless asked~~ *ever*.  ftfy.  you don't want nudes floating around, they can be very problematic later on, see anthony weiner for example. Eh, I got nothing to hide, it's just an average dong. No dick pics ever seems a bit overboard. I've sent dirty pictures to girlfriends before and they've sent them back but there were no identifiers in those pictures. It was just a dick or a boob or an ass. No one would be able to say "Hey, that's Binerexis' dick" unless they had seen my dick before or were some kind of expert dick identifier.  So amended: Don't send dick pics with your face in the picture. Or, as one unfortunate individual discovered when sending me dick pics, with your mail in the background. 

Basically, just dick. Nothing else. Straight up dick/vaj/boob/ass/tentacle. Sooo....no? Here's one anyways... Hint: never. There is a difference between a dick pick and an unsolicited dick pick. Also snapchat. There's really not. I don't care how many technological tricks you use, if it comes down to there's always the analog hole.

If you take pictures of yourself naked, assume that it will be sent to everyone you know. Because even if she seems nice now, after the breakup she's a wildcard. lol love how you are getting down voted for common sense.

I revived you back to zero. lol. I have a guy on Snapchat who always sends really cool things he bakes, he's a baker. It's really awesome stuff and just really fun to see.

And then I got a dick pic. Went from '30 cupcakes down, 70 to go' to 'sunset' where he's watching the sun set with his feet up and his penis clearly visible.

I asked if he meant to send that to me and he said yes. So I guess I saw the bakers dozen. never unless asked and you know the person would be a better way of putting it  Hint: Always ( o  o)	 I use to get dick pics every day. And vag pics from girls. Every single day I'd wake up, check my phone, and see at least 2 pics. It was pretty cool back then and I do kinda miss it but I'd rather see a text telling me about their lives.

Tl:dr I don't mind An unsolicited dick pic is sexual harassment IMO.  People get in trouble for flashing, why do guys think sending their gross schlong is something that anyone  wants to see? Unless we specifically ask for it, we don't want to see it.  
 But what if it's the most beautiful dong in existance? People deserve to see that Buy a billboard ad. Also don't underestimate how much women who request dick pics would like to see the *rest* of your body too.  It's not always just about the wang.  Is that ever ok? If someone says "send me a picture of your dick" then it's probably ok.  Probably. Unless it's your sister. Then don't do it. Oh, oops I dunno, she seemed to like it. Maybe because she was raised in Kentucky? Or Alderaan. It was an oops... Or your teacher.

 Well exceptions can be made. pm Well, a friend of mine sent one to another friend's mother. She's a nurse, and he wanted to know I he should go to the hospital. Barring exceptional circumstances (explicitly designated as such by the receiver), dick pics should be a reminder, not an introduction. Even then, probably not. NEVER send a dickpic unless the other person has explicitly agreed to accept it. Or you know that person to an extreme level, and know they'd enjoy it. The correct answer is only when requested.

And even then.. never. If you take a photo if your Dick you already messed up Is it ever really wanted though? I know there has to be two sides to everything but I've never felt that anyone would ever really want to be sent a picture of someone's dick. Especially unsolicited. http://www.collegehumor.com/post/6910070/should-you-send-that-dick-pic Dick pic rule: do not send dick pics. Full stop.  "Alright Kevin, since you're 6 now I'm gonna teach you proper dick pic etiquette." 

"But I wanna play with my toys" 

"GODDAMNIT KEVIN YOU NEED TO LEARN THIS." Only send them on days that end with "y". If you have a dick, then it's time. No unsolicited dick pics! Fack.

And don't be the asshole asking someone in every form of chat if they want pictures of your dick. It doesn't count as being courteous just because you didn't send one outright, it's still fucking weird.  you can always tell when it will be ok Don't talk on the phone while checking out/ordering at registers/banks/restaurants etc. It's extremely rude not to give someone your full attention if they give you theirs.  Replying "k" to a text message is a dick move. Not as bad as "k."

 Or KKK.

On top of being passive aggressive to me, I now have the ever present fear of being lynched by a white supramcist group?  KKK is funny on accident, once. After that, you need to stop texting them, or at least consider it. It goes "k" then the person responds "kk" and you have the choice whether or not to push it to that limit. i type kkk when I mean ok cause if I type ok then that's too basic but when i type kk it autocorrects to ok so I just type kkk to avoid the hassle That's what me and my friends always use as a replacement for "k". I don't know what that says about us.  It doesn't say anything Haha omg no I do this all the time on purpose. But to only my good friends who know how I am. 

I also then follow it up with a actual text. I'm not a heathen.   On accident? I think you meant: 'by accident.' Fuck me you're right Nice try yeah... I mean it's just sort of funny to people who aren't fixated on racism and racial issues.  I feel comfortable with me or my friends making jokes like that because I'm not on a witch hunt looking for someone who is prejudiced.  It's just part of my philosophy of not taking life so seriously, issues like the KKK are hardly relevant (to me) today. That's how Portuguese speakers write "Hahaha" through SMS kkk is how most Brazilians express laughter when writing a text message. What's wrong with the Kinky Korean Kids?  When someone types like that (Hiiiiii how r uuuuu) I always hear them stretching it out and it inevitably sounds weird. Unless you sound like that, don't type like that. KKK? My friends and I respond to each other with this. Usually only when they respond with k though. White hood white hood I just use kk when confirming something, since I know 'k' can come off as meaning something more. I had a friend who would KKK me (blickety-black here y'all). She was a turd, but I loved her for it. People in my circle use "kk" as a semi-enthusiastic was of acknowledging something. 

"On my way over cutie"
"Kk :)"  k PERIOD DOT COM I always respond with "L." Most people don't get it /: Shit. I do this all the time. It is what I would say IRL though. I hate small talk and chatter. I do add a 'Thanks.' or a 'Please.' though, if it's necessary. If there's a period, they're making a point. The point being that the minimal effort they spent responding to your text is non-negotiable. 

K. Period. End of discussion.  Oh I know, I wasn't arguing.   Neither was I, I have a healthy respect for Tonka toughness. 

Just building bro.  k.
 I do this, but only as an indication that I'm pissed off. It's easier than saying 'I'm not going to argue over text but we will discuss this later'. My dad says 'K' and it's not really rude at all, he's just saying OK. I've had people talk shit because I do it too. I mean, if you text me to meet you somewhere in a half hour, you don't need any more than 'OK'. Yup! An "OK" is basically short for "i saw this message and making sure you know that." 

Why say more than that when it's not necessary? 
 Whatevs. "Sounds good" or "Alright" take about 1 to 2 seconds more to type, and they sound like you actually care, whereas "k" just sounds dismissive. It's more of a cultural thing than a real issue, but as it stands people view "k" as not really caring. He has a flip phone, and I used to for a long time. I'm not saying he shouldn't type "k" since I don't really expect older people to type out fully. Anyone who has a normal keyboard though should type more than just "k." K. Too lazy to press the letter O? He has a flip phone. Yes, I do! :(  I think /u/balleriffic meant using the acknowledgement as a way to be short with someone. 

If I send someone a simple statement and all I get is "k", fine. 

If I send someone a post modern impression of the Magna Carta as it relates to gerrymandering in Georgia circa 1925 through today, then I better get at least a "wtf r u talkin boot?" Ok is fine. Typing 'k' just comes off as uninterested or upset. I think most people think like I do and hear, "*sigh* whatever," in their head when they read 'k'. I think it depends a lot on the context.  If I was telling my brother he needed to come get his shoes out of my car 'k' would be an acceptable response. 

Edit: I hang up on my brother after we're done talking on the phone without bothering to go through all the formalities of ending a conversation like saying "goodbye".  After you've spent countless hours with somebody you can take a lot of social shortcuts. I am currently teaching my 14 yr old to acknowledge my texts. I'd be satisfied with "k", if all I needed was acknowledgement.  That same kid texts me
Mom
Mom
Mom x1000 whenever she wants something.  My mom says "k" to my texts all the time. I don't understand what's the problem, if I text her to pick me up at 223 apple Street at 3 PM, why can't she reply with "k"? my worst day was when my mum started using texts, now she forever texts me inane stuff, and then complains later I don't reply For every unanswered text, your kid spends one hour without a phone.

You're the fucking parent and you gave them a toy. Take. It. The. Fuck. Away. But the point of having a phone when they're out is so they can contact the parent/the parent can call them in an emergency, and taking it away at home doesn't really matter Simple solution to that is get them some old phone that is boring and lame. You mean... [the Jitterbug?](http://mindprod.com/image/electronic/jitterbug.jpg) Boring?! That's genius! Is this a new phone? It looks revolutionary. They will respond even less because they won't bother to charge it.

Source: Had a tracfone. If it is an old nokia then it won't really matter, charge it for an hour it will last 3 days. This kind of solves both problems at once. Regardless of the circumstances, if my kid doesn't respond to me and or have a reasonable excuse for a delay, he/she will be grounded. Way to be a helicopter parent. I used to leave at lunch and come back around dinnertime, no mobile phone. I was only in trouble if I was late. Well, if cellphones weren't a thing and I had rules like that set up with my kids then I wouldn't have a problem with it. I'm not saying that I would need to know exactly where they are when they get there, but if I need my kid to come for something or I'm trying to set up a time and place to pick him/her up then they need to answer. Ignore the people being mean, it's not helicopter parenting, it's teaching kids to report whereabouts.  Teens don't run on autopilot just because they can now fill time on their own.

Source: Work in a teen home, if parents understood that, I'd probably be out of a job. How much are Windows phones going for nowadays?  Or, and hold on to your hats folks, your kid *isn't*going to be brutally murdered if they spend more than 4 hours out of your sight.

/16 year old me. (but still true nonetheless)  And, just maybe, the convenience aspect is the main reason and safety a fringe benefit... the ability to let each other know where you are, where you're going and not have to plan exactly where and when to meet several hours ahead of time.  Blasphemy! A phone would not help in that situation anyway. 

However, it's useful if your kids can get stranded somewhere. I sure did not enjoy those five hours at the door of my school waiting for my mom to land from her business trip because I had missed the bus (and did not want to walk on the side of a lightless country road for an hour and a half all while dressed in black). 

In many cases, it is reassuring for parents to know their kids can make their life easier by calling them even if it's not the end of the world in many cases. The "get them a shitty phone" option seems like a good compromise. Even if my future kids behave like dicks, I would enjoy them to be able to call for help. If you weren't a goth in school, you would have been just fine.
