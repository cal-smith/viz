Strong force charge is called \"color\". Fundamental units of strong charge are red, green or blue, while their anti-particles are anti-red, anti-green and anti-blue.

Since energy and time are linked in an uncertainty relation, energy conservation can be \"violated\" for very short periods of time, provided that the product of the lifetime and the energy discrepancy is below hbar/2. Therefore, if gravitation has \"seemingly\" infinite extent, it must follow that the mediating particles are capable of reaching arbitrary distances from the source. Such would require arbitrarily large amounts of time if the particle were massive, and thus the uncertainty would force the energy of the mediator to zero. Conversely, however, if the mediator were to be massless, the particle moves with speed c and experiences purely space-like space-time motion, i.e., doesn't \"experience\" any time at all. Thus, the energy-time uncertainty relation allows for the violation of energy conservation.   \n  \nThis explains why both electromagnetic and gravitation forces have infinite extent (massless mediators can travel for boundless distances since they experience no time). It also explains the 1/r^2 dependence, since a homogenous radiation of particles from a point source into 3-D space results in decreasing intensity like 1/r^2 as you move from the source.  \n  \nConversely, since the strong force mediators have mass, they experience time and the uncertainty relation only allows them to exist in violation of energy conservation for a brief period, thereby allowing them only to travel a set finite distance from the source before vanishing. This might explain the sharp finite cutoff in the effect of the strong force (but not the r^(positive) dependence up to that point).   \n  \nTake all of this with a grain of salt.

Van Der Waals interactions occur whenever you have two overall neutral atoms/molecules (hereafter called \"things\")  attracted to each other via electrostatic force. There are three cases in which this can happen. First, two things which have an electrostatic dipole, that is they have one end that is \"more positive\" or \"more negative\" than the other, but overall the thing is neutral. The \"more positive\" end of one thing is attracted to the \"more negative\" end of another thing. The second case is where a thing with an electrostatic dipole *induces* a temporary dipole in a second thing. Imagine a bag of magnets (which don't interact with each other for simplicity's sake and because magnets can't be monopoles), if you hold another magnet up to this bag of magnets, all of the magnets inside the bag are going to flip themselves so that the side closest to the external magnet is attracted to the \"exposed\" side of the external magnet. The same things happens in \"things\". Imagine if you have an atom, if you bring a positive thing next to an atom, the electrons in the atom, which all move about individually will now be more likely to be found on the side closer to the positive thing, resulting in a temporary dipole in the thing that doesn't normally have one. The final case in which the Van Der Waals force applies is when you have two things which don't normally have a dipole, bring them close together, and induce dipoles in each of the things. This is like taking *two* bags of magnets, holding them near each other, and shaking. The magnets within each bag would arrange themselves such that all of the magnets, in both bags, would face the same direction. This happens on an atomic scale as well. If you bring two atoms close together, because the electrons are moving around, there will be areas of high electron density and low electron density at any specific time. If an are of low electron density faces a second atom, the other atom's electrons would be attracted to the low electron density and then would be more likely to be found on the side closer to the first atom. This results in two temporary dipoles. \n\nTo extrapolate: even though neutrons and protons are overall color-charge-neutral, the individual \"sub-color-charges\" may (could/possibly/tell me if I'm wrong) arrange themselves such that there are fractional charge dipoles within each of the neutral bodies which attract themselves to the other \"neutral\" bodies.

We understand the fundamental forces perfectly well (err, except gravity..  We're working on that one).  At the classical (i.e. non-quantum / first-year-physics) level, we're taught to think about forces F = {some function of position and time}, and we're taught that forces act on particles causing them to accelerate.  More often, we talk about the potential of a force, which is just it's integral.  So for newtonian gravity and coulomb interaction we talk about a 1/r potential (which leads to a 1/r^2 force when you differentiate).\n\nFirst, let me try to describe how a force is different from matter from the POV of modern theoretical physics, then I'll get to specific examples.  In the language of quantum field theory, which is how we currently talk about fundamental forces, a \"force field\" is a field which is introduced into your equations in order to impose that some symmetry of the matter fields holds true.  The procedure of introducing forces into your matter equations is known as \"gauging\" the matter.  The whole procedure is called \"gauge theory.\"  All of the forces that we understand well (i.e. everything but gravity) are described using gauge theory, and we don't know why it works so well.  But it does and we're big fans of that so we do it a lot.\nOnce you have a theory with \"matter fields\" and \"force fields,\" you can extract classical potentials (like 1/r potentials) from the quantum field theory.  But the full quantum field theory is capable of much crazier behavior which is all insignificant at the classical level but is very significant at the quantum level (things like vacuum polarization). \n\nSpecific example time.  The first force that we really understood properly was E&amp;M, so lets talk about that.  For brevity, I'm going to gloss over some details about the fact that electrons have spin.  If you write down the equation for electrons by themselves (with no forces), your electron field is a complex valued function of space and time.  I.e. your electrons are described by, \n\nphi(x,y,z,t) = some complex number\n\nYour equation for the electron field is something involving phi and derivatives of phi.   Something like\n\nyour equation = |phi|^2 + |grad phi|^2\n\n(if this equation is confusing, don't worry about it.  I just wanted to throw it out there).  Now you notice that if you multiply phi(x,y,z,t) by a constant phase everywhere in space and time\n\nphi(x,y,z,t) --&gt; phi(x,y,z,t)*exp(i*C)\n\nyour equations stay the same.  This is known as a global symmetry.  However, if you let that phase vary with position and time,\n\nphi(x,y,z,t) --&gt; phi(x,y,z,t)*exp(i*C(x,y,z,t))\n\nyour equations won't look the same anymore because you'll have extra terms from taking derivatives of C.  If the equations looked the same for C(x,y,z,t), it would be called a \"local symmetry.\"\nHere's the key point: in gauge theory, we INSIST (for no good reason!) that the local symmetry MUST hold.  In order to MAKE it hold, we introduce a new field which sucks up all the extra terms and makes our equations look the same as they did before the phase factor was introduced.  This extra field is a force field, by definition.  So a cute and kind of grandiose way to say it is \"the symmetry of the electron field necessitates the existence of the electromagnetic force (light).\"  The form of the electron equations and the symmetries therein determine everything about the electromagnetic force equations.\n\nIn a more complicated theory like the strong nuclear force, you start with a matter field, the \"quark field,\" which has a much more complicated global symmetry built into the equations.  Then, when you insist that the symmetry hold locally, you get a force field with a much different character from the E&amp;M field -- in this case, you get the gluon field of the strong nuclear force.  The different character of the force arises from the different character of the symmetry of the matter.  (Aside: The reason quarks of three colors is related to the global symmetry of the quark field.)\n\nSo that's what force fields are and where they come from, but now what about all that 1/r potential stuff from classical physics that we're familiar with.  As I said, once you have the quantum field theory for a force, you can extract the classical potential.  It turns out that the form of the classical potential has a lot to do with whether the force field has a mass.  It turns out that one can show that any force field which is massless will lead to a 1/r potential.  Photons (electromagnetic force), gravitons (gravity), and gluons (strong nuclear force) are all massless and so all lead to 1/r potentials.  The strong nuclear force has a peculiar feature that the next correction to the classical potential is linear, i.e.\n\nV_strongnuclear = a/r + br + ...\n\nSo if you try to pull two quarks far apart, the 2nd term eventually kicks in and the force starts to get STRONGER rather than weaker (1/r falloff).  This leads to quark confinement (trapping quarks inside of protons/neutrons/etc) as mentioned below.  Caveat: unlike the e&amp;m and gravitational potentials, which work well at long distance, the strong nuclear potential above works well only at short distance (~radius of proton).\n\nThe weak nuclear force field has a rather large mass, and this leads to a different classical potential known as the Yukawa potential\n\nV_weaknuclear = a*exp(-m*r)/r\n\nThis type of classical force has a much SHORTER range than 1/r potentials because of the exponential fall off due to the nonzero mass.  Here's a sort of ELI5 explanation of how the weak force / yukawa potential different from E&amp;M.  Particle A wants to communicate with particle B via some force.  He happens to have a friend, E&amp;M, who is an Olympic runner.  Because he's so \"light\" on his feet (get it?) he can deliver the message very far.  The force has a long range because the force carrier has a small mass (zero mass, really, for light).  In a different scenario, particle C wants to send a message to particle D, but particle C hasn't chosen his friends carefully in life and can only get his friend the weak force to deliver the message.  The weak force is a heavy guy who doesn't work out much, so he's not willing to carry the message more than a few blocks.  The force has a short range because the force carrier has a large mass.  \n\nSome fun caveats about the weak force.  Matter particles actually have two \"pieces\" -- a left handed and a right handed piece (not the same as antiparticles).  The weak force actually only talks to the left handed part of the particle, but the right handed part doesn't know anything about the weak force.  This is a big part of the reason why it is interesting that neutrinos have mass.  Massless matter particles only have a left handed piece and no right handed piece, so -- since neutrino's only interact via the weak force (and gravity) it's impossible to learn anything about the right handed piece directly.  So originally we assumed they were massless and that the right handed piece didn't exist at all.  But now we know it's there, and it's a big mystery. We can't probe it directly because the weak force doesn't talk to that part of the particle.  We can only learn about it indirectly.\nAnother interesting caveat is that the weak force actually has three different aspects to it.  If you want to think about it in terms of particles, there is not one particle that mediates the weak force, but three.  The neat thing is that two of them have an electric charge (one is postive and one is negative, the W+ and W- bosons respectively).  Its interesting because a particle, through interacting with the weak force, can change into a different type of particle with different charge.  This is how beta decay works: roughtly speaking, a neutron interacts with the W field and is able to change charge from neutral to positive and become a proton!\n\nAn interesting note: even though it is not a \"fundamental\" theory, the interaction of neutrons and protons via the strong nuclear force can be modeled by an approximate force field called the pi-meson field (this is called Yukawa theory).  The pi-field has a mass and so the classical potential looks just like the weak nuclear force potential above.  This was one of the early models for the strong nuclear force before quarks were discovered.\n\n\nEdit: added more ramblings about the weak force by request and as a way of saying thanks for the gold!", "gilded": 1, "score": 224, "created": 1424461981.0},{"body": "Hey, you are really GOOD at this (explaining things clearly).\n\nI have completed a graduate level course on electromagnetics, but have never studied gauge theory, and your use of em to illustrate gauge theory was useful.

Nothing interacts with it, nothing changes.\n\nThen **gravity** comes in. A particle which comes near anything with mass will have its momentum changed. The heavier the mass or the closer the object, the faster the momentum will change. The particle will speed up, slow down, change direction, or some combination of those.\n\nHow? Every object that has mass/energy effects space and time. The details don't matter, but what is important is that heavy objects tend to \"pull\" on space. Which makes space and time bend in weird ways. When sometimes encounters this bent spacetime, it will still follow a straight path through that bent spacetime, but its actual trajectory will seem curved, sped up or slowed down.\n\nSo far so good for objects with no charge. But sometimes particles have an **electric** charge through which they can affect each other's momentum. They don't simply attract, but can also repel. The two types of electric charge are labeled (+) and (-), opposites attract and likes repel. How strongly? Well, the stronger the charge the stronger the force, and the closer together they are, the stronger the force.\n\nBut that's not everything. If you carefully measure the forces from these electrically charged particles, you would see that something is \"off\" when they're moving. The forces are not *quite* what you'd expect. It turns out there is another effect in play, that of **relativity**. When objects move fast, weird things start happening like lengths that become shorter or timescales that become longer. Again, the details don't matter, but they have a measurable effect on the kind of forces that these electric charges exert on each other. We call the difference between the force we'd expect from a static picture, and the actually measured force **magnetism**.\n\nBut how does this work exactly? This is the point where we start looking at microscopic stuff and things get **weird**. Lets forget everything we know about particles and forces and start from scratch. A particle can be considered as a very small chunk of highly condensed energy. As we all know, energy is conserved, but can be changed from one form to another. A particle like an electron, which is a small chunk of condensed energy, can be split into two different chunks of energy: a new^1 electron with different kinetic energy and a photon.\n\ne^- \u2192 e^- + \u03b3\n\nHow often does this happen? All the time. Randomly^2. It just does, in every direction. But it averages out to zero, so we won't notice anything in a single particle. But this photon can be absorbed by another electron.\n\ne^- + \u03b3 \u2192 e^-\n\nNow the second electron has absorbed the momentum the photon was carrying, and the result is a force between the two electrons. Photons are massless and do not decay, so this charge can reach infinitely far. A bajigazillion (technical term) exchanges of photons produce a huge change in momentum, which we can easily see as a classical force. Furthermore, the photon has no electric charge, so doesn't interact with itself.\n\nSo much for the classical forces. But what about the others? We're getting into slightly unfamiliar territory, but the same principles still apply. Beyond electric charge, certain particles, called **quarks**, also have **color charge**. Instead of two, there are three types of color charge, labeled red, green and blue. These are the charges of the **strong force**. Obviously, these charges have nothing to do with actual colors, but they are named so because three of those charges are required to neutralize each other.\n\nIf you have a positive and negative electric charge and bring them close together, the effects you feel at long distance will be almost zero, because the effect of the two charges neutralize. The same happens with color charges, though you need three quarks of different color together to get **neutral**. Another option is having a quark/anti-quark pair with corresponding color/anti-color^3. You're probably wondering if this also works in terms of \"likes repel and opposites attract\", but the situation is slightly more complex.\n\nJust as the electromagnetic force is carried by photons, the strong force is carried by **gluons**. What does this interaction look like? Does it change the momentum of the particles like the photon does? Yes, but that's not the only thing. Gluons are not color neutral. They carry a color and an anti-color charge. Tt effectively allows them to change another particles color charge. So for example:\n\nblue quark \u2192 red quark + blue/anti-red gluon\n\nAnd if a red quark happens to be nearby, it can absorb the gluon:\n\nred quark + blue/anti-red gluon \u2192 blue quark\n\nBut that's not all! The gluons can also couple to *each other*:\n\ngreen/anti-blue gluon + red/anti-green gluon \u2192 red/anti-blue gluon\n\nGluons are massless, like photons, meaning they can reach infinitely far. But because they can interact with themselves, that also allows them to multiply as they travel (just reverse the interaction above). So that means that the further two quarks are apart, the more gluons they will be sending to each other. This results in the force getting **stronger with distance**. Luckily this doesn't spiral out of control, eventually the energy in the intermediate space will become so large, it will condense into a quark/anti-quark pair, forming new neutral particles with the ones that were interacting previously.\n\nThree quarks can form a **proton** or a **neutron**, each having a neutral color charge. But sometimes gluons escape, allowing them to interact with each other. These \"leakages\" are what holds atomic nuclei together, but the specific interactions are fiendishly hard to calculate.\n\nNow what determines whether three quarks will form a proton or a neutron? The answer is quark **flavor**. The only two relevant flavors^4 for us at this point are called up and down. The up quark has an electric charge^5 of +2/3, while the down quark has an electric charge of -1/3. A proton consists of *uud*; two ups and one down. This gives it a total charge of +1. The neutron is *udd*, with zero electric charge^6.\n\nWhy is this relevant, you ask? Because of the **weak force**. It is the third^7 interaction that governs the quarks in the protons/neutrons in the nuclei, alongside the electromagnetic and strong force. And the question is of course what it does. It affects momentum, just like the electromagnetic and strong force, but that is the least important of its effects.\n\nBecause the weak force is the only interaction that can **change flavor**. Now this works the same as the other two. The weak interaction has three force carriers. The W^+, the Z^0 and the W^-. Their electric charges are +1, 0 and -1 respectively, and the two W particles are each other's anti-particle. I won't go into detail about the Z, so lets consider the W's.\n\nA quark will spontaneously emit W particles, just as it emits photons and gluons. This works in the following way:\n\n*u* \u2192 *d* + W^+\n\nAn up quark can emit a W^+ and change flavor to a down quark. If another down is nearby, it can absorb this W^+ and change itself into an up. This will have its usual contribution to change in momentum, but overall we will still have an up and a down.\n\nBut what if an up quark in a proton emits a W^+ and the W^+ escapes? Well, it will turn the proton into a neutron, because the total quark flavor will have changed from *uud* to *udd*.\n\np^+ \u2192 n^0 + W^+\n\nLikewise, a neutron can change into a proton by emitting a W^- or absorbing a W^+.\n\nYou might ask what happens to the W now. These W particles are quite heavy, so they will quickly decay (break into smaller chunks of energy). Which ones, well...\n\nW^+ \u2192 e^+ + \u03bd_e\n\nOkay, what happened here? The W broke up into an anti-electron and an electron **neutrino**. Neutrinos are nearly massless, neutral particles which only interact through the weak force. Although there are many interesting things about them, there isn't much to say about them in this context. They hardly interact at all with anything. They just kind of pass through everything.\n\nThis is the mechanism with which (beta) **nuclear decay** occurs. If an atomic nucleus would be more stable with a different proton/neutron ratio, a proton will change into a neutron or vice versa. Why specific ratios are more stable is then again determined by the electromagnetic and strong force.\n\nI hope you at least understood some of that :)\n\n^(1 How can we distinguish between a new electron and the same electron which simply bounced off a photon? It depends on your interpretation of \"same electron\". In essence, all electrons are identical and indistinguishable. But every time an electron's state is changed, such as its momentum or any other feature, it could be considered a completely newly created particle while the old one is destroyed.)\n\n^(2 The probability of this happening is actually tied to the amount of momentum and energy the photon is carrying but the details of this are very technical.)\n\n^(3 Anti-quarks do not carry color, but anti-color.

Gravity curves space-time. An object orbiting the Earth is going in a dead-straight line in a space-time that's been curved by the Earth's mass, so it looks like it's going in circles. What feels to you like weight is the force of the floor pushing you up, causing you to accelerate. It's the exact same principle as, say, sitting in a car that's accelerating. The feeling of being pushed into your seat is because the car is accelerating you, pushing you off the constant velocity path you would otherwise take.\n\nThe main problem with gravity is that general relativity isn't a quantum theory, so it can't be the final description of gravity.\n\nAs to why particles with colour exert force on each other, that's a bit of a tricky question. Why does something called \"colour\" exist? For that matter, why does electric charge exist, and why do some particles have it, and some not?\n\nThe answer is, weirdly, often to do with symmetry. There's a theorem (Noether's theorem) which states that there is a conserved quantity associated with symmetries of physical laws. Electric charge is associated with a global phase symmetry of the wavefunction, for example (you can add a phase shift to every wavefunction in the universe, and physics would all work the same way).\n\nThe strong force is associated with a symmetry which is called in the wonderful notation of group theory SU(3), and the properties of that group give rise to colour, and the way that they interact. It's a similar principle for electromagnetism and the weak force, they have symmetries, and their symmetries determine their properties.\n\nSo the current best idea for why certain types of particle exist, and why they have certain properties (such as the ways they interact with each other) are all to do with these abstract mathematical symmetry properties. Why these exact mathematical entities are the ones which make up our universe is still an open question, but they're always looking for more symmetries, and ways in which the ones we know of could just be parts of a greater whole.

When nuclei have larger atomic numbers/masses w.r.t iron, then can be put into precarious configurations where it is advantageous for them to disintegrate into smaller fragments, each with a lower atomic number of larger E_b.

You get 1 chromosome from each parent, so you have 12 different alleles (genes).  When they test for compatability they only test 10 of these alleles (not HLA-DP) to see if you are a match, and siblings have a 1:4 chance of being matches for the 10 loci (assuming no recombination).  The current number of known alleles is always increasing as we find more, but for the HLA-B there are around 600 different alleles, which is the most studies allele.  Others like HLA-C only have around 150 known and the class II MHC only have from 6- 45.

These HLA proteins act like identification and inspection sites for the human body: Cells which lack them are targeted by natural killer cells (a type of white blood cell). HLA also function as a snapshot of what is inside the cell. You can imagine HLA like a hotdog bun, and inside the hotdog bun, the HLA presents a random protein segment from inside the cell. If that protein segment is something the immune system sees regularly, it will ignore it. If it is something odd or foreign, the immune system will attack it through a  T-cell response. And if the HLA itself is a different setup, this will result in an attack as well. So in the example of non-identical humans, the T-cells of one human will attack the other.\n\nIn rats and mice, however, scientists use historically inbred mouse lines that are nearly (if not completely) genetically identical, like the [C57/Black-6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C57BL/6) mouse.

In an intriguing experiment, scientists took two types of genetically altered mice with similar phenotype, and parabiosed them to see what happened. The Ob- mouse lacked ability to make Leptin, while the Db- mouse made leptin but lacked receptor for it. Both mice overate and became really, really fat. But when parabiosed, the Ob mouse lost weight, and the Db mouse remained fat. Interestingly, a wildtype mouse parabiosed to an Ob- mouse made the Ob-mouse lose weight, and a Db-mouse parabiosed to WT caused the WT mouse to lose weight and die.

The assumption that modern society or civilization is better than previous hunting and gathering societies is fundamentally flawed. That's way outdated anthropological/archaeological thought from the 19th century. The idea of cultural evolution is an outdated concept that was based on a miss understanding of how biological evolution actually operates. \n\nThat would be natural selection. Which operates on 4 basic principals. Inheritance of acquired traits, reproduction, Variation of genetic material and competition. Throw in evolutionary forces such as mutations, gene flow and genetic drift. \n\nCulture is not a biological organism and does not \"evolve\". \n\nLouis Henry Morgan propagated that nonsense.  But for some reason it's still floating around in even the scientific community. \n\n2.  Since around the 10k mark population has grown, knowledge accumulates and so on  but looking at human Osteological material from most agriculturally based cultures ( including and especially our western past) we are mostly unhealthy and disease ridded. More people died of the Spanish flu than there were people alive in 200,000 bc.  Also, I guarantee most of you fellow reditors never farmed and if you have I could bet you didn't use digging sticks and rocks to sew your crops. It's obscenely hard work. This also results in shortages and mass starvation. As where a hunter and gatherer might have seasonal hunger. They herds will reliably return, unlike a failed crop.  That's  right before Walmart if your crops failed you died. Most archaeologist do wonder why we didn't discover agriculture sooner but they also wonder why we stuck with it. There were no dictators or kings before the accumulation of resources (Neolithic revolution) as far as we know. \n\n3. On that note. People. CLIMATE CHANGE. Climate is not static it's been quite tumultuous for all of earth's history. It's no mystery that during the last ice age ( which had 15 cooling and warming cycles) people dispersed throughout the world.  Land bridges  were everywhere. The UK was not an island chain it was straight up attached to the rest of Europe. Most of Europe stretching from England to Russia was a great plain kept cold and dry by the Scandinavian ice sheet. This grassy plain is referred to as a steppe tundra and below it was a park tundra with stubby bushes and in the Mediterranean there were boreal then deciduous forests. \n\nThis plain was filled with an astounding number of plants and animals because of the daylight hours which contrasts current day tundras. Paris is in line with New York ( kinda) most Americans don't realize that Europe is actually a much \"higher\" relative to them. But as where current Alaskan or Siberian tundras count their winter daylight  in minutes the ice age tundras would count them in many hours. This means that the land could support more species. \n\nThe ice age hunter would have access to not only mammoths but a variety of deer, rhinos, hippos, lions, bears, hyenas, small game. They likely exploited marine resources too but those site are all deep under water so we'll never know for sure. And they didn't frequent the large game until other Han groups entered europe and increased population pressure.  It was us crazy anatomically modern humans that likely started regularly hunting the large and dangerous animals. The Neanderthals didn't need to risk they're lives with all the safe game around. Though they too hunted big game on the occasion. \n\nThe short answer to why they didn't become sedentary and start growing stuff is because why would they need too?! \n\nThe answer? \n \nThe climate changed. What was 3,000 feet of ice in Central Park, New York would have melted in as little as 11 years. Imagine that all over the northern hemisphere.  \n\nAs the forests from the Middle East moved north ( in the course of only a couple hundred years) the large game were choked out. By the way out ancestors were not idiots. As they noticed what was happening they \"encouraged\" certain biotic communities to grow per region. Grains like wheat were encouraged to grow and later domesticated in the Middle East as where oats were in the north. Wheat requires a wet winter and a dry summer to germinate. Traditionally it could only be grown under specific climactic conditions. Goats and sheep were also domesticated in the Mediterranean and cattle in the north. Also, don't forget about the funguses and bacteria we domesticated to preserve all this food. \n\nPeople didn't just say. Ok let's do this. It was a long process that involved humans manicuring the land. The idea of wilderness is fundamentally flawed too. Most of the earth, including the the amazon rainforest ( huge pre Colombian sites are being uncovered that reveal controlled burning and maintenance of rainforest land) , has been a manicured \"garden\" since the end of the Pleistocene. Nobody domesticated anything sooner( aside from dogs) because we \"created\" the species through careful observation and selection of plants and animals we liked until our modern species exited. We're still genetically selecting and modifying our domesticates today. GMO's are NOT a new thing. Everything you eat is a GMO.

But this breaks down at very low and very high temperatures. And certainly wouldn't make sense with negative temperatures, which I've seen mentioned a few times. \n\nTemperature is thermodynamically define as the inverse of how much the order (entropy) of a system increased with energy, proportional to the energy you put it (T=-dE/dS). Usually, when you add energy to a system, disorder increases. And this makes sense, because things have more energy, and bounce around and make things all disorganized.\n\n At small temperatures, it doesn't take much energy to make things get a lot more disordered. So, the rate of change of disorder relative to the energy is really high, and the inverse of that (the temperature) is really low. \n\nAs things get really really hot, adding some energy won't really change much, since it's already really disordered. So this is the opposite of the above example, and temperature is high. \n\nIn negative temperature systems, like a laser gain medium, you end up creating systems where things get MORE ordered with the more energy you put in. So with more energy, disorder decreases. However, to get to this point, you first have to cross over the boundary from getting more disorder with more energy to getting less disorder with more energy. Somewhere in between, there is a point where if you add a tiny bit of energy, the disorder doesn't change. Making the ratio of the change in energy to change in disorder (aka the temperature) approach infinity, before becoming negative. \n\nSo that means that all the talk of a maximum temperature being about energy density or short wavelengths or Planck is based on speculative misunderstanding of the science.

Making this process even more complicated is the issue of spelling: in order for the symbols to be comprehensible, they need to conform to a standard order. When reading, this process runs in reverse. Your brain needs to \"decode\" the symbols to get the information they contain.\n\nMost people use specific sections of their brains to read, write and process language. Dyslexic people use a different part of their brains to try to accomplish these same tasks. This has been demonstrated using studies where brain scans are taken while a dyslexic person reads and writes. \n\nProfessionals in the field describe this as having problems with symbol decoding. When a person mixes up b and d, it actually isn't because they are mentally reversing the letter in some way. Rather their brain has difficulty assigning the phonologic meaning /b/ to the symbol b. \n\nThese language difficulties frequently are accompanied by difficulty breaking words into their component syllables and are characterized in many children by a lack of interest in language games and nursery rhymes. To put it more bluntly, the reason many dyslexic kids don't like Dr. Suess is because the fact that cat and hat rhyme isn't something that they notice instinctively.\n\nSo, how does this affect blind students or could a person with dyslexia read Braille?\n\nNo, the dyslexic person would not find Braille any different than reading letters they could see because they still need to associate a symbol (though in this case, one they can feel) with a sound (decoding) and then piece together a word and meaning from the sound. This is also why fonts which claim to \"make the letters stop moving\" are a load of hogwash. They don't address the underlying issue of decoding problems.\n\nDyslexia is found in all groups of people, including those who speak languages such as Chinese which are largely pictographic. While it doesn't have an alphabet, reading and writing these languages still necessitates going from symbol to sound and meaning and that's where the problem is.\n\nSources: http://www.interdys.org/ewebeditpro5/upload/Definition.pdf\n\nhttp://www.interdys.org/ewebeditpro5/upload/DyslexiaBasicsREVMay2012.pdf\n\nTL;DR: Yes.

That is, the only difference is that the non-sighted reader is using tactile sense to relay that information to the same area the eye would for a sighted reader.\n\nThe difference is that when you see a picture of a fish, this is a representation of the idea of the fish.  It is a straight association.  However, in English, the word \"fish\" is composed of letters.  Each letter carries a sound.  These letters must be interpreted in the brain as separate sounds (especially when learning to read for the first time, sounding it out), identified as the correct sound (as English has many arbitrary rules for how a letter sounds in the context of the word), and then assemble all of these sounds to give meaning to the word, and then converted to speech.  \n\nDyslexia is a small part visual decoding dysfunction and a large part language processing dysfunction.   People with Dyslexia first have trouble processing the shape of the letter, which is manifest in that d is confused with b, and p with q.  There is an inability to see this difference clearly.  Normally, this would not be such an issue if it were the only problem, because this information passed on to the part of the brain responsible for decoding the information into sounds and meaning could correct this mismatch through context clues, etc.  It would be obvious that the word \"blood\" could not be \"dlood\" in a sentence, since I would know that sound has no meaning, and blood makes much more sense in the context of the sentence.  \n\nWell this does not happen either.  The area of the brain responsible for decoding those shapes into meaning and sound is also impaired.  Wernicke's area receives this already garbled visual representation, and further fails to decode it into meaningful sounds.  Then this mess is passed onto Broca's area, where the brain then tries to sound out all this information, and it can't since it makes no sense.  \n\nIt turns out sighted people that can read Braille treat it almost like a pictographic language, similar to Chinese, where the symbols are associations with whole meanings, rather than a composite of sounds.

Most of the windows (except the windshield) are made from tempered glass. Tempered glass is known for being quite strong, but also fails quite spectacularly, instantaneously shattering into an enormous amount of little pieces. Why does it do this? Well let's understand the processing. This glass is cooled rapidly from liquid to solid. Glass that cools more quickly ultimately ends up at a lower density, hence a higher volume compared to glass that cools slowly. [graph](http://www.benbest.com/cryonics/tg.jpg) Well guess what, there is a thermal gradient in a pane of glass as it cools. Meaning the outside rapidly cools and the inside does not. This puts the outside of the glass in compression and in the inside in tension. This acts as a crack inhibition method, meaning that the stress necessary to propagate the crack must first overcome the compressive stress on the outside (since glass will fail in tension well before compression). So what do we get? A glass that is ultimately very strong, but has a massive amount of stored internal energy through the tempering process. \n\n[Stress Profile in Tempered Glass](http://failures.wikispaces.com/file/view/wiki_nickel_sulfide_fig01.jpg/177204681/292x132/wiki_nickel_sulfide_fig01.jpg)\n\nLet's say we want to break this glass though. How do we go about it? Well if we can force a crack to propagate through this thin compressive stress layer on the outside and into the stored tensile stress region, then this crack will immediately cause catastrophic failure. The easiest way to do it? Use something small and hard to act as a stress concentrator. This can amplify the force applied and help penetrate this region. So in the case of the spark plug shard, which is made from a hard ceramic (likely an alumina based material) the impact from the ceramic is enough to form a crack and cause it to penetrate the glass deep enough. That is also why you can buy punches (firefighters and other emergency responders also carry these) that are essentially hardened steel or diamond tipped and do the same thing.\n\nHardness of the glass compared to to impact material is definitely relevant since this interaction is very similar to a hardness test (Rockwell, Vickers, Knoop, etc. Indent tests). The material needs to be harder, or at least close to the same hardness as the glass. I highly discourage people from using the Mohs scale to get actual numbers. \n\nSources: Shelby, \"Introduction to Glass Science and Techonology\"\n\nVarshneya, \"Fundamentals of Inorganic Glasses\"\n\nFun fact: your windshield is engineered to break before a human skull will.

Steel is an alloy, a combination of different metals (iron and carbon, in particular), and steel made according to the same \"recipe\" of ingredients and process will be the same, wherever it is made. \n\nThat said, various shorthands have emerged, maybe similar to the way that people might refer to \"Hollywood movies\", even for something filmed in New Zealand or Toronto. There are only so many companies in the world that make raw steel, and language and geography mean that you tend to get certain localized cultural norms.\n\nTraditionally, \"Japanese\" steel implies high carbon content, high hardness, but also increased brittleness. There are exceptions to every rule, but the Japanese steelmaking industry is an old and proud one, and in Japan, \"steel\" typically and traditionally refers to a very hard metal, capable of keeping a sharp edge for a long time. \n\n \"German\" steel, OTOH, traditionally means a softer, more pliant and flexible metal. Something resilient, that will bend, not break under stress. A German-steel knife will traditionally require more-frequent sharpening than a Japanese knife, but it will also be much more resistant to cracks, chips, and actual \"damage\". \n\n\"American\" can be either a compliment or an insult to steel, depending on the context, since it tends to imply an alloy that was purpose-made for the thing, rather than made to an ideal. \"Chinese\" is basically never a compliment, when applied to steel.

Test Report.  the test report will show the info of the producing mill, the specifications they claim compliance to, the heat number, and the actual chemical composition and physical properties.\n\nso yeah, while that rambled pretty well off course, let me bring it back home by saying that earlier today, i handled a bunch of 316 a240 plate, some of it produced in Brazil by Aperam, some of it produced in the USA by North American Stainless, some of produced by Outo Kumpu in Sweden.  you could reasonably expect them all to perform very similarly.\n\non a final note, many american companies (especially those that work with the government) will only accept material produced in the USA, or from DFARS (Defense Federal Aquisition Regulation Supplement) approved countries, which ends up being almost anywhere but Asia.  while this is mostly political, there has long been a bit of perceived disdain for asian metals, writing them off as inconsistent, unpredictable, or sometimes just simply inferior.  as someone who simply buys and resells metals, i can't comment on the accuracy of this last bit, but it's definitely a common perception in the current american metals market.", "gilded": 1, "score": 71, "created": 1424240441.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1424244081.0},{"body": "From my prior experience in machining, Chinese steel has a tendency to contain more internal stress, which would seem to implicate the annealing.

It would block parts of the bronchiole tree and not get further.\n\nThere are generally 3 different mechanisms of clearing airways and lungs, and which one is the predominant one depends on the size of the particle in question: coughing, mucociliary clearance and alveolar phagocytosis.\n\nCoughing is probably the most well known one. Larger particles (including what would be understood by as crumbs) touch the surface of the airways and stimulate special neurons inside of the walls of the airways (the neurons are very close under the surface, directly under the so called epithelium). Once stimulated, the signal is sent to the brain where the breathing muscles are ordered to coordinate in such a way that air is very quickly and strongly expelled in short bursts; this causes a high degree of turbulence with which larger particles are sent flying outside.\n\nSecond one is mucociliary clearance. This pertains to particles (and microorganisms) that are typically microscopically small and/or so lightweight that they don't stimulate the \"coughing neurons\", but are large enough to not be eaten by macrophages (although there is quite a bit of crossover). The airways are covered in a thick film of mucus. Underneath the mucus are very very small hairs that rhythmically beat in the 'up' direction (towards the throat), called ~~kino~~cilia. What happens is that most particles attach to the sticky mucus layer and the mucus is transported to the throat where the mucus gets then reflectively swallowed (thus landing in the digestive tract). Another way to picture this is that the airways are covered in a large sticky \"fly trap\" that gets automatically cleaned and cleared via a conveyor belt principle. This is probably the most important mechanism to keep your lungs free of e.g. dust and pathogens. Depending on how exactly small we define our hypothetical crumb, this could be the dominant mechanism for our scenario as well. \n\nThe last one is the aforementioned phagocytosis from alveolar macrophages within the lung. The particles they clear need to be small enough that they a) reach the alveoles of lungs without sticking to the mucus and b) the macrophages can actually eat them. Phagocytosis becomes also increasingly more important the higher the load of the particle is in the breathing air since the mucus is not 100% efficient in catching every particle if you are breathing a whole lot of the particles at once, for example during smoking.\n\nEDIT: I'd like to add that the system is not perfect, and in the comment discussion below are various examples when these mechanisms fail.\n\nEDIT 2: it's been brought to my attention that apparently the hairs in the respiratory wall lining are called cilia, not kinocilia, whereas the (motile) cilia in the inner ear are called kinocilia. This is unusual to me because at least in German literature (take a guess where I am from), kinocilia are generally called cilia with a distinct architecture of cytoskeletal filament proteins (a ring of 9 pairs of microtubules and a pair right in the middle, or 9x2+2). The cilia of the respiratory tract fulfill that criterium and therefore are commonly called kinocilia here.

This man's COPD means he is predisposed for stuff (air, mucus, and even peas) to get caught in the air sacs. In fact, COPDers can have *huge*, single air cavities in their lungs called *bullae*. These airspaces make it really hard for your body to clear foreign material, leading to pneumonias, abscesses, and \"COPD exacerbations\".\n\nSecond, COPD is usually caused by smoking/smoke exposure, which also leads to fibrosis of the conductive airway tissue and loss of mucociliary clearance. It also causes loss of sensation in the airways, diminishing the cough reflex. This is why we often have to treat COPDers for aspiration pneumonias and abscesses. This man had a typical case of aspiration, especially in the setting of a recent hospitalization for an exacerbation. The only weird thing about it is that instead of chewed food/saliva/secretions (the usual stuff aspirated), he aspirated a whole pea.

That's what the vast majority of the mass of an average seed is - analogous to the yolk sac inside a bird egg.\n\nThe fruit itself tends to serve a purpose in the *distribution* of seeds, rather than as a source of nutrients for a growing seedling.  In many cases, the fruit tissue contains germination inhibitors, compounds that stop the seeds from growing until the fruit is eaten, rotted away or destroyed.  When a seed germinates inside a fruit, it's usually a misfire, a fluke.  A typical fruit would have a *much* greater concentration of seeds than should ever be planted next to each other.  When you seed a garden, you usually sow seeds a couple inches apart and thin them even further from there.  Much closer, and the resulting plants compete with each other and end up stunted and unhealthy.  Similarly, if the goal of a fruit was to provide nutrients to the seeds it carries, all the seeds would have to grow right next to each other, leading to extremely dense patches of unhealthy seedlings.  This wouldn't be a very good strategy for spreading the species around.  One unlucky footprint, and there goes an entire generation of seedlings.\n\nIn the specific case of a pea, there isn't really even a fruit involved.  The 'fruit' of the pea plant is actually the pod the peas grow inside, not the peas themselves.  Peas and beans are actually seeds, just like the seeds of watermelons, apples, sunflowers, broccoli, wheat, (wheat berries anyone?), and nearly every other crop we grow.  They just happen to the main part of the pea plant that we eat, snow peas and pea shoots notwithstanding.\n\nMost seeds do not actually need dirt or soil per se to germinate.  What they do require is the right combination of moisture, temperature, gas exchange and light to stimulate germination. (This is, of course, a gross oversimplification of the number of potential factors involved in germination, from local mineral content, seasonal temperature cycles, to smoke exposure, fungal breakdown of the seed coat, to the presence of neighboring plant species, to name a few.) For some plants, light level doesn't matter.  Peas and other legumes are often like this - they'll germinate anywhere, with water and oxygen.  Others, like poppies, actually require sunlight in order to germinate.  I can't speak well to the specific case of the watermelon, but horrifyingly enough, I can't think of any specific reason why it *couldn't* germinate inside a lung under the right conditions. It doesn't need light to germinate and isn't inhibited from germinating by the high temperatures inside the body like, say, a lettuce seed, would be.\n\nNow the upshot to this is that cases like this are *extremely rare*, but please do feel free to continue worrying about watermelon seeds in the lungs.

I would likely not be immune to those infections, but I would be protected by herd immunity. Sure enough, I had a titre later in life, and was negative for measles and mumps antibodies, though was positive for rubella antibodies. Perhaps today the pediatrician may have been tempted to recommend a potentially dangerous second course?\n* Vaccines are constantly developed, and prompt, widespread deployment of new vaccines in children helps to prevent the spread of the infections among unvaccinated adults. Chickenpox is a good example. The vaccine against varicella zoster, the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles, only came to market in 1990. There are millions of adults who grew up before the vaccine was available, did not have chickenpox as a child, and as a result are susceptible to varicella zoster infection (which tends to cause both worse symptoms and increased incidence of serious complications in adults, especially pregnant women and their developing fetuses - the concern is serious enough that the CDC recommends that pregnant women who may have been exposed to varicella seek medical attention).

The oral (live attenuated) vaccine protects from infection by reducing the odds of infection on exposure (\"shedding\" poliovirus in stool)  to 13% compared to no vaccination, while the injected (inactivated) vaccine provides no protection from infection (http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002599).  Both vaccines protect you from paralysis.  The injected vaccine is safer in absolute terms for you as an individual (http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2urird/raskscience_vaccines_megathread/cob6l6j), but the oral vaccine is better at stopping infection, and neither stops all infections.  This is why we use the injected vaccine in countries where poliovirus transmission is non-existent, but use the live vaccine in countries where poliovirus transmission is a concern.  If we use the injected vaccine in the wrong place, polio can transmit silently as happened recently in Israel (http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6159/679).\n\nLast for now, even if you can get silently infected and can transmit after vaccination, infections in vaccinated people are usually smaller (less virus/bacteria produced) and last for less time. Because of this, silent infections in vaccinated people, if they occur, are usually less important to transmission.\n\ntl;dr: Vaccinated people are usually individually-protected, but they might be able to host a silent infection, but that silent infection will probably be small and less important for transmission, but not always.

So, if a freshly vaccinated kid goes through a \"shedding\" phase, then could his nonvaccinated classmate catch the disease from him? If nonvaccinated kid caught the disease would it be really bad and cause an outbreak all over town, or would it be a lessened version of the disease since he caught it from someone else's vaccine?", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1423107587.0},{"body": "I'm glad you liked it!\n\n1. We talk about immunity like it's one thing, but it's very complicated.  Vaccines train the adaptive immune system to respond, but there are lots of components to the adaptive immune system (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system), and most vaccines do not train all the parts of the system that are important to fighting off a disease.  \n\nPoliovirus infection mostly takes place in the intestine, but it can cause paralysis when the virus travels from the intestine through the blood to the nervous system.  So, poliovirus immunity can act in 2 ways: there's local \"cellular\" immunity in the intestinal tissues where the infection takes root, and there's also blood-born \"humoral\" (like the four humours) immunity that can block the trip to the nervous system.  \n\nThe oral vaccine is a live poliovirus that's been modified so that it is very unlikely to cause paralysis (like 1 per million rare, vs 1 per hundred paralysis for wild polio infections).  Because it's a real polio infection, it replicates in your intestine, triggering the development of intestinal immunity, and it also travels into your blood and triggers blood-born immunity. The live vaccine gives you essentially the same immunity a natural infection would provide, but with much more safety.\n\nThe injected vaccine is made out of \"dead\" (inert, can't replicate) poliovirus protein and is given in your arm.  That treatment is really good at generating blood-born immunity, but it does very little if anything at the intestinal cells where poliovirus can get a foothold because it doesn't travel there.  So, someone with the injected vaccine has good protection from paralysis, but they are almost unvaccinated to stop infection (there are some more complicated effects I'm leaving out).\n\nThe reason different places use different vaccines comes down to \"is 1 paralysis per million vaccines a big number or a small number?\"  It's a small number if wild polio is still circulating in your country (Pakistan, Afghanistan, maybe still Nigeria) or in a neighboring country that can re-infect you, and so it's better to risk a few vaccine-associated paralytic cases to better prevent transmission of the much more dangerous wild polio. But, 1 per million is a big number if the risk of ever getting exposed to wild polio is much lower (like in the US or most of Europe or South America), where it's judged to not be worth the few vaccine-associated cases per year.  \n\nIt's worth pointing out that until about 20 years ago, almost every country used the oral vaccine because polio transmission risk was a serious concern everywhere. It's the success of polio vaccination that has gotten us so close to eradicating the disease that we are asking these complicated questions now.\n\n2. It's possible *sometimes* in a couple different ways, and sometime impossible.  \n\nFirst, all vaccines that are based on proteins or inactivated \"dead\" bugs can't transmit and so there's no worry (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inactivated_vaccine). \n\nLive \"attenuated\" vaccines (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine) can *in principle* transmit and give the neighbor kid a vaccination for free, but transmission is only common for oral polio vaccine and is unusual for all the others.  So, with the exception of oral polio vaccine, there's no worry about transmitting anything from a freshly vaccinated person to a non-vaccinated person. And, except in very rare cases (that 1 per million from earlier), transmitting the polio vaccine helps because it's like getting more people vaccinated for free.  Nobody gets sick, everyone is happy. \n\nNow, if someone was vaccinated a long time ago, but picks up a wild infection like we were talking about a comment ago, then they can pass it on but are usually much less likely to pass it on than if that person was never vaccinated. It's less likely because the vaccinated person is often less likely to get infected in the first place and the infection is often smaller than it would be if they weren't vaccinated.  So again, the vaccination makes it safer for everybody.\n\nThe main point of my posts here is that immunity isn't \"yes or no\". It's a continuum.  \n\nOn one end are things like measles vaccination (and mumps, rubella), where the protection after you get vaccinated with all required doses is excellent for decades.  These are up there with closed sewers and garbage collection as the most important public health inventions of all time.\n\nOn the other end is flu vaccine where the protection halves your odds of getting badly sick if you get the flu, and you need an update every year.  \n\nEdit: this is why I never write on reddit.

[Explained at length and quite well in the same faq sheet farther down](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/thimerosal/thimerosal_faqs.html#f).\n\nThe short answer as to why thimerosal is generally safe is that the mercury in the compound is not in a form shown to be harmful to humans. Repeated studies *since the 1930s* have shown thimerosol to be safe to use in human and animal vaccines as a preservative (interestingly, the reason it is included at all is because the first efforts to vaccinate children in the UK (1920s) resulted in ~1/2 of patients dying due to direct injection of staphylococcus bacteria).

The simplest formula to answer your question is\n\n(the probability per day of getting infected if not immune) = (probability per day of infected contact transmitting to non-immune individual)*(number of infected contacts per day)\n\nThe guesswork is in both the terms on the right.  \n\nFor your pets, true guesswork if they are indoor pets is that the number of infected contacts per day is zero, and so the probability is zero, no matter what the transmission probability. I wouldn't immunize your elderly pet based on what you said unless *you* hang out with a lot of other pets even if your pets don't.\n\nFor measles, the guesswork is statistical estimation from data, and Bryan Grenfell is the best source (http://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/flutsche/PUBLICATIONS/Grenfell.pdf).  But, to be quick-and-dirty about it, the first parameter in the equation is roughly 0.9 for measles. That means there's a 90% chance per day that if you are not immune and you are in close contact with someone with measles (like a sibling), you'll get measles.  \n\nSo, maybe you're not immune and you were recently at Disneyland and waited on line for an hour with someone who had measles. Then the probability you get infected might be something like 0.9/24*1 = 0.037, so you've got a 4% chance of being infected that hour. If you're in line with 10 people over the day, that's 40%. \n\nBut, if you're immunized, that 0.9 per infected contact per day drops to something small enough that it's not been reliably measured, and even if you do somehow catch some measles, you'll probably be asymptomatic unless it's been decades since your last booster.  So the vaccine is a really good idea.\n\nBut your vaccination-skeptic friend asks, what if I don't plan on taking my kid to Disneyland? Then, sure, as long as you never take your kid anywhere where people might have measles, then the probability of getting measles is zero and so the vaccine won't help.  However, how is your friend gonna hide the kid from all sources of measles for all time?  There are a few million measles infections globally per year, and Disneyland, the UK, China, Russia, Nigeria [etc]( http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/surveillance_type/active/measles_monthlydata/en/), show that measles is transmissible enough to find non-immune people wherever they are. So even if the odds of meeting someone with measles are low every day, the lifetime odds accumulate.  And anti-vaxxers hang-out together, so it only takes 1 to bump into that random stranger for the whole community to get sick.
