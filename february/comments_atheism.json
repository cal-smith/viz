My church now performs gay marriage, promotes interfaith discussions/services, etc., we've even got one openly gay staff member and several openly gay Elders. \n\nOur church's take on \"doctrinal fallacies\" is that the Bible is absolutely not literal, not in the least.

(Those Greeks again.)\n\n3 - Prostitution was legal and common\n\n4 - Games of sport (such as wrestling) were often done in the nude and attended by men and women.\n\n5 - Drug use may have been common (they called it sorcery, the Greek word is \u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 (phar-ma-kia) which suggests that drugs were sometimes used to 'magically' heal or influence.  \n\nNot one of these was a hot button issue for the apostles.  \nPaul doesn't tell the Christians to protest, march, complain, interfere, politicize or in any way engage society to change any of these 'issues'.  Instead, he tells them they are only to concern themselves with their own behaviour.  Admittedly, in at least one place, he says that using a prostitute is a bad idea.  It also appears he tells them that drug use is bad and that homosexuality is bad (I know this one is argued a lot but to be fair it is there).\n\nMy point is, that activist Christianity and the assumption that Christian values should be applied to a non-Christian social and political culture seems to oppose the practices of the early Christians.  They apparently decided that once a person became a Christian, their behaviour and personal life would change but that forcing change on a culture was meaningless.\n\nIn fact, when Christianity did become the official religion of the Empire under Constantine, it seems he did it for entirely political purposes and his own ego, neither of which was very Christian.

I can't even count the amount of personal \"miracle\" stories I've heard from teachers leading up to the good ole' \"One day something will happen and it will cause you to believe in God.\" It was disheartening and quite frankly oppressive. I personally think that religion isn't worth the distance it creates between humans. No faith/hope in the world is worth more than our humanity as a whole. Can you remember your life before this one? Why assume there is a next one? They honestly believe all of these living creatures are some sadistic test subjects for morality and at the end of it all you are judged based on your performance. That is a direct slap in the face to every living being (even beyond humans) who wasn't given the opportunity to make a choice. Because our brain's #1 interest is being alive and conscious, that's why these stories are created and perpetuated. Some people live happier with the delusion of hope than in the actuality of biology. \n\nEDIT: [Here's](http://religionincollege.blogspot.com/) a blogpost I made while going to community college about this very subject, my professor told the class he believed in God because of the Fibonacci code and I decided to write a blog about it.

(It kind of makes my blood boil because they don't know the power of their words, not in some aggressive militant atheist way, but it just affects me, like it hurts deep, because the teacher is overlooking my personal opinion and basically invalidating it, and I can't even stand up against it because I know I would get overruled by the majority and silenced.)", "gilded": 0, "score": 12, "created": 1424575765.0},{"body": "As a science teacher and christian in the south (AL and TN) I wanted to give you my views on this matter. \n\nI teach evolution. I do not teach anything about any religious belief that I have; if a students asks about my personal religious beliefs, I tell them to bring that up again outside of class time if they are truly interested. I do understand that because of where I teach, there will be various views on the subject. Most of my students will not \"believe\" in evolution mainly because of how they have been raised. So when I introduce the topic at the beginning of the year, I have my students do research projects on the many different cultural and scientific views that are out there. I am not there to make up their minds for them; my students are at an age where they should be starting to question their world views and the world views of others, so that they can develop a personalized (and educated) view of the world. \n\nAfter the students learn about the different views, I tell them the view that will be taught--evolution-- is due to scientific evidence and that whether or not they believe it, does not mean they are exempt from obtaining the knowledge. To be fair to my students, I have spent time learning the beliefs of many different forms of creationism and intelligent design so that I can at least have an understanding of the different view points that come into my classroom. \n\nIt would be wrong of me not to address the view of my students. It would do no good to just ignore what my students believe, and could cause problems in their learning down the road. I'm not going to \"convert\" my creationist students during one semester.

What I can do, is help them become more educated and make them begin to think critically about those beliefs. \n\nIs that to say that all classrooms are run how mine is, no. Lord, no (haha, see what I did there). I remember going to professional development with other science teachers in the state and having to bite my tongue on the topic of evolution. One teacher even boasted about how she gets a sub to teach it now that she is being forced. I wanted to ask her how she taught the rest of her biology course, since everything had a connection to evolutionary concepts. But that was neither the time nor place for a just-starting-out teacher. \n\nHave hope though. Times are changing. Don't group us southern, christian teachers all together, or just Christians in general. In my graduate education and professional development classes, I have seen a recurring pattern that the older teachers (&gt;40) are anti-evolution while younger teachers (&lt;40) are pro-evolution.

We don't expect the wider world at large to grasp all the nuance of what can be very complicated and involving research.\n(I've seen the glazing of the eyes at parties when I try to explain my thesis - its a common issue.)\n\nThe broader issue, or the problem that I hear come up most frequently when I talk with other scientists about public engagement with science, is not that there is a lack of knowledge about specific schools of science, but that it seems that the **scientific method** is what isn't appropriately understood.\n\nLack of understanding of the engine behind all the sciences results in a mistrust or misunderstanding of conclusions that are drawn. It seems as though people don't understand there is no flawless experiment that can address all areas of a particular aspect of a topic at once. Science builds knowledge by pieces to contribute to a wider knowledge base. Over time, that information is updated as we improve technology or learn more, but that doesn't necessarily invalidate all the things we have learned previously. \n\nI hear way too much of \"All scientists are paid off by big pharma/Monsanto/the government/the green energy industry and are therefore frauds\". Not how it works. \n\nYou can absolutely design a shitty experiment and release a shitty paper that is manipulated in such a way that it gives you the answer that you want. It's bad science, but it happens. Scientists aren't saints. \n\nBut the system is set up in such a way that there is a process of replication and peer review. Eventually your shitty study will be discredited, retracted or fade into obscurity. This is what the system does. \n\nHowever, you then see people who agreed with the initial study arc up about a 'cover-ups' or 'the science not being settled' and planting seeds of discord - discord that doesn't necessarily exist within the scientific community, but takes root and spreads within the wider public, because of a fundamental misunderstanding of the system behind the science.\n\nThe Andrew Wakefield MMR controversy is a great example - His article was widely discredited, retracted, and countless hours of studies have created piles of evidence against his assertion, but in a worrying number of places, his conclusions are seen as equally, if not more valid than those of his detractors. \n\nThe scientists aren't wholly absolved from blame Most of us get it.

This intrusion into freedom of choice, and the eventual failure of some, if not many, of these government licensed drugs discredits science; if the current science is all that great, then it should not need anti competitive protection against alternative discoveries.\n\nAnother problem is that science has a record of failures mixed in with successes, and the failures often become a greater focus of attention that creates an anti science bias in the minds of those who don't understand that there is much trial and error in discovery of knowledge.\n\nAnother problem is the involvement of government in funding.  When the public sees exotic studies that seemingly are laughable, there is resentment against having been forced to pay for something no sane person would have supported.  If science were funded by contributions or paid for by profit seeking organizations, and not by forced extraction of wealth from taxpayers, science would have much more credibility.  The distribution of funding by government means that what government wants is funded, and what scientists themselves want can be thwarted.  When big institutions like government, and universities (themselves often government funded too) decide on research there is a bias to protect established interests.  This causes stagnation in science, so there are examples in history of rejection of new knowledge for decades, before it is accepted.\n\nPerhaps it is just self serving narcissism on the part of scientists to blame the ignorance of the public or the failure of corporate controlled media for the inadequacies of the system of which they are part.
