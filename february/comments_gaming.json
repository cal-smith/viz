We especially see this in Nintendo's evolution as major graphics and capabilities evolved, it was natural to keep the same characters and expand on previous titles.  \n\nUnfortunately, our capabilities in the past 10 years haven't drastically changed.  COD II came out roughly 10 years ago.  The mechanics are improved, but it's just not a comparison when 10 years previously, DOOM was the top FPS of the day.  They're completely different games yet COD, whatever number it's on, hasn't changed much.   Every game released does get slightly better, but it's like they're making a statue, and every year, releasing the new version.  The first years saw the biggest improvement, from a hunk of clay to a slightly defined body to wel defined limbs etc.  Nowadays, they're getting in details lke those odd little red bumps  you get with dry skin, for example... it really doesn't add to much to the statue, and I wouldn't pay for a new one. \n\nAnother point to make is people, in general, go with what they know makes sense and what they can make up.  Minecraft has been a wonderful thing to the gaming industry, but many gather/crafting games rely on the similar mechanics and even the same tools.  These are not done by big corporations, but by individuals.  They're not doing it to copy and make money, but instead they're focus is on other gameplay elements, Starbound comes to mind here... where there are so many \"copies\" of minecraft mechanics however it's mostly because when building a gather/crafting game base build, minecraft is a great place to start researching how to build a good game.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have too many like Chris Roberts for example.  Many people have the drive to create a new feel of game.  Many have business sense of how to run a small company.  Not many have both and also powerful enough leader skills to do everything that's required to manage a business, manage the creative teams to do things the unproven and hard way, and on top of that, make a game that's fun.  Robert's is quite unique in this since he's been an indie developer before there even was the name \"indie developer\".  He went into the big developement and did AAA management, and saw the problems with it from investors.  He even had a great failure when he went into studio production, and has seemed to learn from it.  A critical component to any one person's development is failing at something, then learning from it unironically.  I think he's done that.. at least I hope.\n\nThanks for reading if you have, I'm sure your inbox is exploded.

There was a point where the player actually messed up and couldn't get the spreader upgrade because the level scrolled too far and he couldn't jump up to it. So he purposefully killed himself, which dropped him in the top of the level, and he was able to get the spreader. Fuckin' genius. He thought this up on the fly and the band never missed a beat.
