It's there because around 2008 an employee spotted in a press picture looked like Gordon Freeman.  Link? [The image that started it](http://cdn.acidcow.com/pics/20091117/gordon_freeman_at_cern_01.jpg)

[Reddit then sent him a crowbar](http://www.redditblog.com/2008/11/crowbar-arrived-at-cern-freeman-was.html) I can picture him standing there with an unamused look, asking "Do I have to do this?" and "The half-life of what?". He's an Electronics Engineer at CERN. There is a good chance he knows Half-Life. I have this impression that prestigious scientists like those at CERN are what happens when regular science-inclined people choose not to play video games. 

EDIT: This comment is great for tagging scientist Redditors for the future.  Guess some of you DO play games.  I'm reporting all of you to your superiors and those who control your government funding.  Get back to discovering new science shit for the rest of us! They just have the discipline to stop playing when it's time to work. Everyone needs to relax sometimes, I'm a scientist and the public perception of us as these unfeeling, fun loathing logic machines is pretty amusing. And yet you speak like I would imagine a scientist too, and I'm ok with that I'm a CERN user, and play a fairly solid amount of video games when time allows. So do many others I know! Glad to hear it.  So my impression was unfounded. Those "prestigious scientists" are people with hobbies, too. Yes.  Hobbies like prestigious science. My friend is Ph.D. (Dr. rer. nat.) in physics and Researcher at the Center of applied space technology and microgravity in Bremen. He works on stuff like "Equations of motion in metric-affine gravity: a covariant unified framework" and guess what - he loves playing video- and computergames. Last game he played for a while was Elite:Dangerous. He also plays Star Craft 2 and SNES games like Contra 3. &gt; "Equations of motion in metric-affine gravity: a covariant unified framework" 

This sounds really awesome, but I fell asleep about halfway through reading that title.  Tell your friend to keep up the good work! today I learned you can't be smart and like video games at the same time. more has to do with not having enough time There's a difference between being smart, and being smart enough to work at CERN.  I bet they don't even know about music and TV. Not about brains. About time. Highly successful people in very advanced/competitive fields generally have very little free time. And when they do, that free time is very often closely associated with what they get paid to do. There are of course exceptions to this. One of my profs worked at CERN. I'm pretty sure he didn't have any time left for any hobbies, his family was happy when they got to see him from time to time. But he was working for CERN in Geneva and doing lectures in Heidelberg, so I guess his schedule was tighter than that of most scientists working there. That's quite symptomatic of senior academics. There's a certain breed who like to be permanently based away at or constantly travel back and forth to wherever their data is collected (be it a lab, a telescope, a rainforest).

For example, I never once met [Dave Charlton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Charlton) (now spokesperson for ATLAS) during my 4 years at Birmingham. Maybe doing lectures was his hobby! And that hobby is *SCIENCE!* *SCIENCE!* as opposed to science, which is strictly a professional pursuit. As everybody knows.  [deleted] No way, they probably use Half Life as a training simulator just in case they rip a hole in our dimension After a relatively shitty day at work, this has me grinning from ear to ear.

Also, half life 3 confirmed? Augmented reality game What if... Like... Half life three is real life and were already playing it? /r/outside That game looks like shit I've been playing for a while and it really is pay to win bullshit Everyone keeps raving about the graphics, but I needed an unofficial third-party patch just to keep everything from being blurry. Lazy developers. I have an official patch to keep things from being blurry... also crap.

I also can't get the sense-of-smell.exe file to extract properly.

The devs have yet to release a statement... :-( I've got it stuck in colourblind mode. Graphics look spectacular. But literally everything is pay to play. Was this game developed by EA? Graphics are realistic but lack the flair You mean /r/Ingress We're not playing it, that Gordon Freeman lookalike is. We're just NPC's. Not if I can help it. I want to see a game where the NPCs rebel and decide to have an adventure themselves.

Then when you get to the end there's a 50% chance to find out the boss has already been defeated by a local mob, led by the shopkeeper. There is an online comic called Goblins where the goblin characters actually take up character classes as they hate always being fodder for low level adventures. They end up leveling and everything lol! Not exactly what you wanted but your comment brought it to the forefront of my mind so I thought I would share. *sigh* ... nobody's stopping you from playing with yourself ... You clearly have not had the pleasure of meeting my dead Aunt Satine. I'll have to go talk to him then, on second thought, He'll just have to wait until after the test. I am honestly trying to go deeper. Like Being John Malkovich but with that guy Gaben will probably die before HL3 is written and Brandon Sanderson will be called in to finish the series. I get why they'd shy away from straight up making a(n) HL3 right now, but I wonder why they don't make some continuation of the HL series even if it breaks away from what you'd expect and maybe circles back around to HL3 with new momentum. I can't tell if this is a Portal joke or not. Ha, it wasn't but I didn't even think about that.  Something like that though. Wavelength 3 confirmed. 3 what? Meters? Miles? Use your units, people! It'll complete a cycle When It's Done.  That really hertz. it must be a sine of things to come 3 girth units. Man that guy was a super good sport, or a real HL fan.

Aw: the videos and picasa gallery are gone.  6 year old links. Fuckin link rot. The picasa link works. The vids are gone though. This is so awesome. I'm so glad Reddit did this and then they subsequently added the HL Logo.

This makes me so happy. that guy has to be italian. He has an italian name(Sandro Bonacini) and wrote a thesis at Universit di Modena e Reggio Emilia in Italy partly in Italian. I'd say so too. Hah! See? That's imprinting for you. I can always recognize cute countrymen around my age. [deleted] No, Gordon Freeman. It's a common mistake, because they were played by the same voice actor. "HYAAA"  -  Gordon Freeman Totally thought this was a screenshot at first... Lol same here. I was thinking it was an easteregg in a game that had a level that took place at CERN. [Building 887 (EHN1)](http://imgur.com/a/ijQkY#3) would make a good level, particularly with the four beamlines passing through air. [I](http://gryphart.com/files-gryphartcom/Gryphart_Images/Games/Deus_Ex_3_The_Missing_Link_DLC/DLC_OceanBase_Hangar_01_withtinyperso_rsfrwb.jpg)

[Completely](http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/529293-deus-ex-human-revolution-the-missing-link-windows-screenshot.jpg)

[Agree](http://deusex.wikia.com/wiki/Rifleman_Bank_Station) I don't know if I'm getting old, or the graphics of games are really getting good but I thought the first one was a picture.  I think the first one is concept art.  The second image is a screenshot of the same game. It's the graphics of real life that are really getting bad. I loved every second of that game. Deus Ex: HR was amazing. I only wish that the world was more open. It seems like the kind of game where open world would be very doable and make a lot of sense. In fact, I initially thought the game was going to be open world, as the early levels were large and open. Whoa, that last link took me to the Deus Ex wiki, but the page was all done up with Majora's Mask artwork and ads.

I should note that I'm on my work computer, and don't have any ad blockers installed. But that's okay because I like Majora's Mask. I remember that when our guide took us through that building, we asked about the warning signs about radiation hazards. He replied: "Nah, I've worked here since forever and back in my time the maximum dose was much higher and it never harmed me when I stood next to the machines and...". We didn't hear the rest because he turned around and kept walking while mumbling. That actually might be the case. [This is a graph](http://i.imgur.com/5KoRO9d.png) that shows the cumulative dose of all personnel working at the SPS each year since 1977. I can't find one per-person, which would probably be more instructive.

No single person since 2003 has received more than 6 mSv in one year at CERN. In 2012, no one received above 2 mSv.

This is all useless crap I learnt from a radiation safety course. The radiation protection guys seem very proud of these statistics :D Haaang on, lemme pull out the [xkcd radiation chart](https://xkcd.com/radiation/) so these numbers start to mean something.

I can't find historical numbers for the number of employees all that easily, but they [currently employ 2250 staff members](https://jobs.web.cern.ch/faq/general-information) and state that about 13,000 people work their way through there each year. Let's assume that graph only represents employees, and that the number of staff as grown linearly throughout their entire history (0 in 1977 to 2250 in 2014). I have no basis for any of this other than better information is difficult to come by and linear progressions are really easy to calculate.

Max amount of total radiation looks to be 1981 with ~750mSv. It was also very early in the project when, by our formula for employees, it will have the most effect. That was spread across approximately 243 employees, that's ~3mSv/person on average. That's one and a half head CTs or about 3% of the lowest dose ever clearly linked to increased cancer risk.

2007 appears to be the lowest non-zero value at around 40mSv. That's spread over approximately 1824 employees for a total dose of ~0.02mSv on average (20 &amp;micro;Sv).

Survey says... That's about double your daily background dose of radiation, one chest x-ray, or an airplane flight halfway across the continental US.

And the figure you give - 6mSv max dose since 2003. That's:

* living in stone, brick or concrete buildings for 85 years (most of your life)
* a little under one chest CT
* approximately 1.5% of the dose required to cause radiation poisoning in an acute dose
* 6% of the dose received by Fukushima plant workers
* 0.07% of an always lethal dose

So yeah, it sounds like they have something to be proud of. :) HL 3 confirmed...? Whoa, whoa. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I'm still waiting for Half Life 2: Episode 3. "Diminished sense of reality, huh? VR training will do that."

- Solid Snake Haha nice they are onto us! El-psy-congroooo! I still love how every time CERN does an AMA, [at least half of the questions/comments are Steins;Gate references](http://i.imgur.com/x7YxOab.png)

 He said in the first one that they are tired of it and that they've heard every single joke multiple times already.

I'm guessing they didn't want to get sued. Much like it wasn't CERN, but rather it was SERN. I think it was playing into the whole alternative timeline thing as well.

Shame he ended up in a totally different world line with a big divergence number Holy shit.

What if he was real and his mission was successful preventing the apocalyptic future? That is fucking awesome. A role player was so good that they got their own wiki. Wikipedia article  wiki. [John Titor really exists](http://www.johntitor.com/) The other guys got John titor, that was cool. The ibm computer was also real and actually did have the capability to do whatever weird shit they wanted it for in the show. I can't remember And the fact that it's based on an actual time travel theory. Agreed. A time travel story that doesn't trip over itself and great character development. Seeing it here made me happy.  You should read the visual novel. If you have like 80 hours to burn, sure. More like 40-50. Or build yourself a microwave time machine, then you'll have all the time in the world. What's wrong meowster?

*Nyan....* Is this real or another unreal 4 engine shot?  I just can't tell anymore... LOL, ikr, i thought it was a game. Seems like its real shot though Also [gman] (http://i.ytimg.com/vi/NVU6ThbB1EM/hqdefault.jpg) Because when you have a badass job, you get to do badass things like painting a lambda on the wall. Supplies thataway. I know this one. Look nearby for either a ladder or a waist-high vent in the wall.  Expect either Magnum rounds or alien batteries.  Sometimes I hear the "kch-ssst" of the medkits when I'm eating. You may want to get an x-ray of your jaw Because my life is dope and I do dope shit.  Or DO you?  I'm sure some intellectual rights lawyer is checking the legal books right now just to make sure... "They're waiting for you, Gordon,... in the test chamber." This is the north end of the [180/S-204 corridor](https://maps.cern.ch/mapsearch/mapsearch.htm?n=%5B%27180/S-204%27%5D). Located under building 180, which houses a [big workshop for magnets](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1511082?ln=en).

[Here is my own pic](http://imgur.com/grvjWUg) of the [2/S-202 corridor](https://maps.cern.ch/mapsearch/mapsearch.htm?n=%5B%272/S-202%27%5D) at pretty much the opposite end of the campus. Unfortunately there's a distinct lack of interesting graffiti there :(

Edit: Since this thread is like a fly-trap for people at CERN, do any of you know the explanation/story behind [this picture of a horse](http://imgur.com/qX2Y6PQ) in Filtration Plant? Thanks, now I know where the supply cache is. That corridor obviously has headcrabs.  &gt;there's a distinct lack of interesting graffiti there 

All it takes is the right man in the wrong place to make the difference. that floor looks like it could use a mop. A lot of the older buildings are in pretty poor condition. My office is in one of the very original ones and [frankly it's a bit shit](https://imgur.com/a/Pvaif) Your office doesn't look dirty or non-functional, it's just got old furniture in it, and the shelves look a bit disorganised.

It looks fine. But I believe it would be kinda freezing to work there without that heater(?) in the middle of the windows.

Big windows = non-existant insulation on one wall = lots of room for heat to escape. I still envy you for working at CERN. Remarkably similar to my university physics department. I guess the moral of the story is that the experiments are where the budget goes, not the premises! You should see the older CERN buildings from the outside. Some of them look like factories abandoned decades ago and built decades before that. The whole SPS ring is pretty sad looking, as are many buildings along Route Gregory.   Somehow they look [less bad](http://imgur.com/a/tJk4b) in the snow. I, too, am often at CERN. I know jackshit about physics but I use their gym so I'll just join this thread. That would annoy me to no end, always walking past that. 

There must be supplies around _somewhere_! Can confirm that this is real.

Source: Working at CERN, been down there. Quite fun. You could easily get lost and it was in early winter so while moving around it literally changed from freezing from 30C to 5C depending on where you were (because all the heating pipes for the offices are down there, along with a whole lot of fiber cables for networking).
Oh, and the best thing is: You don't have to break any "Authorized personnel only" or similar signs. Those tunnels are accessible to anyone on site.

Here's an album of some photo I took while down there. http://imgur.com/a/yB2Vd Love the 7th picture with the chair in the dirty valve room. http://lonelychairsatcern.tumblr.com/

I want lambda's to just start springing up all over cities and that's what builds HL3 hype Can someone explain what a resonance cascade is and why it can't happen at CERN? Yes. Can you explain what a resonance cascade is and why it can't happen at CERN? Yes. I'd be more worried about the false vacuum.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe#False_vacuum I will admit the probability of a resonance cascade scenario is extremely unlikely. But you don't need to hear all this, you're a highly trained professional. *jumps* Resonance cascades are fiction. [Cascade resonances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_baryon), however, are bound states of a 1^st generation quark with two from either the 2^nd or 3^rd generation.

i.e. baryons with [I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isospin) = 1/2 and |[S](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangeness)|+|[C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charm_%28quantum_number%29)|+|[B](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottomness)|=2 But does the phrasing Resonance Cascade at least make some sense? Like if we had a situation akin to the one in Half Life would we give it a name like resonance cascade? I'm not sure I can come up with an answer. The physics behind the events in Half Life seems intentionally vague, which is just fine. Certainly preferable to a jargon salad in my opinion. Achievement Progress: 52/100

Lambda Locator Half Life 3 Con....CERNed? We're all con....CERNed about HL3 :( This post has made me unreasonable happy.

HL3 - NOT confirmed.

so close! I work at a military research lab. One day I was going through some gear in a back room and I came across A) An orange jumpsuit and B) a prybar.

It made the hair on my arms stand up. Awesome. your job sounds extremely interesting  There are days when it is. What exactly do you do or would you have to kill me if you said? Not at all, for 25 years I was a graphic designer that translated scientist and engineers ideas into illustrations and drawings that explained How Things Worked. Some of it was lethal technologies, some other things (like sensors or translation programs or robots).

A few years ago I got into the public affairs end of the workplace. I work at an Army research facility. I have deployed and climbed all over some very interesting things, some of which were classified at the time. Like when the US bought a motor rifle brigade outright from East Germany. THAT was cool, tanks, APCs, all kinds of soviet tech. Or getting to spend time at a range, shooting things with a Barrett, or some other weapon. 

Like I said, it can be fun, yet not always. I am a career government employee in the Department of the Army. probably better than whatever i''ll end up doing. I'm guessing they pay you well? Yep. "Lamda Locator" achievement unlocked. Sneaky Valve. I knew I'd finally get that last one someday. Except that it's actually spelled 'lambda'. Valve and their typos. smh Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide No escape from reality. Open your eyes. Look up to the skies and see... moms spaghetti He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready  http://i.imgur.com/6MFWOeK.gif Is this just Fanta sea? Half Life 3 conCERNed?  That reminds me, I need to watch the latest episode of The Flash That's what I expect eat HL3 to look like. Get the fuck out of here. This picture makes me want to buy a can of orange spray paint and a make a stencil We all knew CERN is underground because of Black Mesa. The person that did that graffitti didn't know his gesture might have some... unforseen consequences...

There might even be some... Apprehension.

Who knows! Maybe there are a lot more workers there with qestionable ethics. http://i.imgur.com/vncZ8J3.gifv In some places in the CERN tunnels one can still find traces of Zombie blood*(fake, probably) from the Zombie movie we made there: http://www.decayfilm.com/ So is CERN going to be visited by a man in a suit and tie carrying a suitcase and several months later accidentally open up portals to others worlds and cause an Alien invasion? (lol jk) Holy shit I would play the fuck out of this. The industry really is missing a wonderful opportunity to make a free roam, sandbox style Jurassic Park game. I mean, like all the GTA, it's on an island! If they could make a JP game as a sort of Rockstar/Bethesda game, I'mm all for it. Nothing like running around shooting dinosaurs, or exploring Ingen's ruins. The Telltale game was such a let down. 

Let's jope with Jurassic World, that a game will come out in that vein. If there was an Outlast game that is Jurassic Park themed I'd shart water on a stranger. I have you tagged but I hope for everyone's sake you don't have to pull through on this [deleted] **BUTTWATER** I've seen this before too.  The guy put water in his butt from the hose and then shit it out of the guy on the ground.   He shat water a few times on the grass before he shat on the guy, so he should be mostly clean. &gt;  so he should be mostly clean.

Probably not.  Pretty gross though.  fucking christ for real, wtf Pretty sure that one was a front page /r/wtf, but I'm not clicking to verify.  buttwater! buttwater! /r/retiredgif Was probably more relevant the other day when it has its own thread...which is what OP is referencing.  I dare to think what you had to type into Google to find that... It was on /r/wtf a couple days ago. ohh he does I'll fucking do it. I still need to put my penis in someone's ear to make good on something else. God. I've got to stop talking.  This is my favorite idea here. I didn't finish Outlast (jump scares, pattern learning got a bit old) but a lot about that game felt really good. The atmosphere, lighting, oppressiveness, but more than that the movement just felt really great.  Butt water!!! [Buttwater, buttwater, buttwater, buttwater!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvP01RcxJs8) Enough with the zombies! WE NEED DINOSAURS!!! But dinosaurs need AI programming. Think devs don't like that. That's one of the reasons there are so many zombie games....they lack complicated AI, which is easy to program. I would love a 'clever girl' moment in a dinosaur game :). Seriously, the only thing that we have gotten the past couple years is zombies, aliens, or zombie aliens. We need prehistoric shit NOW! [Zombie goasts?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHxyZaZlaOs) But. But... Vampires... :( I'm like the only person rooting for a new legacy of Kain.  Bought Dino D-Day the other day. my niece wont stop playing it. Dinosaur vs Nazi lol. Ubisoft had a poll on what setting fans want the most and the one that won undoubtedly was a Jurassic park style/themed island with dinosaurs.... I would play the fuck out if that game so bad.... Let's just hope it is actually the next Far Cry game. &gt; Let's just hope it is actually the next Far Cry game.

You mean [X Isle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwHEdySGbck), the game that was later renamed to Far Cry after it had it's dinosaurs removed?

Fear not, you can [download the demo](http://downloads.guru3d.com/download.php?det=455)! It's a little bit dated is all. Oh yea and put in those stupid genetically modified ape things right? Dinosaurs would have been way awesome but perhaps difficult to program the AI for.  Two words; TIME TRAVEL!

8 more words; Back to the Future and Jurassic Park crossover. So the ride that used to be at Universal Studios? I just wanna see Doc fall in love with a dinosaur. It's a tale as old as time... Doctor and the Beast

 If you haven't seen it already, here's a [BTTF mod](http://youtu.be/_m3-xw_BOwo) this dude created for GTAIV. It's crazy how a time-travel game like this hasn't been made yet. &gt; Back to the Future and Jurassic Park crossover

You mean [Dino Crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dino_Crisis) and its [Sequel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dino_Crisis_2)? I want a full on (not a DLC) Far Cry game set in a prehistoric dinosaur world.
 Or Assassin Creed: Jurassic Park, where you need to assassinate some dinasaurs for being ugly or something. If Bethesda were to do it I can think of only one thing: [Pterodactyls. Pterodactyls everywhere.](http://i.imgur.com/EL8wL.gif) haven't seen an annoying flying mob in an elder of scrolls since morrowind. I kind of missed them in the last two installments. They seem to have exported them to Fallout. Those god damn bloatflies, man. Cazadores. You misspelled satan Dragons?  I wouldn't call them annoying. I actually enjoyed those but I would have liked a flying mob that showed up as frequently as wolves. Dragons getting killed by a single frost troll. Now THAT was annoying!

I once saw a giant take on two dragons and kill one, dying to the second.

Bethesda: Why did dragons have to be soooo shitty? Yeah they should have had the easy dragons be dragon babies and size them accordingly and up the power with the size of the dragons. Imagine if they made the really powerful ones to the scale that they are in dragon age. Now that would have been fun and worthy of song in Valhalla There are a couple mods which make dragons more challenging and interesting. I've got a few, deadly dragons, more dragons, more dragon loot, things like that. Jurrasic park combined with battle royal would be heaven put into a game. Fuck fighting zombies, the real thrill is manage not to get eaten by a walking house **Trespasser**was that game. It was awfully fun when something worked, and just awful in general. One of the few games where a player could commit suicide via gun. I had some _National Geographicesque_ moments in that game, like watching a herd of brachiosauruses interact, but when I was attacked by a raptor and only managed to shoot the scenery I noped out of there :) Turok I feel like that entire franchise is underrated.    Except for the new one, they took away all the stuff I loved about the old games =[ The new one being the 1st turok games for the Xbox 360? That is the newest o e that im aware of, and it was great for that time.   It was an ok xbox game for that time period. It was not a good Turok game.

I remember how great the Turok multiplayer was and the awesome weapons you could get and the new turok got rid of a lot of that. The next Lego game is JP. Going to be all 4 movies.

Edit: here's the teaser. 
http://youtu.be/19bujoZiBNA I enjoy the Lego games but it's just not what I want with Jurassic Park. I want a 1st person survival game. Hahahahaha just...a little...further...come on Rex, you can do it! In lego games, every level requires at least 2 players. Which means a level with Chris Pratt and a raptor. LEGO Jurassic World is coming out this summer. If Rockstar and Bethesda made a game it would win game of the year for at least 3 years in a row. Imagine the mods that thing would get, holy crap.  Man your hypothetical game of the year isn't conceived yet and you're already hoping for people modding it to make it better We need a modern version of Trespasser. Essentially, what the devs had imagined but didn't have the technology to make at the time actually brought to life.  &gt; The industry really is missing a wonderful opportunity to make a free roam, sandbox

Many, too many games released these days are "free roaming! Sandbox!" but the problem with the industry today is that they all think "Let's develop this game as a free roam so we don't have to think about level design and progression, just put storyline based checkpoint randomly over a huge and poorly detailed map". Open world has always been like that. I wish more devs would take the time to add Metroid-style elements to their worlds, where you need to develop skills before you can safely navigate certain areas of the map. That'd allow the game to have a more natural difficulty curve and sense of progression, rather than just "suddenly there are more and/or stronger enemies". You hear that ubisoft? Take a break from farcry and reskin it to have dinosaurs. Seriously, I would play the shit out of that. A modern version of Trespasser would be great. A modern version of Trespasser that didn't have a paralyzed left arm and complicated ass system of controlling the right, would be great.

I really loved the game but that control system was just...atrocious. I appreciate trying to do something different/new but that shit was silly.

I do however fully endorse retention of the cleavage tattoo health gauge. Or something like dead island but with dinosaurs Orion: Prelude is a game where you run around shooting dinosaurs.  It's a good few hours of fun.  It'd be awesome to play on your JP map. There was one on snes....so hard.  One of the few games I never beat. What has no one converted Skyrim to Jurassic Park yet?! Because it's a shit engine. Well, it certainly isn't an ideal engine but I'd take it over any current dino game on the market. A game you describe is early access on steam. http://store.steampowered.com/app/322920/ Steam + Early access + survival game = disappointment. That's not entirely true... There is always project zomboid. It's a pretty awesome early access survival game Yes, of course Zomboid is the notable exception. Look up the segacd Jurassic park. On of the better sega cd games. And it's free roam like myst. As free roam as that is.  I've always dreamed of a [Jaws Unleashed](http://youtu.be/VPvEjrHYv6k) style Jurassic Park game. Anyone remember Turok for N64, where you could play as Raptors in multiplayer? Cause I would play the SHIT out of that game too! :D  Primal Carnage, PC.

 Oooooh much appreciated!  Rented this once because all my mates were taking about a sweet fighting game. They meant Tekken of course. I heard the t and that was enough. No regrets. [deleted] Fuck Zombies already, why can't Dinosaurs be the next big thing? I'm still waiting on the Battlefield with dinosaurs dlc rumor to come true. :(

Still, saw a velociraptor coded into a game, I'm happy! Blowing up a pterodactyl with a smaw sounds marvelous.   I would probably c4-jihad ram a T-Rex with a jeep ARMA 3 has a Dinosaur mod. Yeah but I wanted to play at more then 15 fps whilst all on low using my supercomputer. That game I swear to god. Ultra quality@1080p: 48fps.potato quality@1080p:47fps.  Walks in major console video game producer meeting. 

"Alright, zombies are all the rage today. Let's strap up and milk this until our pockets are bulging. Any questions?"

"Yeah, can we try something new. Like dinosaurs. I mean, hell, we could make a fully fleshed out, sandbox style, free roam Jurassic Park game, or hell, be lazy and atleast do a half decent Turok game.  A lot of people love dinosaurs, and since thereare not that many video games with dinosaurs in them, we could really make some money on this."

Exec looks like he just smelled shit, and gives a face of disapproval. "Listen here noob, we are going to go with a theme that is already guaranteed to make money. With stuff like George Romero and John Russo's Of The Dead and Return of the Living Dead films, Resident Evil, Left 4 Dead, Island of the Dead, and the populatlrity of COD's Zombies, we are guaranteed to make a pile by beating and milking this dead horse. You got that noob?"

"But dinosaurs are the shit!"

"Listen, I run the show here, sit down and shut up."

 I would love a dinosaur video game, but mahor companies are retarded and will beat a dead horse like no tomorrow. You see what is happening to Nintendo? They keep making sequels to the same damn franchises. That's why I don't buy
 Zelda anymore. 

Also, the industry just wants to make Doom and COD clones, and flood the market with the same shit over and over because it's proven to make money. 

But what they don't realize is if they had spent time to make a good dinosaur game, and advertised it correctly, they could make profit easily. Instead you get garbage like the last two Turoks. They would rather go for the easy dollar. Than the, what I like to call, "Fallout 3" dollar, where they actually spend time making a very good game, and the return is phenomenal. 

The gaming industry is just like an other industry. They prefer quick profits than a product that users will cherish for a long time. Milking a dead horse!!!  Milking and beating it! Beating it gets you milk, in my experience. Isn't that how we get glue? Third person stealth survival game set in the prehistoric world. Hide and sneak around in the world to avoid the massive deadly predators that stalk you. Urine collected from dead corpses could be used to frighten away or attract dinosaurs. Have realistic ecosystems and working predator prey relationships instead of just randomly spawning dinosaurs, with each dinosaur type having migration cycles, mating cycles and hunting cycles along with patches of territory.The player should start with modern weapons and ammo, but slowly run out and be forced to go stealthy, using traps and makeshift weapons to outsmart the larger but stupider dinosaurs. Realistic AI behaviour with enemies that stalk you silently would also be great. Seriously, someone make this game. You just wanted to use the word 'urine' in a serious comment. Urine a pretty serious thread right now, you could probably get away with it. Heh Dinosaurs in a modern world are cool but I would prefer being a prehistoric man. Doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense since they are separated by millions of years.


Imagine being a caveman and having to find T-rex pee to make a medicine for your sick cave woman or assembling a hunting group, sharpening spears and arrows and tracking dinos through the jungle.


I just want to be a caveman. caveman version of the sims would be ill Turok is about as close as you will get There's actually a game I've been following on Steam that is basically this.  It's slated for release later this year, and looks pretty well made from all I can tell.  Called the Stomping Land

http://store.steampowered.com/app/263440/

Edit: Apparently this game is dead.  I am saddened. You're right, but there is a difference between making a good sequel and a cash in sequel/ripoff, and a good sequel can make financial sense due to the lessened risk factor.  You're preaching to the choir, but to be fair, the company is just doing what's safe. 

Makes sense from a risk perspective but tends to create more boring/bland products.  I read the executives voice as Paul Rosenberg  As the Pawn Stars are infamous for saying "we're not in the business of collecting antiques, we're in the business of making money" you could say that about most video game executives.  

I wont say it's completely the executive's fault, as the industry somewhat evolved with sequels being "a similar styled game with better graphics" from the start.  We especially see this in Nintendo's evolution as major graphics and capabilities evolved, it was natural to keep the same characters and expand on previous titles.  

Unfortunately, our capabilities in the past 10 years haven't drastically changed.  COD II came out roughly 10 years ago.  The mechanics are improved, but it's just not a comparison when 10 years previously, DOOM was the top FPS of the day.  They're completely different games yet COD, whatever number it's on, hasn't changed much.   Every game released does get slightly better, but it's like they're making a statue, and every year, releasing the new version.  The first years saw the biggest improvement, from a hunk of clay to a slightly defined body to wel defined limbs etc.  Nowadays, they're getting in details lke those odd little red bumps  you get with dry skin, for example... it really doesn't add to much to the statue, and I wouldn't pay for a new one. 

Another point to make is people, in general, go with what they know makes sense and what they can make up.  Minecraft has been a wonderful thing to the gaming industry, but many gather/crafting games rely on the similar mechanics and even the same tools.  These are not done by big corporations, but by individuals.  They're not doing it to copy and make money, but instead they're focus is on other gameplay elements, Starbound comes to mind here... where there are so many "copies" of minecraft mechanics however it's mostly because when building a gather/crafting game base build, minecraft is a great place to start researching how to build a good game.

Unfortunately, we don't have too many like Chris Roberts for example.  Many people have the drive to create a new feel of game.  Many have business sense of how to run a small company.  Not many have both and also powerful enough leader skills to do everything that's required to manage a business, manage the creative teams to do things the unproven and hard way, and on top of that, make a game that's fun.  Robert's is quite unique in this since he's been an indie developer before there even was the name "indie developer".  He went into the big developement and did AAA management, and saw the problems with it from investors.  He even had a great failure when he went into studio production, and has seemed to learn from it.  A critical component to any one person's development is failing at something, then learning from it unironically.  I think he's done that.. at least I hope.

Thanks for reading if you have, I'm sure your inbox is exploded.  However if you ever make a game and throw it on kickstarter, PM me, you got at least 25 bucks from me or more if I'm having a good month


 I won't argue with anything but the idea of not buying the next Zelda. It's basically Skyrim "2015". What happened to stomping land and that other dinosaur sandbox game on steam? Zombie dinosaurs. So Dino Crisis? I like your phrase "Fallout 3" dollar With the upcoming jurassic park movie, don't you think there's an opening? There was a game. "The Stomping Land"

Until the Developer decided to go MIA after putting it on steam is Early Access. At least we're getting Lego Jurrasic World eventually. This is amazing! 

Just giving another point of information - check out the game Trespasser. It was the first JP open world game. VERY BASIC by today's standards, but was still a blast when it came out. It would be a good reference point for if you needed to design a level. 

Here's a youtube video on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW-7uatehx4
 [There's a guy making a remake of Tresspasser called Tresspassing.](http://trespassingpetrolia.com/) that's how this started,as a unity remake of Trespasser.Unity engine just couldn't handle the kind of scale/vegetation I was going for though it was so laggy so switched and started on this. Tresspassaur Our hero's arms seem to be made of putty. Dude. Yes.

Maybe post on /r/JurassicPark I already did. I am subbed there. And I post there often, too.

I posted this earlier, about why Jurassic Park 3 was not as good as the first two: http://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/2v899s/why_jurassic_park_iii_was_not_well_recieved/ Hey man, Fallout: New Vegas was great! :( It was rushed though. From what I've gathered at least a third of the game was scrapped to fit the release date set by Bethesda. There was originally going to be romance options, a more fleshed out Caesars legion quest line, continuation after the main story, a serial killer quest and a bunch more I think. I wouldnt ever judge a game by what it was 'supposed to be'. I hadnt heard about it being rushed before reading your comment, and I can tell you its one of the best games ive played despite that. Anything else that may have been added given more time would only have made it better.  I'm going to admit that you wrote a strong post about JP3 and that it is the lesser movie of the trilogy. However you completely missed the fact that it featured a god damn  3D printer.... [You can buy a 3D printed replica of the resonator on ShapeWays.] (http://www.shapeways.com/product/BJEZF7R87/jp3-velociraptor-resonating-chamber-replica) Holy. Shit. There is a 3d printer in JP3. I haven't seen it for many years, but I never realized that the machine he pulls the Raptor resonating chamber was a 3d printer.  3d printers were invented in the 80s.  I hate to rain on parades, but you realize you can't actually sell this game right? That said, you should uh... send me an email, and we should uh... work on that project I was telling you about... you know... the one with the angry frogs.... Is this that science-based 100% dragon MMO I've heard so much about? I hope he doesn't try to promo the game by borrowing someone's Jeep.   I'm out of the loop, what MMO? http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p1ssv/dear_internet_im_a_26_year_old_lady_whos_been/

**tl;dr**

Lady says "I made a game!"

Reddit says "No you didn't.  You made pictures"

She made pictures.

And a [website](http://www.dragonsbloodonline.com/) that's been "Coming soon" since 2012.  Apparently she is on Valve/Riot time.

[You'd think there'd be more info here, but you'd be wrong](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1ks6iu/100_science_based_dragon_mmo/)


I've been on reddit for too long. Was she trying to get funding or something?  Not really, this was before Kickstarter was really a thing.  It ended up being a joke because she came across that guy who goes 

&gt;I have a great idea for an app!  All I need is someone who can do code, someone who can do graphics, someone to handle the marketing, and someone to do legal!  I can't do any of that, I'm the "idea guy!"

 You forgot to add the:

&gt;We can't pay you now, but we'll give you a cut of the profits

Been through that bullshit too many times.. 

Time is money, fool. Now all I can imagine is a Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis type game with graphics like this.

I want it. Came here to post this. This. This. Please, mother of all that is right. Please make another, updated Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis type game (that's not Jurassic Park Builder) on PC. Hell, I'd settle with graphics much less than this but with an improved roster of dinosaurs.  Still have that game on disc along with Galactic Battlegrounds.  Only two physical PC games I have.   This is a great resume. Portfolio* churro* quesadilla? Will I be able to hold a shotgun in one hand while looking at my chest to see my health-boobies? whilst also using oculus rift? http://imgur.com/cEPeMUH Oh no no no I am not subjecting myself to my chased-by-velociraptors nightmares in 3D 1080p. Wait... Oculus is 1080p?! Oh shit, I don't think I could handle it either.  Appearently they are working on a 1440p version now as well. They better be. That kind of screen covering your entire field of view mere inches from your face needs that sort of resolution. I tried an earlier version of the oculus and it was...pretty low res but still very cool. What game is that? Jurassic Park: Tresspasser.

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7F4BD2BC40CB27D) a good LP of it by a guy that knows the game and a bit of it's history pretty darn well. Trespasser. I would love a Jurassic Park game that has similar gameplay to Alien: Isolation. One can only hope. Oh my god I'm just imagining the kitchen scene from the original film but with the isolation gameplay. I want that so badly  Yes!!! Someone posted this project here before a few months ago,so I just added some newer pictures to the album.There's also a bunch of videos for anyone interested,links at bottom of gallery album.

 Appreciate the contribution! I'll ask what we're all thinking...who is conceptcrash? Did he make the game or did OP? Thank you, I'm pretty confused Yesterday a guy posts a shitty render of a shitty bedroom in max, gets front page. 

This guy posts fucking awesome Jurassic Park shit a day later, SHOW EM HOW IT'S DONE ! Mother of God, please continue and release this game.  I imagine OP will get a cease and desist before you ever have the opportunity to download it. Please, oh please include Oculus support -&gt; Would be amazing! tried,I even bought a rift!.It turned out wasn't possible though,unsupported engine and tried post conversion also but no luck.I was genuinely gutted about it. Scrolling through all I could hear was Goldblum's voice saying "you do plan to have actual *dinosaurs* in your dinosaur park, right?"

Then suddenly, a raptor appeared! Not to be a Debbie downer but do you have the rights to release this. I'd love to see this come to fruition even if it's just us walking around but I see that your listed on indiedb which makes me think you don't have the rights. no I don't,I'm not profiting from it and not making a full game.Since Jurassic life has been around 7 years ,origins (a fan film) has been around 3 and even mines over a year old now I don't see it being a problem. While you'll probably be okay, in this instance making money has nothing to do with it. In these situations a company will issue a cease and desist request solely on the basis that you're unlawfully using their copyrighted material. That will obviously give you a chance to cease and desist without getting sued, but you'd probably be better off not stamping their logo all over the game and name as they could very easily view it as something  trademark dilution. I have only lightly researched this but I can tell you for certain that you not making money won't protect you.   so you made this? do you have a team Just me working on it for fun whenever I can,another project called crynosaurs gave me the raptor/Ai to use though. Get permission in writing. Universal are making the new movie, and seeing this might freak them out and send you a cease and desist. I know you've clearly put the time in, but cover yourself by asking their permission. It looks like you spared no expense, nice work man! Looks stellar.  I am really impressed.  This is really well done.

I've had "Learn CryEngine" on my bucket list for a while.  Is the learning curve as hard as people say, especially for someone with no programming or art background but with a creative mind? I would honestly say don't bother,learn Unreal (and learn Unity for a week).Cryengine is really flawed,lacks support and I've had issues with even the smallest things like making doors open with a basic switch,I regret not picking up Unreal as it's also good industry standard to learn. Kinda. Map design is easy as using MS Paint once you get the hang of it. A fair bit of game "programming" can be done using the flowgraph system (which has a moderate learning curve). However, it's recommended you know C++ and LUA before getting into any serious CryEngine work.

EDIT (after reading the replied comments):

CryEngine is still very good. Its real time lighting system + post processing is ahead of anything else on the market (though UE4 is catching up).

I agree that CryEngine is more complex that UE4 or Unity though, and it's suggested you have prior game dev experience before working with it

EDIT2:
This might help: http://blog.digitaltutors.com/unity-udk-cryengine-game-engine-choose/

 Here's a crazy game idea: Make the island, and script everything that happened in the movie(s) to happen in real time.  Like, have the whole island fleshed out Skyrim-style, with a T-rex pad, roaming veg-o-saurs, etc....

Then have the characters from the movie as NPC's go through the motions of the movie, including the helicopter ride in, then the tour, then the jeep ride, the 'oh shit moments', up to the escape via helicopter. 

The player is a mute observer (perhaps a scientist ala Gordon Freeman) that can choose to follow the NPC's or just go explore the island while the Grants are elbow-deep in dino shit. Imagine climbing a tree to take in the dino-vista when you see the whole island go dark, and hear a t-rex breaking through his fence.  Now you have to survive and find a way off the island.  Or you can just kick back, crack open a beer and watch some white folks get eaten before embracing your own inevitable fate.  

Maybe even make it so you can interact with switches &amp; kick off the dino-apocalypse yourself! Or maybe complete the mission of Newman, and get off the island early? 

As for escape, script in every known and plausible escape vehicle, like Newman's secret ride, the big (early) evacuation boat for staff, and the final helicopter with the Grants as a 'last chance' ride.  The player would be welcome on every ride, but it's not going to wait for them, so if you take too long getting from A to B, you're waiting until the sequel for another chance.  

It would be a fundamentally different survival game than anything out there today.  You're not the protaganist, or antagonist, you're just a guy having a really shit day at work who wants to get the fuck off the island.  The world doesn't revolve around you, hell, it doesn't even wait for you.  If you flip the power back on and save some kids because the guy that was supposed to do that lost a fist fight with a raptor, nobody's going to thank you or even know your name. They'll still just leave you behind if you're not at the chopper on time. 

Make that, and I'll play it.  you aint too far off what I was thinking,I originally wanted the 1st mission to be finding the labs and recovering the dino dna,getting into the visitor center and discovering the labs had burnt down.At that point you would have to find the Cryocan and when you left the visitor center the electric cars would pull up and you could get in and this section would literally be on the rails/tour.The car doors would lock (in a nod to hammond mentioning it in the movie) and it would come to a stop outside the trex enclosure due to the crashed vehicle..and then the trex would step out again all over!.

The reason I didn't/haven't done this is..by the time I build the tour route I will have to build it all anyway and pre-animated dinos are still really complex. Why even make it a mission? Then you have to program triggers &amp; shit.  Make the whole island a ride that you're on and doesn't stop regardless of your input or not.  

Having no scripted mission but scripted NPC's would allow for some crazy (and easy to design) emergent gameplay and great replay-ability.  I imagine the first play-through a player would be chilling in the dino museum before shit gets real, and would freak out and die to a raptor.  The second play-through they'd follow the grants, and get the 'movie' experience, the third follow Sam Jackson's character and watch shit get real from security cameras.  From there players would just start really exploring and testing the limits of the game. 

By creating scripted missions, you're kinda forcing the player to ride YOUR ride, and not create their own experience. Since Jurassic Park is an island, you have a unique opportunity to create a manageable yet interesting world unlike other.  Jurassic Park is supposed to be a theme park, so build the player a park, not a ride.  He spared no expense. Maybe you'll finally show us how exactly a cliff fits right next to the T-Rex paddock. Yes, I've seen the drawings trying to explain it and I'm not convinced. Usually these explanations involve a kind of cliff-corner but the movie only ever shows us a straight cliff. you're right,the drawings don't work in 3d!,early on I built the paddock but scrapped it as it was miles away from the main area and I didn't think I would ever be able to fill the gap in-between. This is a sign that the world is ready for a triple-A Jurassic Park game. The closest we have to this is a new Jurassic World Lego Video Game.... My biggest complaint here is that you have plants in the building that are poisonous; you picked them because they look good. But these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're in, and they'll defend themselves, violently if necessary.

What I'm saying, is that you were so preoccupied with whether or not you could that you didn't stop to think if you should! Anyone remember the Jurassic Park game on the Nintendo 64?  I always remember wanting to kill myself because I could never find the batteries for the night vision. Plug in a derivative of the Xenomorph's AI in Alien: Isolation, but make the raptors somewhat killable and you've got yourself a proper sandbox-survival. Please quit your day job and work exclusively on this. Start a Kickstarter, I would definitely contribute. Eleven year-old me just pissed his Jurassic Park pajama bottoms. /r/jurassicparkaftermath Do you have any plans on distributing this? I know you can't sell it because of copyrights an such. Wow, that looks great! I can really tell that you've spared no expense! This could be great. Like Alien: Isolation great. About how many seconds per frame would this get on typical modern hardware?  I've been watching that carefully,I'm running at around 50fps in the most model dense area (the visitor center) and up to 60-70fps out in the jungle areas. Specs? Crysis 2 or download Crynosaurs demo on ModDb  He meant PC specs, lol. I know,if he can run specs of either of those he can run this.Man can google that shit himself..bloody "specs?" lol How should he be able to Google the specs of your PC?
It's kind of odd, that you just won't tell him :P He wasn't asking my PC specs he wanted to know what it needed to run,google Crysis 2 specs or even just cryengine 3 specs tells you that Holy fuck. Please make this playable with the Oculus Rift AMAZING!!!! Please for the love of all holy finish this and let me play!!!! :) Sorry is someone's asked this, but I can't find it: How exactly have you been working on this, cuz it looks great! started well over a year ago and did 3 weeks,then didn't touch it for like 6 months.I now work on it randomly whenever I get a few days off,so in total maybe 3 months work.

 This looks awesome man! Are the models/textures all yours? everything but the vegetation Nice, looks great.

If you don't mind me saying, I think you should up the polycount on those cars if you can, you can see the polys around the tires. But otherwise this is really really awesome! you're right,I think they were the first thing I built..that or the visitor center which I since re-worked on.I was being overly cautious coming from Unity with framerate issues..and I'm not a huge fan of modelling cars to be honest Jurassic Park game with Alien Isolation gameplay. pls industry. I'd love to explore this world with an Oculus Rift, especially with the emphasis on exploration. Are you going to make it Rift compatible? I've tried an it wasn't possible in cryengine version,I bought a rift pretty much just to do it. Ah that's a shame. I know Oculus has released some updates for various engines for integration, but I guess not cryengine yet. Imagine this on cry engine, my god It's CryEngine2 with some improved shaders from the modding community, it seems.  You know what would be badass? Take the SNES missions and put them in this game. You know, go around the park finding ID cards, collecting eggs, using terminals to open certain parts of the park. I actually considered adding this to the elevator outside the bar lol,but got something else there - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoxIFOoEBn0 Umm... Why are you using two different usernames in this thread? I'm not,I posted this to dinosaurs thread and someone there posted it here. Ah. Gotcha. just noticed: http://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/2v90vt/jurassic_park_aftermath/cofm22b I wish they would just reboot turok I second this. So can a studio buy this project and make a game of it please? That is why I posted this here. Maybe a company will be smart and buy this game. 

I just hope they don't have a game based on Jurassic World, like Disney does with all it's crap. The Jurassic Park Lego game is coming out, though, and I have high hopes for it. Fingers crossed This is awesome! Great work! On this note... The world needs a next Gen Turok: Dinosaur Hunter This is cool and all, but when the hell are we going to get a new JP:OG? Bonus points if you manage work in "Touch the fence for a free life" and "Raptors will not attack unless you shoot them"

edit: It's from the SNES game if you're wondering "One man project" - Still looks better than some full releases. That's awesome! 

My dad loves to play flight simulator. The only thing that drives me nuts, is how he plays it.

He sets up a long flight, knowing that it is going to take about 5 hours. He will then proceed to take off from the runway, get to the elevation he desires, and then set the autopilot and leave. Come back 4 hours and 55 minutes later, land the plane, and then shut the game off. 

He gets a lot of enjoyment out of it, so good for him. But it drives me crazy. [deleted] He better have a kick-ass surround sound system to blast Kenny Loggins through or else he is doing it wrong. We set the hard deck at 10,000 feet....you knew it, you broke it, and broke a major rule of engagement. 

Edit: added a comma  Sir, I had him in my sights.  He saw me move in for the kill.  He proceeded below the hard-deck.  We were below for just a few seconds.  I had the shot.  There was no danger, so I took it. You took it...AND BROKE A MAJOR RULE OF ENGAGEMENT. Then you broke another one with that "circus-stunt" flyby.... Negative Ghost Rider, the pattern is full.  I WANT SOME BUTTS! You took it, and broke a major rule of engagement! Then you broke another one with that circus stunt fly-by. Top Gun rules of engagement exist for your safety and for that of your team. They're not flexible, nor am I. Obey them or you're history. Is that clear? YES SIR!

*Goose sweats and gibbers softly to my left* Then you ride off on a motorcycle to bang a hot chick who turned out to be a lesbian and it screwed with your psyche  so much that you end up joining a cult and go completely bonkers. Cold, ICE cold.  Ice, man... I am dangerous. *bite gesture* I am not an avid pretend pilot, but I used to fly it occasionally. I once bought one of those "beers of the world" 12 packs and proceeded to set up a flight every day to the country whose beer I was to drink that day, and would take off and engage autopilot so once arrived my aircraft would just circle the destination til I got home and could land it. Then each day I drank the beer. Pretty dumb but whatever lol.  That actually sounds awesome  It also sounds borderline insane but I applaud his dedication. Possibly. I was an aircraft mechanic at the time though so I would geek out from time to time. Never apologize for nerdiness. It rocks. I am currently pooping BTW. I used to do that back in secondary school!

After I visited Florida, I set up a route in FSX that almost exactly mimicked it (I think it was EGKK to SFB) using the same plane and runway.

Then I left it running while I went to school, came back, and crashed it. &gt;crashed it

Fucking OOM. That took a turn Yes. Into the ground. Scale model of A-10 Warthog - $15.00

Paint and glue - $9.00

Time to assemble, paint, decal, detail - 7 hours

Firecracker - $0.15

&amp;nbsp;

Seeing it explode into a million shards - PRICELESS
 As a kid I super glued a rocket engine to a model ford explorer. I glued it at a slight angle with the idea it would thurst it down a bit as it rocketed forward.

It went maybe 10ft forward then did a front flip and went up into the air spinning in circles what seemed like 40+ times. This was pre good camera days (12-13 years ago) but I am so tempted to try and replicate it just for the fun of it. On a related note I think the Estes corporation, supplier of clear payload tubes to backyard rocketry programs, should commission a monument to those brave lizard pioneers who might otherwise be forgotten. Get a rocket engine or two, wire up a system to fire both rockets simultaneously, count down, enjoy. Igniting  those things simultaneously is basically impossible  they are bastards "I don't care if you're in an airplane. [**THAT SHIT DON'T FLY!**"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgNKDS5-nk) That's what they said about my sleigh for a few hundred years! HO HO HO! $1.35 /u/changetip This is...

[Unless you are such a good pilot as to manipulate g-forces so that only the ones looking out the window will know something is amiss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMWxuKcD6vE) There are old pilots, and there are bold pilots, but there are no old and bold pilots... Except for Bob Hoover, fucking legend. From the looks of that pit I would guess your uncle plays combat sims  like DCS, which makes me wonder why he is against barrel-rolls. "Heat seeker spamming noob. 1v1 me guns only no radar." 

Basically my battlefield career.  Y'all mother fuckers need War Thunder. Wouldn't be the case with DCS. You take every real-world edge you can get. Gun fights can be fun though, especially with functional headtracking :) You don't want to over G the plane, maintenance crews going to be pissed!  I made the mistake once of playing NASCAR 98 at 100% race length on Bristol. By the time I was done 5 1/2 hours had passed and I wanted to throw my racing wheel out the window. 24 hours of Lemans in GT5, before the save race feature was patched into it... oh god.

my friend and i did that once. we got i think 8 hours in and his little brother wanted to play. fine, whatever. we had a huge lead, even if he sucked we could still win no problem.

we go on the computer for a bit, we hear him crash. he's like 'oh no!' and before we can tell him its fine just go to the pit stop, he RESTARTS THE RACE.

didnt even want to play anymore. didnt touch gt5 for like 6 weeks. Never ever let little brothers play. All they do is fuck things up or delete your save file. Or get your account permabanned on your favourite server. Had it happen, never letting him on my games ever again. Man when I was younger (like 15 maybe? Probably younger) my little sister (11 or younger... Probably younger) begged me to play Sims 2. Under order of my mom I let her play under my supervision. I told my mom that she shouldn't be allowed on her own because it had sex and death. My mom let her play while I was at school, and low and behold her Sims had sex, then starved to death. My mom banned us from playing Sims again, and sent to disks to my sister who wanted it, which obviously didn't work because I already registered the CD key. 

I'm still kinda upset about that.  This makes me upset for you all my sister did was build enorumous houses, create perfect families, then play them for half an hour and start another house. She's now into architecture, go figure.

Meanwhile I had 4 generations of random Sims in prebuild houses. And if a kid was born with facepaint on, it did stay on until they grew out of it Story? During the days of battlefield 2 I was on my favourite server (can't remember the name) and I was asked to do some chores. My little brother also asked if he could play while I was gone, to which I thought it was fine. What I didn't realise is that he has no idea how to identify who is friend and foe. And friendly fire was on.

When I got back, I only played for a few minutes until I was banned. I appealed on the forums but needless to say the admins weren't too fond of giving me another chance.

Never let people play on your computer. Admin: "Listen supersaintz77, you were a good soldier, but I watched you murder in cold blood our own men on the deck of our own aircraft carrier. Again and again, for the entirety of 1500 tickets." Me and my younger brother tag-teamed the 12 hours of Le Mans, it was awesome. can confirm; deleted older sister's pokemon save file with a level 86 Feraligatr when I was 6(by accident). Still haven't been forgiven and shouldn't. Dreamcast version of Test Drive LeMans had a 24 hour mode and no save.

Me and a group of friends did a 3 driver rotation and made it about 14 hours before we gave up. How do you make it to 14 and give up? I'd understand 6, but 14? You were more than half way there.  Because you still have another 600 minutes of misery to go? I'd rather just get it over with by then. What kind of shifts were you doing? With 3 people it shouldn't have been too bad as long as you weren't doing ridiculously short or long "shifts". (No pun intended) I'm not OP. But even so. 24 hours of going round the same dull circuit. Fuck that Sunk Cost Fallacy right here....

Quoting wikipedia 'Sunk costs should not affect the rational decision-maker's best choice'

Being, the 14 hours already invested cannot be reclaimed, so they should not be taken into account in deciding on future actions. What stood ahead was still 10 hours of playing the game, the decision to do so should be made without taking the previous 14 into account. 10 hours of playing a game when tired is a pretty good reason to stop playing. Okay get ready... now turn left...

Have an upvote from a fellow iRacer. 
Not touching Daytona by a long shot, I'm still in the mx5 lol What position did you come in?  Well if it took a whole 5 1/2 hours, I'd assume he was pretty far back It took 5 1/2 hours because I was 10 and crashed a bunch of other cars. Those cautions take up a lot of time. I finished in 1st. Fucking cautions.  At least Bristol is short. I did that once, at Bristol too. Got so frustrating and stressful when my car was basically being held together with scotch tape and twist ties.  I managed to win only because everyone else was worse off. Fuck, I love Nascar 98. He sounds like the kind of guy who doesn't use warp in Kerbal Space Program. Haha.  Just have a dedicated computer and let it sit for a couple months on an interplanetary trip. And then discover you put the landing legs on the wrong way http://i.imgur.com/TIucxCY.gifv Space is really big.... My friend says his friend who flies for an airline pretty much gets it in the air, sets the autopilot then drinks a coffee and reads the newspaper for a few hours.   So this sounds pretty much par for the course.

edit : For fun, you could always quietly edit the settings of the sim your dad plays and increase the chance of a major failure happening.   I remember playing a sim one time where you could change settings to pretty much guarantee an engine would die or some other massive failure would occur. It's realistic, but seems kinda pointless from a "video games as entertainment" perspective. It's like being a cop in a video game but spending a lot of time doing paperwork. Well there are people who play Games like Euro Truck simulator. At least there no autopilot in Euro Truck :p At least with that you actually have to be involved the whole time. Maybe you're just driving on a highway for 40 minutes, but you still have to drive the truck. With the flight sim it seems to kind of defeat the purpose to actually playing the game when it can keep playing without you.  I used to play online with my buddy on FSX, we would set on autopilot and just talk about life. Eventually whichever of us that was copilot at the time would get the map and we would start preparing for descending, landing, etc. Usually one takes off and flies, the other one lands, vice versa. Was a great way of spending time with him, specially because we now live in very far places. He's one of those friends that doesn't matter how long it is that we don't talk, it feels like we never got out of touch. And he's probably the only person I know that is like that. Good memories.

What was I trying to say again? Oh... so yeah, even if you don't "play" the game for 80% of the flight, it doesn't mean you don't enjoy. I mean, you had to set the whole plane up before take off, and set all the autopilot and etc. So not having to do anything for whatever the time of the flight is, only means that you did all the prepping correctly... and all the preparation and details are what simmers get off on, in my opinion! That's the best fucking thing I've heard all day.did you use flight sticks?I really want to do this.

 Judging by the kind of [joystick](http://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-Hotas-Warthog-Joystick-2960720/dp/B00371R8P4) and general setup this guy's got, I don't think he's playing Flight Simulator. Probably DCS or BMS.  Yep.  Shameless plug for /r/hoggit  I don't think I've ever played a game that I could walk away from for 3 hours and it would play itself, so I'd tend to agree. I would play this paperwork game, friend You would love "Papers, Please" Best dystopian paper pusher simulator ever made. And given the competition, that's definitely saying something. My friend flies a private plane used by a Governor and also a Fox News reporter, he spends most time in the air watching movies on his ipad. "...used by a Governor and also a Fox News reporter..."

I'd love to hear more about this relationship.  I don't have my friend's permission to say anything more specific about who they are but I will say that the Gov (a democrat) and the Fox News reporter (actually, an anchor) are personal friends..... weird, I know, I know - the Fox News anchor owns the plane and "loans" it to the Gov. Could see that getting real ***interesting***, really quick... *cough* *cough* Former governor of Virgina knows all about "gifted" plane rides. *cough* *cough* Those people use it at different times, dingus.  &gt;I don't have my friend's permission to say anything more specific about who they are but I will say that the Gov (a democrat) and the Fox News reporter (actually, an anchor) are personal friends..... weird, I know, I know - the Fox News anchor owns the plane and "loans" it to the Gov.

------------------------

Not saying there ***IS*** something questionable going on here... but I do specifically remember the former governor of Virginia being indited over "gifts" which happen to include the use of a private jet. They don't have to be on the jet at the same time for it to be *questionable*.  &gt;He will then proceed to take off from the runway, get to the elevation he desires, and then set the autopilot and leave. Come back 4 hours and 55 minutes later, land the plane, and then shut the game off.

Funny thing, aside from the not leaving part (well except from the random piss) flying the real things isn't much different. Between takeoff and landing there's not much to do other than change ATC frequencies. I kill time looking out the window while most guys I fly with will listen to AM radio stations, watch movies on their ipads, play games, read a book, and occasionally (gasp) nap. 

Also, I see enough $$ worth in equipment for this person to get a REAL pilot's license, at the very least a sport pilot license.

Can confirm, am former flightsim nerd/flight instructor turned airline pilot There's $10,000+ worth of equipment there?  I'm probably going a bit on the high side, but $5k seems about right from what I just see in the pic.

Depending on where you go to get your training done, $5k isn't completely out of the realm for getting your license, though admittedly hard to pull off realistically. $7k would be pretty average for a dedicated, proficient student. got my private in the last 8 months or so for ~$6k, fwiw. Do you ever turn the plane around for two hours or so and then fix it, so when he comes back to land the plane is still hours away? No sir, I do not. 

I ask that no one touch my games without my permission, and my father expects the same. 

That is his one game My father would get pissed if I played his Rome game. Better burn all these treaties before saving....  Declare war on all factions, give all money away, disband all units, save and quit. 

Then prepare to be killed by your father. Son, I am disappointed in you. Not for touching another persons game while he was on the toilet. But for not messing up a playing session better. *Shows the screen that he has completed the campaign successfully despite war against everyone, no money and no units.* Is [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/af/c5/d5/afc5d51a04c434fc9f442b85434ae843.jpg) your father? They actually kind of look alike, Except my dad has glasses, and his mustache is grey.

Dude, I've never made the connection before, but that may be my father This an exact description of how I used to spend my Saturdays playing Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 as a kid. 

I'm not alone!  When did he get divorced? When I was 5, so about 20 years ago. 

But he has since re-married Aww shucks, I feel mean now... I guess his current wife is more understanding of his hobby? :) I don't know how to do that face that the one guy from those gaming forums does. So just picture it in your head. That's what I would put in this comment.

Edit- _ calling /u/Warlizard

come in /u/Warlizard Here you go. &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232; Bist du der Mann von diesem Spiele-Forum? &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;--- Hey, Aren't you that guy from that gaming forum? 


No but seriously, thank you for that face. Np. :) Hey you're that face from the... Fuck it, I'm sure you're sick of our shit.  It was better than me. As a kid I would purposely crash into buildings. 

Then came 9/11 and I felt bad about myself as a person...  Who knows how many 1's and 0's I destroyed with my childish ways... I had just installed flight sim 98, I know,  a few years too late. Using the keyboard,  I would easily lose control of aircraft. On 9/12, I woke up eager to play my flight sim. My mother came in to say good morning and distracted me, causing me to lose control of the aircraft. My mother begged me to correct the controls and save the aircraft. I tried my hardest to regain control. My mother became hysterical as I plummeted towards the ground. She was in tears.  Wow that escalated quickly
.
.
Or should I say "de-escalated"  (   ) I think your dad and OP's uncle are just waiting for the day when the pilot and copilot of an actual flight spontaneously die and the stewardess makes that one desperate plea with the passengers,"We have a grim situation folks, does anyone know how to fly a plane?" He's grinding for Air Miles. Pilot here... they are just training for the real world ;) By the looks of it this guy is playing DC A- 10...leaving it is how you die quickly lol Loooots of people do that.  But then, you don't really have a lot of other options.

In X-Plane, you can either artificially increase your air speed in 2x increments - but this is highly unrealistic, and doesn't simulate anything else like fuel usage or drag or drift or changing wind speeds, etc...

...OR, you can increase simulation rate in 2x increments - But each step requires 20fps available rendering speed.  This means to get 3x simulation rate, you would need to be rendering at 60fps at 1x speed.  Increasing simulation rate properly simulates everything, but it requires an incredibly powerful computer to get it to any significant rate.  My computer can only go up to 1.2x speed.  

So those are your only options.  Either fly short routes, fly long routes with the simulator unattended for a few hours, fly with unrealistic time dilation, or get an expensive computer to fly with realistic time dilation.   That's sweet.  My grandfather used to be a pilot and he wants to fly, but he is barely mobile now.  I've been thinking about building him a flight sim so he can fly. I seem to remember some post where a guy brought his rig to a rest home and did just this. One of the guys was a retired WWII pilot and he pulled up the plane that he had to let him fly it again.

In my head I can imagine it looking cool, but I don't know how that would actually work out in actuality. I believe they are. The vision is actually projected on surfaces just in front of the simulator, and the windows are just glass. Which would give you a slight feeling of real 3d. Or get a 4k projector capable of projecting onto a curved surface outside the windows. No bezels and no visible edges! This is the coolest thing I've ever seen related to video games. Holy shit. How much is this shit? Ok seriously, at that point why not just become a damn pilot?  Probably because he has a non-piloting job. And that's the closest most people will get to flying a 737. It's ~~a couple~~ tens of thousands, but a 737 is $51.5-$87 million.

 this is the sort of thing people don't understand about the appeal of sims... especially driving sims... like, my entire computer plus wheel/pedals/shifter/e-brake is only maybe $1400 before monitors/rift or anything else special. But I can't drive F1 cars in my free time otherwise...  The thing that most interests me is what software is used and how much detail there is in it.

Does anyone have any clue?  [deleted] I was going to say I'd be surprised if this uncle doesn't already hang out at /r/hoggit. He's definitely built something like an A-10C cockpit there (especially with those fire extinguisher handles), and I'm pretty sure that's the Thrustmaster Warthog stick/throttle. I agree. That's for sure a thrust master warthog HOTAS at the very least. It must be an uncle thing because mine has set up like this but for pc racing and driving sims. My cousin says he even uses different steering wheels depending on what car he is using. I'll have to get a picture of it next time I visit.  It must be... My uncle always wanted to be a dancer and so he got the kinect version of Just Dance. He's been living the dream ever since. ULTRA PRO: Note the ejection handles. And he has a hole in the ceiling for emergencies

 ["Take that, mom! Take that, dad! Send me to a psychiatrist will you!?"](http://youtu.be/E5Hrvza9FkM) Im starting marketing for a firm next week who makes Flight Simulators with a dome screen rather than having 3 flat screens there website doesnt really show what they can do very well.

http://www.immersivedisplay.co.uk/

This video shows what i mean by dome.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLeJ4KmDwGA#t=64 Your company must be scared shitless of the oculus rift Oculus rift while it has the immersive factor doesn't take into account having to push all the buttons required to fly the higher detailed aircraft which is the main concern in the flight sim community. That's actually a pretty reasonable point. "open up the view to see more on Halo"

yea, good luck with that, the FOV is fixed, duh. I feel like if you're wanting a true realistic flight sim, a curved screen is gonna complete the illusion more than an oculus. Having the camera that close to you doesn't simulate the cockpit quite as well as having all your controls in front of you and being able to physically control them.

Edit: Thanks to people clarifying. Since we can't track our hands in virtual space, the oculus is not going to be the go to choice for those wanting the most realistic simulation.  For more casual users, I agree an oculus would do wonders for immersion, but any more controls then a flight stick and keyboard would just be a pain to control without direct sight.  I mentioned that to the director when i had my initial meeting with them, but he wasn't.  He did go in to detail why but my memories terrible.  Which is why I'm interviewing him next week about why the dome is more Immersive and better than Oculus and flat screens.

They sell jet fighter simulators to 3rd world countries that can't afford the high tech top of the range ones that US and UK would use.

When I'm in there next week Ill get videos of there toys as they have some really cool stuff but haven't promoted themselves very well so far. What does he think is the best flight simulator software? You can't go wrong with DCS!  Your Uncle isn't just practicing takeoffs by any chance is he? allahu akbar!!  From the thumbnail, I was hoping this was a Delorian shell and he was flying a hovercar :(  Couldn't help but notice the lack of cup holders... unless I'm just missing them. otherwise pretty sweet [r/hoggit](http://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit) As a guy who's lucky enough to fly planes with cockpits like that in real life...

That's totally freakin' awesome and I want it. Does he take it seriously enough that one should not pull those yellow pullbars? So did that Malaysia Airlines pilot... Sorry I just can't find that reference... A lot of professional pilots have simulators like this at their homes, for practice. The pilot of the Malaysian flight that went missing was one of them. *whoosh* More of a splash, really.  Sploosh Mastrurbate. "*If a plane hits the ocean and no one is around, does it still make a splishy splashy sound?*"
 No. Clearly anyone who has a simulator in their home is planning a terrorist attack. That's what CNN has been saying! /s Woosh. [Whoosh](http://i.imgur.com/fMTvqDI.gif) ... Oh wow. So, I guess the flight simulator thing was just news hype then. Seriously, fuck 24-hour news. Neither can CNN Which one? This guys flight simulator is insane: http://www.hyway.com.au/747/747.php this guy can build a big ol flight simulator down to the tiniest buttons but can't figure out that you can't put blue text on a green background?1 The passengers of "Snakes on a Plane" would be proud of him. At that point shouldn't you just start taking piloting lessons? He probably doesn't have 10 times the amount of money it would take to do that. Plus the FAA doesn't take kindly to you dropping JDAMS on things. Well a real full functionality sim costs anywhere between 10k-15k if done correctly.

Source: Im in the process of building one now.  That's about the same price as getting a private pilots license in Canada. Average cost is around 10K to get a private pilots license.  Throw in another 7-8K to get instrument rated.  Then figure 120+ per flight hour.  The sim is hella cheaper. Before you build this expensive setup. Aren't flight lessons $100/hr? It's a no-brainer.  To get your pilot's license can be around $10k.  Assuming this setup cost $1K (the HOTAS alone is $500, but I imagine if he made it himself he may have kept costs down), then yes it's 10% of the cost to get your own license.  But consider what that doesn't include:

1) A plane.  
2) The ability to fly anywhere, at any time, and impose whichever rules you want.  Sometimes I like using "real" ATC, sometimes I like ignoring all the flight rules and just relaxing in the air.  Sometimes I"ll fly a little loop around Boston, then go enjoy the sites in Dubai.  
3) Anything more than GA craft.  Looking at this setup it seems like he probably flies mostly fighters, which is a whole different ballgame, but I know a lot of people that enjoy flying jet liners.  To do that in real life would require an entire lifestyle change, not just some money. HOTAS = Hands on throttle and stick

Just saved you five minutes on Google Or more than five minutes if typed with an extra S. I see what you're saying, but nobody requires that you have to get your pilot's license. I'd take 10 real-life flight lessons over an (impressive) flight simulator setup any day of the week.  What's to say his uncle doesn't also have his pilot license? That HOTAS is store bought.  Yeah sorry, I mean the rest of the setup.  He's got a gamepad I see, and I don't know if  those switch panels were fabricated or not, but in general if the whole cockpit thing was made personally it may have been decently cheap. I don't understand how those HOTAS controllers cost so much, they have all the correct switches (for the most part) but they feel so cheap compared to the real stuff. Especially the auto act.  That specific HOTAS, the [Thrustmaster Warthog](http://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-Hotas-Warthog-Joystick-2960720/dp/B00371R8P4), is a metal-constructed replica of the flightstick and throttle of the A-10C "Warthog" fighter. It's ~$500, huge, heavy as hell, and damned accurate. It's accurate to the point that the stick doesn't have a yaw axis- if you want analog yaw you need to spring for pedals (just like a real jet). Usually, fixed rotation is the mark of a cheap stick like the [Logitech Attack 3.](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-963291-0403-Attack-3-Joystick/dp/B0000ALFC5)

You can get less accurate, but still great, USB HOTAS controllers for $50-200. The Warthog is the top of the line (in terms of what you can buy retail). By 'accurate' I mean compared to an actual jet, not in terms of motor input. You can get really fine control for under $100. We have a set at work for testing of stuff that goes on stuff. Can't really talk about it, if ya know what I mean. Anywho, it might be expensive and accurate, but you think they could make the buttons not so plasticy and weak.  Ah, I know what you mean. I hate that about the X-55 Warthog, too. I don't get it. Buttons shouldn't creak. Yep, and after a long day of working with the real stuff, your fingers should be hurting.  I love flying jetliners. PMDG makes fantastic payware addons of the 737 and 777. I have legitimately learned how to fly a 737/777 simply from using their software. I'm a private pilot IRL at the moment, but I eventually want to go commercial, so I find messing around with all of the systems that are modeled therapeutic. I'm pilot. I canfly You can definitely get your license cheaper than 10k depending on where you live. If you fly out of a smaller airport and get your 40 hours somewhat quickly and efficiently you can get from ground school to your check ride in 5k. You can pick up a 152 for 20k and drastically cut down on the price of your training too. Still way more expensive than a sim, but totally worth it in my mind. Consider what a flight sim doesn't include - flying. You are still sitting in front of your desk. I would gladly trade 100 hours of pretending to be jet pilot in front of computer for 1 hour to actually fly even shittiest GA machine. &gt;To get your pilot's license can be around $10k. 

That's a stretch, you can do it for well less than that*, but unless you get your sport pilot license, it wont be under $5k, and even then.

*in 'murricah assuming you dedicate yourself full time to it and go to a mom and pop flight school/indy CFI

 In 'murica, it 10k is a good estimate. Most places around me in Indiana is about 7k total when priced at 40 hours. When you add more towards the average of 70 hours, you'll hit about 10k. About the same pricing scheme here from what I've seen in Massachusetts.  It's probably all relative to local living costs. 100/hr lol. Maybe 20 years ago Hahah. Google it. Dude... show me a link to a flight school where a plane and an instructor is 100 per hour.  You can find it on the internet. Google it. It'll change your life. It can  also help you win pissing contests on the internet for that hollow and masterbatory feeling of superiority.  If you are talking about this:

http://www.fscj.edu/academics/areas-of-study/aviation/professional-pilot-technology-as/tuition-hourly-flight-training-rates/

You realize this is just for the plane right? It says right on the bottom instructor is 50 so total is 150. Which is actually pretty good compared to my local school c152 which charges 185. Argument dumb. Argument over. http://aviation.ou.edu/noncredit_courses.html

I pay almost $100/hr for a massage too (70 to be exact), seems like I should just watch it on youtube instead. Not everyone has the physical requirements to fly a plane, or want the responsibility of putting lives at risk, just let people have their fun  Is this custom or did he purchase surplus?   [deleted] This is wicked cool. I'm becoming a pilot, this is a better flight Sim than my club has! [An engineer you say?](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4dwRuKLYQTA/hqdefault.jpg) Only on PC thats badass i want one but i dont play flight simulators [deleted] It's called TrackIR, and it's fantastic. I bought it for ArmA, but I also use it for flight games like Elite and Warthunder. You can also make your own head tracking system for $20. All you need:

 IR LEDs 

a battery 

ir camera (ps3 cam with the filter removed) 

and open source software Arma? How does it work for that game? Allows you to move your head with the TrackIR, legs with WASD, and gun/hands with the mouse. It allows you to look around, lean etc with your head while keeping your mouse free for aiming your weapon. I've seen that, its head-tracking for what an occulus rift would do, but lots of flight sims don't support the oculus yet. You should see if he like space sims. Elite Dangerous is really fun, would go great with this set-up, supports head-tracking and occulus.  ok thats awesome. over the top but awesome
 Haha it's not too crazy, it's literally a baseball cap with a piece of plastic on it that's calibrated to a sensor.  I used something similar to this while i was earning my pilots licenses. His looks more geared towards fighter jets or planes rather than training planes. Any idea how much money he put into that? I would be interested in doing something similar if it meant i could dogfight. It looks like around $3000 or so. Just the stick is around $400 since it's a thrustmaster warthog. I'd imagine he uses it for DCS A-10C by the fire handles.  http://www.naturalpoint.com/trackir/products/trackir5/ You should get him a DK2, or the consumer version when that comes out. It's pretty awesome being able to see the depth of the buttons, and to feel the scale of whatever you're sitting in. You notice a lot of the things you can't really see when you're looking at a screen. I've tried the DK2 with DCS World, flying the A-10C and the KA-50 Black Shark. The resolution isn't good enough yet for flight sims IMO. You can't make out any of the instruments unless you lean right in close, nor can you really see the HUD properly. Once you're in the air you can't see the runway unless you're practically on top of it. It's a fantastic experience but it's not practical for serious simming. I'm hoping the CV has a good enough resolution that helps alleviate some of those problems. But then he can't see his hands reaching for all those physical switches that he built, or the touchscreen in the middle. A Rift would be a pretty big step down in functionality for this setup. People that take flight sims very seriously often have controllers that copy the real thing.  I know, I take my flight sims pretty seriously and have the same HOTAS and head tracking as this guy. My point is that none of that matters if you can't actually see the switches. Wearing a Rift is no different than wearing a blindfold when it comes to using 90% of a cockpit like that. Basically if it's not on the throttle or flight control stick itself, it's probably not being used.  If it was 1:1 perfect model, and you matched the oculus movement to real life movement, then the switches should be physically wherever you see them through the oculus. But yeah, I have a DK2 and the resolution is not up to it yet. I can't imagine there is any motion tracking software and/or hardware out there that is accurate and fast enough to overlay a hand into the rift in perfect synchronization to what your real hand is doing, and to the precision of the human hand. That's science fiction at this point. 100% of the time, eyeballs and hands will be faster than the rift with blind hands, no matter what the setup is. And for that reason, to simmers like me that enjoy testing emergency procedures, or working at a breakneck pace, the rift is only a hindrance.  So he goes through all this trouble, and he puts the sensor on a hat instead of on a real pilot's helmet? The helmet is the most badass part! I hope he at least wears cool sunglasses.

This is the kind of helmet I'm talking about: http://m.ebay.com/itm/221682139206?nav=SEARCH After playing flight sims on my laptop and trying to use NUM keys to look around the cockpit I would totally welcome TrackIR. If I remember correctly its pretty affordable and makes the whole experience much smoother. As a pretty dedicated pc gamer i really want one but it does seem over the top, they have a sensor that clips to a headset also, so if you wear headphones that would be most practical It is actually the most amazing and game changing part of a good flight sim setup besides the joystick itself. You need a lot of vision and to be bale to look around fast, which is hard to do when all your fingers are already in use flying the plane. Also any other games with separate head movement like Arma. Yes, the $500 joystick is fine, but the $99 head tracking is over the top... i was referring to the entire set up  Okay, I just wanted to make sure people appreciated the joystick. =p FacetrackNOIR is also really good. It uses facial recognition instead of IR sensors so all you need is a camera and a face. I'll admit it's a bit of a bitch to get set up properly, but when it is, it's phenomenal. If you're willing to make yourself look like a complete prat, there's an app you can install on any Android phone with a gyroscope which will do head tracking (you attach your phone to your headset with a hairband or something).  I used it in Elite Dangerous for a while and it worked surprisingly well but my phone is just heavy enough that I couldn't get used to it.

There's also EDTracker which is a (much) cheaper solution than Track IR that uses an Arduino and a cheap gyro/magnetometer board.  I can't comment on how well it works because I've bought one but not got it yet but it seems well regarded. How much does a setup like this cost??? Space games more your thing?

Elite: Dangerous, Star Citizen.....  both would gladly make use of a setup like that. nah i do racing and sandbox and adventure games Some folks barely play and just spend their time making simpits! There are two kinds of people who play flights sims: People who take them seriously, and people who played them once.
 Might want to share this with /r/hoggit  That "Please Stand By" screen looks natural I would dig this as a wallpaper.

Thanks! /u/PUSClFER! http://i.imgur.com/dhOmxeo.jpg (1920x1200)

You adjust to it. After your eyes heal from being gouged... I doubt it. I can't imagine it ever not being distracting in a game. But it's probably great for multitasking, editing audio/video/photos. Things like that. It's really only noticeable on your wallpaper. Otherwise it's just a good line of separation between your windows. Try finding a decent [6400x1440 wallpaper](https://i.imgur.com/ZmbeAky.jpg). Oh, we're playing this game? Try finding a decent [7680x2160 wallpaper](http://i.imgur.com/NwqpX0q.jpg). Good god.

(   ) [More waifus at once.](https://vimeo.com/21778892) I believe stock market traders may want as many screens as possible to keep an eye on everything they have money in or are thinking of investing in. and one for email of course. That's just 2 images flipped a bunch, not one continuous wallpaper. It's actually a modification I made from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TripleScreenPlus/comments/27fefi/complete_setup_overlapping_ribbons/) in /r/TripleScreenPlus, but I get what you're saying. That kind of feeds into the "try finding a decent wallpaper" thing, because there's not many out there for 4x2 setups. Mate, I don't have anything that's made to that particular resolution but I do have images much larger or equal to.
I have several more (they come from my HDR collection rather than "big ass wallpapers") but here's some from my wallpaper collection [that's at least larger than your posted resolution]
So you can center or crop them yourself I guess :v

That right monitor isn't level with the others fix it :( FIX ITTTTTTTTT I just do Screenshots of my games (star citizen, for example,  can have great screenshots to use as backgrounds)  I don't understanding obsessing over wallpaper. Honestly if you are looking it that much then you aren't using that monitor which means you might as well not have it. At the very least just break up your desktop with different backgrounds. Works well when working. Share your pain. Resorted to 3 separate wallpapers in similar styles for the most part.  http://m.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-34UM95-P-ultrawide-monitor 

This is what I need my wallpaper for. I hate bezels, what can I say. [One wallpaper for each month of the year.](http://imgur.com/a/fVliC) (3440x1440) do you manually change them or do you use a program to do that? I was looking for something to change mine by month/(or hour) for ages but never found anything decent. You can pretty much set them to change anywhere between every 10th second to every 24th hour via Windows 7 (not sure about 8). If you want to change them automatically specifically for each month though, I think you'll have to use a program of some sort.

To make them cycle once a day, right-click your desktop and select Personalization. In the window that pops up, click Desktop Background in the lower left corner. In there, you can choose to browse and select as many pictures as you'd like, and have them cycle via the dropdown list at the bottom of the window.

Like so: http://i.imgur.com/uPUfr8u.png Today I Learned... 8.1 windows checking, can also do. ahhh okay, I was hoping you had them set for a specific one each month, I overlooked that feature for what you've got going, makes sense, thanks anyway though!


Edit: Found a way to do daily/hourly which is pretty cool thanks to the three suggestions below (googling them led me to this one) http://futuresight.org/products/wallpaperchanger People don't use Windows Task Scheduler, but this is exactly the kind of thing it's useful for.  3840x2160 is also difficult. /r/firstworldproblems How do you think I feel sitting here with a 5:4 screen?  My condolences. Disappointed is my guess I've always had the opposite problem. I have so much trouble finding good wallpapers in 16:9 but I always see them in 16:10. Granted I haven't really looked much in the last year or two so maybe the 16:9 ones have gotten more common recently. i never understood the native american chief on those standby cards. apparently it's a test pattern called the [Indian-head](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian-head_test_pattern) Ooh! Check out "Test card F", it has a legacy!

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Card_F Personally, I like the [Philips PM5544](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips_PM5544) testcard more. That design is beautiful. I can feel it! I can feel the learning! Down this Vagina mine. Now, how about an animated one that works with Dreamscene? I'm working on it. Give me a couple of minutes.

**EDIT**:/u/ItzAPILLOWPET Here's the best I could come up with: https://www.dropbox.com/s/et57mndccr112fc/Fallout.wmv Sorry it took so long. I got distracted by wallpapers of cats during the process. Will your Cuntry Boner just not go down? Fuckin love puscifer The game needs a filter or a mode to make it look like this on newer TVs Like how La Noire has black and white mode Yep exactly. I wouldn't think it would be hard to make one for PC at least. It's not easy, but it's not the hardest thing ever since it can be done in postprocessing. All Bethesda games since Oblivion have ImageSpace Modifiers that let the game apply whole-screen effects. That's how Cateye, Night Vision, and Friend of the Night work in FNV, and how Tranquility Lane was B&amp;W in FO3. It wouldn't be terribly hard to make a blurring B&amp;W filter in FNV, with overlaid textures too if you were running NVSE. I was talking in general, rather than Bethesda games.

Also, Tranquility Lane had the worst performance I've ever seen. WHAT. How did I not know this? I was unaware of Black and White mode. I will not be playing again. Why not change your monitor settings instead of changing the game? There is a program called [SweetFX](http://sfx.thelazy.net/downloads/) that does just that and more. [Here](http://sfx.thelazy.net/games/game/70/) are some already made presets for the program.  Positive there's a mod for that  [Imaginator](http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/39619/?), actually.  If you're on pc, you can use [Imaginator](http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/39619/?) to achieve this.  [Here's a video of us playing the first 20 minutes of the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUI72nX_9e4) 

If any mod thinks this violates rule 8 I'll delete this link One of your friends is Ray Romano? Lmao, that would be the TV's owner. His name is John. I can assure you he's not Ray Romano.

Trust me, you're good bro. TIL /r/gaming has rules. I got banned for calling OP out one time.

I laughed at it, but there's rules. Pshhh.. don't get me started with the rules and Mods on /r/gaming. Post a picture of an N64 and "look at this le gem I found at the Salvation Army", get a bunch of upvotes and no mods give a shit, post pictures of gaming computers and talk anything PC related and get your post aptly removed. AMA request: OP's Ray Romano friend I like how you say "first 20 minutes of the game" when really you're just doing the character creation portion. Which is the first three hours for me.  Yeah, we didn't really get into the nitty gritty of the gameplay, reading all that text on a tiny screen is quite the challenge

[we did have a fixation with killing easy pete for some reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng9DZTo3ts0#t=40) I bloody hope they dont. that would be dumb. Someone in this video sounds like Ray Romano. Suggestion: Try Bioshock next. I agree! Bioshock would be amazing on this screen. There needs to be a list created of best games to play on older televisions!!! [That Cuphead game would have to be somewhere in that list.. Even if it doesn't turn out to be any good, the art style just screams old TV.](http://www.studiomdhr.com/press/images/cuphead-flower1.png) http://www.neo-geo.com/forums/showthread.php?238415-CRT-Fetish-Thread I guess I have a new fetish now. welp. As much as I hope you're right, I have a feeling it would be almost impossible with how dark the environments are. The game actually benefits from this.  Can't really read the text though. They should implement as a game feature so it can be beautiful AND legible! Or you could just turn the color on your TV to zero... Or you could record the tv with your phone with a black&amp;amp;white filter and then you could ~~you~~ connect it on internet to a stream so you could watch on your computer with a 10sec delay and reduced quality with lags. 

But I don't know why anybody would do that.  You could even just kick your modern tv over and then get out a chess set and experience true hipster video games. Wouldn't that just be 'games'? Not if the chess set was in fact Video Chess for the Atari 2600.... Man, seeing the word 'chess' over and over makes it sound really wierd. Like 'flannel', what sort of word is that?

It's the scanlines, it's the low resolution with that natural fuzziness, it's the weird minor anomalies in certain part of the screen where you used to hold a magnet too close to it when you were a kid. It's not nearly as bad as Dead Rising for the 360 was on a non HD television. You could only make out one of every ten words. May I...May I have some dogecoin? sure :)  +/u/dogetipbot 200 doge Thanks! Could I have some please? Sure +/u/dogetipbot 200 doge I have a modern TV that is small but ultimately quite an acceptable size. Text is quite clear to read when watching TV, but there are many games where the text is not nearly as clear on it as it should be. I honestly feel this is just a failure on the part of developers. All you need now is an old radio playing heartaches by the number. JOHNNY GUITAAAAAR I got spuurrrrs that jingle jangle jingle~~ *JINGLE JANGLE* *jingling does not intensify, instead it goes away but comes back every twelve minutes* And they roooowww right merrily aloooong *As I go riding merrily along jimmy saville is that you  That's the day my world will end! The look of the world really fits older tech but I have to assume most of the more in-depth aspects of the game are virtually unplayable because you can't read the text. I can't agree with that. It looks so washed out. Just download (make) a mod that changes your screen filters to look like that and keep the pixels.  I feel that the novelty would wear off rather quickly My thoughts exactly. It's cool to look at, but trying to play like that would get old and annoying so quickly. TV's try to keep up with games, not the other way around.  I played Final Fantasy VII &amp; VIII on an old 14" TV back in the late nineties. I remember coming back to it after we upgraded to a new TV and wondering how on earth I did it. But then I realised: the games drew me into their worlds in such a way that I didn't care how crappy and small the screen was - I was *there* with the characters in Nibelheim and Balaam GARDEN.

It's the same as an old book. I read LOTR from my mum's beat up old hardcovers - but i loved it. The world melted away in the midst of great storytelling.

So here's to getting drawn in to a compelling story, regardless of the way it's delivered. So that is a sweet chocolate covered, yes they would get annoying. Up vote for memories though.   &gt;TV's try to keep up with games, not the other way around.

Which is exactly why we have 4K consoles available but no 4K TVs. Oh wait... Maybe it's cause i used to have to play my Atari2600  on a shitty black and white set as a kid, but I, for one, appreciate the nice modern screens a lot. 

Don't miss these bastards... http://i.imgur.com/lmjo6Dv.jpg First time I played and fished Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, was in black &amp; white, and I finished it that way. So when I saw it in colors for the first time, I didn't really like how the ocarina was blue, and how some weapons were colored like toys.

It was a very different but special experience. Well if there was a ever "poetic" way to play a video game, i think this is it The pip boy actually doesn't look so out of place now! Looks like they're playing on a pip boy screen  He never looked out of place! I remember I had an old black and white TV in '05, I was eight at the time, and I used to play Silent Hill 2 on it, in the dark, yeah I know an eight year old shouldn't be playing Silent Hill 2, anyway It was all fun, I had a friend help me, I was terrified of horrors, still am, till one of my parents decided to grab their radio, have it play static and sneak up behind me. I'd never jumped so far in my life How did you connect the console/PC to this super old TV? Anything that has an RF modulator in it (such as an old VCR) would work.  Run the composite (not component) video out from the game into the VCR's video input; then run the VCR's RF/coax out through a 75ohm/300ohm balun hooked up to the TV.

They also make (made?) boxes that perform this same function so people could hook a DVD player up to a TV that had no composite video inputs. By the way, this was our original post

http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2cqlkx/what_do_you_get_when_you_play_20132014_games_on_a/ You should try bioshock, and post results. i dont know whether to be horrified or love it. can i be both? Check your VATs. I don't see why not : 3 One winter, years ago, my parents went to Hawaii and left my brother and me at our grandparents' house. To pass the time one night, we went to the video store and rented some Nintendo games. We sat in the back bedroom and had a blast with TMNT, Dragon Warrior, and more! 

But one game really pissed us off. We thought it was a ripoff and a stupid, cheating, idiotic, moron game! You see, while we loved TETRIS, we had no fondness for the cheap knockoff called Dr. Mario, who never once let is win a single game! So angry, so bitter.

Until we played it at a friend's house. On his color TV. The Indian-head test pattern used in Fallout is **particularly** apropos. Yeah it's my favorite picture in the album &gt;apropos

What does this mean Here, "apropos" means "very appropriate to this particular situation", because the Indian-head test pattern is the sort of thing you'd expect to have seen on an older TV back when it was first in use. It looks like you're playing Fallout from within the world of Fallout [the walls fall away revealing a post-apocalyptic landscape]

   *2016* You guys, my friend's birthday is on Saturday, the popularity of this post is gonna mean so much to him \^__^ You can avoid the space by doing this:

    \^-^

    - = underscore, doesn't show for some reason in code

\^_^ And to thinkthis will have less lag than an HDTV Wow, this brings back memories. My grandma's tv got stolen when I was younger, and she had to pull an old black and white TV out if the attic.  We got the dreamcast and N64 hooked up to it. About made me sick playing on that thing. Not too terribly long ago I bought a Coleco Telstar model 6040 (launch model, 1976) from a thrift shop for $5, thinking it was a collectible item. Turns out they aren't, and I finally sold it to a used game shop for $10 sometime later.

However, when I bought it, I didn't realize how old of a TV I needed to play it. I had a early-90s Sharp 19" CRT TV at home back then that I used for my SNES, but the Telstar had no RF hookup. Went back to the thrift stores in town, nobody had a TV that old. Finally, I found one of my friends who had a B/W Zenith from the early 70s in his barn, and we hooked up the Telstar and it played great, despite the fact that smoke started coming out of his TV after 5 minutes (!!). 

The whole experience is up on YT here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSH8A6tk3kY

Anyway, the reason I'm posting this is because I'm curious how you got a Xbox 360 to work on such an old TV? Is there some sort of adapter, or did that TV have RF input? I don't have my Telstar anymore, but would there be a way to use an adapter to hook it up to a typical 90s CRT TV, or maybe even a modern LCD TV?

Those are some cool pictures, by the way, super eerie. I think this could be classified as art. "Dude what ENB is that?" It's kind of eerie how real that looks when played on that TV.  Some people are asking how this setup works,

Here's my friend's explanation from the last thread:

"Alright there were 3 conversion technically. The first was from "Twin Lead" to coaxial cable. Then a device that converts an AV to coaxial. The final is where it gets technical. The conversion of the Xbox signal to an AV signal. In short I either need a coaxial or an AV input for it to work on this T.V." More like fallout old vegas amirite If you guys like this, [my friend's channel](https://youtube.com/user/johnbrnssr/videos) has him playing all sorts of stuff on this tv

again, let me know if I'm violating the rules here It looks great and all, but I would really hate to play the entire game in that small box.  Awesome post.  Call me crazy, but some of those would make sweet wallpapers.  Nice work, OP! \&gt;two bears high fiving each other Pretty cool. It's a similar concept to playing modern music out of a tube amp. This is actually how the game should be packaged and sold.  You buy a copy and they ship you an old shitbox TV to play it on. The only hipster-approved way to play modern videogames. It would of been so much fun to play.... For about 10 minutes It really fits the theme of the game :D I couldn't stand doing this. Props to you. I would really love if you put [Tunnel Snakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0ximxe4XtU) through the TV and recorded it I feel like this is cool in concept, but would get very irritating after awhile.  This game was made for this TV Difficulty level: Grandparents' TV. I don't know why but it just looks so right. Looks great. Only thing missing is one with the pip-boy I feel like Bioshock would look awesome like this. This is not Fallout. Fallout came out in 1997. #bitterOldMan I think this might be the real way to play it. Looks like you're playing Fallout 3 in Fallout 3 0 input lag, well done.  looks like shit That looks awesome, it has that certain charm. I'm surprised how naturally good this looks. Wow the tv actually did really well  Tunnel Snakes rule! We're the Tunnel Snakes.
 That's us! And we...
 RULE Nice! Did you have issues with the resolution?  When I first bought my PS3 I still had one of those fatty square mid-90s CRT TVs that actually also had a VCR as part of it.  Played a bunch of game and had a good time but felt like something was off.  Eventually I got a proper flatscreen and realise that I was missing out on like 40% of the displayed image. Same here. Tried playing assassins creed 1 and couldn't even tell what the icons on the mini map were.  Every game we play on the old tv is a lot more crisp than I'd expect.

I guess it's because the picture quality was perfected for black and white TVs then they had to start from scratch with color in terms of quality.
 whoa curved screen... are you sure this isn't the future? It is just curved the wrong way. Look how long it took them to fix that ! I have serious respect for the people who make this in their freetime I'd say its probably practice for them too if anything.  I know a lot of devs mod on the side too as a hobby.  But regardless, thank the gods for these people. And you can put in a resume/portfolio for getting 3-d modeling jobs and the like. And these people are the best. Exactly what I was thinking. Making expansive mods like this is how you get noticed in the gaming industry. Telling a company you made the equivalent of a new game on your own really draws an eye I remember the 19 yo who made the Falskaar mod. Everyone was shitting on him because he didn't have a degree, but bungie hired him. Glassdoor reports associate engineer (is that the same as associate designer?) average salary of 77k. If you do good work you'll get noticed.  Didn't the guy who made the Helgen Reborn mod get hired to? And the guy who made OOO for Oblivion.  IIRC wasn't it for Bethesda? This article's saying bungie http://www.joystiq.com/2013/11/30/19-year-old-skyrim-falskaar-modder-lands-gig-at-bungie/ &gt; Thank the nine for these people 

FTFY This is an ambitious Skyrim project, the ultimate goal of this project is to make the whole continent of Tamriel playable in Skyrim, with it's own unique characters, background, flora and vegetation, mainquests, guilds, factions, questlines and sidequests, new mechanics and spells, new and unique armors, every province and it's own unique armors and clothes, weapons, background, beliefs, religions and cultures and much more to come.  

This is Province: Hammerfell, If you got what it takes then you should head in and help them on their fantastic project, no matter how small you can help, it will be greatly appreciated, they need every help the can get, now go on in, what are you waiting for! : http://www.darkcreations.org/forums/forum/119-beyond-skyrim/

Recruitment link: http://www.darkcreations.org/forums/forum/141-recruitment/ I can't wait to play this in 2022. IIRC there's a lo-res terrain map of all of tamriel in every game, they just have to upres and populate it.

So you'll only need to wait until 2020. Im sitting here thinking 2020 is 10 years away I forget the time we live in.  we are living in the future and don't even realize it That's some Jaden Smith shit right there How Can The Future Be Real If We Don't Even Realize It That's actually a good one.  Quite profound. /r/im14andthisisdeep /r/im14andurmumisdeep How can we even realize the future if we'll only experience the present. An interesting thought, realizing the future, leaping forward in ideas, technology, etc. often requires disengaging from the present to gain a perspective that doesn't include the limitations of ideas at present time.  It's like how I always thought kids in grade 5 were old. One day I was in grade 5 and didn't feel old and I realized this was gonna happen over and over forever. ~*~ real eyes ~*~ realize ~*~ real lies ~*~ How Can The Future Be Real If AP History Isn't Real Welcome to Oklahoma. Technically we're living slightly in the past because of speed limitations of your nervous system. But that depends on how "present" is defined. And how "living" is defined. I'm only here so I don't get defined. And how defind "defind" is defind.  And how that is spelled or how spelled is spelt When will then be now? You just missed it...  http://i.imgur.com/UBps5YD.jpg Obviously. 2020 is 20 years away, at least. 20-25 Sounds about right. I hope the computers don't all shut down in a few years. Am I fucked up or is it 5 years until 2020? You are fucked up, only 4 years and some months away Whew I was worried for second there. Only 9 years man. President Obama's only been in office for less than three years.  Holy fuck dude, that guy was elected when I was 15. I'm 22.  Same, I don't even properly remember a time when George Bush was president. In my memory it's just like, he got elected, 9/11 happened and he was hated for starting some wars... ???... Obama! Funny it's the opposite for me. Clinton was the president I don't remember well. everyone was like yeah he's cool! Then all of sudden people hated him. Sexual stuff. Then it died down then all of a sudden Bush! Then when the Bush years were over I was old enough to vote for Obama. Funny how we remember history when we were young I'm british, it's just Queen Elizabeth as far back as anyone can remember. 

I think she might be a droid. It is now. SEE how fast the time is going. Even time is faster in the future! Each minute that passes is a shorter percentage of your entire lifetime than the previous minute was. Time definitely speeds up in the future! The 1990s will always be about 10 years ago to me. Every "20 years ago since" 90's milestone blows me away a little bit more. Here's a few coming up: 

March 1st, 1995 - Yahoo is founded in Santa Clara, CA 

March 16, 1995  Mississippi ratifies the Thirteenth Amendment, becoming the last state to approve the abolition of slavery.

March 27th, 1995 - 67th Academy Awards, Forrest Gump wins best picture  Imagine how I feel; I occasionally catch myself wondering when Huey Lewis' new record is coming out. I can't wait for Sealab! &gt; IIRC there's a lo-res terrain map of all of tamriel in every game

Not quite. Skyrim's world includes a heightmap of most of Tamriel, and Oblivion's does as well, but to a lesser extent.  Serious question: Why? In certain locations in both games geography outside of the game's province is visible. Obviously there has to be something to see. You can even see a very poorly modelled White Gold Tower from certain spots on the Skyrim-Cyrodiil border.  [Here's a pic of the whole "Imperial City" from the border.](http://i.imgur.com/CQrw2hx.jpg)

[Here's an up-close pic of the Tower.](http://i.imgur.com/n4v1cBB.jpg) [And here is the object they referenced to build that tower model.](http://static.hardwarestore.com/media/product/248930_front500.jpg) It's almost like I'm really in a low-res Imperial City It... it's you! THE HERO OF KVATCH! This truly is an honor! Was this screenshot taken way up in the sky? Yeah, I noclipped and disabled the invisible walls to get the screenshots. Where?  Not OP and not too knowledgeable on it, but I just perused REAL quick on the TESwiki. Quotes below, followed by link.

"In The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, the White-Gold Tower can be seen on PC by disabling borders in the Skyrim.ini and Skyrimprefs.ini files (Add bBorderRegionsEnabled=0 under [General]). However, it is a low detail version. The provinces of Cyrodiil and also Morrowind are present beyond the borders of Skyrim.

On 360 and PS3, it is also possible to approach the tower. The process is much more complex though. First, one needs to glitch out of Riften using Whirlwind Sprint (Tutorials found on YouTube), then just run towards Cyrodiil. Once there, you will be able to see the tower."

[Here](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/White-Gold_Tower_(Structure\)) is the link. Perhaps so when they were building the individual games, they could use it as a reference (you know, so they didn't accidentally make oblivion or something much bigger than it actually should have been. All these lands are supposed to be interconnected, so making sure they are the right shape/size in relation to everything else could have been important.) The games are all made to different scales, so that isn't an issue.  Except Morrowinds landmass (Vvardenfell) is a larger map that Cyrodil is  in Oblivion, but if you look at a map of the continent of Tamriel, Vvardenfell is significantly smaller. What's ridiculous is that Vvardenfell amounted to about 9 square miles, actually smaller than Skyrim at 14 and Oblivion at 22, but it felt bigger because running used fatigue and you had to do your navigation by exploring instead of markers.

Nothing will top Daggerfall's 62,394 square miles, though. Also, the shorter view distance. Going back to vanilla Morrowind is impossible for me now because "Why the hell is there a dense fog everywhere?"

Skywind can't come fast enough... MGSO! Giant mod compilation for Morrowind that'll clear that fog right up. Bethesda loves mods, and so when you get up high you don't just see nothingness. You see an incredibly far distance with some detail in the landscape.

But seriously, I have no clue. That's just what I'd assume. I'd definitely thought of the "you can see some of it" part, but I would have thought they'd have cut out anything you can't see just to save space and processing power. It's probably more for mods and the inevitable "we know you're going to hack the game and fly around so we don't want to hear you complain about the lack of land." The good old "for kicks" answer. I love it when developers have stuff like that. &gt; IIRC there's a lo-res terrain map of all of tamriel in every game, they just have to upres and populate it.

Yeah I'm sure there is a button for that.     
And then adding quests/monsters/dungeons... details... quickly done.

I'm with you, 2020 foh sho! There's a button? Well maybe October 2019 then Playable beta out tomorrow for $10,  skyrim is the only available province Why don't we just forget everything else and I'll pay another $60 + my soul for an online Skyrim that isn't some mmorpg bullshit Yeah when the people asked for The Elder Scrolls online, we meant that we want Skyrim Co-op please. But if they add Multiplayer in the next Fallout/Skyrim that comes out, you know there will be the 50% of people that complain it takes away from the story, or they didn't have enough time to make the campaign. I think fallout is a game meant to be played by yourself though. Your supposed to feel alone most of the time, adding multiplayer would take away from the experience, imo. It would turn into a Borderlands that took itself seriously... &gt; Yeah when the people asked for The Elder Scrolls online, we meant that we want Skyrim Co-op please. 

I think you meant skyrim co-op but with the whole continent.  When we worked down from 2022 to 2019, we went from comically overestimating the time required, to probably underestimating it. 2019 is only four years away now.

If those morrowind mods are any indication, 4 years is going to be the release of the empty pre-pre-alpha version. So this July we can expect to see it on sale in Steam as the pre-pre-alpha-alpha-pre-alpha They just have to hit the Enhance button, child's play 2020 Fus Roh!  https://i.imgur.com/fings4r.jpg Honestly, by then won't we have a newer TES game that we'd want to be completing this project in for all the new stuff it'll have? That's one question I've always had about huge, ambitious game projects like this - the modding community tends to mostly swap to the newer game in probably 9 cases out of 10 when it comes to sequels. What are you talking about? All those big ambitious Morrowind projects all came true, it's not like they lingered around for such a long time that most of the modders started transitioning to Skyrim or anything like that.  Most of those big ambitious Morrowind projects are still alive and well. Tamriel Rebuilt, Skyrim: Home of the Nords, and Province: Cyrodiil are all still regularly updated.  You are right, it's the oblivion one's no one works on anymore. That's because of the potato people.   By Azura! By Azura! By Azura! It's the grand champion!


By the way... Do you happen to know what the fine is here in Cyrodiil for necrophilia? Just asking. Just gonna say, the Total War modding community is dedicated. There are some people still working on mods for the original Rome (came out in 2004). I also have my doubts. Look at the SureAI team. They have been doing this stuff since Morrowind, they have a lot of experience, you can literally see how they got better with each game. Nehrim was too ambitious for them, it was too big. Now you have 14 people plus many other volunteers with minor contributions working on this Enderal project and it will take almost 4 years to finish. btw, half the work goes into debugging the game. 

Beyond Skyrim will need an insanely huge, well-coordinated team of experienced workers who are willing to sacrifice a lot of free time for many years. It is quite a mess if people come and go.  You joke but that's only 7 years away.. Equally ambitous I'd say is the Skywind Project.  Modders are recreating TES III: Morrowind inside the Skyrim engine.  The effort that has gone into making this is absolutely boggling when you consider it's all voluntary. It's essentially a complete remastering of the game.  It also looks much more likely to reach completion in a timely manner and I believe you can download developement versions now.

[Official Page](http://tesrenewal.com/) I posted this elsewhere in the thread, but i will post it here too, where people may actually see it

The difference i guess between skywind and other projects is that We already have the content 90% complete like Quests, The place where we are focusing the work on now is Assets and Landscaping. Once we have replaced all of the morrowind assets we can provide a public beta, Which will involve heavy amounts of bug checking and tracking. But Only once we have completely removed anything from morrowinds game files from Skywind. as we cannot legally distribute the package with these assets.

You wouldnt want to be testing with this:

http://i.imgur.com/toTiciA.png

http://i.imgur.com/sp3u50o.png

http://i.imgur.com/TWvA1p0.png

The main problem with Morrowind is that The world is incredibly empty, And those screenshots show it. That area hasn't been landscaped yet so it really is not a good representation of skywind as a whole, but it gives you an idea about what is to do as our current focus is to get the whole world blocked out to some degree, That way our testers can go in and play in a world that will look very similar to the final release. I know about this, I'm a fan, I like their job, it's very good Have they considered forking the morrowind section out to skywind? Would save a lot of time, and be great if they could work together. If they did, they would have to change lots of the landscape to show the devastation that happened after the red mountain erupted. Soemones done their homework Vvardenfell was pretty much uninhabitable after the Red Mountain's eruption, IIRC, so it wouldn't make much sense to have the player be able to go there at all in the same timeframe as Skyrim.

Edit: Yes, I know the eruption happened 200 years ago, but in the Dragonborn DLC they made it very clear that Vvardenfell is not nearly as inhabited as it once was. Except that Skyrim takes place 200 years after the Red Mountain erupted. Oh snap. It's still far from inhabitable. But still visitable. They should do the whole thing, but add like a constant health drain so that you can't survive unless you've got tons of health potions (or restoration magic, or super enchanted gear, or.. you get the point). If there's no one living there it might be kind of pointless with no quests, but I'd love to just be able to wander around. Just the fact that it exists in game and you can go there would be so cool. Was the Morroblivion project abandoned or finished? Or is it still ongoing independently of this? Morroblivion works pretty well even though they say it's in alpha. I didn't know this until just now but it appears to be (practically) complete!

[Here is the faq on it](http://tesrenewal.com/morroblivion-faq) When I saw OP's post, yeah I was reminded of Skywind and Morroblivion.. in that by the time these projects get anywhere there's another TES title released to start re-creating them with all over again. I love that people do this, and it's really an amazing amount of talent/commitment. It's just that they likely won't get as much appreciation because they fall an iteration behind too quickly The difference between these two projects is that Skywind will really come out and ... the other one, nah I don't know ;) If they make all of Tamriel playable I'm never getting out of that place.

I thought I'd run through Skyrim in an hour or so, just to get a feel for it. Then I came to understand what a vast place it is and how many challenges there are.

If all of Tamriel is playable then it'll be a universe in its own right. It's mesmerizing really. I think Morrowind was the most immersive game of the series, but Oblivion and Skyrim feel so real as well.

I hope this Tamriel version comes with a couple grand quests but also dozens upon dozens of localized storylines. Morrowind is to this day my favorite game ever.  I had over hundreds of hours of game time in Skyrim and I was still finding new places. This could potentially be a game you could play off and on for a decade and still run into new stuff.  i wonder, has bathesda made any effort to contact Beyond Skyrim?
 They interviewed them in their bethblog Wait, so this isn't something that we will see years and years of hard work put into then a C&amp;D will come down from Bethesda two months before completion?  Bethesda supports modding. They let anyone who owns skyrim download the creation kit for free. There is the steam workshop were people can download other peoples mods. As long as these people don't charge for it I doubt bethesda will do anything about it. Steam workshop is an inadequate place to get Skyrim mods. Nexus mods is by far the best location to find the bestmods. Also Loverslab if you're into that. Lover Slab has some SFW stuff that isn't on Nexus. Bethesda fully supports mod projects like this as long as they don't reuse official assets from previous TES or 3rd party games. The only time they've C&amp;D a mod was the original old Morroblivion project, which at the time was a direct copy/paste of Morrowind's assets. Is there any known timeline for when this will all be completed? Also do you know if this will be a mod add on for Skyrim or will it be a stand alone installation?  this will be a mod The devs want to encourage people buy Skyrim to support Bethesda and their devs who made such a mod-friendly game. And because it's not their IP they couldn't make it an independent, stand-alone installation and certainly not charge money for it.

Black Mesa is the only recent example I can think of where the original IP holders (Valve) gave the go ahead to an independent dev group to make a new version of their IP.

Bethesda is talented, but I don't think their execs are that generous. That's amazing that they are just going at it for a mod, and fucking awesome that people support the company and people who are behind the game. More game companies should be supportive like this. *cough* Nintendo *cough* I had a dream recently where Brawl was announced as a downloadable Wii game on the Wii U, and that PM would be a "dlc pack" or some sort for like 5 bucks. I was so sad when I woke up. So are they on meth, or adderall? There's no chance these modders are not on stimulants. Just Moon sugar and Skooma it looks like Wonder if this will be out before the next Elder Scrolls game. If not, are they gonna try to take everything to the next game, or keep it as a heavily modified Skyrim? Same thing will happen to the equivalent Oblivion project. The next game will come out, the modders will move on and it won't get done. &gt;won't get done

MorrOblivion is still insane, though. also dont forget about skywind the remake of morrowwind in the skyrim engine I wonder how much % of that is complete https://tesrenewal.com/blog/blog-entry-1

We recently had a blog go live, which should explain some questions you may be asking!

 I LOVE the idea of this project, I just don't want to spoil myself until you guys are done with it. well they have the coffee machine installed last week! Don't forget about Tamriel Rebuilt. All of Tamriel built in Morrowind's engine. I'll get excited for this once they finish it. Morroblivion No, Skywind.  No, Skyblivion. Morroblivrim http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ygzljVH1_70 That was a nice SSD, fun song too. Lmao sorry about that Squidwind Tentacles.   No, Skaggerfall. RemindMe! 10 years Not to be that guy, but this isn't the first time a group has set out to recreate Tamriel, and they've all quit or gone into eternal hiatus. There's a reason it takes a large group with millions of dollars several years to make one game one eighth of the size of the scale of this project. As an programmer myself, I can tell you first hand that indie developers tend to set the scale far too grand for what they can actually handle, and tend to get discouraged.More power to these guys, but don't get any of your hopes up.Edit: Just want to say that I totally support these guys and admire their work thus far. What I'm pointing out though is that the internet and Reddit in particular get incredibly mean and witchhunt-y when their incredibly high expectations don't get met and the hype bubble bursts. The cycle for TES: "complete tamriel mods:"

Modders begin work on a unseen territory in Tamriel

They get some attention on reddit for a few pretty screenshots of this foreign land

They realize that this is going to take much more effort than a few small regions

Modding group slowly loses interest and support. Development slows to a snails pace

Next TES is anounced and released, Modders lose interest in old mod

New TES gets old and new modding group thinks to make a "complete tamriel mod" for the game

rinse and repeat

 I'm impressed when they even make it to screenshots. Half of these mods fall apart before they even get the landmass filled with basic clutter. there were screenshots of this like 2 years ago. What is new exactly?

Honestly crafting the overworld of Tamriel is a feat and a half and that's less than 1/10th of the project.  . . Quests? Dungeons? NPCs? etc. Yeah, it's neat to see, but with how ambitious this project is, Bethesda is going to have a new Elder Scrolls out with a new/better engine by the time this project is even close to being completed, and that's if it continues that long.

It also doesn't help that Elder Scrolls Online is essentially a Skyrim-esque game with basically all of the continents. I realize ESO is not Skyrim, but it scratches the itch for people who wanted to play the old maps in updated graphics. Haven't they only done sections of Tamriel in ESO though? I wanted to see their interpretation of some Skyrim city (I don't remember which one) and found that it's not actually in the game.  Skyrim is in the game, but I'm blanking on the name of the main city there. I don't remember which faction. I played the game a lot at launch and then stopped once I played the story in all three factions.

EDIT: Ah yeah, I reread what you're saying. There are only pieces of each in the game. But Beyond Skyrim got a great amount of publicity, even Bethesda interviewed them of their project, I'm pretty much sure this one will be very different from the other projects, they really work hard and put in alot of effort, each time they post a new picture you can feel and clearly see the improvements and the big development in the project, I have big hope for this project as it looks very promising Tamriel Rebuilt was the same way, until we realized "oh shit, scripting and quests and an actual plot are way harder than level building". Tamriel Rebuilt is nearly finished in the terms of land, Almalexia and Old Ebonheart are the only thing they're working on at the moment in terms of landscape, and they actually have a full Great House Telvanni questline with great rewards, also they have completed The Mages Guild's questline, and The Fighters Guild too IIRC Yes but the point I think he is making is that they don't see the true scale of the project. Tamriel Rebuilt took years upon years to make it this far and it's only for 1 of the provinces. They still need to finish the west scripting-wise, that and actually begin the south, personally I want to see Tear and Narsis I can't wait for Tear, sounds like such an intimidating place, giving me Xenophobia vibe &gt; I'm pretty much sure this one will be very different

Humans. Publicity doesn't make games. It doesn't help make games. It doesn't indicate if a game will actually be released or how good it will be if it is finished. 

It really says nothing.  Publicity draws in more help. That's almost entirely the point. publicity can lead to investors which can lead to more people on the team which can increase its chances of actually becoming a thing.

Publicity is VERY helpful.

edit: investing, donating, giving them money. Same principle. I get it. "You can't invest blah blah blah" There's 4 comments saying the same damn things, I get it. Thanks.

edit 2: Yes you can fucking take donations for making a mod http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/605097-nexus-donation-system-for-users/

bethesda said so themselves. However, that's just bethesda. Morroblivion and Skywind productions too publish pictures that show great progress and development, but they're not even close to finish line. I actually remember living a totally different life, quite a time ago and getting hyped over those games. Years pass, one is in beta, other in closed alpha.

But let's not go that far as recreating entire game. 
Morrowind mods that allow you to join House Dagoth (restoring partially scrapped story arc, that didn't make it into fine cut of the game) are still buggy, lack in writing, design and it's been what... 9 years?

Also, it might be just me, but
"this one will be very different from the other projects, they really work hard and put in alot of effort"
is just god damn insulting. As if other modders did not put sweat into their work.

They do and still fail. Recreating entire continent, when productions with double Hollywood Blockbuster budget do one province is not a matter of "hard work", it's nearly impossible. Not only from technical pov.
A few programmers don't make a game. You need all kinds of people, often humanists, people who can create good, thriving vibe of the game, liveable npcs, dialogue lines, flavour texts.
It is a hell of a lot of ungrateful and mundane work. And that's the stuff you don't see on pictures. Stuff they prolly didn't even start considering working on. Mostly because they've got entire friggin continent to create. Just because they got some attention doesn't automatically mean they can achieve what they set out to do. The fact is even AAA studios run out of time designing their games. Some people completing that much content in their spare time is unheard of. Especially if you're talking about assets of decent quality.  I spent most of my adolescence working on Tamriel Rebuilt for Morrowind - it's nostalgic and awesome to see the next generation taking a crack at it (because let's be honest, most of the people that have time for this are teenagers). Show me the curved swords (   ) Tamriel Rebuilt for Morrowind is still going strong, as is OpenMW.  You'll have Tamriel in a modern engine from those two projects long before this mod is playable. TR is no longer aiming to recreate all of Tamriel. They gave that up like, 7 years ago. They've been working on Morrowind for about 14 years, and they still aren't finished.  Awesome. I wonder if they're taking any inspiration from Daggerfall and ESO, or even replicating certain areas? This is never going to happen... Tamriel rebuilt is a morrowind mod that started before the game even released and it is not even done yet... 

If this mod actually has a team willing to stay with it, maybe you will see a release in 2030. By which time at least another three Tamriel games will have been released, each with at least one "Tamriel Rebuilt" mod in the pipeline. And by which time the improvements in tech will have made Skyrim almost obsolete. When the mod will be finished Skyrim will be the equivalent of those old games people post here "DAE remember this gem?" Only 10s kids will get this!  SHUT UP AND TAKE MY SEPTIMS! Check out Enderal, people!!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQog9lkyH8k

Best part: It will come out this year. 

This is a full game, it will potentially be better than Skyrim, its predecessor "Nehrim" was better than Oblivion in many ways (didn't have English voice actors, though). German PCGames magazine already gave Enderal a big thumbs up after playing for while. But this will get burried anyway. You guys are going crazy over Fallout 4 or TES VI rumours while this almost finished and equally good game is sitting under your nose. 


 The biggest problem I got with those screenshots is all the wooden houses at Kanver, it would be better to have clay Houses for artstyle, it just doesn't seem to fit. Hammerfell is a dry country and should have houses closer to a more African feel, as opposed to Skyrim's Nordic feel. The Goldmoor shot house is too high, should be single story with an attic, the use of wood here is fine as it is surrounded by trees, but needs a new house model, not one from Skyrim. Otherwise though I love what has been done with the place. I have to agree. The landscape is primarily red, even in the grasslands there is quite a bit of red, but the wood texture is very green. It's pretty jarring in the mountains there and all the building's look really out of place. Not to take away from the ambition and work that has gone into making this stunning landscape, it's just disappointing to see it broken by something so relatively small.  I mean it's not even that, there's even a few sloped roofs on there, which simply wouldn't be there in a desert climate (as it doesn't rain). Accurately they would be clay abodes and as a result of that accuracy it would look good too, as you said. Your going to make me install skyrim again..... No no I don't wana I have a job a wife, kids.......fuck it goodbye life as I know it I decided to do a fresh run with a new mod set last weekend.  I hope I get to play by March. "nope. intro horse carriage still tumbling across skryim."

I found Rorikstead and a bunch of places I'd normally never explore that fell in my carriage's linear glitch once lol It is amazing to see these modders work to build outstanding games whereas the real game devs are making stuff that gamers constantly have things to complain about. Now, I have no doubt that this mod will have quite a few bugs in it. I do not think I have played a mod without its fair share in it. But, should that not be a testament to the abilities of these guys? With no budget they are making something that we actually want. While the AAA companies get a massive budget and make average games that are nothing special. 

I am generalizing of course, but, I hope you all understand the sentiment. Will be awesome if they ever finish it. This is all I've ever wanted, finally I can actually do something role-playesque with the redguard because its the ONLY race I ever play. Obviously cool.. but what happens when they release better versions and game engines in the future?  will this project be updated? Will there be quests, monsters, etc?   Depends on the compatibility with the newer engines, if it's easy to convert the files (like from Oblivion to Skyrim and vice-versa) I'm sure it will be updated, and I do think there will be new quest monsters and other goods It's absolutely mind blowing that this is a community project! Hammerfell looks incredible, and the sheer scope is truly awe-inspiring. Kudos to the team making this. The project has been going on far long in morrowind and is much more complete why not just play that? by the time this project gets as far as that if it ever does the graphics will be just as outdated as Morrowind. here's to actually feeling the vastness of a world and not running into a POI every 10 seconds!! even if it's mostly "empty". i wanna get daggerfall lost. Got completely lost for nearly three months in that game. Joined guilds, killed ghosts, and then a random guy came up, poked me in the back with a blade, and reminded me I had to kill someone... I'd gotten so lost/distracted I'd completely forgotten the mission and was nowhere near where I needed to be. Why did I buy this game on PS3 ............ considering how long skywind is taking, this is going to take f'en forever I remember 12 year old me fell in love with an ambitious mod; Earth's special forces, a DBZ total conversion for Half-Life. It's been 13 years and while the team has made tremendous progress it's still not out and there hasn't been a significant release in about 7 years. This looks beautiful. Great work, keep it up! Where do I donate? Oh, good.  Another Elder Scrolls project that will never be finished. I think Skywind will finish, it's the most progressed one up to now and it's doing really well, the other though, they're lagging, none moreso than beyond skyrim, i honestly don't think they'll finish this at all and if they do it will be bare, i'll eat my toenails if this gets finished and doesn't look like a barren wasteland. lots of development discussion here ----------&gt; darkcreations.org
It's where the project is currently hosted, it has been 3-4 years now :) (this mod was founded on 23rd of November 2011)
And i personally think the screenshots found there doesn't look pretty barren. And our trailer here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2XsmMeCS9g] (/spoiler). &gt; it's ultimate goal

its ultimate goal I got that earlier If this gets completed I will post a video destroying my consoles and a picture of my new pc parts being ordered. I would love to see this finished. I can only imagine the fascinating new error messages this would cause for me. For those that haven't played these games, stumbling in from the front page -

Tamriel is the continent where each Elder Scrolls game has taken place; each game covering a different region.

[This map has each game's region marked.](http://i.imgur.com/Gn4Az.jpg)

Disclaimer - I don't know the games (stumbled in from the front page) and found this image while trying to understand the scope of this project. Please correct anything about which i could very well be wrong. Great work is being done for this mod.  
The project might seem daunting, and that is because it is. So join up and help make it come out a little faster. No one is unable to contribute, at any level of experience you can help out or learn how to be great by taking courses with experienced modders on the forum. I think this needs more visibility.  Is the team creating art assets, or using pre-existing stuff? Dev on the project here:

We're using assets from the vanilla (base) game where appropriate, but in many cases we're building new art assets from scratch. If you've seen the trailers we've made for our first release, Bruma, for example, all of that architecture was created from scratch by our modellers. I have lots and lots of time on my hands. Just put 100 hours into dark souls. Not even half way done. I like to explore too much. How can I sign up to assist with this instead? darkcreations.org &lt;------------ Where the project is hosted. both. That's insane, I can't imagine the amount of work that the mod team will have to put in to this. Mad props for the dedication of modders like you guys, provided me with top notch entertainment beyond the scope of vanilla games for many years. Whats that huge port city down in the bottom right? Judging by the location, I'd say it's Rihad. Nice Might be Anvil, though the maps don't exactly line up. Nah man, its in hammerfell. cool They are bringing honor to Talos with this project.  
 you spelled its incorrectly
 I think skyrim modding has reached critical mass with this There better be curved swords Is anyone else watering at the mouth freaking out about such an idea...?  I need a better PC. I just wish consoles could experience this. My boner is raging right now... Just make one MOD that allows you to turn Skyrim into a 2 player game.  Someone will act as the main character and the other player is a follower.  

One of the things that I love about Skyrim that ESO cannot replicate is how claustrophobic some of the dungeon passage ways can get.  Those would be awesome for 2 player mode.  



 [Rise of the Triad had a good way of encouraging upgrades.](https://i.imgur.com/zGxJnSK.png)

EDIT: Come on people, if you're nostalgic, check out the modern remake. It's amazing how they manage to squeeze 2.4 sprite animation onto 3d models! I remember when all the rich kids had 486s on Doom2 multiplayer. I was on a dialup modem connecting from a bulletin board system to play other people around the U.S. I was 9 and thought L.A. was Los Angeles but later found out it was Louisiana and racked up a few hundred bucks in long distance. I was in deep shit at that point.

Edit: love all the stories guys, keep em coming. Big nostalgia trip Those days were fun.  I was a little older, perhaps 13 or so.  I remember my family bought a Pentium 90 that had a 14.4k modem.  I used to dial into local BBS's.  Most required a paid subscription.  My parents were afraid of pedophiles and only let me go online if I pretended I was an adult.  It was great fun.  I used to talk with other guys about how my wife was ragging on me to help out around the house. The other day I got some kid on a CSGO game (his voice was realy squeaky) seriously upset ragging about how his wife got pregnant and he couldn't afford another child so they would need to let go of the dog and sell his Corolla. That's some parental control right there.  "Look Dodger, I know you really give it your all when we play fetch but I just don't think you fit in around here. We're gonna have to let you go." "We're bringing in some new blood and need the desk space, have your bed cleared in the hour" ... We're gonna need that chew toy back too. Dude might just have Helium-itis.  Don't be so insensitive.  His wife loves him for who he is, in all his squeaky glory. Heliumitis: inflammation of the helium. Hey don't joke about that, my grandmother died that way. This is a serious condition.  Helium's not supposed to be flammable. Inflammable means flammable? what a country! Read that as Helium tits. A different, yet equally severe condition.

Less funny voice, though But do they make that squeaky noise like a balloon if you rub them? Sort of.  What's really cool is they can make your hair stand up Poor Vincent Adultman, just can't catch a break. I dunno man. I have this friend that has 3 kids, is 22 but sounds like he's 14. Somehow his voice even has the slur of a kid with braces. Unexplainable. the unexplainable part is how a woman let him stick his penis in her a minimum of 3 times.  Could be triplets. i thought of that afterward, but it kills the joke.  Like a pair of scissors to a crab. good god He's also awkward and plays video games almost 100% of his free time. Not like I can talk but I'm not the one with kids. Maybe she's the one who writes the erotic fanfic about the characters on the Recess children's show. &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232; the what? It's mimicry that evolved to aid in hunting. Sorry but your friend is a pedophile. He could be an adult. I went into the settings once and changed it so my microphone would be all high pitched and squeaky. I totally forgot about this until some guy asked why I sounded like Mickey Mouse.  I could see that backfiring too.. You should have told them you'll be OK, the pediphiles pretended they were kids :) This is the best advice I've ever heard, never let your child online while being themselves, tell them to complain about their wife! This was probably about the same time -- I had a 486 DX2 50 MHz with 2 MB of ram.  I think the same modem.  We were blessed with a local BBS a high school kid was running that was free, and my parents had literally no idea what I was doing.  Those were fun times.   me and my friends did the same thing.. pretended we were middle aged married guys...

maybe we were all 12 yr olds thinking we were talking to 40 yr olds Lol.  I *tried* to play Doom once online.  I was living in Spain at the time, I'm glad it didn't work.
 I did it with battlechess...  Long distance up the wazoo, I wasn't allowed to touch a computer for months after that.  Be glad it didn't work. Battle Chess was my jam! OMG...BattleChess! I forgot all about you!    

[For those that don't know..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYbQCRwgk) For when you wanted your chess game to last 4x as long I'm sure it was Battle Chess that later got me into the Civilization games.  Strategy, long games, battle animations, planning and foresight. OW MY FREAKIN EARS [I don't know. It's gotten bad reviews...] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RHLtx9r2LA) I found this porn site on dial up once. It just said I had to connect to it. I was young and didn't put two and two together that the dial up sounds coming from my computer after I clicked "YES" a bunch of times were connected. Man I looked at porn for hours. I don't even know if I was jerking it yet. 

Thirteen. Hundred. Dollars of charges show up on the phone bill. I was in sooooooooooooooooo much troubleeeeeee When it comes to porn when does anyone put two and two together?  Foursome and orgy videos  Did the same but with two differences, my bill was only 55 ($80ish) and I didn't get hours of porn, I got a 2 second Britney Spears nipple slip... I racked up a $700 phone bill playing doom2 like that.  Dad almost skinned me. damn the concept of the internet causing long distant charges on your phone bill just sound like the weirdest fucking thing ever to me lol It wasn't the Internet. It was a BBS system.

Similar thing happened to me when I was around 7 or so. There was an ad for a BBS in the back of a PopSci (I think), and I had no idea what an area code was. Logged in every day for a few weeks to check out their games, etc. Got in huge trouble when the phone bill arrived, although my parents understood I had no idea I was costing them money. 7?! Damn that is impressive. Back then if you called to a different area code it was considered long distance. It was a horrible time to be a kid getting into mischief Hell sometimes you got Long Distance charges in the *same* area code.  What a shakedown My mom let it slide when I said I had no idea what the charges were when I connected to the Software Creations BBS like 10 states away.

She had to have known, she called the number and it was a computer tone.  I was the only one using a computer. im 24 and i still get that wrong if i dont really think about it. I remember getting made fun of because I splurged for a 256MB stick of RAM. When buying our first family computer, a KFC, the salesman talked us into getting less ram because if the computer was to fast we may input a code wrong and not be able to see what we did wrong.  See thing is, that's not an exaggeration.  DOS was a fickle bitch. Man, I'm more concerned with selecting the right character in Vi than typing something wrong in DOS. After all, it doesn't matter until you hit enter. I misread this as "the guy at KFC said to get less ram", I wondered what relation fried chicken had to computers of the nineties. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard but it's hilarious! Oh how the times have changed. That's why PCs had a 'Turbo' button that made it only run half as fast.. It was actually true. DoS used live input from interupts, you could run a command and clear the screen faster then then the screens draw rate.

Also on the correct processor speed you could type faster then DOS could read your key strokes.

DOS was weird. Wait.. wouldn't a salesman want you to spend more instead of less? I remember when 64MB of RDRAM for my power Mac 7200 was $400. That wasn't even apples pricing.  My cousin connected to an Australian city's MSN because it has the same name as a local city.  The bill was 4 digits. Man, phone companies made so much money off of such simple mistakes. I don't know how it was possible, but I found a BBS with a free connection to the internet. I think it was in Nevada. I was in New York.

The phone bill was huge and my parents were pissed. I remember my dad literally crying when he got the second bill.

I also remember trying to play Doom on Dwango, but we couldn't afford it. So I made account after account with a credit card generator program. I was a dumb kid. I remember playing quake on dialup and used to get pissed off at the LPB's (Low ping bastards). Basically anyone under 400 ping was an LPB. those were the days lol yeah, they had a huuuuge advantage. By the time you see them, there's already a rocket detonating next to you. Man I loved that game

**dog mode** Was that,...was that an eyeball? [Ludicrous gibs!](http://imgur.com/Tza6Mv9) my 7 year old self pretty much thought it was an Achievement  to get the eyeball on the screen That was such a good game. It had two features that combined into my first memorable gaming moment. First, they had doors that opened vertically that, if you were standing in them when they closed, would crush you. Second, occasionally enemies would get on their knees and surrender.

So some mook had gotten on his knees. I contemplated killing him for a few seconds, but decided to spare him. I walked passed him only to hear the thunk of a door shutting and the crunch of a body. I turned to find the poor bastard had surrendered on top of one of those hydraulic doors, and when I went out of range it murderized him. *No.. no don't shoot! Noo... Auugh! (feign's death).*

I turn and walk away and the fucker shoots me in the back. Serves 10 year old me for being merciful.
 I always think Calvin and Hobbes any time I see "Augh" used instead of "Argh". Which of course in addition to Doom, Wolfenstein, and Quake, I was also raised on Calvin, Far Side, and Tom and Jerry, &amp; Looney Tunes... No wonder I'm a twisted smartass Haha that's probably where I got it from. Never really thought about it til now ... *contemplates entire existence* Those fuckers also stole your extra weapon. You don't know how scary a game can get until a mostly harmless mob wields a firebomb. It also had trampolines and enemies getting thrown around. I played ROTT off of the Duke nukem 3D install disk as like a demo but it seemed to go on forever like it was a full game but could only play as Taradino. I've looked for a way to get ROTT but the only thing i could find was ROTT: Dark War, which doesn't have the same maps. Anyone know if there is a way to get just the original ROTT? ROTT Dark War is the retail version of ROTT. The shareware, ROTT: HUNT Begins actually had completely unique levels, an entire chapter in fact. I'm unaware of a place to download Begins by itself, but it's included with full copies of Dark War, along with Extreme, a bonus level pack made for maximum difficulty. You can change which level pack to play through the settings config. Game is on GOG and Steam if you're interested, along with it's modern remake. Ah okay. I own it through GOG but was disappointed that it wasn't what I played on the shareware version. I'll take a look and see if I can get that to load when I get home today. Thanks! I've got a copy in my desk drawer at work.  If you want it, you can pry it from my dead cold hands.  http://imgur.com/99dNbqI
 That's awesome! I have a copy that easily installs and auto starts through DosBox!  Oh wow. Haven't heard of ROTT in YONKS!!!

Thanks for reigniting my.memories!!

"Behind ya!!" I haven't heard of ROTT in so long.  I remember as a kid using DOS commands to bring it up.  I think I only had the shareware version.  I had to have been like 7 years old, maybe younger.  All I remember from that game was the two pistols and typing in ROTT  to bring it up.
 That's the version I had.  I absolutely loved this game.  Along with Wing Commander and Commander Keen.  Oh oh and Blake Stone! You can relive all those memories in HD now, it's been remade.

http://riseofthetriad.net/web/app.php "Would you like to drive your car off a cliff?" replayed DOOM with all of that 1080p mouselook goodness recently. it was amazing. Right? My brother and I have a yearly tradition of playing through the entirety of DOOM II in Co-op every Christmas Eve. We're both in our 30's. Still so fun; brilliantly-designed levels. I've yet to see a shooter with better levels. E1 has the best level design in my opinion.  The lighting and the architecture just works.  

Doom 2 has some really good levels too, like 2, 9, 10 (fun fact, 10 was an alpha level cut from the first game), 15, and 26.  

And it's so easy to make your own levels.  Wadauthor ftw. Have you played TNT and Plutonia? Of all official episodes, I liked those the most. Yup.  There are many good ones in those episodes too, I just haven't played them nearly as much as Doom 1 and 2 so I can't list them off the top of my head.  Also note that those episodes weren't developed by id, but by amateur modders that id bought out.  I think plutonia was developed exclusively by two brothers.   Duke Nukem 3D had pretty awesome level design.  [deleted] "Unf! Unf! Whereisit?" Yeah, but fuck the sewers level.  QUAKE 1 by the SAME PEOPLE! Quake 1 is still amazing. And is the best quake. I don't even understand how quake 3 is related. Albeit quake 3 and quake live are great games.


Quake 1 has amazing music, sound effects and level design. I thought people thought that DOOM's level design was pretty much a maze you have to wander through like you're a Minotaur, I never played DOOM, so, eh... You might not dig the original due to how dated it is, but with this mod you might enjoy it.

http://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom

You can jump around and have mouselook enabled amongst other new features. Highly recommend. Give it a shot! It really stands the test of time pretty well. The level designs were all very creative given the limited assets that they had at the time, and the action was just fun! Proves that good level design and gameplay beats shiny graphics any day. Modders always find ways to improve the graphics later on anyway. Brutal Doom. Have you tried Brutal Doom? In my opinion, there is no other Doom than Brutal Doom. Brutal doom is so damned good. Try Brutal Doom. The shotgun is amazing. BOOM chachunk BOOM chachunk BOOM chachunk clak^clak^clak^clak^clak

The execution animations are amazing. You shove the shotgun up the guy's ass, lift him up in the air, and fire. You can also literally tear the pinkies in half with your bare hands. You can also shoot off enemies' legs and then curb stomp their heads in. Oh, did I mention everything explodes into gore?

Finally, there's the metal covers of the music that come with this mod. Enable the music pack, and it's even better. I've been playing Doom in my Oculus Rift. It's fantastic.

Unfortunately, other people seem to get motion sickness quickly and can't play. No deathmatch for me :( God damn you just made me so jealous! That sounds like tons of fun! While Doom can now be played on a modded graphing calculator, at the time Doom required some serious hardware to play at it's highest settings. For some perspective Xbox Ahoy made a video on attempts to emulate Doom on the weaker Amiga systems and the solutions various developers attempted to make a playable FPS.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv6aJRGpz_A The is because the Amiga used planar graphics while games like doom used VGA's chunky graphics.

Chunky graphics had 1 byte per pixel meaning that setting a pixel was as simple as writing a single byte.

Planar graphics had 1 bit of each pixel in different planes, or segments of memory. This was great for hardware blitting (large sprites/blobs/etc) and raster effect but terrible for setting single pixels as that would require as many writes as there were bits in the pixel (plus reading, masking, etc).

The PCs also tended to have a much faster processor than the Amiga since business users were buying them with wide budgets and this drove Intel's R&amp;D. Also because the x86 cpu could multiply by 256 instantly, it was *incredibly* fast to do texture lookups on maps that were 256 wide and 1 byte per pixel (which was VGA). This is why so many games from that time had 256x256 texture maps.

Also, you could arrange the pallete into ramps of brightness, and then offsets your color value to make it darker or lighter, so it was also extremely fast (like 2 cycles) to do shading. All that is a lot harder on 16 bit color pixels. 

By the time machines were fast enough and we figured out how to do 16 bit fast on the cpu (386 era), the dedicated graphics cards were coming out, and we moved that stuff off the cpu.

source: Game developer since 1991, did a *lot* of VGA games. Not to mention, a lot of people forget that Doom had a "low res" mode (F5 irrc) that halved the horizontal resolution of everything and thus made it run at much higher FPS with larger view windows. By "forget," you mean didn't know. :P [deleted] That was really interesting. Thanks for posting! I remember in Doom II the final boss battle would crash if I took too long (too many creatures would spawn and I would run out of memory) It added a whole new sense of urgency to it! "xtra hard mode!" Computer: ^tick ^tick ^tick ^tickticktick

Me: Guess there is somebody around this corner.. This was my first experience with "lowering the resolution increases the frame rate" although at the time I was too young to fully understand. I was lucky enough to have a really fast family PC as a kid, so I never understood why so many games gave you the option to have a big border round the edge.. While there's a good post about Doom that's at least somewhat popular, I figure it would be a decent time to let everyone know about an AWESOME Doom mod that I was reminded of. There are a plethora of Doom mods that were made, but Brutal Doom is by far one of the best. It adds serious gore to the game, and a boner-inducing level of satisfaction upon each execution. Furthermore, it has multiplayer capabilities (I can't recall exactly how to get that to work though).

If you're a fan of Pre-Doom3 Doom you need to give this a try, seriously. The day I found it I spent around 9 hours playing over LAN with my best friends.

Again, that is "Brutal Doom":
http://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom

edit: To play online you need [Zandronum](http://zandronum.com/). Thanks to u/Catastrophe666 for the reminder! Give that man some upvotes. There isn't another game that let's me kick a demon in the balls, flip him off, and tell him to go fuck himself. Plus fatalities are sweet. Not to mention impale a guy through their ass with a shotgun and fire it. Oh, and literally rip pinkies in half with your bare hands. ... Aaaaand I just spent an hour on youtube watching Brutal Doom gameplay.  The speedruns are amazing. Holy shit, I don't know how they do it. Just play it instead. Even if you don't own a copy of Doom to get the .WAD from you can get the shareware (episode 1) wad for free and have brutal doom up and running in max 10-15 minutes. Episode 1 was the most memorable anyways. That looks pretty fucking awesome! It reminds me of old Duke Nukem in some ways. I also like the [Doomsday](http://dengine.net/engine) engine as well.  It gives you well-made fully 3D models and fully 3D mouse-look (undistorted up/down aiming) and HD textures and particles.   I like that that engine supports ChexQuest. Ohhh, I'm going to have to give that a look. What's really impressive is that Doom and Doom 2 were entirely 2D.  There are no sections of a map that are over/under another portion.  This was because the entire "3D" level is based on a projection of a 2D map.

It's also why there are certain bugs involving object "height".  For example, rockets and buttons only checks if you're within X/Y range, not Z range.  That means you can press buttons that are "above" or "below" you and that rockets don't have damage drop-off for height differences. They liked to call it 2.5D. To play multiplayer you need [Zandronum] (http://zandronum.com/), instructions are on the website.  I can absolutely guarantee this is the only way you'll play Doom from now on once you try it. Adds so much to the game, doesn't take anything away in the process. Builds the Doom that I'm sure id would have built if they had the resources to do so. Saw this post.. Now on stage 10 @ max difficulty.
Awesome find! And because any time I see DOOM it reminds me of this game; [DoomRL](http://doom.chaosforge.org/)

Enjoy :) Thanks, that looks great. I'm going to give it a try tonight. Our high school group project was to network the labs computers with token ring. We had an assortment of 386 machines and on 486 dx2 66. First test of the network was to run Doom. It would crash quite often but 8 player Doom was really something special then. Wow, I couldn't imagine Doom on a token ring setup. 

Our computer maintenance teacher would regularly let us come into his classroom and play Doom against each other. We would skip prep rallies and go play Doom instead. Those were some good times. Yes pretty much zero work was done for the rest of the term! Ah yes, I remember LAN parties when we were still using coax cables and terminators. Bit of a nightmare, but still good times. It's amazing to me just how many games come out every year that aren't as satisfying as the doom gun play was. Even Doom 3 wasn't as good as 1/2. As a kid playing DOOM, I called it the "less scary" mode. Or one of the console ports. My first Doom experience was on the 32X unfortunately. The window *was* larger than the OP though. Oh god, the 32x. My mom got it for me but couldn't afford any 32x games to go with it but claimed the man at the store said it would make my regular Genesis games faster, it did no such thing, but I told her it did anyway when she asked. I didn't want her to think she'd spent all that money for nothing. You're a good kid!

And the 32x must have meant some bragging rights at least. There was also a low quality mode which I believed was a hidden feature. You could access via F5.

It was about a decade later when I found out about it so I couldn't say how much performance it added. Are we talking a slow 486 here? Because I saw that video of that one guy who manage to port doom on to wax tablets.... No, we're talking 286 or 386 here. I had a 486dx Toshiba laptop that ran the shit out of doom no problem. At least a 386. It required 386 protected mode and 4MiB of RAM. It wouldn't run on a 286. can confirm, we had a 286 for more years than I'd have liked.  Doom would absolutely not run.  We were lucky to get Wolfenstein working semi-ok. Yep, I had a 386 until well past its expiry date. Doom would "run". To get reasonable playability it looked like this screenshot.

386DX25, 4MiB RAM -- not nearly fast enough. I remember a 486 dx2 66 was basically called the "Doom Machine". Benchmarking was performed with Doom back then. 486 would have been full screen. 486 dx2 was top of the line  in '93 when Doom came out IIRC Fire up the ol' 486  
Rely on HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE to get ya into that delicious post-1Mb RAM you bought  
Tweak config.sys for your new purchase with a little SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 H5 P330 T6 (better get that IRQ right or your mouse might not work!)  

... nothin' but gibs.  This whole routine was my first foray into PC tech support. Everything I know about computers today started with trying to get Doom running in DOS. That's almost my story, too - though I was already a bit of a household pro by the time I was playing Doom. 

I got my start with computer support when my family bought a 486 dx 50 (1994). Within the first 48 hours I'd wiped out c:\Windows (where 3.1 was installed) and I couldn't get to Minesweeper, Solitaire, or the sweet "arcade classics" game disk we bought. Compy went back to the shop and was re-loaded with software. 

Not two days later I did *nearly the same damn thing* - computer unusable, trashed parts of DOS, wiped my config files. The computer shop we bought from had given us all the floppies for our software (3.5" by this point, thank god). I was so deeply embarrassed that I opened the boxes and started reading manuals. I re-did DOS and Windows from the ground up. Loaded all my software again. Started learning.

Like you, I got started because I wanted to keep gaming. Hell, my first RAM install (4x 4M 30-pin SIMMs) was to get enough memory to play Doom well. I had the toughest time 'til I saw a PC repair show on TV and watched them install the chips diagonally. I was such a kid back then.. :) 

My first computer job for money came in '96. This summer will be my 19th year in the field. I don't build or repair PCs anymore - mostly I'm managing IT for major enterprises, building private clouds, running virtual environments to do IaaS and the like - but it all goes back to being a kid who just wanted to keep gaming.  it's for this reason I worry about kids that do nothing but play freemium games on an iPad. Will they be curious of the inner workings? I have a similar history where early DOS gaming on XT/286/486 taught me a lot about computers and got me into the industry in support roles, and moved up as a director later on.

There are cases of young people in the jailbreak community (although old enough to have a good start, Geohot comes to mind) trying to expand the functionality of controlled devices, so I know there is some hope though. I hesitate to use the word, knowing how diluted and distorted its definition has become, but hope rests with the hackers. 

There will always be kids willing to dig in, to learn, to explore, to occasionally break things in spectacular ways, to enjoy putting them back together again - it's my opinion that finding this trait and cultivating it should be one of the goals of any progressive society. 

Their hacking won't look like our hacking, but on the plus side, nobody said ours has to stop due to age. =)  Yup, the top notch for me was setting autoexec.bat with selectable settings from menu. This is exactly how I played the DOOM shareware trial on my 386sx 16Mhz. Good times. funny, i used to call it welding mask mode Are you running this on a calculator? My new calculator runs doom pretty smooth actually,  I actually wouldn't doubt it. Some of those new calculators are badass. 

I still think it's pretty impressive that you can get Doom to [run on a iPod Nano 2g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3_pp9A_l1I) Oh fuck it burns......

Dreamscape........ ALL RISE FOR THE YOUTUBE NATIONAL ANTHEM. It might be a printer. ;D Nice, we called it stamp mode Just leaving this here that you can mod Doom into a [MegaMan Deathmatch](http://cutstuff.net/mm8bdm/) game. Doom is the game that first taught to learn computers.  I had once seen the teacher playing Doom on a computer lab computer before class.  I thought, ok I need to be seated at THAT computer and figure out where this game is.  It was on Windows 3.11 at the time and i started to open every folder I could find. 

 I eventually found it and started playing it when the teacher was talking.  I had put it on mute but soon everyone started to stare at my computer and started to murmur.  I managed to quickly close it but the teacher was on his way to see what the fuss was.  I switched to the custom color selector and then said, oh everyone is just amazed with how customizable the computer is.  After the class all started to chuckle, he figured I was up to something and started to close my open folders then seen I had found the game.  

He then said if you finish your assignment early and accurately, students could play the game on their computers.  Needless to say, we were all very motivated in that class.   I never learned how to use the mouse to aim until Unreal Tournament :(

Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem 3D, Unreal, I was playing all those games with the left/right arrow keys set to *turn* left/right.  I did have look up/down set to pageup/pagedown for the occasional time I encountered a flying enemy. A bunch of us keyboard doom players would play deathmatch, and then one day a mouse user asked to join us.  We already had a whole meta built around that fixed turn speed with the arrow keys:  circle strafing each other, jinking left and right between shotgun rounds..  and this mouse guy just walks in and wrecks all of us, repeatedly.  It was enlightening, in a pissed off sort of way. That actually seems a really run way to play online. I always refused to shrink my screen like that back then. I'd play it on full screen even if I got 5fps. I remember making the decision fps didn't matter. I suspect the time I spent on Doom (and, later, Quake) running at sub-10fps every time I played contributed to me, in the present day, being happy with about 12fps or better. I remember getting a disk copy of Doom, rushing back home to install on my 386.  Then watching the monsters advance on me while aiming my gun frame. by. fucking. frame. 

It was unplayable.

Now whenever my computer is as slow as fuck, I always refer back to playing Doom on a 386. Should have pushed the "Turbo" button. My favorite thing to do in DOOM is to open up the console and spawn friendly monsters that kill other monsters. If you spawn a friendly Arch-Vile, all of the dead monsters it revives also become friendly. Nothing like having a horde of monsters and demons on your side.  I had to do this on Quake on my 486. Looking at that resoution, it's amazing that I put up with it. &gt; Brutal Doom 

god damn. what speed was your 486 ?
If only my 9 year old knew. I had the 66mhz 16mb ram Compaq.  I used to play CS and TFC like this in software mode. Times were tough  The pain is real. Hahahaha.  I so did this on my 386 SX.  Did it with Descent as well.  I remember that well when I had Doom 2 on a 386/33 I once basically destroyed a company network in order to play Doom all weekend with my coworkers.  It was a beautiful, pizza fueled nirvana. I feel like this could be an episode of Workaholics.  I could play doom 2 on a windows 3.1 in 1993. How fucking slow was your computer? Hell, by '95 you could play it full screen! This may be how I play inquisition before I get my new GPU. 486 DX/2 66! idspispopd Its not slow, its just differently abled... I dont know why I was expecting this to be a gif.... I watched the screen for like 30 seconds before I finally got the "riod shield mode" I should probably go back to sleep..... I remember playing Doom and Duke Nukem when I was 7...

And to think I haven't killed anyone yet, nor have I thought about it. 

But seriously, Doom was one of the best. lol [deleted] OP was speaking about the past hence the use of the word "called" and not "call". How does one acquire a PC slow enough to not play doom? Step 1: Be born around 1980 1981 to be exact 1974; I played Doom the same way on my 386.

 Oh, I was thinking it was taken recently Could well be, but nowadays OP could run it on his calculator if he wanted to, he was just reliving his childhood... uh... riotshieldiness? Maybe it was. But on a computer that didn't need riot shield mode.  1987 checking in, I remember playing Wolfenstien 3D for the first time with sound.  My dad and his friend were litterly jumping for joy when they got it going.   Yeah I was around when it came out and don't remember any performance problems.  My first PC was a 286 12MHz.   Very accurate. Never thought of it like that I have also played Doom on a 386 in DOS 5.0. Used to play silky smooth on a 486 which I believe ran at about 50mhz.  Now fitting the WAD (level) files on the hard drive required some planning.  I think our HD was only about 200 megs at the time, and I think the WAD was around 25 or so. Brings back so many memories lol can you believe the price of them things? 

I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. "Give me five bees for a quarter," you'd say.

Now where were we? Oh yeah: the important thing was I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones... I actually played rainbow six like that a bunch until I got a super duper voodoo 3500 Yup, we all had riot shield mode at one point. I think back to my first pc that ran doom, and i cannot imagine a slower PC existing. Press the + button! Our DOS system was fast enough, I used to shrink it when my brother would play just to piss him off. Can't do it I get DIMS GIVE THAT MAN A PROMOTION!  Only if he ran up and pulled the trigger. he should tie a string to the trigger so after he impales someone he can just pull the string back and BOOM! This idea needs more thought. I could see this in a game. cartoonish, borderlands-style game.. Except a chain instead of string, ya know, for durability. Hurl the rifle at the enemy like a spear and impale them, then yank the chain to fire the rifle directly into your enemy's chest and pull the rifle back to you in the same motion.   I could see this being very effective in a shotgun Can shotguns have bayonets on them? Anything can have a bayonet with enough duct tape and a large knife What about a bayonet on a pistol? Or even a bayonet on a knife?  http://pmd.edgarbrothers.com/images/postprocessed/pb-1t_on_mp_18.jpg

Not the most effective product. I wouldn't put that thing on any of my guns but I have some friends who bought this for kicks. http://i.imgur.com/7Nq7YIH.jpg "Affix bayonets!"

"But sir, all I have is a-"

"I said affix bayonets, soldier!" *Throws a roll of tape at you.*

"Siryessir!" *You tie a knife to your knife, and proceed to slaughter the enemy.* "Sir, it worked!"

"Yes, my boy. Now ascend beyond your mortal coils." If ur brave enough [how is this even a question?](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view3/1253236/watermelon-shotgun-bayonet-o.gif) It's super effective. Cabbage fainted. Garden is out of useable vegetables. Garden fled. Absolutely! I've already seen shotguns with suppressors on them IRL I've seen some pretty over the top tacticool shotguns at gun shows I love browsing the "tacticool" guns at gun shows WW1 trench shotguns were equipped with bayonets.  That's so OP, it's unfair. Harpoon + Boom-stick = Harboom I prefer "Boompoon" but to each his own... Evil Dead III; The return of Ash Evil Dead III is Army of Darkness But it would have to be shaped more like a spear or javelin and less like a rifle, no? A rifle is basically just a tube so you can change the shape of the stock pretty easily. Really if you're just going to throw it instead aiming down the sights  a javelin shape would work pretty well. GET OUGHTA HERE! 

-(scorpionvoice)  This is some God of War level shit.  Now that sounds badass.  I'm thinking of [this](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bolo+bat&amp;tbm=isch) with a semi-automatic rifle instead of a ball. I can see this in Bulletstorm. It wouldn't even feel out of place. That's some RWBY shit. New weapon confirmed. Monty pls

Edit: Fuck. Monty plz get better :(

Edit: fuck. RIP RIP :( Well, this is a shitty way to find out about this I mean, it just happened this morning. What? God damn it. Best of luck to all Rooster Teeth staff.  Yeah, I can't believe I missed that though, only to find out in these comments WHATTTTTTT
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!!!

NOOOOOOOOOOOOO, WHYYYYYYYYYY ;_; He has passed away. Rest in peace Monty:'( you might want to change that to RIP...
 What happened to Monty? Emergency Hospitalized for unknown reasons. Update: [he's dead.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RWBY/comments/2ujjvh/monty_oum_has_passed_away_xpost_from_rroosterteeth/) Well fuck.  All we know is that he's in critical condition in the hospital....you probably find more info at r/roosterteeth He's dead. http://www.reddit.com/r/RWBY/comments/2ujjvh/monty_oum_has_passed_away_xpost_from_rroosterteeth/ RWBY? More specifically, it's very similar to how the secondary form of [ Blake's weapon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImKCt7BD4U4#t=130) works in RWBY.

Basically, in the show most weapons have two different forms, usually a melee form and a gun form. Many characters use the recoil from the gun part to give them additional momentum in their swings, or even help them jump higher. Here's an [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctiDu69kIho) with an awesome fight scene. Fight starts at 5:55 if you feel like skipping.

*Edit: Aaaaand the creator of the show just passed away. :( Super sad right now. Both seasons of the show are on Netflix for anybody that wants to watch it. It's also on Youtube. That... That clip was something special.  The whole show is something special. You should go watch it all on Netflix. Or on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sGiE10zNQM) if you don't have Netflix. The first season is pretty good, the second season is great. Unfortunately, the quality of the show will undoubtedly drop since the creator and lead animator passed away yesterday, but what better way to honor him by introducing new people to his dream. Wow. Turns out he had a standard medical procedure, had an allergic reaction that put him in a coma.

Never recovered from it and passed. RIP.

I'll always remember him from the days of Dead Fantasy. Damn. That hammer chick Pwns.  Rooster teeth show on YouTube  And netflix now!   Wow, it made it to Netflix ? That's awesome ! It's crazy. I remember going to roosterteeth.com to watch RvB argue with eachother back in Blood Gulch. Then they moved to Halo 2, and then 3, and then mocap, and now they are actually becoming a production studio!

It's awesome that something that used to be so small has grown to such an amazing size.

Wow. Makes me feel old.

EDIT: Fuck. 33 years old.. Rest in peace Monty. You were one of a kind, and we will never forget you. [RWBY](http://roosterteeth.com/archive/?id=7872&amp;v=more&amp;s=1) FUCK. I really dont need this right now, Ive got shit to do. Fuck, we Reddit hugged it to death. Does RWBY stand for something? Red/Ruby

White/Weiss

Yellow/Yang

Black/Blake

Name of the colors and main 4 characters. R.I.P Monty Oum. Don't think they know yet but yes, he will be missed It wasn't a Reddit hug, the creator of RWBY, Monty Oum, just passed away. All the fans are crashing the site to read the newspost. Rooster Teeth video series. Haven't watched it but it's apparently quite popular. Its an animated show on YouTube by Roosterteeth Hot damn youre right. Which has both seasons on netflix now! Get better Monty :( Sorry to break it to you but he has passed away, he will be missed ;( Fucking Christ man I was thinking just cause *Fire seldom, but accurately. Thrust the bayonet with force. The bullet misses, the bayonet doesn't. The bullet's an idiot, the bayonet's a fine chap. Stab once and throw the Turk off the bayonet. Bayonet another, bayonet a third. A real warrior will bayonet half a dozen and more. Keep a bullet in the barrel. If three should run at you bayonet the first, shoot the second and lay the third out with your bayonet. This isn't common, but you haven't time to reload.* -- Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov I always preferred this one:

"The bullet is a mad thing, only the bayonet knows what it is about." - Same guy as above He most likely pulled the trigger, THEN threw the rifle. But that's not as badass. well if he shot one guy and threw the rifle at another that would be a really badass double kill.
 "That's now how you're supposed to... oh ok then" "That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works!" ["GET A MUSTACHE!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6c4CP_YN3Q) What game is this? OP's photo is from Total War: Shogun 2.  The video (which you're asking about) is from Mount &amp; Blade, Napoleonic Wars DLC.

Everyone seemed to have a really hard time answering your question in a non-confusing way.  heh Mount and blade warband, with Napoleonic DLC Man, the Game of Thrones mod for M&amp;B is amazing! Ah yes CHKilroy. His ArmA videos are legendary. This NPC needs his own franchise.   Gunslinger? God, could you imagine a Gunslinger video game set in a sandbox version of Roland's world before the fall of Gilead? You could play as one of his ancestors, dealing justice in a world slowly moving on. Hints of sci-fi, fantasy, magic, all rolled into a first person shooter.  Dark Tower would break the video gaming world. Nothing could compare to it... Dark Tower -well done- would break the gaming world. Hell's bells, Dark Tower well done would also break the movies/series world. Imagine Dark Tower on HBO with Game of Thrones budget. Not a lot of people could comprehend the absolute mind fuck.  and I would refuse to watch it. I couldn't emotionally deal with [the death of Oy](/spoiler) again. Ake? You're a monster for making me sad. 'Hell's bells'? 
You are clearly needed in /r/dresdenfiles. Not everyone will get that reference. Maybe it will inspire them to find the series and fall in love.  What series? I didn't even get that.

Am I in /r/gaming again? I never get anything there. The Dark Tower series by Stephen King. It's a story of a gun wielding knight errant in a dying world, questing after the lynch pin of the universe in an attempt to save his world or at least discover its meaning. It spans multiple genres and ties the majority of King's stories together into a kind of running war between order and chaos. Highly recommend it.  Stephen Knig's Dark Tower series - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_%28series%29 I shall be ordering and reading this series immediately.  If you don't quite get what the fuss is about in the first book that's okay. The first book is alright. It has a few really good lines, but it didn't exactly blow me away. The second book is where things really pick up though. It's one of my favorites of the series. 

Note: The first book is pretty short too, so you'll get to the good stuff soon enough. The hell with them. Gun*flinger*! Guys put the name of the game in the title when you post stuff like this. It's in the sidebar. On a side note, RIP samurai.  I don't think it's in the sidebar any more.

Anyway, the game is Total War: Shogun 2's DLC Fall of the Samurai. That right there is a man who had enough of everyone's bullshit. I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THESE MOTHERFUCKING SAMURAI ON THIS MOTHERFUCKING PLAIN If there's one thing reddit loves, it's (s)word play Only good ones though.  Just take the fucking up-votes please.  Is this a Total War game?  Yes it is, it's total war shogun I believe it's the fall of the samurai DLC [This is correct.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/201271/)

(Super awesome game, by the way) Its' just so expensive. Worth every penny, between the workshop mods and the amazing game on its' own i have sunk probably 500 hours into fall of the samurai alone. 

Long live artillery.  I have Shogun 2, fall of the samurai, empire and Rome II. So much fun but I am bad at all of them haha. Apparently large scale strategy is not a skill that comes naturally to me.  But nobody could lose at Empire No one could win either; pretty sure you were given a medal if you made it 10 turns without it crashing. &gt; No one could win either

Haha, gave me a laugh. You're damned right nobody wins, not if the hundred single-man-stacks of the Ottoman Empire can do anything about it. Or a single schooner blockades every one of your ports You should try Napoleon and Medieval II. I think MII is the best of all the TW games if you can deal with some outdated graphics.

Rome II was a complete disaster though. Rome 2 was a completely disastrous launch. The game is utterly polished now, and the AI isn't half bad anymore. They still can't manage sieges though. Yep, Rome2 did a complete 180 post launch. With the relaunch of the title under the 'Emperor Edition' name it's actually well worth buying. &gt;They still can't manage sieges though.

Played Napoleon and Shogun and can tell you that the AI has never really been able to siege well. Unless they just completely outnumber you, you'll pretty much always win. Interestingly, MTWII was the only one that implemented a "change armor appearance" as you upgrade. Rome *sorta* had that with the gradual transition to segmentata in one of the legionnaire units. I think it's a wonderful and underused mechanic. Artillery strikes so awesome. Did you capture the european gunship yet? No:( 
I tried a few times but wound up having to sink it due to heavy loses. 
I'm much more suited to destroying stuff. Torpedo boats make up half my navy in FoTS. 
That blackship...that thing is terrifying There's torpedo ships? Damn, I only have the original Shogun II and I thought it was kinda boring compared to the earlier titles. They are glass cannons. If you can get em close enough to get a torpedo into your enemy, that enemy is royally and majorly fucked. On the other hand, it's insanely easy to sink those little torpedo dingies. 
I love em, but you almost have to practice aiming and leading torpedoes, and you will most likely have to first person aim to hit anything Holy crap, apparently I only saw the tip of the iceberg with Shogun II, the DLC sound way more interesting I have it and just fucked around in one random custom battle...I was losing (Just left all my rifleman in a line) until those Gatling guns came online...mmm Steam sales man! It's a way of life.  I got shogun 2 and all the expansions for about 20USD I think. Add that shit to your wish list. They'll even email you when it goes on sale. Did not know this. Thanks! with the fall of the samurai its the best total war game by far.  Otherwise known as the Tom Cruise expansion pack Furthermore it's a mod. Bayonet fighting isn't in the game for some reason so when they modded them in they gave the rifle troops spear fighting animations for close quarters. It works out pretty well until someone hurls his rifle, then it's awesome.   yeah looks like shogun 2 I wonder if it ever happend in real life. In the book "Breakout" By Martin Russ, about the 1950 Chosin campaign where US Marines were surrounded by Chinese and North Korean soldiers, this happened.  A US Marine sergeant's M1 Garand rifle had completely frozen up due to the unbelievable cold that winter.  He threw the entire weapon directly at a charging Chinese soldier, and killed him.  The other Chinese were so demoralized when they saw this that they ended the charge and retreated back down the hill.

 I read that book about 10 years ago and that particular moment really stuck with me.  you would think they would be like "hey, that guy doesnt even have a gun anymore!" and... you know... not run away from him.  It might have been that the person he killed was solely responsible for the groups moral, maybe the groups leader or just somebody who had been keeping them all alive, or the story in the book might be completely made up/heavily embellished.  My dad is a Vietnam veteran.  He always says the only difference between a fairy tale and a war story is that a fairy tale starts with "Once upon a time..." while a war story starts with "This is no shit..." Is that to say that war stories are frequently as *false*  as fairy tales or as *unbelievable* as fairy tales?  Yes.  They say that for every profession. My dad's a sailor, same exact saying. If a guy killed one of your friends by flinging his rifle, you probably wouldn't want to stick around and see what he could do with his sidearm.  &gt; When a man with a .45 meets a man with a rifle, the man with the pistol will be a dead man, because he got impaled by the rifle guy throwing his rifle. But then the man with the rifle won't have a rifle anymore, so he'll just be an unarmed man and anyone else can just, like, shoot him or whatever.

*-Ramon Rojo*, A Fist Full of Dollars (1964) ^(Note: Quote was slightly edited down in the movie for a shorter run-time.) Yea they were charging into rifles, but the thrown one is what demoralized them. Completely believable  Like most of these feel-good propaganda stories it's probably quite a bit "embellished" ... or outright fake to sell a book. I like to imagine that they had more rifles than bullets and the Chinese simply staggered down the hill in confusion and to go get something to hold all their shiny, new weapons in. 

My biggest doubt in the "actual" story, however, is how did sufficient enough soldiers witness this that they retreated? In the chaos of combat, especially a charge, how do a large number of people notice something like that?  Of course. But only with Tediore^^^TM muskets, which will be rematerialized in your hand after throwing them. &gt;Some muskets were designed to be used with a bayonet, which is a triangular spike or blade designed to fit onto the end of the musket's barrel, allowing the musket to be used as a pike or spear. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musket

**edit**

What I was trying to imply is, that rifles were thrown from time to time to spear an enemy if the opportunity presented itself. Yes, theyre not *designed* to be thrown. But if you had the chance to chuck your rifle at someone and spear them with it, then it was done, regardless of what its actually intended for. In times of war, you use what you have to kill the enemy, by any means necessary. Even if that means throwing your non-aerodynamic rifle.

And yes, I know OPs image is not of a Musket. Same concept in regards to the person I was replying to; A rifle with a bayonet that *could* be thrown, if you had to. Especially while cavalry was still a force to be reckoned on the battlefield. Look at the awesome retreat of Napoleon and specifically the formation "carr". Well trained infantrymen could fend off cavalry charges and infantry alike. Is there some other way to use the rifle, Mister War Expert?  **HEY EVERY ONE. CHECK OUT MR WAR GUNNINGTON OF SHOOTSHIRE OVER HERE!** Now he needs to walk up to the samurai and pull the trigger before taking his gun out...  What is this Mortal Kombat? FINISH HIM!! HISTORIC FATALITY! "FUCK, I'M OUT OF BULLETS BILLY, WHAT DO I DO? WHAT DO I DO? ... WAIT, I GOT IT!" &gt; BILLY SAN

FTFY I believe this game is Fall of the Samurai and am wondering why this wasn't the main promotional poster. [To be fair, they didn't exactly slouch on the advertisements they made.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3-VkbRSKQ) Wow that was depressing. All the romance that went into their swords and fighting technique juxtaposed against a mass produced Gatling gun which ripped them apart before they even got close. The feels.  Though a gatling gun unit left by itself was easily routed by light cavalry in that game. Kind of like how awesome modern military technology and weaponary is and all, but an extremely advanced army can still get wiped out with a single nuke. It's dumb that they never show how pure evil the samurai could be. Since they are Japanese, they are depicted as caring white knights. In reality, the Samurai were feudal warlords. They would kill people they didn't like just for the hell of it. Nobody could do anything about it because the Samurai were so well prepared for combat. I'd do the same thing with how long it took to reload those things. They're a little faster than you may expect. They look like [Chassepot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chassepot) or [Gras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusil_Gras_mle_1874) rifles, which are both French single shot bolt actions--so no ramrod, etc. required.

The former used a paper cartridge, which could foul up the breech to the point of unusability, so maybe that's why this guy threw his. The Gras is wrong for the time period, though, as FotS depicts the Boshin war (1868-1869). So of those it'd be based on the first one i guess. Ah, I wasn't sure about the time setting. Certainly the Chassepot, in that case. I thought they already had repeating rifles by that point? Repeating rifles and gatling guns just started being relatively widely used at that point, yes. And Japan wasn't exactly able to outfit their armies with the latest and greatest equipment from across the ocean. They just didn't have the money. That's a breach-loading rifle, you can tell by the little knob just above the trigger - that opens the breach and pulls back the bolt, and you just slip another cartridge in there.  No mucking about with powder and balls and such.  It's also period-accurate. SHOUT OUT TO /R/TOTALWAR 
Check it out, great game and great community.  I've played shogun 2 FOTS so many times and I did not know this was possible. It isn't, there are no bayonets in vanilla FOTS. You have to install the bayonet mod which gives the riflemen some AI from yari ashigaru, and you sometimes end up with soldiers throwing their rifles round. No bayonets?! Only because all riflemen are equipped with a sword Damn, I really miss playing strategy games. Makes me wish I invested in a gaming pc instead of a ps4. Trade in. You'd be surprised how little you'll need to spend. If you do decide to make the switch, I'd be happy to help you figure out a build. /r/buildapc will point you in the right direction too. Thanks a lot for the offer and kindness. I'll remember that when I decide to make the change!  no, I have not https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHkt5oEv_sI Some days I've done that. I wouldn't recommend it; nowadays I try anger management techniques before I throw things at samurai. My life has gotten a lot more stable recently Maybe it was malfunctioning. They still have the bayonets attached, so this is quite effective way of killing people. What game is that?  It looks awesome. Have you ever had a dream? 
http://youtu.be/G7RgN9ijwE4 Have you ever been so pissed off that you line up all your troops in a goddamn row and the winner is whichever side isn't completely wiped out? Shamefur Dispray The samurai kinda deserved it, bringing a naginata to a musket fight... http://i.imgur.com/gNVkN.png i wish the name of the game was included in every post title...anyone else? Shamefur dispray! Must have been so pissed he forgot that he could shoot him  It looks like a front loading rifle, at those ranges, you shoot once, because reloading takes a loooong time and will get your head cut off by a samurai, throwing it bayonet first into said samurai isnt as stupid as it looks. At least it has a bayonet attached. Yes once, it was a long story that involves A duck, fishing, the entire nation of Cuba and a space ship full of aliens.  I think the Samurai got the point of the war.  No, but Tom Cruise has.  Not even a glitch, he actually meant to throw the rifle. Guess they do this after running out of ammo. No, but I know a fellow Drill Sergeant that has flipped shit and thrown a M16. "If it's stupid and it works, it's not stupid." -some guy It's a musket, 90 seconds to reload vs throwing it as a spear - he might've made the right choice here... Ideally he has a string attached to the handle, and with an utterance of "GET OVER HERE!" he gets his rifle back! And uppercuts a samurai as well! lol It is actually a breach loading rifle, but at the same time, those rifles used paper cartridges which commonly fouled the gun up so you would have to clean it before firing again. An empty rifle with a bayonet on it can also be called a spear. how cool would it be if people used their guns like this, and force of the impact caused their guns to fire, shooting the man at point blank  ...the resulting recoil propelling the rifle out of the victim and back into the hands of the badass dude? 

Yes please. I wish that had been in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.  I'd like to imagine that the John Wilkes Bootherang scene was filmed but got cut. I think I watched an anime with a hammer where contact with the enemy triggered an explosion for a piston to ram into the enemy. Jack Churchill: the early years. This unit was obviously upgraded from a Zulu Impi. I'm always that pissed, but there's never any samurai around. This is actually how I felt after that play call by offensive coordinator Darrell bevell last night. Yes Makes the Wii U gamepad seem compact by comparison Strange japanese guy befriends you a couple of years, forgets a strange nintendo-product in your house, and disappears for good. The product spreads through the Internet and suddenly everyone thinks the Wii-pad feels small and handy.

Coincidence I think not.  This is exactly what happened and whats going to happen Some top professional melee player needs to use this in tournament.

Mango pls delivar. Dude I don't know what I'd do if a pro player contacted me to use it Shit yourself. It's always a solid plan in situations like this.  &gt; Shit yourself.

Sometimes it's not so solid. Can confirm: just shitted myself. But did you plan it though? [deleted] Hey no need to bring [him](http://i.imgur.com/TMYHKFk.jpg) into this. *It's dangerous to go alone, here, take this* *Oh, thanks old man, that is really very nice*

Korean DJ using one. "Can you email people while you play?" Give this guy a raise. KDJ used one of these at least once, something to do with it being heavier than a regular controller He had an injury I believe and that controller was more comfortable to use. People with carpal tunnel have reported that it's more comfortable. Smashers also tend to tense up a lot, and can cause undue stress on certain muscles and tendons, having your arms further apart is more comfortable if you've injured one of those tendons.  calling /u/iamhungrybox in case mango doesn't deliver. I will gladly take it, and dedicate a night of streaming to it.

I'm gonna use it to talk to chat while I play them in netplay. It would be beautiful. AND WE HAVE A WINNNER FOLKS!!!!!!!!!! This was released worldwide. Mostly used for playing Phantasy Star Online (while the Dreamcast used a dedicated keyboard+mouse, the Gamecube had this accessory). Yep, I had one to play PSO on the ol' Cube. Sold it for a pretty penny some years later. I was surprised when I held the Wii U's gamepad for the first time.  Way more comfortable than I thought it'd be.   Made playing Phantasy Star Online easier but not much else. Yeah, I never got into PSO as much as he did... So now I just have this huge controller that people like to look at but not much else. I guess it's kind of a nifty collectors item. Dude. I'm still playin PSO... me too. Online right now with Blue Burst on a new Hunewearl.  GC is still online? I thought SEGA shut the network dow.... wait a minute... Are you using pipe? I think Blue Burst was the PC re-release. It was, but online with the PC version, I think all console versions have private servers up at the moment. The dreamcast version does, not sure about the cube version.

reddit made me wait 9 minutes to post this for some reason. Had to reroute it to the NSA first. You set off some kind of trigger.  The NSA *really* likes PSO Hah, NSA has their shit together, probably dropped a packet or a backend failed over to secondary system... ;) Well I am Hispanic... dreamcast is the name of the newest psychedelic to hit the market. Not enough comment karma probably. IIRC the Gamecube version does have a server online [Sylervant](http://sylverant.net/connecting-to-sylverant/) has servers up for the GameCube. There are private servers for all versions of the game. Unless in the few years since I last played, they took down some. Been playing Dreamcast PSO since 2001 and am still playing on a private server. Still some of my best friends and gaming memories How are you getting online? I used to use a free dialup company for the Dreamcast cause I had cable internet, but my Dreamcast only had the dialup modem. I recently tried logging back in to PSO using the old ISP numbers, but that company has long since vanished. And I still haven't seen a cable modem for the Dreamcast cost less than $100. There are a few people still playing on Gamecube on www.schtserv.com but the majority of people either play Blue Burst for PC on the same private server, or they are playing Phantasy Star Online 2.

I would guess there would be more people on Dreamcast if the broadband adapters weren't so retardedly rare/expensive. I bought a broadband adapter in 2002. We switched over to broadband pretty qucikly so I made the investment back then. Cant tell you how much I paid for it. I have it plugged into my Computer and share the connection through it. Google Schthack You could bring it to a smash bros tournament and use it to stand out. If I hear of any in my area I might... but only if it's smash 4 cause all the characters I like are on that one lol Shhh don't say that on reddit, don't you know melee is the second coming of Christ? My best characters are Shulk, Rosalina, Ness, and Duck Hunt... So I wouldn't do well at a Melee tourney even with this fab keyboard ***SOMEBODY SAY MELEE?!? FOX ONLY, FINAL DESTINATION, NO ITEMS, 4 STOCKS. LET'S GO!!!!*** http://i.imgur.com/SDdIlLk.png DK BONGOS ONLY. Weird, most of the melee elitists I know have no problem with 4 at all. The items are a bit much, but they're never on anyway. And there's such a nice variety of final destinations. lol like anyone has any gamecube controller adapters for you to plug that into anyways Its the ultrapredecessor to the wii U Shadow box it with the original GCN controller. I think it would make a nice piece. If I had the money, I would consider it... currently unemployed. Yeah I used to be really into PSO back in high school when it was big. I always wanted one of these, but I never got one, so I just became really good at using the on-screen keyboard. I would talk to people online and everyone was always so amazed at how fast I typed without a keyboard. It was like my special/completely useless skill. Now look where its got you Yess, 8 points on reddit a decade later. My ultimate goal. If you put it on your resum/Cv I'll upvote every post you make AND friend you! Consider it done.

Can type super fast using ONLY the on-screen keyboardYOU HEARD RIGHT.
 You might get a job as an on screen cursor  it's also nifty in a fight Almost as deadly as the Klingon bat'leth. The Nintendonians have no honor! "Captain, I must object- I am not a gaming man!" [It's worked before!](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view2/1130578/wanted-keyboard-smack-o.gif) If someone came at me with one of those I would run ... straight to the atm so you could buy it That's why I have a Dreamcast keyboard. Good times... The best of times! I used a keypad in Monster Hunter 3 for multiplayer. I had a generic mini keypad with a trackball mouse I used for my HTPC. I plugged the USB receiver into the Wii and was amazed that it actually accepted typing input. It really is universal. Typing of the dead. Greatest game on the dreamcast It was also good for typing letters in Animal Crossing.  :) Wait... You could use this with Animal Crossing!? After further research it appears I was wrong.  I remember specifically buying a keyboard to play, but I must be thinking of the Wii version. LPT: you can play AC on wii too.   unless you mean specifically the wii version only. AC on the Gamecube wasn't programmed to use the keyboard.  I do remember having a keyboard (because typing letters was so tedious) but it must have been the Wii version of AC.

Although I'm not sure if this keyboard would work with AC on the Wii... only one way to find out, slap that sucker in and try. I sunk so much time into that and still my main was only lvl 120. I wish I still had a working copy, I miss that game. Blue Burst never did it for me, wasn't the same.

Probably one of the better co-op games I've played.  It allowed me to email people while I played [smash bros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnz6PA1GbCM). No joke, I will buy this from you.  Haha. I'm not sure if I'd sell it. Technically, it's not mine, but I haven't heard from the guy in years...

I'd be lying though if I hadn't thought about trading it for a Shulk amiibo, though. OP I'll buy you a Shulk amiibo and you can keep the controller. 

My exam got postponed and I'm in a giving mood today 

Edit: Called 6 Game Stops, they said all of the amiibos are for pre-order only so moving onto eBay

Edit2: [Delivered](http://i.imgur.com/HlK22dJ.jpg)

Edit3: Thank you for the gold kind sirs! :)  I would love you forever if this happened.
EDIT: HE DELIVERED! /u/truegamer1 made a shitty week so much better for me.  Please tell me if this actually happens You'll be the first to know Wouldn't you and the buyer be the first to know? He'd be third?  Touche... OP Delivered! But you're OP Touch But you're not OP Touch Sent you a link to the one I'm planning on getting for you. 

Let me know if it's correct and if so,  PM me where you'd like me to send it That's some /r/UpliftingNews stuff right there, grats. :) Reddit is pretty cool sometimes. On top of being a legend, I just stalked through ur comment history out of curiosity. I can just feel the positivity radiating out from your comments. The reason I checked is I saw the other day someone who just randomly argued (aggressively) with someone, checked his history and all his comments felt negative or just trying to start arguments. I was wondering if maybe I was just projecting a little bit or if that's what the general reddit user's comments look like. But no, you just seem like a real swell dude! Keep being awesome. Thanks so much for letting me know! I try to be the change I want to see in this world (or at least in reddit) , so I'm really glad my positivity is helping others too! 

Hope you have a great day!  He probably died :( Sell it. Haha, He's alive, just haven't seen him in years.

And I was honest about the Shulk amiibo thing. Someone trade this man a Shulk amiibo Yeah, right. No one has a fucking shulk amiibo. You know what's up. Chuggaaconroy does. I don't think he'd trade it. Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time. Hey. I'll find you a Shulk amiibo if you can promise you'll trade it to me :B I have 2 Shulk amiibos but I also have that controller.

http://i.imgur.com/cNa6GwH.jpg pls OP Deliver pls Well then someone better deliver me a goddamn shulk Someone get this OP a Shulk stat! The power to make OP deliver is in your hands, Shulk-owners Who the fuck is Shulk I'm pretty sure if you have something of someone else's for so many years it legally becomes yours Squatter's rights? Nah I believe it's covered in the "Finders Keepers Losers Weepers" section of the Constitution, directly below the "Liar Liar Pants on Fire" clause [Adverse possession](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_possession). http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-GameCube-ASCII-Keyboard-Controller/dp/B0000694RM Wow 200$, was a bit more than I expected for a controller that is basically for one game. Had to import this thing for like $70 with shipping. Took three weeks to come in.

...and then they came out with a Gameshark keyboard that had a USB adapter for PS2/XBOX/GC for like $20. Buh. ..a keyboard adapter for gameboy? Probably meant GameCube. Gotta name those pokemon with lightning speed! Fixed. &gt; "lost touch"

Admit it OP, you killed them.  [You mean to tell me this was worth karma?](https://i.imgur.com/PQaYZaa.jpg) I have had mine ever since I used it to play PSO GC for years.

I was named Ace(SWAT) if anyone remembers me. Legit level 196 RAmar on Gamecube, although I played on DCv1, DCv2, PC, and GC.

On my main character I broke the playtime counter, at 9999 hours and 95 minutes.

I used that game as a meditative tool to survive bedridden near-death. It is very close to my heart. That game was the first online game I ever played. I was bedridden for the first 17 years of my life. I started with PSO DCv1 with dial-up on my dreamcast when I was 10 or 11 years old. The conversations I had with people through that game were some of the only things that kept me sane during my bedridden years. I am out of touch with nearly everyone from those days. I helped a lot of depressed and suicidal people back then. If only they knew how young I was at the time.

edit: thank you, whoever you are. I have never had reddit gold before. Why, if you don't mind me asking, were you bedridden for so long? Additionally, what caused you to become not-bedridden? I don't mind at all.

I was bedridden due to the combination of an illness and abuse at the hands of my mother. The illness was poorly understood, and at the time of my sickness in 1990 highly controversial. It has a lot of names.

* Multiple Chemical Sensitivity
* Gulf War Syndrome
* Environmental Illness
* Sick Building Syndrome
* Toxicant Induced Loss of Sensitivity
* Idiopathic Environmental Intolerance

also my mother is psychotic and has munchhausen by proxy.
and she medically tortured me and experimented on me.
one of the things she put me through was heavy metal chelation therapy, at home, without professional medical supervision. hand capped pills and her own always changing protocol.

200 pills a day for 6 months.
100mg dimercapto succinic acid,
100mg alpha lipoic acid,
every 3 hours, including at night. Acids/'chelating agents' on 3 days, off 4 days. All the other pills every 4 hours every day for 6 months.

No painkiller.

I'm writing this quickly because I have to go get my girlfriend from work soon, but that's the gist of what she did plus what was already there keeping me in that sickbed.

As for how I got better.. did I? I'm still struggling very much. AMA! AMA! AMA! If there is enough interest, sure. I have to leave soon to get my girlfriend from work. When I get back later tonight I will go through and respond to every last message people care to send me. I always tend to do that.

I am an open book and welcome any question Perhaps you should start a thread on /r/casualiama I made the thread, you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/2vljop/i_was_bedridden_for_the_first_17_years_of_my_life/).

I will be leaving soon, but I will answer questions when I get back from my errands. I will answer every question. Jesus fucking Christ this sounds like the plot of a tragic movie. So sorry :(. It's okay. To be alive is a joy I remember you! I was Jubei Yagyu and Gospel.  I REMEMBER YOU!!!!! :D I never even knew you had so much going on! When I played PSO I was in a horrible spot in my life, as well! I had no identity, was being tortured by my ex, and a HUcast got together with a group of people to, literally, save my life. It's crazy how small of a community it was, and how pivotal it was in our lives. The game itself was simple and repetetive.
The people made the game alive.
It was so zen. attack attack attack. Your three button rhythm.

I think sega stumbled onto something accidentally wise with the formula they had there. That's over 416 full days of play time. Yes, it is. I promise you I really didn't have anything better to do. I was sick and stuck in my bed. This is not bragging, it's a monument to my morbid delirious sleepless solitude. I needed a PS2 version of one of those for Final Fantasy XI on PS2 back in the day  Couldn't you just use any USB keyboard? Yeah, but man using a keyboard to move for final fantasy 11 was hard. You didn't use wasd for a long time, you used the numpad. Maybe the playstation got a wasd movement keys but pc didn't for years.  I played FFXI on a PC and ended up getting a PS2 to USB adapter and macroing everything. Lots of L1-R-R-R-X to do stuff. I just got used to the keyboard. Now I play 11 or 14 with the keyboard only. 
I'm faster than a mouse/keyboard user. 
 [Logitech made them.](http://images10.newegg.com/NeweggImage/ProductImageCompressAll300/26-102-208-01.jpg) 
 That's the one I have...used it for FFXI, it was still running strong for FFXIV on PS3!  I saw that in a museum once. Apparently gaming pioneers would take them along when obtaining checkpoints in uncharted regions of gaming.

They'd use these tools to saw down trees which they'd burn to run their steam powered consoles.

Two people would grab one handle each and stand on opposite sides of the tree for greater dps (depth per second). 

This was a sequel to the early traditions of primitive co-op where each player took turns pushing a giant wheel to power consoles while the other played. 

Some say that's were the two guys from Contra got their rockin biceps. This was too deep for me. Gonna go outside and play with some dirt. Dirt's frozen, gonna play with snow.  10/10 Am I to late to get some karma. I have even saved the original box. I loved the hell out of PSO.

http://imgur.com/a/35OVA That's amazing! This post brought back so many memories playing PSO that I had to get it out of storage in the garage. I feel like a nerd though for still having the original box and bag that it arrived in. It was well worth the 3-4week wait to get it. [deleted] It's the same a regular controller, only it also has keys for typing/talking to other players in PSO. Couldn't tell ya, never used is for its intended game. Sorry! I am fascinated by this. i have a feeling we all are Can confirm: fascinated
 i am aroused by this I have a feeling we all are There was a dude that would play Smash with one of these at tournaments. Went by the name Mavis Beacon How many tentacles do you need to use this? What is this used for? Are there any specific games that support it? Dance Dance Revolution Phantasy Star Online Phantasy Star Online PSO Phantasy Star Online.... maybe and another game called Phantasy Star Online which is abbreviated P.S.O. or PSO or P.S. Online Was it online?  I think it was called Phantasy Star Online iirc. I recall it was Phantasy Star Online. Just Phantasy Star Online. Phantasy star online. Fuck you Kevin, I want my controller back! NICE TRY ASSHOLE MY NAME IS STEPHANIE Is it compatible with PC?  
I'd really love a keyboard like this, since mine sucks. I highly doubt it, but how cool would that be if it was compatible with the Wii U adapters that came with SSB?  Maybe it could with the Mayflash GC adapter. Someone send op every kind of gc to USB adapter they can find. And a Shulk amiibo. The MayFlash will **not** work with the keyboard, however the [Raphnet adapter](http://www.raphnet-tech.com/products/gc_n64_usb_adapters/) will. (I own one, it's great!)

**EDIT - Important point:** Both parts of the gamecube keyboard are supported, **but only one at a time**. Two adapters are needed to use the joystick and keyboard simultaneously.

So it looks like the adapter can either enumerate as a HID keyboard, or as a HID joystick, but not both at the same time. I mean...define "compatible".  I guarantee it could be made to work with a PC, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone has done so, but I am not aware of any such effort. 1. Connect pins to Raspberry Pi GPIO
2. Power power pins, earth earth pins (See:- Standard Gamecube pins)
3. Listen on RX pins
4. Push random buttons, see RX input
5. Write a list of input | keys
6. Done So what's the first video game system, I wonder, that had a keyboard (and mouse) that was actually useful? The Dreamcast had a keyboard and mouse that was supported in several games. The SNES had a mouse that had moderate support as well. I can't really think of any others off the top of my head. Many PS2 games had keyboard/mouse support, since the console had USB ports. I had the PS2 version of one of these bad boys for playing Final Fantasy XI.  It's a Sammy Keyboard controller.

http://www.amazon.com/Game-Cube-Keyboard-Controller-ASCII-Sammy/dp/B0000AFZRW

So cool :) The only game I know that actually uses this is Phantasy Star:  Online. Hahah this thing. I still have it too. I bought one about 11 years-ish ago for PSO ep1 and 2 for the GC. Used to play religiously with my friends on local coop until we wanted to try playing online. So I got the broadband modem for the GC (which also supported MK double dash LAN) and this amazing piece of controller. Years passed and I moved to the U.S. And I felt compelled to bring it with me. Lo and behd people hve some kind of fascination with it and is till hve the original box it came in, and I think it came with collector cards for PSO or something as well. 

I got Ep3 CARD revolution for my birthday from my friends as well. This crazy thing worked great though. Online was a wonderful dream sting with it.

Now it's just sitting in the box it came in. Pretty awesome OP. Makes me want to pull it out again.  Being a big fan of Phantasy Star Online back in the day, I would have KILLED for one of these. Imagine, being the only kid in your small gaming clan that didn't have one of these bad boys - your responses were cluttered and took an eon to type out. So many missed opportunities...they had the perfect communication device.
And as it were, it was part Gamecube controller. Had one of these for PSO. Imported that fucker. Usps had it in the states for 5 months before it reached my home. So, if your hands are on either side of the controller, what are you supposed to type with?

Ohhh myyyy! That's a wide gap to cover if you're using it as a controller! It's for pso, I hated typing without one. I've played smash with one and it's pretty tight  boomas I want to take this to a smash bros tournament This looks like it would be comfortable to use after using the Wii-U gamepad. I like being able to have my hands at my side as I play. Good ol Phantasy Star  I take it your friend liked to play Phantasy Star Online. It was specifically for Phantasy Star Online. It was very useful, if you wanted to communicate about which missions to do. I suspected that when I saw this. The port to the Xbox did it better with voice communication though. PSO whoop whoooooop Phantasy Star Online Episode 2, 3 The proper way to play Phantasy Star Online  so good for online pso!! It was for chatting in Phantasy Star Online. I've always wanted one! Fucking PERFECT for Phantasy Star Online Episodes I &amp; II on GC! PSO. Nuff said This looks like it would have been perfect for Phantasy Star Online back in the day. Exactly what it was made for! This may be slightly ridiculous, but I would prefer a controller like this instead of chat pads. Real keyboards are just so much more efficient. There's leaves behind him.

HE'S ALREADY DEAD. Can't defeat Airman. I had an old youtube video showing a cosplayed air-man -- possibly this one -- with that as the background song.  I cannot find it now. :(

**EDIT** GOT IT!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tJFvYHlwMs&amp;index=13&amp;list=PL1260925A3B8DAC6A What if your only power was to push others away? I may  be the only one who gets this...But it's the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the pic.  There are at least three of us. Yay The Megas THERE ARE LITERALLY DOZENS OF US! Then I'd say you'd have a heavy load to bear Do you think you can carry it? And I fly high above monsteropolis, and I reign terror down on the general populace!

(best rhyme ever) But they aren't in shield - like form People don't usually include spaces in hyphenated words. I do if I'm on mobile Wasn't it crash bombs you needed to kill him in two shots? His big weakness was the Leaf Shield, but he was also susceptible to the Crash Bombs. best part of leaf shield is that it doesn't consume leaf shield power for him to run into it.  Just hammer "B" and he will die. Weird, I always just did him first because he made Crash Man a breeze. For a while, Air Man was my first target as well. Jumping enough of his tornados to beat him wasn't terribly hard. 

Eventually, I had played that game so much that I could do any stage with just the base weapon. Doing Quick Man first is the hardest, with Heat Man second.  You are bragging about your skill in old school video games... in the right place! That's badass. I have no doubt that I would get thoroughly owned if I tried it now. I played that game a ton (it was my favorite for years), and modern platformers are far gentler.  [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM09cP9rcFI) is the Air Man stage theme from Mega Man 2 if you're interested. Some of the best music in gaming history came from MM2  Especially [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFeL7kTw2CU) masterpiece. You can tell they really pushed the limits of what the NES can do, one of the reasons being a loop for more than a minute was almost unheard of back then on home consoles.

EDIT: Check out /r/nintendomusic for more of the same, megaman features there regularly as you can imagine. While a classic, the [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT9DST_M_g8) to MM2 is still my favorite track. Just so damn epic. That drop. How am I supposed to get work done today when there are so many megaman sound tracks to listen too... This will not be productive. [For those who prefer Mega Man 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G98baqaSmBY), and [for those who like Mega Man 3 better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXAwolUpz4g). Listen to them while working?

[Plus bonus! My favorite REmixes and originals. Worth it!](http://www.4shared.com/zip/ETnaJJyOce/Freds_collection_of_mega_man_r.html) One comment and my inbox is flooded with megaman music and remixes. Today is a beautiful day. My favorite is [MM3's intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsn_C9rvIQ)! If you all love Megaman music, or video game music in general, you need to watch this band.  They perform at MagFest pretty much every year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUHlVdqRlPA

Guy plays the game, they play the soundtrack.  I envy the guy whose role in the band is to play Nintendo really well...

EDIT:More descriptive Wow. Small world.

I film for MAGfest.

EDIT: By the way, both the band and the guy playing the game are all chill dudes. Story time: I believe it was last year, but they did the speedrun to Contra. There was a point where the player actually messed up and couldn't get the spreader upgrade because the level scrolled too far and he couldn't jump up to it. So he purposefully killed himself, which dropped him in the top of the level, and he was able to get the spreader. Fuckin' genius. He thought this up on the fly and the band never missed a beat. He actually died again later, but beat the game on his last life.

TL;DR - Contra rocks hard, but Bit Brigade rocks harder. Small world. I went to Magfest and Katsucon. FUCK YEEEAAAAAHHH!!! I... am Megaman

I am blue... and Cyan
 That was for the intro to 3, not 2. Oof... You're right, be gentle with the downvotes. I am voting for Barak-Man Obama! 200X? what year is 200X? Since it's 2015...have we already missed it? Is there a Megaman amongst us?!?! Enjoy this version https://soundcloud.com/megaman2lullaby/opening-theme ENJOYMENT RECEIVED

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqwkXj3vJQM You may enjoy [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MuoUmwhrn8) a great deal. http://i.imgur.com/yFhgQXo.gif  http://youtu.be/JOiYU2m6Swo A game I learnt about recently, Journey to Silius, has unique music for a NES game. Rather than use the PCM channel for drums (as most games did) [it had a sampled bass track instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BDAJS_8RSA). Almost sounds like the music is coming from an FM synth chip rather than the NES' more basic sound hardware. It certainly is unique, the opening is definitely in my top 10 NES tracks. I always really liked the soundtrack to The Guardian Legend which is also an underrated game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyfSdJ0a1w4 Well, the biggest NES game was 1MB. Imma let you finish, but MM3 had the best music. 

Sparkman for life No way, man.   MM2, Dr. Wily first stage.   Epic.  10/10 best track in games Yup.  That and Bloody Tears from Castlevania II.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0MLscghcN4 

enjoy this shit. Hahaha - I will respond with another:

Mega Man 2 - Dr. Wily Stage Acapella: 
http://youtu.be/iW_Ct49H1ng Snake man's theme is the tits  I made a Flash cartoon many years ago with the MM3 Theme as the background music. It gets me so fired up...I'd listen to it on a run if it weren't a MIDI file! Topman is always a favourite from that one. MM3 was also the better game (despite being rushed and thrown together according to development) . I loved the fact it was a 30% longer game having to fight all the robots from MM2 with additional stages after you beat the ones from MM3.   My only disappointment is how easy the last boss was in the game when you figure out it's weakness. It's not really the last boss being easy, it's Rush Jet being overpowered as fuck. getting to that top platform is pretty easy by jumping and using shuriken on the first form.. it's the 2 hits top spin on the final form to that makes that final stage a joke.  You also take on very little damage from attacks on that stage. Yeah, it's not hard without Rush Jet either, but it wasn't something terribly uncommon for the series. Minus the Lead Bubble bullshit, holo-Wily in MM2 was also easy as fuck.

But maybe it's just that I find extreme Top Spin weakness quite a clever thing (although I suspect it was kind of unintentional) - the weapon was basically useless through the game, so many people would just think it's bugged (like that's uncommon on NES) and forget about it. And the lack of google only helped it. I agree that Mega Man 3 was better than 2. When I think of Mega Man, I think of playing 3 with the music from 2. My ranking for the NES games would be:

MM3
MM2
MM6
MM5
MM1
MM4 [Armcannon - Mega Man 3](http://armcannon.bandcamp.com/track/mega-man-3) Funy things is that Bun Bun, who made soundtrack for Mega Man 3, also did for the fourth one, commonly regarded as one of the poorer ones and with undisputably [the worst loop in Mega Man's history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnI5UXfL7ko).

Also, [Hard Man is way better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFhqRStcsgk). MM3 was the best overall soundtrack. MM2 had a song or two that was better, but also a few duds. MM3 is all great all the way through.

Also, listen to The Megas MM3 albums, [History Repeating - Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I96lXa3aVuQ&amp;list=PL8EFD08AB308CA452) and [History Repeating - Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasR70I52TE) (Please [buy the albums](https://themegas.bandcamp.com/) if you like them, The Megas totally deserve it) Dude, the whole Megas saga is fantastic. Megatainment, Get Equipped (and Get Acoustic), and both volumes of History Repeating. Especially starting with Megatainment, it definitely makes Wily into a more sympathetic character which is an interesting spin on things. There aren't many franchises than can match the number of classics nes era mega man produced  Except for Metroid. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgoPgrhpy_M  Enjoy. The Minibosses - Mega Man 2: http://youtu.be/EuxfQjJ-3DM

The airman theme is right after the intro.  But the whole medley is worth listening to. That music is burned into my brain from the many nights trying to beat that game as a kid. if you like mega man songs like this check out a band called PowerGlove And the Donkey Kong 1 and 2 on SNES. I listen to that shit on my ipod and in my car. I was always a sucker for Storm Eagles stage on Megaman  X http://youtu.be/J8eLoCtHB4E  They're [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBWl9p0fH28) friggin awesome.  It was probably my third or forth SNES game and I still love it to this day. [No one in this world can understand who I am. That is why I'm my own biggest fan. Do you know what it's like to be built this way? With only the power to push others away?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bUnYcNc6YQ) This is why I'm my own biggest ---

 I'll usher in the end, aboard my thunder chariot! Flashman's stage music was among my favorite.  I remember that when I was like 8 I beat quickman for the first time. I became a man that day. 

ZWwwooooooooop zwoooooop zwoooooooooop Picked up mega man 2 on virtual console.  Died 3 times and at quickman and rage quit.  I'm reliving it all over again.   ***SPOILER***

Got to get Flashman's weapon first.  The level is almost impossible without it.  Then, you have to farm tanks to refill your Flashman weapon.  I think I still have the Nintendo Power magazine with MM2 in it. I was so thrilled the first time I made it through that stage without needing to use time stop. It really is super hard. 

Then, you get to start the fight with Quickman by flashing away 1/3 of his health.  You're doing better than me, can't even come close to beating a single boss in MM3. Man, games were a lot harder back then. I think Gutsman's stage in the first MM was the hardest for me. I beat 2 before I beat 1.
