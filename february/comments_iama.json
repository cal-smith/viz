When the leadership of both parties join together - as they so often do, despite the myths to the contrary - those issues disappear from mainstream public debate.\n\nThe most interesting political fact about the NSA controversy, to me, was how the divisions didn't break down at all on partisan lines. Huge amount of the support for our reporting came from the left, but a huge amount came from the right. When the first bill to ban the NSA domestic metadata program was introduced, it was tellingly sponsored by one of the most conservative Tea Party members (Justin Amash) and one of the most liberal (John Conyers).\n\nThe problem is that the leadership of both parties, as usual, are in full agreement: they love NSA mass surveillance. So that has blocked it from receiving more debate. That NSA program was ultimately saved by the unholy trinity of Obama, Nancy Pelosi and John Bohener, who worked together to defeat the Amash/Conyers bill.\n\nThe division over this issue (like so many other big ones, such as crony capitalism that owns the country) is much more \"insider v. outsider\" than \"Dem v. GOP\". But until there are leaders of one of the two parties willing to dissent on this issue, it will be hard to make it a big political issue.\n\nThat's why the Dem efforts to hand Hillary Clinton the nomination without contest are so depressing.

Organizing is important. Activism is important. \n\nAt the same time, we should remember that governments don't often reform themselves. One of the arguments in a book I read recently (Bruce Schneier, \"Data and Goliath\"), is that perfect enforcement of the law sounds like a good thing, but that may not always be the case. The end of crime sounds pretty compelling, right, so how can that be?\n\nWell, when we look back on history, the progress of Western civilization and human rights is actually founded on the violation of law.  America was of course born out of a violent revolution that was an outrageous treason against the crown and established order of the day. History shows that the righting of historical wrongs is often born from acts of unrepentant criminality. Slavery. The protection of persecuted Jews. \n\nBut even on less extremist topics, we can find similar examples. How about the prohibition of alcohol? Gay marriage? Marijuana? \n\nWhere would we be today if the government, enjoying powers of perfect surveillance and enforcement, had -- entirely within the law -- rounded up, imprisoned, and shamed all of these lawbreakers?\n\nUltimately, if people lose their willingness to recognize that there are times in our history when legality becomes distinct from morality, we aren't just ceding control of our rights to government, but our agency in determing thour futures.\n\nHow does this relate to politics? Well, I suspect that governments today are more concerned with the loss of their ability to control and regulate the behavior of their citizens than they are with their citizens' discontent. \n\nHow do we make that work for us? We can devise means, through the application and sophistication of science, to remind governments that if they will not be responsible stewards of our rights, we the people will implement systems that provide for a means of not just enforcing our rights, but *removing from governments the ability to interfere with those rights*.\n\nYou can see the beginnings of this dynamic today in the statements of government officials complaining about the adoption of encryption by major technology providers. The idea here isn't to fling ourselves into anarchy and do away with government, but to remind the government that there must always be a balance of power between the governing and the governed, and that as the progress of science increasingly empowers communities and individuals, there will be more and more areas of our lives where -- if government insists on behaving poorly and with a callous disregard for the citizen -- we can find ways to reduce or remove their powers on a new -- and permanent -- basis. \n\nOur rights are not granted by governments. They are inherent to our nature. But it's entirely the opposite for governments: their privileges are precisely equal to only those which we suffer them to enjoy.\n\nWe haven't had to think about that much in the last few decades because quality of life has been increasing across almost all measures in a significant way, and that has led to a comfortable complacency. But here and there throughout history, we'll occasionally come across these periods where governments think more about what they \"can\" do rather than what they \"should\" do, and what is lawful will become increasingly distinct from what is moral. \n\nIn such times, we'd do well to remember that at the end of the day, the law doesn't defend us; we defend the law.

I've read quite a bit of his stuff and I don't think he blames America for *everything*. But one would definitely be correct in saying that criticism of America is extremely frequent in his writing.\n\nWhy is this? I actually think it's because, as an American (and a constitutional lawyer), he feels like he's in the best position to level criticisms against the US government. Not only that, but that he has a duty to speak out. It's his niche.\n\nThis quote by Noam Chomsky is instructive in this regard:\n\n&gt;*\"My own concern is primarily the terror and violence carried out by my own state, for two reasons. For one thing, because it happens to be the larger component of international violence. But also for a much more important reason than that; namely, I can do something about it. So even if the U.S. was responsible for 2 percent of the violence in the world instead of the majority of it, it would be that 2 percent I would be primarily responsible for. And that is a simple ethical judgment. That is, the ethical value of one's actions depends on their anticipated and predictable consequences. It is very easy to denounce the atrocities of someone else. That has about as much ethical value as denouncing atrocities that took place in the 18th century.\"*\n\nCertainly with respect to the issue of terrorism against the West or terrorism in formerly US-occupied territories, he does level the criticism that US actions are in many cases responsible for creating the situation in which terrorism is thriving in the first place. I happen to agree with this, and Greenwald is far from the only person saying it. Even many veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are coming back saying they are convinced our actions over there are causing blowback and instability.\n\nI'm not all current on his feud with  Sam Harris, and I think all the arguing about 'Islamophobia' is just pointless because that term means different things to different people. While I think Harris goes too far in his rhetoric about Islam, personally I wouldn't leap to the conclusion that he bears blame for vigilante attacks against Muslims (as apparently Greenwald has claimed -- not sure though as I haven't read this piece).\n\n Regardless of whether or not Harris is or isn't an 'Islamophobe', I think there is one criticism of him that ought to stick: his corpus of work provides cover for the surveillance state and the military to justify primarily targeting Muslims, both at home and abroad. And although the vigilantism of private citizens against innocent Muslims is abhorrent, I think it is dwarved by the State focusing some of its most sinister powers on the Muslim population, just for being Muslim. \n\nHarris's works justify such ugly policies, and I think part of Harris's success is due to  his messages  actually being desirable to the powers that be. I mean, do you remember [this article of his](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/in-defense-of-profiling)?

You cannot do the same for atheists (Harris' audience)--their lack of theistic belief does not compel them to kill people who criticize atheism. I think this idea obviously comports with reality, and Sam also cites compelling data about hate crimes in the US that support this. Thus Harris' criticism of Muslim belief does not endanger Muslims the way that Greenwald's criticism of Harris' beliefs does.\n\nAnother difference here is that Sam Harris goes way out of his way to paint an accurate picture of broadly held Muslim belief. He references data heavily, all the time. At the very least, he is not purposefully misrepresenting the beliefs of the subjects of his criticism. On the other, Greenwald's portrayal of Harris' beliefs deviates heavily from the beliefs that Harris has painstakingly and repeatedly spelled out in clear detail so as not to be vulnerable to the type of distortion that Greenwald achieves.

Atheists, for example. I have some cherry picked statistics to demonstrate this.\n\nGG: Sam Harris's twisted view of Islam provides cover for atrocities and injustices committed on Muslims by the governments of the West. His Islamophobia encourages hatred towards, and vigilantism against, Muslim minorities in Western countries. Also, he should feel bad. And I'm going to write inflammatory stuff on Twitter about it because I love flamewars.\n\nSH: Glenn Greenwald's twisted mischaracterization of my remarks is unfair. I do not advocate vigilantism and my words pose no threat to Muslims. I am not Islamophobic. I merely believe that Islam is a cancerous belief system, incongruous with Western values, that must be fully stamped out if there is to be world peace. Besides, everything I'm saying is true. I have the cherry picked survey data to back it up. Glenn Greenwald's inflammatory remarks encourage hatred against, and vigilantism towards, me and my family.\n\ngoonsack: How can you claim that what you write about Muslims doesn't put Muslims in danger, but that Greenwald's words about you do put you in danger? \n\nSH: ... ... **Islam has the ignoble distinction that Muslims kill for their ideology in numbers that vastly exceed other groups you might compare to Muslims.**\n\n\nI dunno - it seems kind of unsatisfactory and tautological and weaselly to me.\n\nBesides -- this whole exchange that I imagined in my head is skirting what I think is Greenwald's best point. In fact, I think Greenwald's argument that Sam Harris's incendiary remarks about Islam encourage individual vigilantism against Muslims is somewhat tenuous and hard to definitively link. (Hell, it's hard  to tell if anti-Muslim sentiment is even a motive or not sometimes, like in the UNCCH case. A lot of it appeared like a personal dispute and the guy seemed sorta unhinged). \n\nI think it's the weaker argument because the effects of vigilantism (and I guess you could call small-scale terrorist attacks a form of vigilantism) on the world is dwarfed by the effects of militarism on the world. And I'd argue that Harris's productive output, which has largely coincided with the post-9/11 years, have served the interest of justifying and providing ideological cover for the recent militaristic conquests that the US has undertaken in the Muslim world (Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Syria). \n\nBut atheists don't kill for their beliefs, right? I disagree actually. It's true, in the sense that atheists don't kill over religious beliefs, having none. But religious beliefs are far from the only kind. And far from the only dangerous kind. And yes, we're not saying that individual atheists killing people in vigilante style attacks is some kind of pattern that jumps out. But Western atheists seem to be part of  factions within their countries that were and are supportive of aggressive actions in the Middle East. Cheered on by their belief that Islam is the great evil of our time. They don't have to do any killing for their belief -- their government does it for them. Doesn't mean blood isn't on their hands any less.\n\nI remember Sam Harris and Chris Hitchens were big proponents of the Iraq War -- just a couple examples of many atheists who made up part of this war's popular support. And how many innocent Iraqis were killed for *their* beliefs? (Namely, the beliefs that 1) Saddam had WMDs, 2) Iraq had something to do with Al Qaeda, 3) Invading Iraq was a humanitarian course of action). While not religious, were these beliefs any less wrong? Any less pernicious?\n\nI've typed way more than I meant to, but my point is, I just don't think Western atheists (particularly I mean the type that have a particular and abiding hatred of Islam) come out clean in all this. While holding no religious beliefs, they do hold beliefs that can motivate terrible violence. While not perpetrating this violence individually, the real situation could actually be understood to be much worse -- their beliefs are reflected in the actions of a gigantic, lethal, and cruel State military machine.

I think the Pew study he is citing is itself cherry picked. The way they present the data is such that the viewer is easily misled. And they don't survey every Muslim country, often leaving out those in which the Muslims are very moderate. The most confusing part of their data: the percentages of people who say \"stone\" or \"death\" for adultery and leaving Islam, respectively, are *only among the percentage of respondents who favor Sharia law*. So, for an [example](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/), let's take Indonesia, the country with the highest Muslim population. 18% favor death for leaving Islam, and 72% favor Sharia. So, if we extrapolate, just under **13%** of Indonesian Muslims, or [27m/205m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_by_country) people have this view. For Pakistan it's a bit grimmer, with 64% of total population (if we extrapolate) holding this view (121m/189m). The next largest Muslim population, India, with 177m Muslims, isn't even in their poll! But one would probably expect low support, since India's not a theocracy. So, quite possible that not including countries like India is going to skew their numbers upward. For Bangladesh, total percentage is 36%, meaning 54m/149m. And so on and so on. For the 20 countries in the poll, which account for 52% of the world's Muslims, the total percentage of people who say Sharia + execute apostates is actually only 19%. Is that higher, or lower than you'd think from listening to Sam Harris? \n\nAlthough execution for apostates is a very awful belief that totally goes against freedom of conscience, it's only 19% (in the half of the Muslim world they surveyed, if we extrapolate from the poll). Plus despite it having some support, I couldn't find any evidence that ex-Muslims are in fact  executed for apostasy in any large numbers. The incidence appears to be quite rare. Interestingly, in Pakistan, which has high popular support for Sharia apostasy executions, there is no apostasy law in effect. And in fact, it seems in many Islamic societies that do have apostasy laws, for those rare people who are actually sentenced as apostates, the death sentence is commonly [commuted to imprisonment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam).  Harris distorts the truth by holding up these cherry picked polling numbers, instead of the reality of the situation, which you'd think was 1000x worse from listening to him. \n\nContrariwise, I'm sure we can find lots of secular but nonetheless terrible and backward beliefs held by Americans in at least that proportion (&gt;19%), that have resulted in very staggering amounts death and suffering:\n\n[Popular support, at time of launch, for  illegal 2003 - ?

His behavior is very much worthy of derision, and it's only made worse by the fact that the group that is most likely to be galvanized by his words are people who enthusiastically support things like the murder of cartoonists.\n\nI dispute this actually. Greenwald's primary readership is the Anglophone liberal left and civil libertarians. Not Muslim extremists. I doubt very much that someone would be incited to undertake or advocate for violent action after reading him.\n\n&gt;Your assertion that Muslims are less safe as a result of critics like Harris is weak. The greatest victims of Muslim violence are other Muslims. Muslims have the most to gain from an influential Sam Harris. Also, I don't think Harris supports military intervention in the Middle East in the way you are imagining. I think Hitchens was the only vocal proponent of the Iraq War, among that group of famous 'new athiests'. Perhaps there are other influential atheists who support military engagements that you disagree with, but I don't think it's particularly relevant either way, as I highly doubt that athiests in general are more likely to be hawkish or violent than other people. In fact I'm almost certain the opposite is true. \n\nI certainly don't want to paint all atheists with the same brush here. Definitely a lot of atheists are peaceniks. But my concern is that the likes of Harris are trying to bring the new crop of young atheists into the fold of hawkishness and draconian policies toward Muslims.\n\nTo be clear, Harris was definitely not enthusiastic for Iraq in the same calibre that Hitch was (Hitch was turned up to 11 on this).  But I do believe SH is, on the whole, a supporter of military intervention in the Middle East. The only real criticisms he seems to level are ones that deal with our botched strategies there. I'm sure there are plenty of countries he'd love to bomb though. After all, per SH, [It is time we admitted that we are not at war with \u201cterrorism.\u201d We are at war with Islam.](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/dec/1/20041201-090801-2582r/)\n\nAnd while Muslim-on-Muslim violence is certainly the bulk of the fighting, I would argue that the US has its hand in a great deal of it. The Iran-Iraq War is one of the best examples, where the US armed and funded Saddam to go to war with Iran -- including giving him chemical weapons. The death toll was staggering. I'd argue that the most recent Iraq invasion and subsequent propping up of a puppet regime there underlies the outbreak of sectarian violence that still grips the region. Same thing applies to the covert funding of Islamic rebels in Syria to try and topple Assad. \n\nOne final note, as you said in the beginning, \"you have to be able to criticize bad ideas\" and I agree with that. Harris has criticized what he perceives as bad ideas in Islam (partly dishonestly I contend) and Greenwald has criticized what he perceives as bad ideas in what Harris writes (it's quite likely that he's been partly dishonest in doing so also). What really differentiates the two for me, though, is that Harris seems to offer policy prescriptions supplemented with his criticisms, such as arguing for [Racial Profiling](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/in-defense-of-profiling) -- policies that abridge peoples' freedoms, and could easily be understood to be a form of State violence. \n\nMoreover, he uses his criticism and fearmongering of Islam to underpin his pro-interventionism stance:\n\n&gt;*\"It appears that one of the most urgent tasks we now face in the developed world is to find some way of facilitating the emergence of civil societies everywhere else. Whether such societies have to be democratic is not at all clear. ... It seems all but certain that some form of benign dictatorship will generally be necessary to bridge the gap. But benignity is the key-- and* **if it cannot emerge from within a state, it must be imposed from without. The means of such imposition are necessarily crude: they amount to economic isolation, military intervention (whether open or covert), or some combination of both.** *While this may seem an exceedingly arrogant doctrine to espouse, it appears we have no alternatives. We cannot wait for weapons of mass destruction to dribble out of the former Soviet Union to pick only one horrible possibility and into the hands of fanatics.\"*\n\n&gt;[The End of Faith](https://books.google.com/books?id=V1NXG1ob-WcC&amp;pg=PA151)\n\nI just don't see Greenwald making those kinds of violent pronouncements accompanying his criticisms.", "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "created": 1424860261.0},{"body": "&gt; If you're saying that Greenwald is fine if he criticizes what he perceives as America's bad ideas, as long as he stops short of calling for violence, then what is the flap all about?\n\nYes that's what I'm saying--glad we agree there. The problem is that Greenwald **purposefully** and significantly misrepresents Harris' views. Criticizing (or 'disrespecting') Islam publicly is already dangerous enough. It is made even more dangerous when someone like Greenwald starts using words like racist and genocidal to describe Harris.\n\nNo the data are not misleading. The poll covers most Muslim countries, and the results are not confusing. Yes, there are a couple questions that are only asked of respondents who answer *yes* to subscribing to Sharia law, and you are correct to multiply those two percentages together to get a total view. The results are very gross. Go here if you want to see the numbers I've looked at:\n\nhttps://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2014/10/04/maher-harris-kristof-steele-and-affleck-squabble-about-islam/\n\nA quote from that site:\n\"Good for liberal Indonesia and Malaysia: only 35% of Muslims in the former state, and 52% of Muslims in the latter, think that adulterers should be stoned (I\u2019ve multipled the proportion of Muslims believing in sharia law by the proportion of those who favor stoning)!  Every Muslim country is strongly anti-gay and anti-women (look at the \u201cwives should obey their husbands\u201d statistics).\"\n\nThus, I wholeheartedly disagree with your contention that Harris has been dishonest in his treatment of Islam and its effects on the beliefs of its adherents. Sam Harris is spot on here.\n\nYour reference to Americans having bad beliefs entirely misses the point, and underscores how Harris' thesis is commonly misunderstood. He is not simply saying \"here's a group of people that believe bad things\". He's pointing out that:\n\n1) There is a direct link between Islam (the teachings, the holy literature, the life of the prophet) and Muslim belief. \n\n2) There is a direct link between belief and actions, social pressures, etc.\n\n&gt; Don't you think it's time Americans cleaned up their own act, instead of lobbing criticisms at nations they know virtually nothing about?\n\nNo, that is absurd. Harris is not responsible for what is wrong with America, and there's nothing to preclude him from criticizing bad ideas where he finds them.\n\n&gt; But my concern is that the likes of Harris are trying to bring the new crop of young atheists into the fold of hawkishness and draconian policies toward Muslims.\n\nYes, you alluded to this previously. I don't think you are right. Sam is a reasonable guy. The term 'hawk' is not at all appropriate.\n\n&gt; After all, per SH, It is time we admitted that we are not at war with \u201cterrorism.\u201d We are at war with Islam.\n\nYes... you can't be at war with 'terrorism'. You can (metaphorically, not necessarily literally) be at war with a set of bad ideas that beget bad actions.\n\nI largely agree with your assessment of US foreign policy in the Middle East, but it's a bit beside the point. Even in the absence of undue Western influence, Islam would be terribly problematic for those living under its authority.\n\nI largely disagree with your commentary on Harris' comments about racial profiling, but it's not germane to the discussion, so moving on...\n\n&gt; Moreover, he uses his criticism and fearmongering of Islam to underpin his pro-interventionism stance:\n\nNo he doesn't. He is simply saying is that it's categorically more scary for a theocratic Islamic nation to have nukes than for an actor like Russia, because the Islamists actually believe that their life here on earth doesn't matter, and that to kill infidels or die trying is the best way to get to heaven. He's not saying nuke the middle east.\n\nI very much appreciate the thought that you've put into your responses, even though it seems that we are still in pretty stark disagreement. I imagine you'd be a good person to chat with in person, but the online back-and-fourth is too time-consuming for me at this point, so I'm going to hold off here.

Screen credits for studio projects are governed by the WGA and every writer is given an opportunity to dispute the proposed credit. If someone disputes the proposed credit, it goes into a very stringent arbitration process at the WGA where the final credit is decided. The process notoriously favours the first writer on the project (search \"WGA arbitration\" and you'll find lots of stories about projects in which someone was credited even though not a single word of their draft appeared onscreen.) Also, as the originator of the idea, you automatically earn an undisputed \"Story By\" credit, so at the bare minimum you will get that. But I'll wager money that as the writer of the first two drafts, the worst case scenario is that you'll get a \"Screenplay By\" credit shared with one other writer. That only happens in the event that someone else can prove that they contributed a certain percentage of original material to the final shooting script, and some contributions count for more than others - brand new characters, scenes and story beats count for something, new dialogue counts for almost nothing. In the case of an original screenplay (which yours was), I believe subsequent writers have to prove that the original material they contributed was 50% or more. (I believe it's 33% on a script adapted from any kind of source material.) So you're also in with a good chance of getting sole credit (in which case it'd be \"Written By\" because you wrote both the story and the screenplay.)  \n\nNot gonna lie, the arbitration process is kind of hideous and gruelling, but if this wasn't stuff you already knew, I hope it's helpful in some way in assuring you that if the movie gets made, you'll get your well-deserved credit.", "gilded": 0, "score": 84, "created": 1424203280.0},{"body": "it's going to be the latter. he sold his original idea and rights to the studio and at this point it's up to them to figure out how to make it happen. unfortunately OP has little power in the process; he needs to let it play out and see how much (if any) of his original work is going to be in the final product.", "gilded": 0, "score": 29, "created": 1424190549.0},{"body": "Shit, dude, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but it's \"asked my wife and *me*.\"", "gilded": 0, "score": 181, "created": 1424189418.0},{"body": "*takes off crown*\n\nMy kingdom is now yours.", "gilded": 0, "score": 347, "created": 1424192166.0},{"body": "You had a good run\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 109, "created": 1424192616.0},{"body": "And this is why editors make the big bucks!", "gilded": 0, "score": 67, "created": 1424189743.0},{"body": "Hey!
