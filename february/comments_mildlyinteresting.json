Snow rollers have been seen to grow as large as two feet in diameter.\n\n&gt;The following conditions are needed for snow rollers to form:\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* There must be a relatively thin surface layer of wet, loose snow, with a temperature near the [melting point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point) of ice\n\n&gt;* Under this thin layer of wet snow there must be a substrate to which the thin surface layer of wet snow will not stick, such as ice or powder snow\n\n&gt;* The wind must be strong enough to move the snow rollers, but not strong enough to blow them apart.\n\n&gt;* Alternatively, gravity can move the snow rollers as when a snowball, such as those that will fall from a tree or cliff, lands on a steep hill and begins to roll down the hill.\n\n&gt;Because of this last condition, snow rollers are more common in hilly areas. However, the precise nature of the conditions required makes them a very rare phenomenon.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/dssh7tX.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Snowroller.jpg) - *A snow roller in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Snow ^cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_cone) ^| [^Snow ^grains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_grains) ^| [^Temperate ^climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_climate) ^| [^Extratropical ^cyclone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+co8713y) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+co8713y)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1422835865.0},{"body": "Can someone explain how it does the 'hover to view' thing?

The cardinals of the Church are collectively known as the [College of Cardinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Cardinals). The duties of the cardinals include attending the meetings of the College and making themselves available individually or in groups to the [Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope) as requested. Most have additional duties, such as leading a [diocese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese) or [archdiocese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdiocese) or managing a [department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicastery) of the [Roman Curia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Curia). A cardinal's other main function is [electing the pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_election) when the [see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See) becomes vacant. During the *[sede vacante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sede_vacante)* (the period between a pope's death or resignation and the election of his successor), the day-to-day governance of the Holy See is in the hands of the College of Cardinals. The right to enter the [conclave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_conclave) of cardinals where the pope is elected is limited to those who have not reached the age of 80 years by the day the vacancy occurs.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image from article**](https://i.imgur.com/SJXFkOL.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Psalterium_Feriatum_Cod_Don_309_042.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Praedecessores ^nostros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praedecessores_nostros) ^| [^County ^Armagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Armagh) ^| [^Ottaviano ^dei ^Conti ^di ^Segni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottaviano_dei_Conti_di_Segni) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+comv93v) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+comv93v)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "created": 1424068871.0},{"body": "This totally belongs in /r/InvisibleBicycles", "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "created": 1424069174.0},{"body": "It's the new C4700F model cardinal, God is phasing out wings and moving into hover units for most short distance flying.", "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "created": 1424069303.0},{"body": "Wingardium leviosa", "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "created": 1424069368.0},{"body": "Damn those birds taking the squirrel feed.

When built for this purpose, the builder will lay the wall along a [property line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_line) dividing two [terraced flats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraced_house) or [row houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_house), so that one half of the wall's thickness lies on each property. This type of wall is usually structural. Party walls can also be formed by two abutting walls built at different times. The term can be also used to describe a division between separate units within a multi-unit apartment complex. Very often the wall in this case is non-structural but designed to meet established criteria for sound and/or fire protection between residential units.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/MnMja0U.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:View_from_southwest,_East_Martin_Street_entrance_and_west_party_wall_-_Barber-Towler_Building_\\(Commercial_Building\\),_123_East_Martin_Street,_Raleigh,_Wake_County,_NC_HABS_NC,92-RAL,10-1.tif) - *View from southwest, East Martin Street entrance and west party wall - Barber-Towler Building \\(Commercial Building\\), 123 East Martin Street, Raleigh, Wake County, NC*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Party ^Wall ^etc. ^Act ^1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_Wall_etc._Act_1996) ^| [^Parapet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parapet) ^| [^Party ^wall ^surveyor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_wall_surveyor) ^| [^Frontage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontage) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+consqg8) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+consqg8)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "score": 7, "created": 1424145519.0},{"body": "Source?", "gilded": 0, "score": 7, "created": 1424139566.0},{"body": "/u/Wolf_Mommy is from the past and witnessed it first-hand.", "gilded": 0, "score": 23, "created": 1424141270.0},{"body": "We're all from the past.", "gilded": 0, "score": 10, "created": 1424144513.0},{"body": "Like... dude....", "gilded": 0, "score": 10, "created": 1424144690.0},{"body": "[This is from 1911](https://i.imgur.com/gigf0pL.jpg)\n\n[Here is the source.]( http://cdm16014.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p4014coll18/id/3293/rec/1)\n\nAlso there did not seem to be another tall structure next to it as others have suggested in the passageway hypothesis.
