Make your own by tossing a cinderblock into the washer for about 2 weeks. .gif of cinderblock being tossed in washing machine :[ http://www.gifbin.com/bin/082010/1281347217_final-thoughts.gif Neat! http://i.imgur.com/wNsZqBO.png http://i.imgur.com/aqY5ruv.gif http://www.gfycat.com/SparklingSpiritedIggypops My mom has that exact same camera.

It was in the back of my head.  oh god that sounds incredibly dangerous It is. There is all kinds of weird stuff back there. Some really neat stuff and the usual chunks of knowledge.  

Great place to spend an afternoon.   The original video is by PhotonicInduction.  :( I wonder whose feet this was chained to.  As long as you don't know. 

The job was done right. ya know what i hate? a guy in a blue suit Worst that could happen is I could spill booze on my $6300 suit. Yeah so sho-sh-sh-should the-sh-sho-should the guy in the-sh-should-sho-should the guy in the twe-should the sh-sho-should the guy in the 32-sh sho-should the guy in the 32 dollar pink sho sh the girl sh in the 6000 dollar sh sh Sh sh shhhhhhhh Come on! Marry me! COME ON! COME ON!! [sssss.. theres one right behind me isn't there.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GwAHEgOxuU) Don't worry he ain't gonna be talking to nobodies. Not when we'd done wit him. I really appreciate the slowed descent after the first cinderblock lands on the riverbed. ooh, I didn't notice that. We need more /r/mildlyinteresting notes like this.  I mis-remembered the quote coming from Dori from Finding Nemo. I watch family guy and all, but i feel this is a pretty extreme reference. I'm gonna start using this response anytime there's a reference I don't understand. I'm gonna start using this response every time someone doesn't understand the reference. Could have been in the WTF sub if it washed up sooner. This reminds me of a story.  I had a friend named Jason who ended up tied to a cinder block by some crazy guy and pushed off of a cliff into water, but he fuckin' lived.  We used to call him the boy who lived. This reminds me of a movie about a bus that had to speed around the city, keeping its speed over fifty, and if its speed dropped, it would explode! I think it was called The Bus That Couldnt Slow Down. Why didn't it head out of the city It went to the airport and blew up rather romantically.  You're now on a list for words 5 thru 8 of that comment.  Those feet of yore, 

Now are no more; 

Hence this block, 

Is on the shore.  Hoffa's Trivia that nobody'll care about, but what the heck:  Cinder blocks got their name because they used to be made of cinders.  Back in the days of coal-burning trains, railways used to have massive piles of cinders left over from burning the coal.  When concrete blocks were invented, someone had the idea to use all those coal cinders for the concrete's aggregate instead of sand.  They were strong, but lighter than those made with sand, and while coal cinders were still common, they were too.  The name came to be used for all concrete blocks. That was mildly interesting. Well done.  There needs to be a mildly interesting version of /r/TIL, somewhere to post neat facts like this without all of the sensational bs. so, sort of like /r/mildlyinteresting ? Pretty interesting. I smiled a bit at learning such a trivial fact. And then I thought, what if you just made that up you son of a bitch? What a roller coaster.  The correct term for today's "cinder blocks" are concrete masonry units or "CMU's." I would have lugged this home no matter the distance. 

 right? that shit is art Yes. It is. 

I wouldn't make it a centerpiece.  

But it's so perfect how nature made stone, man made concrete, nature beautified what is otherwise a part of a wall. 

 Nature: "aw, look, the humans made a rock themselves!  Here, let me just... smooth down the rough edges a little... there!  Now isn't that better?" Nature is my mother-in-law.  You're banging nature's daughter?  Holy shit! My hand is nature's daughter?!! Mine isn't human either Mother-in-law nature and father out-of-time. I read this in such a mother earth soothing nature style voice.  Also remember when cement particles get small enough, either through discharge or erosion it can plug fish gills. That's why you can't dump wet cement into a river, at least here. Interesting, how come that doesn't happen with other tiny natural rocks? Or does it? It could with some silts and sands, rock dust from quarries, tailing, etc.

Edit - I should add this is more of an issue in rivers, streams, and lakes. Although river mouths can be bad for sediment release into the ocean. There's already a lot of sand in the ocean. What stops that from being more of a problem than cement? Sand tends to be larger particles, 2mm+ by Google. I would say maybe half that working in soil, but that's my personal limit (#20 sieve or .8mm). Smaller than that would be silt witch can also be a problem in large amounts.

 The ocean is less of an issue. More it comes from a smaller water body having a sudden influx of small particles that can suffocate fish and others benthic invertebrates. Really its  the quantity that counts. 

I may have been melodramatic about the cider block when referring to cement in general. That makes sense. Wet cement will just continually break down though. Putting it back to the powder or mortar beginning it was first. 
It's the compacting and drying, or moulding proccess that makes it as strong as it is.  With a little chemical additives added in.... for flavor. Would you have walked 500 hundred miles?   Yes, and I would walk 500 more. Just to be the man who walks a 1000 miles?  [deleted] LA LA LA! LA LA LA!  I can't even walk myself 2 two miles.  Smooth mineral /u/DaiLiLlama, are you OK? Are you OK, /u/DaiLiLlama? This is a reference to the song "Smooth Criminal" by Michael Jackson.  Throughout the song, Jackson sings the lyric "Annie, are you OK, are you OK Annie?" Thank you so much. I was confused! kids these days smdh... shake my dick head?

edit:now what? Now you're playing with it. No. This is originally an alien ant farm song... idiot. You've been hit by, you've been struck by. A brick. A smooth mineral &gt;You've been strapped to

FTFY *Damnit Marie, they're mi*

Never mind. Here's the thing... you said cinderblocks "tumble around in ocean currents".

But seriously, this probably sat offshore on a reef or something for while before it was brought back up either by a storm or a person. They don't float. Looks like this one was out there for quite a while though, it's pretty worn down. Neat picture.

Source: oceanographer who weights down instruments with cinder blocks occasionally. None of which have gone a-tumbling. Yeah, it seemed weird to me that there would be a cinder block just floating around the ocean. 

I wasn't going to question it either. I was just going to go out and make a cinder block raft.  A cinderblock raft is the new lead balloon. I'll just meet you halfway with my lead raft. Well I'll be starting two bands and stealing both these names. Yeah that might make you rich but wait til I trade in all this reddit karma for cold hard cash baby! Then we'll see who is laughing. I'll buy you gold if you delete your account and start a new one. [deleted] Now I buy you gold...you must abandon your 3 year account and never use it again. Sucker... Aw shit. Wait a minute. He's already used it after being gilded, what a bastard Totally worth it. That makes a lot of sense if I don't think about it. Oh whoah. That's an offer he needs to consider.  I think we found the economist, folks. There's actually an album I like called 
*'lead sails and paper anchors'*
 The only Atreyu album I've been able to enjoy. the first hit single will be 99 lead rafts 99 lead raft balloons Concrete canoe anyone? &gt;99 lead balloons, floating in the summer sky!

No, wait. That's not it. neunundneunzig leadballoon Now they got all these regulations with lead.... I'm going to be safe and go with the cinderblock raft.

I mean. They make houses ouy of them! Won't work. 


Source: I'm Cuban It wouldn't have to float to be pushed around by currents. There are currents at the bottom of the ocean. 

It was most likely just off of the shore, like /u/rwthompson said. *"hitma... I mean 'oceanographer' who weights down informan... I mean 'instruments' with cinder blocks"* I needed help with a "project" so I called up my cous-...colleague Vinny for some assistance.  Not sure if hitman or just oceanographer... It's a common practice to use cinder blocks when beach fishing for shark. You take your bait out a few hundred yards via kayak, attach a line to a cinder block, it keeps your bait from being brought back to the beach by the current, when a shark takes the bait, the monofilament attached to the cinder block is broken, leaving the cinder block a few hundred yards off shore, and hopefully the shark on the hook.  Do you eat the sharks or catch and release? I can't imagine trying to get the hook out of a shark's mouth.  Some people use hooks that rust fast and don't actually remove them.  some use dehooking devices.  some use pliers.  removing the barb also helps.  I am sure there are other ways.   Catch and release.  I do both, usually only keep 1-2 a year though, I find the meat a bit on the rich side. It could have been dumped just offshore as landfill.

---------------------

Strong winds and shifting sands have uncovered an eerie reminder of San Francisco's past: discarded gravestones and broken tomb markers used decades ago to shore up the Ocean Beach seawall.

The tombstones became visible this week, including bits and pieces of marble and granite that once marked the final resting places of citizens long dead.

One of them is the nearly intact marble tombstone of Delia Presby Oliver, who died at the age of 26 on Apr. 9, 1890.

Her remains were removed and reburied when San Francisco authorities closed nearly all the city cemeteries and moved the bodies to Colma in the early 20th century - part of a move to make space for the growing city. Oliver's original tombstone and thousands like it were used as landfill or in other ways throughout San Francisco.

http://i.imgur.com/rNYdWKH.gif http://gfycat.com/PlayfulFastGnat so they don't float? Try it yourself! That's the fun part about science :) well thanks a lot. I just threw my good cinder block into the river and it floated away. Now i only have an ok cinder block and a bad cinder block. what am i supposed to do now?  combine them to make a single decent cinderblock Have you seen the movie Rubber?

It could happen! That movie was so good and so bad. Meta, like Abed, but indie, like half the greenlit games on steam. Agreed, if it was tumbling around only the external edges would be rounded. This is from water currents eroding all the walls equally. well looks like one got away from you reminds me of the [sea glass](https://seagems.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/sea-glass-jewels-by-tears-of-the-sea.jpg) i used to find on the beach as a kid They look delicious. Pretty rocky candies, actually.  Grave of the fireflies, anyone?


Okay, I'm going to cry a little now Sorry. Lost me. 

Don't cry! that red one in the corner They even have a layer of saltiness for the full flavor effect, like candy worms yum Charlie, that's part of a broken glass bottle It makes gorgeous jewelry if you have some around still! How does a cinder block wash ashore With a mop bucket and some soap. TIL: The ocean is a smooth operator. Smoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooth operatoorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Smooth criminal.  It's where I dispose of the bodies. So mild. Thank you. I wonder how long that took? Anyone got any ideas about that? 3 weeks.

Keep in mind I have no idea what I'm talking about. I'd bet it would take longer than 3 weeks... 4-5 weeks. Whoa, don't go overboard. Like that cinder block did. 3... and a half weeks? seriously, would be a few months of being dragged along the bottom of the reef To etsy! "Upcycled vintage planter". Put it on some old barn wood for the photo. [deleted] Fox News: Atlantis Found! The ocean just changed its font to comic sans I feel like i'm surrounded by idiots in this thread. wat is rock ? It's amazing that *water* did that. Wow. If you think that's impressive, [check this shit out](http://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm)! :P This happens all the time in nature. Ever notice how rivers and streams all have rounded stones? It's the tumbling action they undergo when being washed down stream that does this.  I believe this is called "erosion."

Or is it weathering?  Weathering is a type of erosion. What's it called when water freezes between rocks and breaks them apart? Still a type of weathering - "Freeze-thaw" And what's it called when tree roots grow between rocks and break them up? bioerosion "Root-crack". mechanical weathering It's weathering. Weathering occurs on rocks, erosion occurs on soils. Erosion typically implies translocation/transportation of soil, while weathering implies the chemical and physical processes of rock breakdown.  Erosion can still occur on rocks. Weathering is just the breaking down of the material, erosion is when that material is being taken away/transported  Water itself isn't really going to do that. It can carry harder materials, notably sand, that do the actual abrasive erosion. [Nutri grain.](http://i.imgur.com/8AzSw1d.jpg) Omg is that how rocks get round!?  Yes. Much like minecraft. Everything in nature starts a a solid cube. Yes. This is why streambeds and surrounding areas all have rounded rocks. I love witnessing people realise things like this. I know it's not, but it looks like a small window from a medieval castle.  &gt;mid evil

Medieval Thank you for your kind correction.  I actually though you meant mid evil.  Not low evil or high evil, but mid evil.  A house where average evil lives. Since "mid evil" is typically how it's pronounced, don't feel bad about being corrected! Easy mistake to make.

I do wonder, though - before you learned that the correct spelling was "medieval," what did you think about the term "mid evil"? Did you ever ask yourself why it would be called that? It's what the Internet is here for, apparently.  That's an ancient skyscraper vertebra.  R.I.P. ATLANTIS Cinderblock 2.0 This is too interesting for this subreddit. I need to go lie down for a while. Atlantis 3 confirmed. I guess someone didn't pay the mafia on time. Those are actually tiny doors from the smurf cathedral in Atlantis  those are some round edges whoa! you're right.  I wonder what the history of this cinder block is? Was it tied with a rope around someone's ankle and that person tossed overboard?  TIL nature is a giant rock tumbler Guess the dead guy floated away too. The rock cycle I'm action, deposition---&gt;erosion. It's returning to its people. That looks like the most chill cinderblock ever. Like I can really kick back and talk with that cinderblock. That's such a friendly cinderblock. Nah thats a stone age book shelf bro. That looks like 1960s architecture. I find this incredibly beautiful. Maybe I can borrow the ocean for my new backyard renovation. So smooth...... I guess the dead body finally let it go . This is why you never go running on the beach in the dark. You never know when you're going to trip over one of those dang drift cinder blocks. This is also how sea glass is made.  Here I am, cinder block you like a hurricane! Daily beachcomber here, I've seen some shit.
 OP, that's actually a Lego from the Neolithic Age.... Imagine being hit by a wave and a fucking random cinderblock is in the wave spent a minute thinking about what "time tumbling" was supposed to mean. I'm not a smart man. That's why the ocean is rising! somebody with a saltwater aquarium might want it - it would be a cool decoration There's like a legitimate 75% chance that this was a tool used to "disappear" someone's body.  How did it not sink? It did, unless it was attached to something that floats. It probably just sat offshore on a reef or something for a while. I'm sorry, but a fucking block of stone doesn't "tumble around in ocean currents" it will sink to the bottom and sit there. That is not true.  Ocean, lake, and river currents can move extremely large boulders.  Source:  Niagara Falls. Niagara falls is a bit different from the ocean.. Yes it is.  The ocean would crush this cinder block to dust at it's depth.  Water is strong.  No need to apologize.  You are entitled to your opinion.   i wouldve taken it home and used it as a thing to put candles in and put stuff on top of Herb garden!
 It's oddly pleasing to look at. It would be cool to decorate my yard with a bunch of these. Reminds me of a Sleestak for some reason.  like [this](http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-tough/files/2011/06/bill-laimbeer-thumb-299x224-342650.jpg)? Building block of Atlantis.

Edit: Thanks for the gold! This was a great thing to wake up to this morning. Also Happy Valentine's Day! Turn it 90 more degrees and it looks like they're in a free fall. [AAAHHHHH^HHHHH^HHHHH^HHHHH](http://i.imgur.com/B6wjkJe.jpg) looks like she's using the baby for a soft landing Wouldn't you?! Well, the thing is this. If she dies, the baby will die too. If just the baby dies, she can always live on to have another child.


It is the only logical decision to make, frankly. My logic is undeniable.  Good ol'frank  That guy with the fake head? No, the one with the black friend.  But if that baby is the kwisatz haderach, the chosen one? Read the first couple of chapters last night, would not have gotten reference yesterday at this time LOL

I died when he started patting on the keyboard with his hands and wasn't even typing...this is awesome. I think what I got out of this is that it's completely ambiguous.  There's nothing ambiguous about that hair. Turn it 90 degrees more and it looks like she is suplexing the child *Now I'm freeeee, free fallin'! Fallin'!* Reminded me of [this] (http://i.imgur.com/65da4bJ.jpg). Not sure if it needs a tag, but the woman apparently died. Yes, it's by Stanley Forman. The woman died, somehow the kid survived. It also reminds me of the many 9/11 photographs. The terror of falling like that is not something I'd ever want to experience. I'm right there with you, man. I'm terribly afraid of hights, and the thought of falling like this, really makes me anxious. I saw it in a post not too long ago. I believe the kid made it, due to it landing on her, and I believe it was the godmother. It's not the fall that kills you...it's the ground.  I'm not particularly afraid of heights, it's just the idea of falling without any control. A mother, using her baby as a football,  dives toward the goal line in hopes of breaking the plane.  Just seeing those chairs, I could smell and taste mcdonald's fries. While I haven't eaten in McDonalds in like 8 years... I fully respect the meaning of this image.

I will remember this poster. I was thinking more of a ghostly dead mother reclaiming her baby to take back to the underworld.  No I'm pretty sure it's that baby from Looper "You think this is funny you little shit? I'm taking you with me" wait here baby, mommy is getting some cake... This picture tells a different story for every 90 degree turn! Or maybe she's a poltergeist and she's coming out of the wall to grab the kid.

 Whoa, I didn't notice that. Now we know this pic isn't from murica. Actually I vividly remember chairs like that in McDonald's and Wendy's in the U.S. When I was a kid chairs like that were more common, and always way too far away from the table for me.  We had similar chairs in a Taco Bell near me. They always seemed to be sagging. I'm not sure if they were designed that way (maybe to get customers to not linger long after eating) or if they actually sagged from overweight customers.  Fat people in your store makes your company look bad. Because it's too clean to be a Maccas chair? The gap between the table and the chair is too small. Um, its really not :/ BAM! Damn that's a very good fixing. Nice photoshop skillz bruh *heh.. little do these idiots know that I work here. It's easy to just flip the picture instead* *Did I just say all that out loud?

The fan blade ends are yellow, which represents danger. The baby knew better than to touch those.  Could be a mother that didn't like he child.   If that was the case weren't they supposed to kill the before birth?

A la abortion? Aw come on, him love he child.

And that egg... is *Earth.* Awesome Why is the map itself labeled "upside down"? Who's to say which side is supposed to be up? Europeans, historically. Hence the quotes. Australian map. K, going out on a limb to be the new dumb American here. 
Your fucking with me right? 
So you to tell me if I ever head to our southern hemisphere I'll be having to be the 'American holding the maps upsid... Errrm right side up?!' Haha, yes. I'm fucking with you.

But really, I can't stop laughing, I'm so fucking dumb on the map thing. I should really just stick to reading comments when I'm this high and *not* be contributing.  There are some crazy ass people on here. 

No way, not dumb. Don't do that, high comments are the best comments.  I like this exchange It would piss me off. I thought he was just asking whether Australians [used this map orientation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South-up_map_orientation).

I always assume they swivel and they it seems those are rarer now :( Aaaaaand McDonald's is on front page again No man, the wall is sideways I'm not sure why,  but it took a long time to get my laughter under control after seeing this Very observant. Here is your invisible trophy:  Kinda creepy. Reminds me of that movie Mama maybe shes flying. That McDonald's is located in Cooper Station. Maybe the child was falling and she made a sideways dive to catch them. Or tackle them.. Like Micheal Jackson on the balcony. Black mothers are superheroes  The old style chairs make me happy. I'm seeing an unholy banshee stealing a child in broad daylight. It's Super Woman saving a baby falling from a tree, duh.  Remember when mcdonals was for kids and some shit coffee shop for adults? Have a slight problem with the middle chair angle. Looks like she is wearing a camouflage suit and a white polka dot cape to me. Picture looks perfect. I prefer to think she was in a swing, playing superman, and grabbed the baby when it got too close.  
 Actually I think its superman wife! The hidden chef of Mcdonalds! [Binky Barnes](http://static2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100624191120/arthur/images/f/f4/2x02a.png) wouldn't have let this happen. Incredible diving catch. She's got a career in the Lingerie Football League. Dementor! This made me laugh a whole lot more than it should've  Maybe her legs are wrapped around a tree branch and she just has wicked core muscles.  The person who hung this picture wants $15/hr. Go take a better picture and post to /r/photoshopbattles.

Also, her body is invisible and it's windy. looks like a ghost mom
 It was either an idiot who wasn't paying attention to what they were doing, or it was a genius troll. I could see either way.  Probably an idiot. They do work at McDonalds after all.  God I hope it's the genius troll. I would love to do something like this. /r/hailcorporate or /r/adbusters/ take your pick Maybe the entire McDonald's is sideways and the pic is right side up. maybe she is superwoman and was flying, did you not think of that... ;) I think it's cool that the new Superman is a black woman with frizzy hair. This should be the reference go-to picture if anybody asks if it fits in this subreddit. Makes it look more interesting at least. Oh my god it looks like she's tackling a child that was thrown up. Or catching a child that dropped from somewhere high up. That's *hilarious*!!!! Super Woman. If you didn't tell me it was hung sideways I probably would've never noticed [deleted] Post tomorrow: The wind naturally curled this snow into a roll.

If some one punched me of the pier for unrolling the snow I wold enjoy sueing them and thus having them pay for my college tution.  Except I'm pretty sure /u/takeitatanangle meant punching the roll, not the person who unrolls it. LOL thank you, that was like the verbal equivalent of those pictures that can be a horse or a rabbit, but you can't for the life of you make out the second of the two no matter how hard you look. I would be satisfied by chucking it at a foe My urge would be to push it into the water. This is why we can't have nice things. ...but why we can have ice things.  I just realized that I have no idea of how snow behaves.  As a Florida native, I agree. This just about blew my mind.  **These "snow rollers" naturally occur!**  I moved to and had my first winter in Ohio last year, after living in southern states for many years.  In January I think, for a week or two, these things were everywhere in fields and other open areas.  It was crazy-looking.

I'm not lying or exaggerating -- [Look it up](http://www.ohio.com/polopoly_fs/1.462231.1390880874!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_500/roller28-03.jpg).  With just the right snow and wind, you get conditions that make it look like tons of kids starting rolling snowmen, and stopped at the first ball (roll).  Apparently it's a rare phenomenon, and I was disappointed my children were too young to really appreciate or remember it.  But it was one of the coolest weather-related phenomenon I've ever seen. As a Midwesterner, this doesn't surprise me. Snow actually has a tendency to stick together. It's nothing like powder or pixie dust.  Depends on how far up north you are I suppose. Here in Thunder Bay, it's all powdery. I've only ever seen the sticky stuff towards the beginning and end of the season. It's powdery depending on the temperature.  Humidity and moisture Humidity. Temperature has very little to do with it. The humidity determines how the crystals form from the seed, and the shape of the crystals determines how much they stick together, in combination with ambient humidity. You really can't do that with snow most of the time. You'd need just the right conditions when it was falling. Like a... perfect storm. I've spent all of my winters in snowy climes and I'm confused by this. The only way snow sticks together is if it's wet/packing snow. Its a bitch to drive in as it basically creates a slick streak of ice under the tires. Powdery snow doesn't stick together, and will blow away easily. 

At home, we call it Snowman Snow, cause its the only type of snow that will make snowmen.  To do something like that (or even build good snowballs) the snow is a little bit wet. It's  a little bit "crunchy." It sticks together really nice :) Theres fluffier, flakier snow, which doesn't stick together.  Australian here, I've never seen real snow... How does it do these things?! Does it even science? 
Tomorrow's ELI5 Haskoli island? The photo is taken there, yes :) Yay slendingur! Sll vertu! Looks like bubble tape after you take it out of the container.

These never lasted long for me. I'm almost 40 years old and I still chew that shit. I LOVE that shit. For some reason I thought u/LivEisJeebus was referring to bubble wrap at first. The thought of you maniacally chewing on a roll of it was quite amusing to me.   It's like the PopRocks of packing material. Are u a lefty by any chance. Only because a person who is a righty would have started at the spot where u took the picture  If I tried to do that, it would have definitely fallen into the water halfway through, and I'd be so mad As someone who has live in Florida my whole life and had very little exposure to snow, I really look at this and think, "what the fuck?" Don't worry, I live in New York and feel the same way. This happened naturally all the time last winter in the midwest and northeast US, for some reason. They're called [snow rollers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_roller), apparently. It was weird seeing them all over the place, because I've lived in snowy areas all my life and hadn't seen them before. #####&amp;#009;

&gt;

&gt;A __snow roller__ is a rare [meteorological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorological) phenomenon in which large [snowballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball) are formed naturally as chunks of [snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow) are blown along the ground by [wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind), picking up material along the way, in much the same way that the large snowballs used in [snowmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowmen) are made.

&gt;Unlike snowballs made by people, snow rollers are typically [cylindrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical) in shape, and are often hollow since the inner layers, which are the first layers to form, are weak and thin compared to the outer layers and can easily be blown away, leaving what looks like a [doughnut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut) or [Swiss roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_roll). Snow rollers have been seen to grow as large as two feet in diameter.

&gt;The following conditions are needed for snow rollers to form:

&gt;


&gt;* There must be a relatively thin surface layer of wet, loose snow, with a temperature near the [melting point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point) of ice

&gt;* Under this thin layer of wet snow there must be a substrate to which the thin surface layer of wet snow will not stick, such as ice or powder snow

&gt;* The wind must be strong enough to move the snow rollers, but not strong enough to blow them apart.

&gt;* Alternatively, gravity can move the snow rollers as when a snowball, such as those that will fall from a tree or cliff, lands on a steep hill and begins to roll down the hill.

&gt;Because of this last condition, snow rollers are more common in hilly areas. However, the precise nature of the conditions required makes them a very rare phenomenon.

But good job on the snow roll Thank you. I can sleep now.  How did you begin this roll? Bubbletape! My first thought too, if only it was pink! I don't want to seem stupid here, but how did you roll the snow? Same way you build a snowman I'm guessing. Start at one end and start rolling it, if the snow is sticky enough it will start building up. but how... how does it look so perfect? definitely satisfying. idk why though. It really is.  Everything about it is just perfect.  I think I've achieved inner peace. Next week someone will retitle it, "look what the wind did to this snow!"

More of a railing than a fence.....

 But that's none of my business -Kermit It's beautiful. Like a fruit roll up for angels. It's six feet of snow. For you. Not them. This makes my senses happy.  This gives me a hard on I'm so horny right now Being an Australian who has never seen snow, I am thoroughly confused.

Thank's for obliterating everything I thought I knew about how snow works.

*Asshole.* 

Edit: I can't spell. are you jesus THAT IS NOT SATISFYING

I NEED YOU TO KNOCK IT OFF THE FENCE PLEASE How do you do that? The snow needs to be the right texture, likely closer to freezing when it fell or just starting to melt. *Dude*, it's rolled the wrong way.

My girlfriend would be *pissed*. Nah, you have to put it in like that, otherwise the cat would unroll it.  Well done! Cool! Now finish the job. This is why the internet exists. God bless. How does one go about rolling snow? Good job. You should pe a carpet peeler Now I want cinnamon rolls... You're doing god's work.  This doesn't even seem possible to me... West Glen?  Is this Sweden? It looks like Sweden. Reykjavk, Iceland How were you able to do this?!?! NOW PUNCH IT You pearled it, my friend. Nicely done.
 I love watching when they do this. It happens on mountains with snow, as the wind blows a bit of snow falls. If it is the right angle, the snowball effect will happen and you get this giant circles of snow everywhere. Are you in a Russian city? 100 bits /u/changetip

 Yes, but does it unroll? I would totally lose it if it did. Florida guy here. I don't understand how this is physically possible. I though snow was just a powdery substance, like flour. How did you do that? you should become a superhero named Supermaid Jesus! That IS satisfying AF This is really amazing. Curious how you did it. What is this witchcraft?! Eat it. *unrolls* That looks a hell of a lot like WMU's Parkview campus... but I'm probably wrong. I find this much more oddly satisfying than it is mildly interesting.

 I came.

My Sunday night has now been subtly satisfied. Now roll it back. Snow by the Foot Little debbies! Mmmmm thats gooood [Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/kgT1YwH.png)

Don't like this? Message me! A med student was cutting a crushed ring off of an old guy's finger in ER and commented that the ring was tough to cut for gold. The old guy's eyes widened and he glanced at his wife. The med student thinks the guy bought fake gold wedding bands for them years ago and had never been outed.
 "...you must have gotten that special cold-forged gold! Boy, that must have cost a bundle." [deleted] My wife insisted her wedding band be a cheap ($50) piece of costume jewelry she really liked.

Edit for posterity: was replying to a comment where the guy said his wife wouldn't find out her ring was CS until she tried to sell it.  Marry her!   
Oh wait... Dude she's taken. You chose ... wisely. at least some people are practical.. a wife worth keeping That was a test, bro.  You didn't pass.   BS. I'd have been upset if my husband went against my wishes and spent a ton on a diamond instead of the moissanite he gave me (and which I love), and I would expect him to be very upset with me if I was so manipulative as to play games like pretending I didn't want a diamond when I really did. That's no way to start a marriage. Yes, the real "test" is if a man is capable of taking what I say seriously. A man who listens to the words I say and doesn't assume that I'm a lying trickster is worth more than any diamond. [deleted] My fiancee and I agreed that diamonds are a huge waste of money (and I have issues with the whole diamonds being expensive thing, I'm not a fan of the De Beers company) , so we got these simulated ones (not created, they're like czs with extra coating or something). 
We were looking at some other stuff in a jewellers and the lady there looked at her fake ring and was like "oh my god! This diamond is flawless! It must have cost you a fortune!" 
So I think the fakes are getting better.  Moissanite,  shits half the price and has a double refraction or some shit, i dunno, makes it reflect twice as many spectrums or something. You can tell when you look at it next to a diamond. 


They may get a little dull over time (the new technology has fixed that though),  but fuck spending money on a diamond. They are practically worthless. The supply is abundant and controlled to maximize profit, I'll never buy another one if i can help it. Plus, moissanite is FUCKING SCIENCE, BITCH.  My ring is moissanite. It's a 9.5 on the mohs scale as opposed to 10 for a diamond but it is actually optically superior to diamonds. The people who sell diamonds will try to tell you that moissanite looks tacky because its "too sparkly" but they'll go on and on about how sparkly a flawless diamond is. Oh but that cheaper one? no no no you don't want that, it's over the line of sparkle appropriateness. And not half price, try 1/10th the price. 

http://www.moissanitevsdiamondrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Moissanite_JFire_Test-Large.jpg Mohs is tricky though, because the actual difference in hardness between 9 and 10 is about the same as the difference between 1 and 9. That said, moissanite is great.  [deleted] My engagement ring is moissanite. It was more like 1/10 the price if a diamond at the time we bought it. It is more refractive than a diamond, I think it looks better. Bounces more light off of it. IIRC the entire diamond market is basically fixed - I think there is a HUGE horde of diamonds in Russia (no, not the one in the asteroid crater) that is being held back from the market due to ongoing "understanding" between De Beers and certain Russian influences. If those diamonds were released into the world market they would basically become cheap trinkets you could toss around like M&amp;Ms at Mardi Gras. *I have issues with the whole diamonds being expensive thing, I'm not a fan of the De Beers company*

Wise man! If you want to read about the diamond cartel, and how something that is in in plentiful supply suddenly became valuable [edit: and how advertising ensured diamond engagement rings suddenly became THE proof of love] this is a good article: http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you-ever-tried-to-sell-a-diamond/304575/ Bro's got his back File that one away for next time, everyone When we're all removing rings from married couples? Good foresight.  If the rings had been made of gold then his finger really would have been crushed. Luckily it just ended up being his wife's heart instead. Pretty sure if you have been together for some time, a ring not being pure gold will have been one of the smaller things you've been through. For those who waited for marriage, sometimes the small thing *is* the problem. like OP's Johnson  Nice! Unless you are OP's wife thatsthejoke.png [thatsthejoke.png](http://i.imgur.com/tEjeMu8.png)

 "Honey, we've been through losing our home, two miscarriages and our child getting addicted to heroin, but you know what, nothing hurts as much as knowing that this ring isn't gold"

Seems a bit of a stretch to me. He was talking about penis size So was lbster. Didn't you read the last line? Would you ever have a ring of pure pure gold? Isn't that like...super malleable? No never pure gold.  14 karat (58% gold) is generally considered the ideal composition for rings. Yeah the ring wouldn't matter so much.  However the *lie* that he had kept for all those years would. Oh boo hoo so her ring is made of a less expensive shiny metal. It's not like he fucked her sister.  Yet.  Or did he? Wouldn't it have been easy to remove if it was gold?  Like gold is normally quite malleable. He's saying the strength of the not-gold ring saved his finger from being crushed. If it was gold, it wouldn't have been as strong. "gold" rings actually aren't pure gold....not a single jeweler would make a ring from pure gold 14k is an alloy. the [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fineness) is pretty sweet. apperently 14-18 k is standard for rings, which is a little over 50% gold...shit is way to soft to use for most stuff you want to hold it's shape and not get destroyed from just setting you're hand on a hard surface or whatever.  Now that is just a fucked up way to measure alloys, with a fraction of 24 and use the same unit they use for mass, I kind get how it came to be but still... Karat and Carat: http://science.howstuffworks.com/dictionary/geology-terms/question64.htm One letter difference between the two words but completely different units of measure. Just to confuse things further precious metals are measured in Troy ounces (31.1g) rather than Avoirdupois ounces (28.3g). I buy and sell gold for a living and I get people who call in and say they have an ounce of 10k in bracelet form and expect it to be worth the price of an ounce they heard on the news last night. 

It's hard explaining to people that 24k = 100% and 10k is only 41.7% of that and your 28 gram 10k bracelet isn't even a full ounce and is actually only worth a percentage of a percentage of that number from the news.  Maybe it was just 10k gold when the student was used to cutting 24k gold?  10k gold is only 40% gold, the rest is tougher metal like nickel.  Some people don't like 24k jewellery, not because they're cheap, but because it's fragile as fuck.  All you have to do is tap a 24k  gold ring on a glass window and you've put a dent in it - that doesn't happen to alloyed gold.   I don't think many rings are made of 24k as that's too soft. 10-14k is the ideal for rings.  I have some Chinese jewelry that is 24 karat, it's more heirloom than anything because the metal is too soft to wear without damaging it Many cultures give 24kt jewelry as wedding gifts and such. Definitely heirloom and not meant to wear except special occasions.  Sooo much Thai gold. I see a lot of Thai and viet gold. Yes to a lot of chinese gold too.  They just love that bright 24k look

And yes, I've seen plenty of people wear it. They just end up getting it repaired, or straightened His was .1k gold ring. My english isn't very good and I couldn't translate that properly. Can you explain it like to an idiot what the guy said and what he tought? Gold is soft.  The ring was hard.  The doctor said the ring probably isn't gold.  The man most likely had bought fake gold rings for him and his wife for their wedding. The old man was horrified because he was finally caught by the doctor. Thanks dude! That made it clear to me :) Even as a native English speaker the comment took a second to understand. Just worded a bit oddly I think. Simple English Wikipedia meets Reddit comments. I dig it. Should be a novelty account. Good idea.  ^ Why I love Reddit.

Not only is this a clear, informative response to a genuine request for philological help, delivered without snark or prejudice, it comes courtesy of someone who prefers the nom des chiffres  "EatTheBooty." [deleted] He said it was difficult to cut through the man's wedding ring, and since it was difficult to cut it wouldn't seem to be gold (because gold is soft).

Since the man had a worried look on his face, the guy thought maybe he had bought rings made of fake gold for his marriage

If this is still too confusing let me know which part doesn't make sense I would've been woried too :D Damn.. I get emberrased just by thinking about it Gold is a relatively soft metal.  The med student cutting the metal said he thought the ring seemed hard for gold.  When he said this, the man seemed nervous about his wife hearing that because the wedding ring may not have been made of real gold. Thank you very much :) I'm getting into this conversation a little bit late, but as an ER doctor, the toughest ring I've ever had to cut off was a gold Cartier ring.  I had to go through two ring cutters, and it took about 30 minutes to make both cuts (usually we make a single cut and then bend the ring if possible, but it was too hard).

A hard ring doesn't necessarily mean that it's cheap. Yup.  Could be platinum.  Or Titanium!  In both cases, i think the ring cannot be cut (in a reasonable amount of time) without injury because the metals are too strong.  I've heard something like this from a jeweler once.   I got a toy stuck on my finger when I was like 10. I didn't tell my parents until the next day and my finger had swollen so bad there was no hope of getting off. My mother wanted to try and smash it off with a hammer but every time she pulled back I could help but pull away. As we were on the way to the hospital she decided to stop by the fire department. Enter this tool. They got it off in less than a minute and seemed fairly thrilled about the whole thing because it was a boring day. Finger saved plus I got to check out the fire-trucks. Emergency responders must have loved having the emergency brought to them for a change! Are you saying we should light the fire house on fire?  I think he means we should light them on fire.  Firefighter here. Can confirm, would love it if you lit me on fire. Are you being vague? Well to be more specific, I'd like to be in my turnout gear first... True story. There's a fire department near me that's burned down 3 times now. I once had a lady collapse with a heart attack right in front of my fire station while I was out checking the mail box. 

I think about it from time to time. On the one hand, how unlucky was she to have a heart attack? On the other, how lucky to have it there and then? Right where there's people and equipment who know just what to do. 

She ended up being ok.  Note for everyone who wants to avoid medical bills: go to the fire department! I was going to get a $300 ultrasound tomorrow...but you know what, I think I'll just go to the fire dept for free! Problem solved. 

Edit: I cried a little bit after I posted this because I wish so hard this was true. :( My kidneys suck balls for making me fork over $300 bucks.  Hey, sucky kidney bro, I had to get one of those ultrasounds, too!  That day they also put a catheter in me (I got a newbie nurse, so that was a whole adventure by itself), used it to fill my bladder up with that fluid that shows up on an x-ray (oh god it was so cold), and then stuck a bedpan under me, rolled an x-ray screen over me, and made 17-year-old me pee out all the fluid in front of the doctors, nurses, God and everybody so they could watch to make sure everything was flowing in the right direction.  One of the most awkward days of my life.  And they didn't even find anything wrong, I just have bunk kidneys.  

I'm sorry, I never get to tell that story. Yeah if your kidneys are sucking your balls you should go to the doctor fo' sho'. My dad used to work in a middle school and girls had problems with rings all the time. After calling the fire department almost every week for a few months they ended up just giving him one so they didn't need to be called anymore. Really neat tool though, still has it I think. Why do they go to school to complain about their fat finger problem?

 Middle school. They go everywhere to complain about everything.  One of those swimming days where all the girls in the class are on their periods and can't swim. That day where all the guys yell "shark in the water"? Who the fuck calls the fire department for this. No offence oc.  In some jurisdictions, the fire dept and EMTs are the same.  I love specialized tools, thanks for sharing.  That could make a good subreddit. /r/specializedtools

Just did it. Welp! We're already split between /r/specializedtools and /r/specialisttools

Not great for subreddits just starting out.

 /r/specializedtools masterrace.  [deleted] Thanks, cunt_slack.  I'm afraid 10 is bit too young for an explanation on that one. That sounds great, how does one create a subreddit, and then let people know if it's existence? http://www.reddit.com/reddits/create

I don't know, it seems kind of difficult, but /r/specialisttools/? You're a specialized tool Not the worst thing I've been called. Here is what a ring looks like after going through one of those: http://i.imgur.com/zQO8AYL.png

Fiancees ring got smooched onto her finger, had to be cut off. I looked at this completely wrong! I thought this was just for cutting off the finger, but the way it acutally works makes a lot more sense!
 I actually fucked up so badly with a ring when I was younger that my finger was a blue/purple sausage by the time I got to the doc. When we were on the phone getting advice, my mum said 'I'm afraid they're going to have to cut it off.' The gut-wrenching panic turned to embarrassment when she clarified that she meant the ring. They used the can opener and everything was fine the next morning. Had the same happen to me with a washer that got stuck on my finger in elementary school. The tool looks pretty menacing to a little kid, and having had parents give warnings like "if you get that stuck on your finger, you will lose the finger", and having the nice fireman say "we'll have to cut it off", there's really only one obvious place for the young mind to go. 

It was a terrifying experience that I hope to someday pass on to my children. Same thing happened to me, except it was the ER doc who said it. He pulled out that cutter and grabbed my hand and I was saying goodbye to my pinkie when he snipped off the ring. [I found another one. It works great!](http://cdn3.volusion.com/vqwby.cvxuo/v/vspfiles/photos/CAC-P-CUTTER-Y-2.jpg?1419323465) [The Flash has memories of this one] (http://www.jokeoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/flash-guillotine-500x596.jpg) The ladies love it.

 lol where is this from. For those wondering, it's a cigar cutter. Yeah I know -- I've seen Darkman. [Me too](http://i.imgur.com/wirXNSF.gif) For some reason my mind went straight to "foreskin remover" /r/DIY  /r/DiWHY  As a jeweler, you'd be surprised how many people think we are about to amputate their finger to get to the daggum ring off... Their reaction to the ring cutter is always great to watch. That should I still some fear into them and make them think about the size of the next ring they'll try on. I actually want to know if this would work with tungsten, as my wife and I have wedding bands made from the metal. It seems like I would just lose the finger. Tungsten is very hard, but also brittle. I think they can break the ring. Probably won't lose a finger. The best way to remove a stuck tungsten or ceramic ring is to use vice grips.

1. Open the vice jaws all the way using the adjustable screw.
2. Close the vice jaws, then adjust the screw until it's the exact size as the outside of your ring.
3. Open the vice jaws, then tighten the screw a little bit.
4. Clamp the ring, squeeze.  The ring will shatter.

Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poM423pewRE Thanks for this.  Just sent an email to my ER manager about maybe purchasing some vice grips for this.  So many men get tungsten carbide, so we'd end up banging our heads against the wall with ring cutters and our dremel. Thanks! I have a tungsten carbide ring and I always wondered how to get it off in an emergency. I never realized how brittle tungsten is, I always tap the ring on metal/wood/whatever when I am bored, i'm surprised I haven't broken it yet. &gt; Probably won't lose a finger

Probably. 60% of the time, it works every time. The jeweler I got mine from said that in an emergency situation, you're actually suppose to use a clamp to shatter it rather than a blade for cutting. I gained weight after I got married and about three years after the wedding my ring got so tight my finger was really starting to hurt. Being a tungsten band, I knew you couldn't cut the thing so I looked online how to remove it. Get a locking pliers and clamp to the ring. Unlock and tighten the pliers by a quarter turn and clamp back on the ring. Lather, rinse, repeat until the ring shatters.  Here is a video.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poM423pewRE no this will not. Best way to get off a tungsten ring is to break it entirely. 

It's porous, like stone. so it's brittle enough to break  Tungsten Carbide is not porous, but it is brittle and can be broken.

Think of metals as existing along a brittle-malleable or hard-soft continuum.  When something is malleable or soft, it responds to pressure by deforming, like taffy.  When it is hard, it responds to pressure by breaking, like frozen taffy.  It takes a lot more pressure to break frozen taffy than it does to bend warm taffy, but if you apply that pressure, the frozen taffy will break instead of bending.  It is the same with Tungsten Carbide.  It takes a lot of pressure to break it, but it will break instead of deforming. This is probably the single most concise explanation I have ever read for this concept! Thank you! How do you break it without breaking the finger?

[^bot ^info](http://www.reddit.com/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index) You can crack them with vice grips but it's safer to use another purpose built tool called a [ring cracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IXCu5jPhiU). where the hell was this when I went to the ER a few months ago?

I had an 'open dislocation' (bone sticking out) of my pinky finger.
they told me my wedding ring on the next digit over needed to come off.

they tried using butter, string, and at one point there were three techs working on me with one guy's foot on my chest so he could get better leverage.

when all else failed (and after a 45 minute wait where some RN was probably making a Home Depot run), they brought back a friggin' DREMEL and cut my ring off.

the funny/sad part was that they did not mask/protect my open wound (bone sticking out) a few inches away.
the radiologist asked me what all the flecks were on my x-ray and I had to explain they were little chunks of gold dust that sprayed all over my hand. That sounds like a sorta bush league hospital That's obscene. It's something every rescue squad has, so it's something a hospital should have. can you not use the string wrapped around the finger and through the ring trick? seems like it would work just as fast and save the ring to boot. The string trick does work but in the most severe cases it becomes physically impossible. You might end up degloving it if you pull too hard Just looked up what degloving was,  my fingers just clenched. fingers are not the only things you can deglove... Cock rings..... And that's why I will only ever use gel rings! I hope you mean silicone; gel and jelly toys aren't really body safe. Get one that is properly sized and the metal one &gt; any shitty gel ones you can find at an adult store WHY?!  Imagine what my crotch felt during the lab period where I had to deglove my cadaver's penis. (First year of medical school) "had to" "cadaver" "Medical school" "penis", no wait that one's right. Only way he could get off of it? AHHHHHHH!!!! Additionally, if the ring is crushed (as in soft metal) it doesn't exactly match the shape of the rest of the finger to "just come off". For the curious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB_lTOSshM

Edit: As /u/alittlewood and /u/oyp have pointed out, a better implementation of the method can be seen here: http://youtu.be/DxoAbK5Pc6w For those wondering: no degloving, just how the trick works if it works. Thank you! Although I never heard of degloving, I'm pretty sure I'm not going to want to watch a video of it and wouldn't have taken the click risk. A few years ago a coworker was taking pipe off the top of his van and the bungee caught his wedding ring and degloved his finger as he stepped off the tire to the ground. The next day everyone stopped wearing their wedding rings to work.  That's pretty neat! [Elastics](http://youtu.be/DxoAbK5Pc6w) seem to work a bit better Anyone who watches this just skip to 1:50, man sure does  love to talk I only heard of that technique afterwards, but I was maybe 8 and had this ball bearing that fell apart and thought 'Hey that'd make a cool ring.' I put it on, &amp; couldn't get it off. My finger was starting to swell and turn color. I had to go to the hospital. They had a similar tool to this that had no problem cutting through gold or silver. It didn't scratch the steel bearing I had stuck on my finger.

It ended up that someone there just happen to know someone that worked with steal and had a tool that would cut it. They came up to the hospital with a Dremel. By this time I've got a crowd of nurses &amp; doctors &amp; whoever else was there around me. I was pretty visibly upset thinking I was for sure going to lose my finger. He plugs the thing up and goes to work. 5 minutes in, it's off.

20 years later and I believe my dad still has that damn bearing, and no problem doing a show and tell for whoever will listen.

TL/DR This tool is fine for rings made of gold and silver, but is useless against harden steel ones. I know from experience. And I only found out about the string technique after my ordeal was over. We just bought a nice ring cutter for my office, and in the process I found out they have "crackers" for ceramic, titanium, and tungsten rings. Not so much help for eight year old you, but helpful for anyone that may be nervous about their own rings. 

As a side note, if you fall or injure your arm or hand? Please take off your rings on that hand! Even if you don't think you need to. I hate to remove rings! It makes me feel bad.  Also, as you get more and more pregnant, start wearing your wedding rings on a necklace. Nothing worse than having to cut wedding rings off someone who is already SUPER EMOTIONAL and having a really shitty time carrying around a human. I have a tungsten ring. The place I bought it from taught me what to do if I need to remove it. 

Short answer: vice grip pliers. Just keep adjusting the tightness on the vice grip incrementally as you open and close it as you move around the ring. Eventually it [the ring] will shatter.  Good to know, I have a tungsten ring. Make sure you have eye protection, in my experience they don't just shatter. They fucking explode. picture of bearing pls http://i.imgur.com/tA5kIHI.jpg

http://imgur.com/q80j1Nw Upvote for delivery! Also - would not want that stuck on my finger, nty What sort of metal is this not effective to use on? I know titanium has been a real problem for EMS workers. Tungsten can be broken with vice-grips but good luck cutting it.

Any others? I'm not positive but I'm guessing these were designed for mainly soft jewelry metals. Titanium and tungsten rings will definitely give this tool problems.  These modern ring cutters have zero issues cutting titanium rings.

Source: I've cut 2 titanium rings off of co-workers fingers. Well that answers that. Titanium is easy to cut as long as you don't get it hot (it heat hardens), any kind of power cutting or machining runs into this problem, but a hand operated saw would not. Is there a video of this being used? I'm interested.  here you go http://youtu.be/5XjJzusiJPE?t Awesome, thanks for that. I didn't fully understand how it works, but this helped a lot.  I had to have one of these used on me before. I was 11 and was in a hardware store with my parents. I found a copper washer on the ground and thought it was a cool ring so stuck it on my finger. When I tried to take it off it wouldnt come off and the sharp edges cut my finger. 5 hours and a lot of soap and olive oil later my parents took me to the hospital when it still wouldn't come off and my finger was all cut and bloody. 

I still have my "certificate of bravery" with a teddy bear doctor on it. I was a stupid kid.  Cost to produce: $25  
Cost to purchase: $175  
Amount billed to patient after use: $5,824
 I love medical stuff. I work at a hospital, and one day I got tired of the soft nylon strap handle on my tool bag and went looking for some sort of rod to use to stiffen it. Digging through the upper floors of our abandoned hospital facility on site, I found a med cart in the orthopedic surgery area that was full of sticks. Just these black rods, about 10mm in diameter, in various lengths. There was one the perfect length so I stuck it in my bag handle and it worked great. It was really lightweight too. Later I was curious what it was for and looked up the part number stenciled on it. Apparently, it was made in Switzerland, was part of a bone stabilizing rig, and made out of carbon fiber. Cost: $241. The handle of my tool bag cost 10x what the bag cost, and it's just an inanimate carbon rod. It's awesome. I was in the ER as a student and saw a patient come in with a Tungsten ring on his finger, and his finger was swollen to be double it's original size around it. The thing with tungsten is that it can't be cut. Doctor calls maintenance to bring a pair of vice grips and clamped on them to snap the fucker off. 

Amount billed: Somewhere near $3000 Whats the difference between an emergent situation and an emergency situation? It's a pipe cutter, with a soft side. [You can remove stuck rings without cutting them using just an oxygen mask strap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxoAbK5Pc6w). Ring AND finger stay whole. Not in an emergency situation you can't. One of these tools takes just a second or two and works even if there is severe trauma to the patient. It's also very important to remove jewelry from burn victims. That trick doesn't work in the case of severe trauma or burns.

That is pretty nifty though. When my grandma passed away my aunt asked the funeral director for the rings on her finger for a keep sake. 
The rings hadn't been off in quite sometime and her finger had swollen around them. 
The funeral director said " Absolutely, but you have two options. We can cut the rings or we can not cut the rings." 
My aunt got two fully intacted rings at the funeral... I read this at first as removing swollen fingers and looked to see if it was r/creepy. Damn, for a second there I thought I was the first person to notice it says "emergent" instead of "emergency". Oh well the word *emergent* bothers me on that sentence... emergent &lt;&gt; emergency  I had to have a Titanium Wedding ring cut off years ago, I had a allergic reaction to something I ate, and after a few days of swelling in my face and legs, I woke up to swollen hands a blue finger. I tried like hell to get it off that morning, I tried using lubricant and everything else you could think of to get it off. Hurt like hell. Opted to wait a few hours and see if the swelling went down. It did not. Wound up going to the ER where they spent the next 6 hours slowly cutting the ring. After about 30 blades they got through one side. But still couldn't get the ring off. Two ER techs then got some needle nose pliers and pulled the two cut edges open while a doctor put a penny in as a spacer. They then wrapped my finger in umbilical cord tape (iirc), and had me hold my arm above my head for another half hour or so. When the swelling didn't go down they, started cutting the other side. By this time the doctor was starting to get pretty worried and so was I. A nurse seeing the pain and panic in my face, popped me with a shot of Demerol. After the Demerol I was sitting there talking about how I'll still be able to sprint and duck in BF2 using my pinky finger. After some more cutting they ran out of blades, and started calling local fire departments and such to bring in whatever cutting wheels they had. Then I got the little speech about re-constructive surgery. From the way I understood it they were planning on taking a bone saw to the top of my hand to get through the ring. They even brought the saw up to the ER room I was in, and then realized it didn't have a air line to run the saw. While they were prepping me to go to a OR, a Truck from the OKC Fire Dept showed up with a bunch of cutters from the next large city over. Another hour or so and they we're finally through it. Was a crazy day. Hopefully they have better tools now to deal with this sort of thing. noted. dont get a titanium wedding ring next year. got it. You could do this and save the ring. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxoAbK5Pc6w I am guessing there are many cases that have more severe swelling. For instance, a broken finger will swell the finger more than a broken arm would. Also, sometimes something falls onto the hand and deforms the ring which could also lead to this trick not working. I am allergic to most metals in jewelry. I found this out when I was about 6. A steel ring got stuck on my finger due to swelling and I had to get it cut off at a kiosk in the middle of a mall. The guy used this tool on me and it took about 10 minutes of cranking down on that thing. It hurt like hell and because i didn't cry I got a cool tiger's eye necklace from the man. He was a nice guy. Left a nasty wound on the palm of my hand. Bet it still couldn't open up a Fray Bentos pie Do you need 2 of these? I m picturing that if the finger is swollen enough that first cut doesn't work and the ring needs to be cut into 2 pieces that the first cut on the ring would cut into the flesh like fangs when the tool is removed. I would rather have a gash on my finger than a finger stump tbh. If it is gold you could probably just bend the band apart.  You make two cuts with the same one. It depends what type of ring it is. Gold is pretty flexible so it can be bent after the first cut, but if your ring is titanium 2 cuts need to be made. This is why people tell me I'm taking a chance wearing a tungsten wedding ring. But I like it and it ironically has saved me from crush injury twice. Tungsten is hard but quite brittle, and will shatter you crush it. Well so far it's saved my finger between a heavy table edge and a metal wall corner as well as stopping a slammed car door. 

I have no idea what PSI would be it's breaking point. I suppose a diamond would shatter if you crushed it hard enough. You'd probably need tungsten to crush it with. When I was 8, my mother made me wear all this fancy jewelry for my sisters confirmation. I told her that the ring was too tight but she didn't let me take it off. Four hours later, my finger was 3 times the normal size and was numb. The fire department had to come and cut the ring off with this tool. And apparently, it's procedure to block the street off, too. Most embarrassing moment of my 8 year old life.  I've always wondered how many people avoid calling in emergency services because of the entire parade of shit that always shows up, and what the consequences are. Here's how to do it without ruining the ring.  Saw this a year ago, and I'm a little surprised it's not more well known by now.  Never had to try it, but it sure looks like it would work.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxoAbK5Pc6w You and 1000 other people posted this.  My mother used to be an ER nurse. Once a kid came in with a titanium skateboard bearing stuck on his finger. The idiot tried to put it on to wear as a ring, it didn't fit so his even bigger idiot friend "helped" him by forcing it on his finger. Kid then went to school and football practice. By the time he made it to the ER that thing wasn't going anywhere. The ER docs ended up having to call in the neurosurgeon to operate a diamond tipped bone saw because their ring cutter couldn't even put a dent in the damn thing.  Hard to believe, but the following is a true account as an ER resident physician.  My intern year I went to see a patient about a made up complaint only to find that the real reason he came in was that he put his wedding band around his penis.  As one nurse put it, he was a "grower, not a show-er" because he was able to slip in on, but definitely could not be slipped off.  We attempted to cut it with our ring cutter, but the ring was titanium.  So essentially we just scored the outside of it.  After about 10 minutes of this, I eventually called maintenance to get some large snips and muscled it to crack it.  It actually worked, however, it wasn't like we could then pull it apart, so we had to repeat the process on the other side.  Whole thing took about 50 minutes to fix.  My attending walks in half way through and asks with a smirk, "you guys done dicking around in here?"  At least the patient thought it was funny.   I used this same tool to cut a dental bridge out of the mouth of an emergently intubated patient- their gums had almost completely grown over the metal portion.  I personally think this method is the best that I have seen to remove rings: http://youtu.be/DxoAbK5Pc6w  When the conditions are ideal.  Agreed, unfortunately, I would guess the majority of incidents that the ring would need to be removed are much more extreme.  We have one in our ED that has what amounts to a battery operated drill attachment that turns the cutting wheel for you. Makes things way easier.  The whole wedding ritual thing in alien to me How long do you have to keep turning that key? I thought it works with a motor, but after that I saw that you have to do it manually

Very interesting indeed! It depends on the metal that the ring is made out of. A simple gold ring will usually only take 20-30 seconds of work. Harder metals can take longer but usually not more than a minute or so. I had a patient with a steel ring on once that the ring cutter didn't make a dent in. Eventually got it off with some bolt cutters. Her finger was fine. Thanks for the reply! I'd feel terrified with bolt cutters working away at my finger like that haha.  I've had to have a ring cut off with this thing. I was in 6th grade is was the scariest thing ever, specifically because the guy said we had to save the ring so he told me this was going to take off my finger. Can a ring be repaired after being cut off with this method? It might be pricy but if it were a wedding band or engagement ring I feel like it might be worth it. Yes. Its metal - they just melt it back together. Depending on the metal, its not even that expensive. When I had a gold ring cut off, it was like $25 to get it fixed.  Oh, cool, I suppose that makes sense I just wasn't sure if the material lost in the cut represented an appreciable problem. I imagine the ring is a hair thinner after repair, assuming it was repaired to it's original ring size. Maybe a hair thinner, but definitely nothing noticeable. Also, since they had to make it a half size bigger - they probably added a drop of gold to keep the thickness and integrity of the original band in tact.  Yes, any decent jeweler can make it "as new" unless the cut went directly through some interesting features. So, that episode of _Rescue Me_, where the one guy got a cock-ring stuck to himself and the other fireman using some type of saw was bullshit. They could have used something like this easily.

After the invention of a new harder, stronger metal, nations began deep core mining, unknowingly slowing the earths rotation as a result. Scientists tried to warn the world, but the world was making to much money to stop, so instead the earth itself did. With no rotation, half the earth froze an eternal wasteland while the other half became a vast deserted region. Only one area of the earth can still provide resources for sustainability: the dividing line between worlds, known as *The Belt*. After years of war from the nations of fire and of ice, to extract from the belt the same way the old world did to the core, OP decides to fight back. Led by a singular goal of spinning the earth, OP unites the belt like Genghis did the Mongols and fights back. After finally acquiring one of the world drills, something happens with a shoe-horned love plot. The end.  holy shit would watch The Grand Line Let me help you:

There was a great Huffpost article title, something along the lines of 'Midwest hit with record snowfall, basically shrugs it off" I wish we had gotten all the cool weather channel panic New York got... actually no I don't. Nah. We get all the violence panic. I'm in MN and we got maybe about an inch of snow, probably not even that much. I'm a bit dissapointed. I could easily live in the mountains of snow that were shoveled to the side of the roads. Igloo style living. Some intense Bear Grylls shit. I live in Boston.  I'm currently living in a sidewalk igloo I was forced to build bc my normally 1/2 hour walk to work is now like climbing the Empire State Building stairs 100 times if all the stairs were made of ice/lumpy ass snow. I feel you. 

Edit: I was getting ready to make a snarky comment about "obviously I'm not living in an igloo, you crazy bastards, it's boston not  rural bloody Iceland! My commute is crazy long &amp; hard in the snow but I was clearly joking!" But then I said as much to my bf (I'm a lady) &amp; he showed me the actual snow cave someone built literally right in my commute through Harvard Square.  He wanted me to lie to you all by showing you that picture but I think too highly of you all to participate in that kind of chicanery. In conclusion: terribly sorry,  not really leaving in an igloo.  Yet. 

Edit 2: particular apologies to /u/lachryma, who was pretty stoked about my lie. And is polite, which is so refreshing!  Icelander here, we don't have igloos here.

I really want this to be true, because it's among the most incredible stories I've heard. There's a cocktail of emotions I'm feeling in reaction to that, from outright impressed to sympathy.

An outdoor music festival in the winter, I mean? It's actually a lot of fun. Dress up in stupid, neon, winter gear and ski goggles, freeze your ass off but get drunk as fuck and rave.  After shoveling in Chiberia, the dedicated piles left from snow plows are typically around 5-6ish feet in my area.  AMA...    
"What's the snow like?!?!?"   
"... Cold." Bostonian here. Morning commute took 4 times longer today because of all that snow. Gosh I am from Chicago, but live in Minnesota now and I am starting to feel real left out with our measly one inch of snow.... I just left Peoria and I miss the awful weather. Just moved to Peoria from Texas. How do you people live here?
 That's so average.  Sounds wicked cold. I'm honestly having a difficult time not hugging strangers I see shoveling their walks. "Thank you, sir, for not putting my life at risk by forcing me out into the 4 foot wide road!" Also bc shoveling fucking blows &amp; a body needs encouragement through that sort of mental &amp; physical ordeal.  [deleted] Chicagoan* Typical suburbanite. Typical suburbanite - typical transplant.  i lived on Boylston st and had to walk to mass ave for school.  they never cleared any snow.  i couldn't believe how high and far i had to climb with the wind blowing in my face.  there was a booth in the prudential building that sold headsocks.  when i first moved there i made fun of them but quickly bought one after the first snow storm.  I've been in LA without snow for like 13 years now.  What I would give to be climbing my way to a Dunkin Donuts in Boston.  Gotta get your Dunks iced coffee to do all this clambering!  You like apples? Not as much as topical references from 1997!  Yeah? Well I got that reference. How do ya like *them* apples?

I'm sorry. Truly. But I had to. "Well I gawt her numbah" He's more partial to urine. Is snow not just the urine of clouds? Rain is the urine, sleet is the diarrhea. Not sure what that makes the snow.  Jizz. "Snow is the seminal fluid of the clouds"  Yes  Constipation Chicago Bears Grylls? da bear Until a tractor comes to blast it into a dumptruck and now you're ground beef. Fuck Grylls and his urine. [Snowshoes and solitude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJzT-ZpaB4k) is where it's at. Woah, that's Les Stroud from Survivorman, I never realized he used to be a long haired hippie man.  He was living [off the grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI_nZRPKj0o&amp;list=PL50460423CED8FF3E) for a while too. Fun fact! Hollowing out a mound of snow for shelter is actually a [quinzhee!] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinzhee) As a guy from Chicago this storm sucked. Not because of the snow. Because of the people who don't know what to do when all the snow comes down.  You'd swear these people have never seen snow before. I drive 94/294 everyday for work and Monday sucked. I think [this](http://imgur.com/ocCirLY) was the mindset of everyone.  Throw furniture in the street and pretend that public property is now magically a private spot? Spend 2 hours digging your car out only to have that spot taken when you ran to the store to get some essentials.  See if you reevaluate how parking works.

PS:  If you value your vehicle do not take a 'reserved' parking spot on the south side.  Your shit will get fucked. [Solution?](http://i.imgur.com/CN5njdG.jpg) God, no shit. You know what's more annoying than dibs? Getting the spot you cleared stolen. I thought claiming parking was ridiculous until I moved here. Dibs is legit. It's stupid but it also makes sense.

I love seeing all the different objects people use for dibs.  Wait seriously?  All bets are off in a large city.  All is fair in love, war...and parking.  

Dibs is something for towns &lt; 100k people.  

This ain't no joke, there literally are more cars than parking spots available on any given block.  It's dog eat dog, man up.  Or walk to the store.   Yeah. People put stuff in open parking spots like lawn chairs. If you move that chair and park there, you bet your car will get roughed up by the dibs-caller. Jesus, where the fuck is it?  Must be a Chicago only thing.   Yeah, Chicago is where I've seen this happen. I don't know about it elsewhere though. I've seen it done all around northern NJ as well in the cities. Paterson turns into milk crate city after a storm.  I live in an area in Maryland where we have plenty of parking for our neighborhood. A few years ago there was a war going on with people fighting over parking spots after that huge snow storm where we got a couple feet. My neighbor parked in someone's spot one day. Guess who had to buy a set of 4 tires the next day. I'm spending my first winter in Chicago proper and you better believe once I finally freeded my car from the grips of several inches of snow that I used some folding chairs in my trunk to call dibs while I went to Chiptole  Huge in Boston and it's a highly contested thing every year. Usually the mayor has to come out in support of it to give it some legitimacy. I understand the plight but all it does is encourage people to shovel out their spot half assed, throw whatever garbage they have in the spot (and it's seriously anything from folding chairs to TVs, fans or stolen construction pylons) and call it a day. 

Last year I saw a car that had clearly stolen a saved spot with all the windows busted out, wing mirrors nowhere to be seen and two deflated tires. I think that stems more from the tension between Southie toonies and the yuppies who are gentrifying South Boston. Welp digging a 4k vehicle out of 3+ feet of snow ain't no joke either. I know that here in Allston, in this neighborhood, if you dig yourself out of this mess... that spots yours for at least a couple hours. You earned it.

BTW, Boston is made up of small towns or small neighborhoods (there's over 20). It is not like Chicago nor New York, it's honestly not a large "city", each neighborhood handles this situation pretty much the same way with an understood/unspoken rule.
I mean, I don't have a solution....I almost never do...I'm just glad there's a dialogue about it! :)

Edit: Grammar for the Nazis Shovel a spot out for an hour, and let me park there then, neighboreeno. &gt; All is fair in love, war...and parking.

that includes your car getting keyed and your tires being slashed I need to get out to the city one of these days after a bug snow and go dibs sightseeing. 

And by dibs sightseeing in the city after a big snow, I mean I'll sit on the Eisenhower for five hours trying to get anywhere near the city from Naperville.  I never really understood the vitriol against putting chairs in your spot. There is literally nowhere to park unless I shovel a spot out, and yes I consider myself a nice person but no, I am not going to shovel out a spot for an hour and be okay with someone stealing it when I turn around for two minutes.

Nobody is allowed to do it in the summer though, because that's just lazy. It's because people think they're entitled to the spot forever.  On my street in Boston there are literally spots that people have been holding since Monday the 26th.  It's infuriating. Well, that shit sucks. In my neighborhood it's usually a day or two after a bad storm, with the exception of a few assholes. 

I think it's a good short-term solution and a really awful long-term solution. Ok, you and everyone else in town who owns a car in town. EVERYONE shovels their car out, you aren't some special person.  But they didn't shovel out the spot you had. If they enjoy shoveling out spots, why don't they get out of their car and shovel out a new one? Jesus fucking Christ, god forbid you and your neighbors work together to clear the block out. My neighbors and I did it this year, we don't have problems with parking. 

All dibs does is cause massive parking problems and it's bullshit because it's not like you are going to be using that spot while you're gone anyway.  I don't understand how people don't regard dibs as a valid system. Why should someone else get to use the spot that I spent 2 hours digging out? Say I dig my grandma's car out and then put a law chair there so that she can park right in front of her house. Would you steal that spot? Think about that. Convince me why dibs is bad. People work hard to dig their spot out. Why should someone else get that spot? Those people still exist in Chicago? Tell them to GTFO and move to Florida.

I live north of Boston. Last week when I'm shoveling out, the guy next door comes out and asks me to borrow my shovel because he doesn't own one. _Doesn't own a shovel. In New England._ And he expected me to stand around and wait while he used it too. He got 10 minutes of halfhearted shoveling, stopping every 10 seconds to talk for 60, before I said "uh huh, uh huh, can I grab that for a second?" and shoveled without looking up until he went away. Yes i live in chicago and people constantly whine about shoveling snow.  Just look at this thread.  I park on the street and it takes 10 minutes to free my car.  If i cant find a spot, i grab my shovel and make one.  People are lazy as fuck, thats what it comes down to. Guy from Milwaukee here; can confirm. There was this one private plow that plowed out a small parking lot. He just left the snow in the middle of the street. 5 cars got stuck because they thought they could get through. One even got towed because the person driving it decided that putting that bitch in park and leaving it there was a good idea. Wait you mean there are people who are affected by weather outside of the Northeast? STOP THE FUCKING PRESSES! Someone should notify CNN, I don't think they do. I thought Chicago did pretty well with this one. CTA was running (with some delays), Metra was running, the highways were passable, even if they were slow. Considering the city got 19.6 inches, and it was still business as usual (with some delays) that's not too bad. When all the snow comes down the best thing to do is take a warm shower with a beer. Shower beers are the best It's bad enough that everyone here seems to forgets how to drive in the snow every winter. It's even worse on the roads when the weather gets like this. It isn't all that hard. Drive slower, allow further distance away from the car(s) ahead, (if you *must* pass [2-lane]) turn your blinker on longer before than usual and switch lanes much more gradually and slowly, take it slow on turns, don't text/talk on phone, pay attention and **be aware**. Basically, use common sense. I live around Chicago and pretty much every one I know says this. I'm a really cautious driver in the snow because I drive an elantra and it likes to perform poorly in conditions other than sunshine and awesomeness.  So what I'm getting at is, everyone in chicagoland says this, and I've never known if they are talking about the cautious drivers or the jack off who blows past you in a '08 Mustang. 
I realize this question makes me sound like an idiot... No, it sucks because of the snow. 

Normally takes me about 10 minutes to walk to the train, now it takes me 25. Because of the fucking snow. And what is worse is Obama doesn't even have a plan.  Its like he doesn't intend on doing anything about this very important issue.  Thanks Obama. You're welcome! [I think what you are supposed to do is *whatever* your girlfriend wants even if it's ridiculous out and theres no freekin reason why it couldn't wait until morning right?...](http://i.imgur.com/CqxDMOD.jpg)

Edit: *also shovel, and don't drive like a fish, and clear your hydrants, and don't break the dibs rule or get your ankles slashed.* I've never been in a plane and didn't realize it legitimately looks like this from up so high.  I thought all the rectangles and stuff shown in cartoons were just simplified ways of drawing or exaggerations.  Holy shit.  How have I not seen a picture from this height in the last 22 years?? It's just how land was sold to farmers in this part of th US, 200+ years ago. Go to Europe, or Texas, or almost anywhere else and it isn't so square.

Edit: 153 years ago.

Edit2: yes, yes, other tiny parts of the world are also square-like. The vast Midwest acknowledges your puny efforts. Congrats. That makes me feel slightly better about having missed this for so long. Look up tulip fields in Europe, its still square. The thing about Texas and some of the aired States, you'll see circles due to how the irrigation systems work. Most land is split into squares. Plus farmers split land equally to rotate crops.  Wow those tulip fields don't even look real.  @_@  I have got to travel some day soon.  I've been stuck in the same state (occasionally visiting family the next state over) for my entire life and I'm more recently realizing just how much I've missed.

For example, I've yet to see the ocean in person.  I feel like photos/videos don't quite cut it. The fact that you've never seen the ocean makes my heart hurt. You'll love it.  Dude go to the beach Thanks, Generic surfer. I just think that's awful for anyone. I love ocean Fair enough.  I'm a lake kinda guy.  You must be from cold Visit the Great Lakes! They're like the ocean, but without the salt and deadly animals! [Looks like an ocean to me!](http://www.michiganslakes.com/Lake%20Superior.jpg) It just has the E. coli as a replacement! Seriously though, Lake Michigan is pretty sweet but Lake Erie is so fucking nasty. The ocean easily beats out Lake Michigan though. Michigan's alright most of the time these days.  It's only after an exceptionally heavy rain that the Chicago River still ends up as a giant cess pool.  The lake itself has stayed relatively clean since they reversed the river flow, and even more so in the pas decade or so since the most major reclamation efforts have been set in place.  The really interesting thing about sewage dumping in large bodies of water though is that it's not the end of the world.  As long as the dump site is deep enough and far enough from shore to prevent human contact, the ocean/lake ecosystems can take care of it.  It is after all, just organic material, and fish do poop. Was once on a plane flying into Cleveland. Woman with a young son was sitting behind me. The plane circles over Lake Erie as it begins its descent, and the boy exclaims, "Look, Mommy, the ocean!"

I expected the mother to chuckle and set her kid straight. No. Instead she says, "Huh, I didn't know Cleveland was on the ocean!" Traveling has been some of the best experiences in my life, even though I haven't even left the US. My mind was so blown when I took a road trip from the southeast to see the west for the first time, everything was brown instead of green! Wow this is crazy to me! Are you smack dab in the prairie states or something? You've never had the time to drive to a coast? Dang. Head to the coast now! Winter storms on the ocean are great (also cold). I live on an island, and have almost my whole life. I can't even imagine not ever seeing the ocean. 

It doesn't even feel right to be away from it for very long. When I get home from traveling, the air here feels fresher, cleaner, and healthier somehow. Uhh Texas is also like this... We are extremely "land is power" driven and our lot borders show it. Especially with all our crop fields.  I've flown over eastern Texas many, many times. Lots of farm borders but they aren't this endless squareness you get from Iowa to Ohio. Meh, the farmlans in Belgium also has corners Idk man, the Texas pan handle is pretty well sectioned off to the various farmers and ranchers.  It's anywhere that's flat.  Without major terrain features to plan around, land acquisition was really simple: cut off a square mile and give it to the first farmer who would agree to live on it.  All the plains states have that look.  Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas, Minnesota, parts of Missouri, even eastern Colorado. It's all about the homestead acts. What about google maps? Never seen them on there? This is why: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_%28United_States_land_surveying%29 round trip across the USA is 300. you get 10 hours of airtime. totally worth the money if u don't mind getting harassed by airport security for a couple hours It's getting Hoth in here So put on all your clothes   Or use a Tauntaun's guts.  And I thought they smelled bad....(long breathless pause)...on the outside. SO HOTH! I was up there in the nothingness [driving a semi] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xtetek3oubw) when that storm hit. It was soothing to watch your video It's terrifying to drive in so I figured the chill music would create an appealing aura of juxtapose.  I'm not sure why, but watching this video was incredibly calming.  Wow the roads were pretty clear and the visibility was great! This was the leading edge of that storm.  When I got off the highway toward the end of that video the road was already down to one lane.  The next morning [this happened](http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2015/01/i-94s_horrific_crash_closure_a.html) about 20 miles away. Holy shit [While it was happening.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhNxvMNQSs0) Holy shit is right. What camera is your dash cam? I'm really interested in getting one.
 It's a GoPro but the older one.  It's great if you want to gather random stuff or lots of footage like that video but there are dashcams that are cheaper and are more functional as nothing but a dashcam that will record in 5-10 minute bursts and continually override the memory so you don't have to keep up on clearing space and only keep the stuff you need.  Those aren't going to get the crispy quality of a GoPro but they'll do the job.  I like to do other stuff with mine but it's general purpose is protecting my ass. As a girl from Texas who's only ever lived in East Texas, Seattle, and Arkansas, I've driven in snow all of 4 times in my life. And the parts of that video where you lose boundaries of that road gave me severe anxiety, despite the lovely background music.  That usually isn't a problem, roads are pretty easy to see even if you can't see the lines exactly. The problem with driving in a blizzard is [whiteouts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiteout_%28weather%29). It's happened to me a few times and it's really hard to explain just how frightening it is to lose your sense of horizon. Cool video. I was entirely vibing with it, remembering times I've driven through snow on highways like that. Then I almost shit my pants when you missed the exit for the Skyway and got on 94 to Detroit, and only then I realized that I've driven that route down on 31 along the Lake a ton of times, but I'm going to Chicago. So I rewound and watched again, and yeah, that's why it looked familiar. Way to make me feel at home and then freak me out and then make me feel at home again, guy. I didn't actually miss an exit.  I was hanging out in the left lane because there are two interchanges when you come into Kalamazoo that are cloverleafs and have a shared entrance/exit lane. So traffic tends to bottleneck in the right lane and the snow just makes it worse. I don't usually do that unless it's snowing.  I know, I know, I meant you "missed" my exit -- where I would have gotten off. And that's when I first recognized where you were. At first I didn't recognize anything, was just watching the drive, and then suddenly -- woop! he should have gone that way -- and then I realized, "oh, I've known this whole time where we are." Holy crap!  I'd be scared to drive in that crap.  Especially in a semi! I have some friends who live in the Northeast and haven't been to the midwest, and they don't understand me when I try and explain to them how flat the midwest is. I should really show them this video. "Why don't we just take the city and move it over there!?" http://imgur.com/ulgyeba is this taken from the south? what's that lake As a native Chicagoan, I'm curious as to what body of water that is? I've been trim got work it out and I'm struggling with the frozen bit. Do you happen to know what lake that is?  I still want to live here. My favourite city I've visited.

Where do you think your plane was? Thats an awesome pic op. thanks for sharing. I'm confused about the "snowstorm" part.  Didn't you fly over the aftermath of the storm?  Or am I missing something.  Cool photo, either way This is pushing it for mildly interesting.   Pretty awesome picture It's "cool" how we can observe the heat retaining property of water as it can be seen that there's less snow near the water bodies when I was little I thought that when you flew and saw the different colored fields that they were different states like you see on a map. My dad thought I was crazy when I woke him up and tried to point out different states  nominated for /r/earthporn I feel like this breaks the rules of mildly interesting since that is pretty amazing  I was on the fence, honestly, of where to post it.... It was between WoDude and

You mean the flurry? Winter is coming. WHY DIDN'T YOU DO ANYTHING!?  Drove from Chicago  to Minneapolis  in that  storm. White knuckle the whole way pretty cool shot. you should xpost this to /r/Chicago!  THE SKY AM FROZEN. What do? What. Do. Just missed it. Graduated navy boot camp a week and a half ago Something that is really cool a out the area near Chicago is that you can see the wind direction from the pattern the lake effect snow falls. It gives this effect but on a much more localized scale coldlyinteresting The possibility of these views is astounding. Imagine telling someone even 200 years ago that anyone could one day see this sight. That's some Day After Tomorrow shit right there. It looks so cool ! My first thought was it looks like it's something out of a sci-fi movie that's taking over the whole city Beyond the wall I would have built a couple more scouts early or moved my workers to explore that lands. Exploration is important to a victory at high difficulty.  the big ass cracks are beautiful. they almost look like rivers. They are smaller creeks and streams.

A lot of farmland is riddled with them as they provided the drainage from the fields You flew over it.  I live in it and it sucks. Starkblast Delivered pizza in that on Super Bowl Sunday!

Rip axels I live in IL and can confirm that this picture is accurate. Snow. Everywhere. Had no power. So much shoveling.  That's really cool. Looks like minecraft. This thread has been linked to from elsewhere on reddit.

 Mildly interesting fact: The bird was named after the Catholic cardinals, not vice-versa.  And the Cardinals were named after the sports team, right? King Louis the XVI was named after the city of Louisville. He was born there  His grandfather owned the Suns, didn't he? Those aren't in Louisville, those are in Jacksonville! no, they're in Phoenix! It's actually Portland. The Portland Jailblazers Portland JB, Represent!  Pretty sure the suns are in space. You guys have no idea what you're talking about. Honestly though, its JFK that weirds me out.  What kind of parents name their kid after an airport!? That IS mildly interesting! *mildly* Catholicism has been around since before Europeans came to the Americas. So that makes sense.  Can levitate just fine. Pick a Pope, easy peasy.

ELI5: How did you do this? Looking closely, you can barely see the blurred outline of where the bird was. How did you 'know' what was behind the bird in the original photo, and how did you create it to fill in that area after you moved the bird? 

It looks great, I've just always wondered how people fill in areas after something is removed.  Content aware fill is usually pretty good for this. [CS6 also has content aware move](http://youtu.be/Uu5HPCkcSDY), which is pretty cool. TIL Everyone is a graphic designer with CS6. Actually since the backdrop in this photo is already so blurry its not to hard to fake it and reconstruct what it sort of looked like.

Photoshop has some really neat features that make it so much quicker and easier to do things like this. Specifically the [content aware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay8HfiabGfg) fill option. It's not perfect but it makes doing these edits so much faster and often times cleaner than previous methods.

[How bout this?](http://i.imgur.com/m0zeB8X.jpg) He's not floating. [better?](http://i.imgur.com/rRi7gI9.gif) DSM? I think I am a bird, from Iowa. I think I am a Iowa, from Bird [Like this?](http://i.imgur.com/BKyNvmk.jpg) Being aware of the Arizona team, I expected a football player. Also expected a priest  I expected a bishop, no priest.  Expected a rook, very disappointed  Expected bass, no treble aaaand it's stuck in my head.  [You gotta play the hand you're dealt.](http://i.imgur.com/00rjLxC.jpg) [bishop it is...](http://i.imgur.com/74Qoz2N.jpg) [ok.](http://i.imgur.com/GmX9r6e.jpg) What about with rice? To eat the seed, one must become the seed.  /r/InvisibleBicycles  http://i.imgur.com/RM6aEUE.jpg /r/perfecttiming Where do you live? I've alwats wanted to see a cardinal. They're so beautiful. Virginia.  You can see them quite often here. Cardinals can be found across a [large swath of the US, Canada, and Mexico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_cardinal#mediaviewer/File:Northern_Cardinal-rangemap.gif).  They're fairly common, even in residential areas, and a frequent visitor to bird feeders year round.  Plus the bright red color makes them easy to spot.  Making this a reasonably obtainable goal!  I never had an opinion of them really.  They were just beautiful birds that I saw quite frequently (I live in North Carolina). Then, about 5 years ago, a mom and dad took over one of my tall bushes.  They (or their offspring) come back every year to the same bush.  They are fun to watch.  The mom and dad take turns feeding and guarding the babies.  The dog (and me) gets a good scolding if she hangs around the bush too long. *Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void. Empty, and become wind.* Just an Angry Bird doing its thing. GHAAAAAAAAAAA*HEEEBLLL* What kind of camera were you using? Nice photo!  A Nikon D7000, and thanks! Pretty sure you just captured a glitch in the matrix. Majestic as fuck. How did we end up here? This place is horrible, smells like balls. I keep getting that same glitch with the ravens in Dragon Age 3. Hover bird is hovering. hover bird, hover bird

does whatever hover bird does Your capitalization of "Cardinal" made me expect something more like [this](http://imgur.com/H2K8F5j) "My pope'll need me!" That bird looks zen as fuck. Aren't we all floating for just a moment when we jump? I read this as 'the Cardinal' and was waiting to see a floating guy in a priest outfit. I came here to see a levitating clergyman, but have an up vote anyway. Falling... With style! "I  must go..."  I first thought it was going to be a church cardinal. Was a bit disappointed. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omLve_vezbA "Look ma, no wings!" I wanted a picture of a vatican cardinal levitating :((( I think cardinals are some of the neatest birds I've ever seen. Wish they live where I live. Majestic  Wicked cool photo! We don't have cardinals where I'm from so I always find photos of them interesting. This one, however, is amazing!! The bird feeder has a face. Why is this not addressed? Usually you photoshop the bird on the feeder.  photoshopped You will believe a bird can fly. The long awaited Hoverbird.   "Guys, check this out. I do a great impression of a humming bird!" I....invisible birdcycle. Awesome... I'd like to believe that he was originally riding a penny farthing bicycle that got photoshopped out. The main reason I clicked this link is because I had no idea what a "Cadrinal" was. I call haxx. That cardinal's cheating. Ban it from /r/outside. That mother is WILLING himself to the bird feeder.  Dammit. I was expecting to see a catholic cardinal.  I was expecting this kind of Cardinal: http://www.catholicsentinel.org/SiteImages/Article/20705a.jpg Reminds me of Birdman. That's usually a sign that your game is about to crash. Time to reboot. Just a graphical bug, try /reloadui. Its glitching This typically leads to a bug report. Seems more like deliberate levitation to me.  I would like to see one of those some day. They're so red! And they have an awesome hairdo.  I see these from time to time when playing /r/outside. Sometimes you just need to reload. I thought you couldn't reload without the reincarnation perk? I was expecting to see a Cardinal priest jumping... but this is good too I made Magneto-like hovering noises out loud when I saw this picture. Came to the comments expecting a "look you said this was a cardinal, is it in the same family..." type criclejerk. Was pleasantly surprised. Maybe we will let unidan rest in peace finally. Perfect for /r/birdswitharms I mean, I know birds can fly, but this is getting a little ridiculous. /r/photoshopbattles ? Reminds me of this animation:

https://vimeo.com/36824575 Why was I expecting this photo to be a member of the church floating mid air, with a huge grin. The preview picture is small and I don't have my glasses on. Rad mohawk bro.  Whoa... I didn't know they could fly! Can someone photoshop a ram about to lay that cardinal out? I miss football. He is high HOW has nobody done this yet?

They're such beautiful birds.  It's a bird! It's... a bird. It's a bird! Did not forget to bird. did you find it cute? This reminds me of a story from my childhood. My family was stopped at a McDonalds during a family vacation on a particularly windy day. All of the sudden my older brother points at the sky and says:

"WOAH! THAT BIRD IS FLYING IN MID AIR!"

What he was really seeing and trying to describe was a bird flying against the wind but not really getting anywhere. So in a way it just looked like the bird was floating to him. We all laughed at him and I still bring it up about 14 years later when I feel like being an ass. I must go, my people need me. The birdfeeder looks like a stoned cyclops smoking a joint.

Hey /u/the_pride_of_VPI,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts. r/invisiblebikes It totally does Teach me the Cardinal Float, Sensei! Right timing grt... I can make birds levitate but nobody cares I was expecting to see one of the guys from the catholic church looking like a jedi. Debug mode activated. /r/invisiblebicycles He seems to have forgotten how to bird. Cardinals are so good. They sound like lasers. great shot! TIL:  Birds can fly. That's a jackdaw. was looking forward to seeing a cardinal from the Vatican float - somewhat disappointed. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_%28Catholicism%29 #####&amp;#009;

&gt;A __cardinal__ (Latin: *sanctae romanae ecclesiae cardinalis*, literally *cardinal of the Holy Roman Church*) is a senior [ecclesiastical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiology) leader, an ecclesiastical [prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_the_Church), and usually an ordained [bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_(Catholic_Church\)) of the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church). The cardinals of the Church are collectively known as the [College of Cardinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Cardinals). The duties of the cardinals include attending the meetings of the College and making themselves available individually or in groups to the [Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope) as requested. Most have additional duties, such as leading a [diocese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese) or [archdiocese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdiocese) or managing a [department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicastery) of the [Roman Curia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Curia). A cardinal's other main function is [electing the pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_election) when the [see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See) becomes vacant. During the *[sede vacante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sede_vacante)* (the period between a pope's death or resignation and the election of his successor), the day-to-day governance of the Holy See is in the hands of the College of Cardinals. The right to enter the [conclave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_conclave) of cardinals where the pope is elected is limited to those who have not reached the age of 80 years by the day the vacancy occurs.

 This is a beautiful photo-Just had to mention that.Fantastic timing too :-) Sometimes what cameras can do in today's world is astounding. Cool find! Great pic! TIL that birds can floating. Cardinal just gave us proof Church has special powers. Your turn Atheists! The fuck?  I see the enemy Sparrow on the other side of the feeder.  Sparrows are non-migratory aggressive birds that displace native species.  I own   a pet Sparrow and he is the best pet I have ever had.  Really more like a cat, the way he loves to pounce on things and chase me around the house. Or he's either on that one branch that's blurred out possibly :o???  Damn glitches.

 "Bring back the gold standard!"

-Smaug If Smaug's bounty were to be released into Middle Earth's economy, wouldn't it completely devalue gold? That's a buttload of gold. It would, similar things happened back in the day when Mansa Musa made his hajj.  He passed out so much gold along the way that gold was significantly devalued for a time. I shall tag you as "Be droppin' History Bombs" His name isn't Enola Gay. They do call him "fat boy," though. Same as with the Spanish economy when they started bringing back gold mined in south America. I think it was actually the massive amounts of silver that the Spanish brought back that became the issue after mining an entire mountain of it in Bolivia. "Nah bitch"

-Rosa Parks I suddenly want Smaug to be the president, he seems like he'd be the guy to get shit done. 2016 Vote Smaug IT'S HAPPENING technically *everything* is happening Fetch isn't happening. And its never going to. [It was long ago and it was far away,
And it was so much better than it is today.](http://imgur.com/Pl6HVRl) I would do anything for love... But I won't put my seat belt on. Oh no, no I won't do that!  Oh I'm sorry, I thought this was AMERICA! I live in japan and theres a way around this for $5. It costs you $5 to cut the seatbelt and permanently put the buckle in?  scissors are $5, I can buckle the seatbelt before sitting down, that's practically free. Even if you buy new scissors for this, you'll probably use them afterwards as well. This means the fix itself is practically free even if done with $5 scissors but imagine all the other things you could buy for those 5 bucks!

Plus you'll have a functioning seatbelt to use, in case some pussy wants to borrow your car or whatever But you probably already have those scissors, so you could drive unsafe with music for free anyway! Its free to turn it off. Its in the settings. Its called mykey in fords. It's a feature parents use to limit their kids.  Too late. I already cut my belt. People need to see your comment about the MyKey customization. What's the point of doing that? if you want to die so badly then there are more reliable ways. You've never been stationary in a car? The car most likely only mutes the sound when its put into drive. If That's a newer ford (Not all fords but i know a few do this)... Yes and no. 

If you put it into drive, Then back into park. that message will now display until the seltbelt is buckled or until the car is turned off. I've got some stationary in my car. Would you like for me to write you a letter? the word that means "letter-writing paper" is spelled "stationery."  E is for envelope, A is for 'anging around. how am i supposed to pick up my new stationery if i am to remain stationary!?!? Yes please, I never get any good letters. Here's a q. See? Q sucks. I concur. A very insecure letter. 

Now Z is a fucking letter to live by. C is the most worthless letter. It has no unique sound of its own. It's either imitating S or K most of the time. The only time it's special is when paired with another letter, like CH.  I should be free to eject myself from a moving vehicle during an accident! It's my god given right to be as unsafe as possible damn it! There's nothing stopping you from doing that, you just have to do it without musical accompaniment.
 But it just isn't the same. It's better fly out of a window listening to "Ave Maria" than just being in silence. Really gives it that dramatic touch. Only if you can fly through the windshield in slow motion. That's an important part of it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=qaAbG9oQ_4c#t=15 If I cant smash into my own windshield at 130mph while listening to Slayer, then I don't see the point of living in the first place. You've never sat in a stopped car and wanted to listen to music? I know it's a joke comment I'm replying to, but I think it's worth mentioning anyway.

Seatbelts aren't just about the safety of the person in the seat.  They're for the safety of others in the car *and* those around you.  The first is easy.  If you and/or your passengers aren't belted in, you are all 150 lb. projectiles inside the car in case of an accident.  You all want to do that?  Then fine.  The second point though is that wearing a seatbelt helps you keep control of the vehicle in an emergency situation.  It can help you *avoid* an accident in the first place if you have to make an extreme maneuver.  And that *does* affect others.

I'm all for personal freedom, but driving on public roads means that others around you expect you to take reasonable precautions in the interest of everyone's safety. My car just makes an obnoxious beeping sound if you try to go anywhere without it on. This includes passengers in the front seat. 

Turns out, my cat is heavy enough to set off the sensor when he sits in the passenger seat. It was a long trip to the vet.  You didn't just...buckle the seatbelt? Yeah, that did occur to me later. The ride home was much quieter.  dude Bruh Brah wait, is your cat dead now? Nah, it just had lipo at the vet.  'Murica! It doesn't take that long to teach a cat to buckle up really. Still not a good reason to kill your cat, bro. It sucks when you are driving down the highway and hit a bump shifting your bag in the seat enough to trip the sensor.  Now I'm driving down 95 with the damned chime going on and no good place to pull over to fix it.

Edit:   opps, I didnt mean "now" literally but in the figurative sense.  It was just something that happened to me before that I was recounting. All you have to do is buckle the seat belt or move your bag...no need to pull over  While driving down a high way? It can be a bit distracting. Maybe he only has one arm. The _ stands for *a*.  My car gives exactly *three* fucks regarding the seatbelt.

It chimes 3 times, then gives up and turns the warning light off.

I still wear it though. Your vehicle does not meet the minimal government standards for giving fucks about seat belt usage. Your vehicle has been seized and assigned to an internment camp where it will be re-educated.  You will receive your vehicle once a federal assessor is satisfied with the number of the fucks your vehicle gives about seat belt usage.  

Until that time, you have been assigned a state issued bicycle for your personal use.  You will be required to purchase and register a helmet for the duration of the issuance of the state issued bicycle.  Failure to do so will result in fines.

 Here are the instructions on how to disable your seat belt chime. (toyota sienna )

1. Buckle Seatbelt
2. While depressing the brake, turn the key to the ON position.
3. Press the trip reset button a few times, stop when the ODO is displayed (not trip distance - A or B). 
If the odometer starts at the mileage, cycle through anyway.
4. Turn the ignition to LOCK
5. Unbuckle the driver's seatbelt
6. Turn the key to the ON position again.
When the dash lights comes on, press and hold the trip reset button, and count to 20 (slowly).
7. While still holding the trip reset button, buckle the driver's side seatbelt.
8. The odometer display should read "b ON" or "b OFF". Depress the trip reset button to toggle.
9. Unbuckle and Turn OFF the car. Well you're definitely not going to do it by accident with a system like that. Engaging launch control in a supercar is faster and easier than this. there's a button that's just there... Cars have all sorts of buttons.

My car has a button that turns everything metric. It's not one that just has km/h under mph. It actually makes the needle read whatever the conversion is.

It also happens that this button is right next to the trip-reset button.

Cue me, going down highway. I glance down at the speedometer. 

HOLY SHIT, I'M DOING 100, HOW DID I NOT NOTICE?!

\*hit breaks to get down to 60 before I get popped*

\*guy behind me swerves, flips me off* (I deserved this)

\*glance at other gauge* 

Tire Pressure: 245 kPa

And then I felt like an idiot for the rest of the drive... I love switching to metric for when my daughter looks over. She's been a scold about speeding since she was able to read speed limit signs. This puts her in her place.  The new Chrysler and Dodge vehicles coming out now have an option in the radio settings to remind you when you are going over the speed limit.  Adjustable from 0 to +50 over, with a friendly disembodied voice that tells you what the speed limit is when you breach the threshold. "We know you want to speed, but not speed TOO much, so we added this feature"

Good guy Chrysler.  Which doesn't change the fact that it's easier. no i was actually confirming it &gt; disable your seat belt chime.

Holy shit. You can do this in Fords as well (with a different procedure).

Park car, close all doors and windows, put on parking brake, and have all seat belt unbuckled.

Turn key but do not start. Wait for seatbelt light to go off. Buckle and unbuckle driver seatbelt 9 times. Seatbelt light should go on and then off again.

Chime is disabled. In my Ford truck, all I had to do was unplug a wire under the driver seat. 

Now I can drive around the farm getting in and out of the truck a million times without fussing with the seat belt. And my belt is still intact so I can wear it out on the road! [deleted] What are these weird combo things called?  I'd like to Google around and see what options there are to toggle on my car, but I don't know what to look for. Cheat codes. It would be easier just to buy a different car.  I don't believe you Believe! I haven't had to hear the seat belt chime in my Camry for 6 years.  Did you sell it after all those steps failed? And finally sacrifice a goat to satan Or... you know, just buckle your seatbelt, because it takes two seconds and could save your life? ^ah ^geez ^I'm ^*that* ^guy ^now ^^still ^^though Totally agree. I just feel weird without it on. Why risk your life or a ticket? It's very annoying if you regularly have a bag on the pass. seat that is heavy enough to set off the chime. You're right of course. It's moronic to drive without wearing it.  Or...you can jump the wires on the seat belt switch. Or... just buckle the seatbelt across the seat and behind the cat, right? Or just put the cat in carrier and buckle the carrier in - even a big cardboard box is better than nothing. Cats shouldn't even be loose in cars. If you get in an accident, they're toast. Also cats like laps and cats have pointy bits. Neither of which is very good for safe driving Mine once escaped her carrier and then curled up behind the clutch.   AWWWWwwwwwwwww....  - driver's reaction, and the Doppler effect as someone blows their horn as you drift into the opposite lane So that's how toast is made? Not eating toast anymore. Just ate toast. Spent the last half hour coughing up a hair ball. step 1) get a cat

step 2) put butter or margarine on one side of cat

step 3) put cat in car and have an accident

step 4) (optional) spread jam or marmalade This all happens within the confines of the toaster. I'm not sure you should be deactivating this in a mini van... If I drove a minivan, I'd be deactivating just to increase the chances of killing myself.  Would it be the same for the passenger side? My dog sets it off on trips. A carton of milk is enough to set mine off, can't even nick down to the corner store and out it on the passenger seat without it beeping all crazy like. There are so many God damn beeps in my car sometimes it's actually hard to concentrate, especially whilst reversing. Luckily you can convince the milk Jug to sit on the floor with a bit of badgering.  Or some moderate braking. i was a habitual non seatbelt wearer and since my new car annoys the shit out of me I now wear mine and force my passengers to put theirs on as well now. That annoying sounds fucking works! By any chance a mitsubishi? My lancer does the same, you can't put a fucking bag on the seat without getting a headache. Apparently in addition to the annoying "buckle up to unmute audio" message this system also:

* limits the audio system to 44% of maximum output
* reminds you to slow down at certain speeds
* blocks incoming calls and texts

It's aimed at parents who have teenagers who drive. The Ford website says that [*"MyKey equals love, not control."*](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2013/06/11/ford-mykey--now-on-6-million-vehicles--helps-parents-keep-teens-.html) 

 So you can toggle it? Because if we can annoy teenagers trying to fuck themselves without annoying others count me in. The MyKey settings are coded to a particular keyfob so you can have one key for the kids with the settings on and one without them for you to use. You can remove the MyKey settings but you need the 'parent' key to do it, seems like a pretty good system.  Until the parents lose the main key and everyone is forever stuck at 44% volume output I doubt it's something that can't be fixed with a visit to the dealership. :P You need new key?  Just $300, override key, [just $80 more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzHihzsdTAE).  Just $80.

 It's like the dealership can hold you hostage in your own car 'you know you need to buy a new key....you can't just live with this.' You should really buy a new key when you lose one anyway. You should have a spare at all times. Once you have kids of driving age you will rarely want loud music. That is one of the symptoms of getting old. Just pray you don't get to the point of my father in law where you don't listen to the radio at all.   Because teens *suck* at dealing with new technology, and parents diligently hide their keys at all times, right?

This would work exactly *once*. It's so the parents can pull up to the house blaring "I Wanna Rock" on full volume while head banging without their seatbelt on, get in and lecture their teenage kid on behaving properly while teaching them an important lesson about irony. I think so. I have a ford with this but its never told me I couldn't listen to music without seatbelt. Yes, it's the MyKey - whoever posted this picture, if indeed it is OC, is driving (most likely) their parents car, and has had restrictions implemented by their parents. The car recognises who is driving by detecting which key has started the car. Ford used to use this technology to automatically move the driver's seat to the correct position.  That's my preferred use of it. It's linked to a specific key. You basically turn on "MyKey" for the key that is in the ignition, and that key is linked to these limitations unless you turn MyKey off by using a non-MyKey-key.

If you turn MyKey on for all your keys... you're boned.

 It doesn't just remind you to slow down, it won't let the vehicle exceed 70mph.

Source: Me. I rented a MyKey activated car once and have never again. Driving below 80MPH in Atlanta is a good way to get yourself killed. Way to go, Ford. The speed limiter is variable, actually. I forget what the upper limit is, but you can set it as low as 55, or have it disabled entirely. But I can't drive 55. Can confirm. Even in the rain it's 80mph. 

Source: survived ga 400 &gt; it won't let the vehicle exceed 70mph

That sounds like a great way to die on the DC beltway. Wow that's fucked up for a rental &gt; "MyKey equals love, not control."

That's some 1984 bullshit. I imagine that slogan worked a lot better on paper than it does in real life So it's a car with a built-in annoying passenger. I had a rental with this shit enabled, speed limit was 80. Fucking trucks were passing me on NJ turnipke and I couldn't do shit about it. They did this to me on a Mustang. Was infuriating when I wasn't able to pass. Do you mean blocks incoming calls / texts from coming through the Bluetooth sync on the car?  ***TEENAGER DETECTED***

***FARADAY CAGE ENABLED*** So OP is 16? New 'parent' feature, won't drive to Baskin Robbins without you eating all your vegetables. "I don't want any damn vegetables!" That's a Ford. Most likely Fiesta. There's a parental mode that lets you do stuff like this I believe.  Yeah, that's a Fiesta. Pretty sure that's the only vehicle to ever use that display. Current generation Focuses use a full color display, and previous generation Fords used a two line text readout. There goes car romance out the window ... unless of course you're buckled up !!! 

Edit: Talk about safe sex.  Presumably it would only do this in drive. If it was in park the radio would still work?

And all it does is mean people sit on their seat belts. That's what my mom has done since she had a nasty case of shingles on her shoulders and she can't stand to have a belt go over it.  You would think that, but it may not be so.

I had a Subaru (2007, I think) that would chime like mad if you didn't have your seatbelt on. Put the car in park, open the door and get out, close the door again, and it would still chime to let everyone else know that you had, at one point, taken your seat belt off.

I no longer have a Subaru. But... It's so easy to disable the chime in Subarus. My subaru (2013) only sings the seatbelt song if you're going over 10mph or somesuch. [deleted] Lauren should not be driving no more, if she rolled over in a car twice. I am Lauren's age and have yet to roll any vehicles. I feel like I'm not reaching in full potential Well let's figure out what you're doing wrong. You're driving too fast for conditions, right? That's pretty much one of the main factors right there. Oh, and if you have any Swiss-cheese-lookin' dirt roads around you then it's best to drive on those. Remember these two tips and you'll have your numbers up in no time. it also helps if you can get your SuV going sideways. this can be accomplished by various means, which are left as an exercise for the reader. I imagine Lauren to be the type of person to play music out loud on her iPod when this seatbelt warning appears. Rolling the car is not necessarily the fault of the driver, but is is likely. I'm wondering if there was weather involved. Upstate NY you hear about freak accidents like this all the time in the winter. In this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLKUOZ_OYKA) he states she was a passenger in one of the crashes.  So Lauren's friends aren't much better drivers. Shocker. I've been driving for over a decade and haven't rolled any cars yet. Am I doing something wrong? How do you know your limits if you don't push them? Click the seat belt and then sit down on top of it. No more problems!..till you hit that tree. Remove "my key" from the settings with the master key. (From a former ford car salesman) I heard on planet money that carmakers have to adjust their US airbag settings from their European models because Americans are far less likely to wear their seatbelts consistently compared to Europeans.
  
I think it's this one

http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/04/18/304540007/episode-533-why-cars-from-europe-and-the-us-just-can-t-get-along This is 100% true. I work in automotive design, the way regulations differ between the US and EU is such a pain in the arse. There still seems to be a huge problem with americans and seatbelts its crazy, the fact people buy a product like this (http://www.ebay.com/itm/5pcs-Car-Auto-Mounted-Bottle-Opener-Seat-Belt-Socket-Buckle-Insert-Black-/131419435306?fits=Make%3ABMW) blows my mind! That is a pack of 5 so you know people are putting those in all the belt buckles and it works as a bottle opener...some people are beyond help. Wow, holy shit, that product. Let's combine alcohol, and not wearing seatbelts! What could fucking go wrong!?

I'm appalled at the number of people in this thread who seem to think it's totally normal and fine to not wear a seatbelt. Wearing a seatbelt to me is just second nature. You get in a car, you put on a seatbelt. I never understood how someone could not wear one. I will also annoy the shit out of anyone not wearing one by giving them a lecture on human projectiles until they buckle up.  You can turn this feature off, FYI. 

Most new model Fords have this to encourage/force teenagers to drive safely. It's a part of the "MyKey" system that Ford started using where you can program a specific key to put limitations on the car that theoretically encourage safe driving. You can limit the speed limit, only allow audio when seat belts are buckled, and it can keep track of how fast you're driving and for how far. 

When I got my Focus is was automatically enabled and enraged me until I figured out how to disable the MyKey system.  Remember when cars never opened their bitch mouths and you could just drive and fly through the windshield bust your head open to your favorite sound track. Why would you not wear your seatbelt, though? So you don't wrinkle your shirt, that's my dad's excuse.  Because driving without seatbelt on is so fetch! What the fuck is "fetch" [deleted] Put your seat belt on.  What if I want to listen to music and make out with my girlfriend in the car? Fuck you, car! I am *pretty* sure this happens only when you drive. My friend has this in his car, if you're sitting in the driver seat, it'll make you put your seatbelt on to listen to music, even if the car is in park or even if the engine isn't running. It does the same for the Front passenger seat. So basically if you and a friend wanted to chill in the car and listen to music and bullshit while you ate or something, you'd have to put your seatbelt on. He actually has a couple of old seatbelt clips to put into the slot though to trick it into thinking you're buckled up, so it's not that bad, just an annoying feature that could have been improved upon, and maybe has, these aren't really that new. *that* would irritate me.  No way. What if I'm just washing my car? Armor alling the dashboard and stuff? I can't have music on without buckling the seatbelt?

If it worked only when in drive, I think it's s great feature. I hate driving with people who let the warning chime go off constantly. 

20 miles, **Bing bing bing bing**

Also, would be good for my dumbass sister, who refuses to wear her seatbelt no matter what seat she's in. at least if I'm driving I won't move until she's got it on. Her moron friends and boyfriends? Who knows what they do. 

 Just get a car that's not a nag. They don't exist anymore.  And if they do, by all means correct me so I can get one and not have my next car act like my nanny.

But that aside - Protip!  You can buckle a car's front seats **behind** the seats. also bag's on the passenger seats.

My car make a beep if seatbelts are not plugged in. The main road is 1km away from my house, so if I want to stop at the letter box, and the bin's then its going to beep unless I put the seat belt on and off every time I drive.

Putting the passenger seatbelt in the drivers buckle is a good way round it, getting another seatbelt buckle is another. I know I have to drive with a seatbelt and I do, just when I am shuffling car's around for parking etc i'd rather not have the beep shit. drink a verification can. &gt; I put no one else in danger by not wearing one. 

Except for anyone who might be riding in the car with you.  If you want to risk your life while riding solo go right ahead but if you have a passenger, put your seatbelt on.  You have the potential to turn into a projectile if you get into an accident.
 &gt; I feel comfort and maneuverability makes me more safe than any seat belt ever will

This is the stupidest thing I've ever read. I bet you're one of those guys who says he's a better driver after a few drinks, because you're more confident and relaxed, right? Yeah, those bastards trying to stop you dying, what a bunch of pricks &gt;I put no one else in danger by not wearing one

That's completely false, anyone with at least a 4th grade education knows that.  If the car is in gear, I can understand. 

If it's in park on the other hand, that's a useless feature. Then how am I supposed to have car sex with music on?  Buckle the seat belt *while not in it*. Look at this nigga with his college education and shit. The amount of people annoyed about buckling-up is surprising and slightly disconcerting.  Yes *mom*. Well, that's the point. It's a parental control system that OP's rental company enabled. Is it a ford? It seems like a ford. My fusion does the same thing, but you can turn it off... at least for my car. that's that ford mykey system.  it can be deactivated. This seems more /r/mildlyinfuriating to me.  Should be under mildlyannoying No, it is way more than mildly annoying when you include the other safety 'features' these cars have. The overall state of nannyism has gone too far.  I say sell your car.  *cuts seat belt*  If you can find a "male" piece from a wrecker, you can fix the problem. My car's seatbelt recognition is how far the belt is pulled out of its receiver. So if you plug it in it'll do jack shit. You actually have to pull the belt out 2 feet.

But then again I always wear my seatbelt since it's a habit. Pull it around the back of the seat! Click and done! 

PS. it may save your life when the vehicle is in motion :D Wow, that's annoying.  I just mean for times when you're not driving, but would like to have music on.  Same with headlights off.  I hate how cars have no option to turn off the headlights if the engine's running.  You're not given the option to be nice and not blind people in certain circumstances.  My parents have a 2012 Cruze and you can turn off the headlights if you're in park. That makes the most sense to me.  &gt; Same with headlights off. I hate how cars have no option to turn off the headlights if the engine's running

I will not buy a car if this is the case with the model. I fucking hate this so much. My car currently allows you to control your lights.

And if they continue to keep making cars with automatic headlights then I guess I'll have to rewire the computer system.

Because I hate driving rentals or friends cars because I have to wait to see if the lights will turn off after I have already parked, turned the engine off, and locked it.

I'm not risking a dead battery because Pontiac/GM think's it's cool to keep headlights on when it's not necessary and they deem it appropriate.

You know what's appropriate car manufacturers? Giving me the power to control my headlights... Right?   I'm really not sure what it's all about.  I don't understand how engineers designing one of the most dangerous devices used by the masses could think it's a good idea to discourage users from thinking about what they're doing.  I think it's really dangerous to dumb people down when it comes to operating a vehicle.  Really? There are cars that won't let you turn off the headlights? Guess you can't ever go to the drive-in movies or a drive through christmas light display.  They're daytime lights that come on automatically in many (I thought all) newer models.  They're still bright enough to blind anyone who might be in front of where your car's parked at night.  that's ridiculous.  If you're talking about daytime running lights you can usually just pull the ebrake on most cars to turn them off.  No shit?  TIL.   Gonna try this next time, thanks.

Edit:  Just for clarity, I was working a delivery job and people would often be sitting right in front of where I park having a smoke.  When I got back to the shop, I'd usually flick my lights off just before pulling up to avoid blinding my coworkers. So have fun when the airbag module gets confused during a crash and inflates more forcefully than it should

Edit: you guys do know that modern airbags adjust themselves based on seatbelts and seat position and weight sensors, right?  Or eBay. *Fix the problem*? What exactly is the problem with wearing your seat belt...? Look at this nerd over here wearing his seatbelt like a loser. Don't get me wrong.   If you're driving on roads it should be second nature to put on your seatbelt before you put it in gear.  If you're parked, there's no reason you should be forced to wear your seatbelt just to listen to music.  Even shitty music, there's just no need.  Likewise, if your not even in the car, why would it matter if the seatbelt's done up or not?  Also you should be allowed to listen to music while driving 9 mph up a logging road without gradually getting pinned deeper and deeper into your seat with every bump.  The problem is, not every situation where you want music playing from/in the car is going to be one that requires use of a seatbelt. This is a feature called Beltminder, which is part of Ford's MyKey system. There is a way to disable it but you will need the admin key. Not sure if you bought this used or if the car is even yours, but if it came with multiple keys there is a good chance one of them is the admin key. 

Best of luck, because that shit is seriously a buzz kill.

http://support.ford.com/sync-technology/mykey-encourages-good-driving-habits-sync-myford-touch Just wear your fucking seat belt! It's not that hard is it. And also it does a little thing called saving your life in an accident.  We are all aware of what a seatbelt does. But when you're parked and wanting to turn on the god damn radio, it shouldn't pester you like an abusive girlfriend.  Modern car's computers can detect if you are buckled up. They sure can also detect what gear is on or is the car moving or not? Sure, they can, the question is whether or not the designers thought of this. I don't think that's the question, mostly because we can assume the designers are not mentally challenged as this is one of the most obvious drawbacks to the system. 

The arguable part is their logic or reasoning behind these kind of things, not if they thought about it. Sure they thought of this, the question is whether or not management decided to pay to implement this. From a comment above:

&gt; My friend has this in his car, if you're sitting in the driver seat, it'll make you put your seatbelt on to listen to music, even if the car is in park or even if the engine isn't running. It does the same for the Front passenger seat. So basically if you and a friend wanted to chill in the car and listen to music and bullshit while you ate or something, you'd have to put your seatbelt on. He actually has a couple of old seatbelt clips to put into the slot though to trick it into thinking you're buckled up, so it's not that bad, just an annoying feature that could have been improved upon, and maybe has, these aren't really that new. Well that sucks. I wonder if Ford has an opening for automotive software engineers, because I would like to apply and tune their MyKey system. My friend has a Ford car with this system, it doesn't kick in unless you are driving above 10 km/hr. That's all well and good for most situations, but when I'm on my property checking cattle, or riding around my fish lakes, I don't need or want to wear a damn seatbelt. Not everyone lives in a city. I can see how that could be annoying, can you plug it in before you sit down so it is behind you?  I could, but that would require thinking about it before I get in the vehicle, which doesn't happen. And then it's awkward to have to unbuckle it and re-buckle it if I get on the road... and then it's not ready for off-road again. It's really just a pain in the ass.

I believe in wearing a seatbelt when driving on the highway, so I see why they have the warnings, but I really think they need to add some options. If I'm driving from my house to my shop, which is all of 400yds away, I don't need my vehicle telling me to buckle-up because I'm not on the road and I'm not driving fast. If it could be modified from the default setting to only beep if you go over 15mph or something like that it would be a lot more convenient for people who aren't always on the highway all the time. My boyfriend and I play Ingress and spend quite a bit of time just sitting in the car hacking portals.  It's incredibly annoying to have to wear a seat belt the entire time or listen to DING DING DING My BIL has family members who refuse to wear a seatbelt because they know someone who was killed in a car accident while wearing one... There's plenty of times when it's unnecessary to wear a seatbelt. On any public road I buckle up, but if I'm  making frequent stops while driving through a field or down a private road at 30km/h, I really don't need to buckle and unbuckle my belt every 15 seconds. Having the chimes in work and farm trucks is incredibly annoying.

Luckily it only takes 2 minutes to turn off the chime.  What if I'm in my damn driveway setting up my speakers or whatever. My neighbor is ALWAYS making speakers and subwoofers for his car. This setting is so stupid.  Most effective way of getting People to follow the Law, is to be a major inconvinience :) It's not about getting people to follow the law, it's about setting up your car to nag your kids for you. It's the automotive equivalent to parental controls on your game consoles and computers. You can change or disable it with the Admin key, which is given to you when you buy the car. i had a car that slowed down when seatbelt wasnt on. im glad because it really got me into the habit of putting it on Want one what? What did the seatbelt wanted? What? Im not sure what you mean? And now I'm a retard asking random shit... thanks a lot! Look now You bastard! I have also experienced this passive aggressive vehicular behaviour. So this feature is called the silent treatment? time to get a new car This is more mildly infuriating Could someone pretend to know what they are talking about and explain why this exists?  Cutting a window in a wall isn't that difficult. Some tenant at some point in this building's history needed an opening in the wall in their office, lab, studio, whatever that floor was used for, and the owner complied. I see a lot of broad blind walls with a few random little windows in my city. That window is definitely a later addition to the building, it isn't there in earlier pictures.  The question isn't why the one window is there, it's why aren't there more windows there.  Ah, but don't try to figure out why there is only one window, that's impossible.  Instead only try to realize the truth. There is no window. *Woah* ..Jaden? How can matrix references be real if we haven't seen that movie? There is no spoon. Also you fucking suck. The dead people have been defenestrated. 

*Hehe. Right, Reddit? Riiight?* I see you had Chinese today There are four lights!!! The window is not real. Writers would call it: Some sort of insurance mandated window for security. And as the maintenance manager guided the inspector through the building, he pointed out variouse aspects of the structure that seemed to resemble the very persona of the inspector himself. Then he asked the question that would open the gates to the truth of what has been missing inside of him since he was a child.

"Why would such a magnificent building have only one window, towards what could be the most beautiful side of the city?"

"But it is not the most beautiful side of the city." Replied the inspector.

"Maybe thats because, no one is secure enough to give it a chance."

And as the inspector stared out the single window facing the south side of the city, he realized that the only thing that ice cream could doppleganger, was Washington in a banana hat rowing a cotton canoe.  That last part fucked me up ...now I'm scared.  Imagine waking up someday and everything you could ever read is like that.  Individual words are true words that exist, but nothing assembles into sentences that make sense.  Creepy obligatory: How Can Windows Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real What's really going to bake your noodle later on is, would that window still be there if OP hadn't posted anything. This window is fine for taking pee on ppl  down the road... pretty sure the owner must have made it for his own gratification  Probably so that if the building next to it is torn down and replaced with a taller one, they don't have a bunch of windows looking at a blank wall. This is what's called a [party wall](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_wall) and yes, it is often left as a blank, windowless wall because the day the building next door decides that they want to add some new floors (if allowed or if it is re-zoned) then you wouldn't want windows facing your neighbors brick wall. http://i.imgur.com/v7kZyYy.gifv /r/retiredgifs #####&amp;#009;

 [**Party wall**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party%20wall): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;A __party wall__ (occasionally __parti-wall__ or __parting wall__) is a dividing partition between two adjoining buildings (or units) that is shared by the [tenants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leasehold_estate) of each residence or business. When built for this purpose, the builder will lay the wall along a [property line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_line) dividing two [terraced flats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraced_house) or [row houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_house), so that one half of the wall's thickness lies on each property. This type of wall is usually structural. Party walls can also be formed by two abutting walls built at different times. The term can be also used to describe a division between separate units within a multi-unit apartment complex. Very often the wall in this case is non-structural but designed to meet established criteria for sound and/or fire protection between residential units.

Also there did not seem to be another tall structure next to it as others have suggested in the passageway hypothesis. I suspect the vertical discoloration of the building came from a large ad space that may have been there for years. Those were common on the sides of buildings and that would have been a prime spot. But then, was the window after the billboard? Inside the painted ad? Was there never an ad and instead they just power washed one side? 

Guess we need some more picture detectives on the case. [travelled back in time to give you this picture!](http://imgur.com/5H3onDt) Probably a code window for some operation that required it. Direct emergency venting for solvent spills or some such thing.  If I was in that building I wouldn't even wait for permission, I'd do it myself. That's about an hour or twos worth of work. It's much easier to ask for forgiveness than get permission.

Would also explain why it's the only one. The building was built assumed that another was going to be built along side it. Flash forward a few decades and a renovation in that spot created a room that needed a window for building code reasons. Now there is a window. This window probably couldn't be installed for code compliance, because there is definitely an easement next to the building.  That's the reason there are no windows in this wall: someone else has the rights to build a building right up next to it.  An AHJ typically won't let you install a code required window if future improvements could functionally eliminate it. Where I live, you should get a permit for building such window because it might get blocked. But if you do it without the permit, and can proove it that after (I think it is 20 years) 20 years nobody has wanted to build next to it, you will have the right to keep such window and the building next door can't block you.

 I feel like there may have been another building there at some point, maybe this was used to pass stuff back and forth or there was a door between this building and the now removed building and rather than have a door to nowhere they put in a window. It was either a tiny door, that window is much larger than it appears, or they did an amazing job making the added concrete perfectly match what was already there. 

I'm going with the window leading to John Malcovich's butthole.  Does not appear so...

I suspect the vertical discoloration of the building came from a large ad space that may have been there for years. Or maybe just one side was cleaned or painted. That.. that's plausible! Are you sure you're a Redditor? There was another building there before and after it was knocked down somebody decided they wanted a window. (I just made that up but it seems plausible.) So back in the 1940's it was a big fad in Cleveland to put a sunlight window on the side of buildngs. Its sole purpose was to let light into that floor, but this is poorly done because of how small the window is and how big the foor is. This fad quickly came and went and by the time the 1950's came everyone made sure to have no windows incase the Russians finally bombed us. Thats why that window is there. /r/todayibullshitted bullshat? that made no sense  Exactly why it went out of style. Not even one? Sunshine? In Cleveland? I call bullshit!  Thanks! Exactly what I was looking for.  that sounded made up... No way! You can trust me because im a person on Reddit. I wouldn't mislead anyone Trust you? 


Duh! Crazy goose, I'll trust you.  You do not say, "Crazy goose!"  You call him an asshole like a normal kid!  It wouldn't make sense! Look at his username :P It was.  That guy is bullshitting you. When they built that building there either was another building touching it on that side, or they thought one would be built. That's why they didn't build any windows and covered it in that ugly brick. There isn't another building along they side of this building now, and at some point a tenant put in a single window. As a news editor at Fox news i will use this information Yeah? Well Brian Williams was there when they cut out those 76 bricks in the wall. In fact, someone from the Sunlight Team 6 sent him a white envelope with a shattered piece of brick from that very wall. you're a noble man, thank you.  This guy is all mixed up. What really happened was in the late 1930's having windows was totally out of style, so everyone in this building fashionably removed their windows, replacing them with more hip blank concrete and steel walls. This one window was from this fucking hipster, (who later went on to become the inventor of the one framed glasses with no glass), who went against the flow and was "Too cool" for concrete walls. He later killed himself by jumping out the window since nobody else followed his hipster lead, and kept their windows. They now keep this one lone window here in memory of him. His name? I don't fucking know, who cares. These other responses are wrong. It's so that when one of the employees needs to make a bunch of copies of something they can use that window to keep track of how many Reese's peanut butter cups the statue threw out last winter  /r/ExplainLikeImASurrealist I was really hoping this was a real sub. It's called a [party wall](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_wall).  The neighboring building may have (or had, at some point) building rights along it. it is actually not a party wall, it is a wall at the lot line.  A party wall would generally straddle the lot line and be used by both properties- this is clearly only part of the larger building.
On top of the above practical reasons for wanting to limit windows in such a wall, there are also lots of restrictions in the building codes about allowed openings in walls on or near a property line. It's a toilet I'm pretty sure it's so Bugs Bunny can trick someone into running out of it.  There's a movie on netflix,[ Sidewalls](http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/70197167?trkid=13752289), where part of the plot deals with a couple of people cutting out these windows in their apartments in Buenos Aires. This was probably added during one of the various remodels to the building, as it did not exist when the building was first constructed.

[This photo shows the building in 1911](http://i.imgur.com/iCu9bg4.jpg)

The reason the color of the brick changes is because the building was initially supposed to be only 5 stories, but additional floors were added.

The 7th\* floor was home to "The Sterling Room" and the cocktail lounge. 

It's possible this window was added to an office, I cannot find any other information about the uses of the other floors in the building.

\*This comes down to how '[storeys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storey)' are counted, British vs American. I do not know what was customary in the early 1900's. For a while there was a "window tax." The idea was that rich people had big houses and glass was expensive, therefore it was a tax that would soak the rich. Naturally people responded by not adding windows. In this building, only one person on that side was willing to pay the annual window tax. There really was a window tax at one point. The more windows your house had, the more wealthy you were. Which lead to people evading the tax by bricking over their windows. I'll tell you the story if you wish to hear it, I used to work in that building three years ago. No one ever talked about it, but about 15 years ago the building was owned by a different company. It was an insurance company and the building was full of lawyers who spend all day trying to get the company out of paying insurance claims. Well all of the window offices were used up by the bosses who really couldn't do anything but order people around. One day their best employee got fed up with it and demanded that he be given an office with a window, and he was denied. In his rage he decided to make his own window and snuck a sledge hammer in the next day.

He started busting a hole in the wall, and when he made his window he leaned against the wall and looked out into the sun. The wall ended up giving out and he fell head first to his death. His life insurance was denied by the very same company and his family ended up living in poverty.

All of a sudden other employees started jumping out of the hole, as if they were possessed. The company ended up putting a proper window in, but the office has been permanently locked. The company ended in bankruptcy with many of the heads committing suicide, though we believe it's through their own means. -by Junji Ito And that man?  Albert Einstein Can't figure out how to link the exact comment from a previous thread with this same question while in this app, but someone answered it.  /u/mr_milenko  

There's only a few comments, so should be easy to spot. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Cleveland/comments/283oj9/lone_single_window_whats_your_story/ Oh, hey! So yeah my dad tells me this was a window for an office. That's it. Honestly it's probably just an illegal structure in the sense that it was not on the original floor plan submitted to the government for approval. Most likely whoever bought the floor decided to open up a window during renovation.

It was probably part of the original design intent to not place windows on the facade facing an adjacent lot. If the building next to it gets demolished and built up that window will be staring at a wall lol.. "Please use the designated window for all suicides, thank you" hey tom wheres the suicide window?  

oh just down the hall and its the first window on the right &gt; only window on the right So haunting.  Well, you can't haunt without ghosts. That's what the suicide window is for! Can't miss it The ground, that is. Or maybe it's the last window on the right? "This one with the pile of bodies outside?" 

"Yeah, that's the one."  It's only 4 stories though. So you might just leave with too many broken bones to count, but not dead. swan dive. That's the spirit How many tits have you gotten in exchange for gold? Seriously curious right now I imagine he gets more people asking him how many tits he's gotten for gold. Out of curiosity, how many floors is the suggested minimum? The farthest fall someone has survived without a parachute was 33,333 feet. To be completely safe (or, I suppose the opposite of safe in this case) you should stack several of the tallest buildings in the world on top of each other.  But you will reach terminal velocity after about 1,500 feet (~450m) so falling from any higher than that wouldn't make a difference. Did they land on concrete with nothing breaking their fall? &gt; On 26 January 1972, an explosion on JAT Flight 367, while over Srbsk Kamenice in Czechoslovakia (now in the Czech Republic) caused the plane to break apart. Vulovi, 22 years old at the time, was a flight attendant on board. She was not scheduled to be on that flight; she had been mixed up with another flight attendant who was also named Vesna.[1]
Vulovi fell approximately 10,160 meters (33,333 ft).[1] She suffered a fractured skull, three broken vertebrae (one crushed completely) that left her temporarily paralyzed from the waist down, and two broken legs. She was in a coma for 27 days. In an interview, she commented that according to the man who found her, "...I was in the middle part of the plane. I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane. The man who found me says I was very lucky. He was in the German Army as a medic during World War II. He knew how to treat me at the site of the accident."[3] Man, she had a whole plane to break her fall. That's cheating! 

My personal favorite was the guy in WW2 who decided to jump from a burning plane sans parachute rather than ride it down. Everyone else stayed on board, and he was the only survivor,  and with only a sprained ankle!

FTFY Cleveland, right?  Yep! Euclid ave! I've been in the bldg. Cleveland Athletic club.. Did you go into... the room? nope, but I remember the one time I was there - there were pools and bowling alleys and shit there.  They drain the pool by opening the window? Clever.    &gt;and shit there 

BINGO!  We found the reason for the window.

PERIOD DOT COM!! Aw, that sounds great. I wish it was still open! [I found photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/63837784@N08/sets/72157627008064859/), it's a creepy looking place now it's disused.

[Is this the window?](https://www.flickr.com/photos/63837784@N08/14823924781)
 Neat! That does look like it could be the window as it is not right next to other windows and it looks small enough. A giant redbull? Well, now we know *how* the window was made... but *why?* Once you have wings, you need to fly.  He's been inside that room. It's cold in here! And the damn window was stuck [He can see you checking out that window](http://i.imgur.com/xCOGSNI.jpg) http://i.imgur.com/vnVDWiA.gif?1 I don't think i will ever get sick of clever uses of Javert. I can't find him! [I'm on mobile so I like to think I put in extra effort finding him](http://i.imgur.com/XLRA8Rm.jpg)   



And of course I looked at every single window before finding him up there. Oh Jesus. I'm on mobile as well. I didn't even notice the windows over there.  I thought that was a bell. AND I AM JAVERT! DO NOT FORGET MY NAME! 2460-JUAN. [24602060451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEVago2PKn0) Always watches I cannot recognize him What am i missing here? Look near top right of picture That window is the only entrance into that room in the building. The One has to return to the Source somehow.  That's some [1408 shit](http://youtu.be/vdECkntEMCQ?t=1m9s) going on right there. I know that movie isn't highly rated, but it's a guilty pleasure of mine. I love the tension created by essentially having a room torment the main character. Changing layout by removing windows and walling in the room is brilliant horror. Claustrophobic people must be deadly afraid of that movie. 

Probably has to do with the fact it's based on a Stephen King story. I like that part where Samuel Jackson says "It's an evil fucking room."  There's an Argentinian film called [Medianeras](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1235841/) (Spanish for "sidewalls") in which a character hires a contractor to carve out a "bootleg" window in her Buenos Aires apartment. That's where I first heard about the practice. According to the film they're [not](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3008/2887503341_284cdceae9.jpg) [uncommon](http://www.35milimetros.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/medianeras_taretto12.jpg). This was my first thought, and I'm surprised I had to scroll down this car to find a mention of Sidewalls.  It's called a lot line window. When buildings share a wall/lot line any  window on the lot line is not considered a real window in terms of designating rooms for bedrooms and what not (bedrooms require at least one window). So, because a lot line window is not really a window, most buildings are not constructed with windows on the lot lines since they are a waste of money/time.

It appears that because there's no building built up to share the same wall, someone has gone ahead and inserted a window. One day it could be facing a brick wall at which point he'll have to patch it up.  This is a documented sports prank by the builder, who was a Michigan alumn, when he found out the athletic club was going to be there.  He stated that any Michigan player would be able to put a football through the window many times before an Ohio player ever would.  The club kept the window with the condition that if the window was broken, the thrower would need to pay for it, however that it would be such a feat that the club would honor the player with a dinner if they played for MI, and with the governor's seat if from Ohio. It was all done very tongue in cheek because it was thought impossible.  37 dinners have been served at the CAC and all of Ohio's governors have been elected. Each dinner cost about three fiddy.  No wonder the pool is so big. That little pale girl looking out of it is rather unsettling Oh shit, you're right! I didn't even realize it was a gif. Fuck you.  Fuck all of you. Is it really? Because I live alone and it's nighttime but I'm so curious. HALP.  It's alright, you can't see her because she's not in the photo anymore, she's right behind you. I don't like you..  Don't forget to check behind the shower curtains. I'll take the job but only if I can have an office with a window. 
Fuck  I'm just imagining this was a condo development and this one guy (or girl) wrote into the purchase agreement that he/she would have a window on that side of the building and their lawyers missed it.  Architect here,

If you look at the discoloration around the window, and notice the newer building below it, you can see that another, taller building used to share a wall. This window was actually an escape into the adjacent building for safety reasons (mostly fire).

Vandelay Industries 7th floor, 3rd door from the right of the staircase.  Even more mildly interesting, [Here's an old picture postcard from the Cleveland Athletic Club.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PB9DLQU?ie=UTF8&amp;at=&amp;force-full-site=1&amp;ref_=aw_bottom_links) I found an archive of old material. They went bankrupt in 2007/2008 right as the recession was starting.

I found a flyer dated January of 2007 with club membership prices. No way this place was going to survive through the recession with pricing structure like this.

 Just a wild guess: The shorter building on the right used to be a lot taller and this was a secret passage from one building to the next? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysmLA5TqbIY I thought I remembered that ending with "we're not Detroit" or something...

Edit.: [Found it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzgAjjuqZM), guess I saw part 2 first :) Mosby strikes again i'd like to think a guy chiseled that out of the wall himself instead of working /r/Cleveland I bet it's an old fire escape. The stairs were probably taken down for aesthetics once a sprinkler system was installed in the building. One fire escape in a building that large? You'd get a flaming and dead people funnel. /r/writingprompts would have fun with this.  /r/creepy too!!! ah the lovely view of multi-colored vermiculite block fill kinda weird since the way the wall is faded on only half of it there was another building right beside it, the window was probably a passage between buildings. thats this guys thought Sometimes in apartment buildings, people will have these put in secretly/illegally because they want a window. It's in the movie Sidewalls.  In Soviet Russia, you get ONE window I seriously need to know why this is. Please someone explain and provide a source. I need closure.  I find  this....oddly satisfying. Cleveland? Cleveland. I miss you meatball! Can we get doughnuts soon?  Totally! Mmmmm doughnuts. SCP Fuel? Window on side of the building, no entrance can be found from the inside. No way to open door from the outside. Some reports have been made if a small child's face peering out. All attempts to photograph or video tape have failed. window for richmond #itcrowd Cleveland represent!  Is this Ohio? I swear when I visited family in the rocky river/Cleveland area I took a pic of this same window because of how odd I thought it was. Just one window. Juuuust one  Is this window not in a movie. I have vague memories of watching a movie about Charles bukowski, and him working in some shitty job. There is one scene with him looking out this window. Could be wrong, but the picture reminded  me straight away of it. This is where the toilet it. For the whole building.   That's Kramers office  Its a secret chamber the chamber of farts The chamber of secrets. it's a fire exit... There will be a rope latter near the door. That guy must have a cat. This creeps me out for some reason. Is that the window Chinaski looked out in Factotum? /r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix  I think the window is in a bathroom. Plot twist: that particular room has no door.  Likely there was another building right up against that building, and there was a passageway to get into the other. Thats where the snipper is. It may be the Executive's restroom window? I bet it's a storage room as well This is specifically reserved for defenistration. Reminds me of this old abandoned building that had a door leading outside, on the second floor.

Sure, it probably used to have a stairway or something. But I choose to believe that's it's really a floating idiot door. That's some Portal shit! You gotta know that's a bathroom.  Always read the fine print before agreeing to a contract of a new employee. Defenestration station. This feels special for some reason "That bastard Bob got the window office" /r/mildydepressingpics I windowed once. "I WANT A OFFICE WITH A WINDOW! A WINDOW I TELL YOU!" That's Johnson's office. Good man. As if we couldn't get any more retarded in Cleveland. Who remembers the 10 cent beer night? Also I recommend to watch the Cleveland tourism videos by Mike Polk.  Maybe it's not a [window](http://www.asharperfocus.com/images/Malkovich-4.jpg) at all. The loneliest window in the whole west wall It was probably a vent or something at one point, eventually it was removed and that was the cheapest option.

Source: deep within my own bowels  Possibly a trash chute? Or maybe one installed for renovation?  But what about that windchill factor?  It just feels like you're paying less.  [deleted] It's a penalty for leaving the house when it's that cold.  And making the employees have to come to work because of the demand. Hahah, nah the sign doesn't matter. The number is what they look at. But the number is on the sign. Just drop it okay, the numbers don't matter! Well I absolutely value them Just divide your attention away from the negative sign for the time being. It's not like we pay attention to them only a fraction of the time. Well, I could really integrate this into my frugal life. SHITTY UNIMAGINATIVE MATH PUN THAT IS ONLY TANGENTIALLY RELATED Now you're just being obtuse. Damn, I normally get tired of reddit puns but that was clever. It's okay, the ones below it quickly return to the usual *golden* standard.  That's Numberwang! Let's rotate the board?

Edit: dammit.  I apologize.  I should have scrolled further.   I kept saying this to my various maths teachers in school and they *never fucking listened* Use the absolute value system That's a function, not a system. It's not shown, so it doesn't apply.

No, I'm not fun at parties; unless it's a LAN party. The sign is on the number on the sign. Which sign, the sign sign or the number sign? For some reason this really fucking confused me, but after my brainfart passed I understood what you meant. They look at the number, not the negative sign in front of it.  You're looking for the term 'absolute number', or magnitude. POP POP  That's [Numberwang](http://youtu.be/qjOZtWZ56lc)! Heh, positive temperatures in Canada. It gets hot as fuck to here ya know.  
  
Also, hows Voidspace? Yea but Thursday last year doesn't count.

Also, great! Its a video game I've been working on with a few others for the last few years. Thanks for asking!


[Here's a direct link with footage and the concept](http://playvoidspace.com/?a=1&amp;sr=rdtcmtmi)

 It's says its playable on every modern computing device. Can I play it on my TI-84? &gt; modern

That device is over a decade old. That's ancient in the tech world. And yet they're still over $100 despite having no 3D capabilities and a 100x75 pixel screen. Everything is worth what its purchaser will pay for it. And no, Civilization IV won't run on your TI-84 either. No, it's this principle that has made being poor continue to suck so bad despite rampant abundance and waste.

Besides, Texas Instruments has a monopoly on most math classes and they charge a ridiculous amount for an essential tool. This guy gets his spamming out through his fucking username.  Genius.   This is sick But sometimes it's *all the Thursdays that month.* Sorry for going off-topic in a thread but holy shit I'm so fucking sold for Voidspace. I am pretty sure that wasn't proper english but I just love the idea. It was 7 Degrees today here in Vancouver! Family informs me it was +15 in their part of Calgary the other week, now it's -14. Later in the week it'll be 8 degrees and sunny. 

Vancouver is the mopey but tolerable donkey while across the mountains we have a manic depressive anxiety ridden piglet that you find endearing and likable but also want to smack. 



 &gt; Vancouver is the mopy but tolerable donkey while across the mountains it has a manic depressive anxiety ridden piglet. 

Idk why, but this imagery is really amusing to me as someone living in Vancouver. :D  It was over 15 last week Yeah it's not like it gets to 30 degrees celsius or anything. And we all live in igloos..... ABSOLUTE VALUE Temperature reads left to right ignoring the top and bottom words. Sale reads top to bottom ignoring the left and right symbols. I wish we had something like that around here. It hit -45 today. -40 in Yellowknife today, Marks didn't have this. That's because the store froze. The street froze. Everything froze.  Everything has been frozen for months.   Neighbour! 

Edit: This morning my phone told me -52. My phone might have just been inaccurate. Cold as fuck.  &gt;  Yellowknife 

I'll always know that place because the "Wii Weather Channel" was so useless it only reported weather in about 200 pinpoints, and Yellowknife was ALWAYS the coldest. thats because yellowknife is cold as fuck 100% of the time Where the fuck do you live? And WHY? You burn more calories living in cold environments. 

...this is the positive I keep telling myself You also lose weight by losing your extremities to frostbite! "Hey! Have you lost weight? Or limbs?"  Really, once you get below -20F or so it doesn't really feel any colder. It's all just cold.  Naah. -20F is still okay if its not very windy. -40 to -60F is when your skin and lips start burning and it becomes hell. In Canada during the winter in some places that's totally normal. Was -48 C here the awhile back. Where do you live?? The next time it's -100 I'm heading to Marks.  Free clothes!  Amundsen-Scott doesn't even get that cold, and they don't have a Marks on Europa. Just give the space Nazi's some time dammit. They'll get there. I'm thinking they perhaps might be accompanied by the apostrophe Nazis. I believe the grammar Nazis have already arrived! That's why America uses Fahrenheit. It gets us discounts when we invade Canada, cuz the temperature is always below -40 there. What? -40 Celsius and Fahrenheit are the same thing. &gt; That's why America uses Fahrenheit. It gets us discounts when we invade Canada, cuz the temperature is always below -40 there.

&gt; What? -40 Celsius and Fahrenheit are the same thing.

It's like I'm reading a Futurama script SWEET GUINEA PIG OF WINNIPEG Winnipegger checking in. It's a balmy - 19 of course I'm a winnipegger too, that's the only reason I remember that line from Hermes! 

Winnipeggers never forget when we get mentioned on television.  That's it! Back to Winnipeg! WE GOT A HUMONGOUS FUNGUS AMONG US Good news everyone, We're going shopping. Hermes: we are buying discounted prescription drugs form that Canadian planet mon.

Bender: damn those Canadians, they can't be trusted were their kindness, universal healthcare and metric system. How the hell am I supposed to know what -40 celcius is, they can kiss my shinny frozen ass!

 So...who says what? I'm sure the Professor's in there, Fry's probably there too. Bender makes some wisecrack about his ass, you know the drill Classic Futurama.  [Left out again](http://i.imgur.com/rXh4qXh.gif). But below -40, the Fahrenheit temperature reading is further from zero than the Celsius temperature reading.  you got it right, dunno why people are downvoting you. if it's BELOW -40, you'd get a bigger discount measuring in farenheit. For instance, -45C is -49F. yeah but it never gets that cold. It was -40 where I am yesterday Out of curiousity, where are you? 

I'm 2 hours drive south of the Northwest Territories border and it was only -25C this morning. Albertan here, its only hitting  -24C here. Well,  -28C now, but that doesn't count because it's near midnight and I'm not walking anywhere. He's probably counting the windchill, which everyone always does for some reason.  Maybe not where you are. I've seen it. I don't like it, but I've seen it. Though really, after a certain point it doesn't feel any *colder.* Keyword there was below.  That's why I said below This sign can only display two digits, so it would probably be -00% off. -99% is good enough. Just so we're all clear here, a negative 100% discount means you're paying double all day. Pour some boiling water on the sign.  just locate some dry ice and their thermometer. Liquid Helium

-273%

I guess that means the shop pays me 173% of whatever I buy More like if you buy one you take another 1.73 of it -100 degrees *Celsius* This wee bad boy may tip the odds in your favor:

http://imgur.com/8bP8lIZ Could I use this to fight Batman? But wouldn't negative 100% off really be double price because double negative?

edit: double negative, not false negative If it's -100, your not going anywhere!!   Mark's Work Warehouse...owned by Canadian Tire, the company that made that truck out of ice that was on the front page a couple weeks ago.

I wonder if they know how well they are accidentally doing on social media... &gt;  accidentally 

sure.

accidentally. *Hey how does some free ["accidental"](http://i.imgur.com/hMS7aJV.gif) advertising sound...* "free" "sound" "quotation marks" 

" " " choo choo Based on how shitty most Canadian Tire advertisements are I would believe this is by accident.

They've had a few better ones the last couple years, but 5 years ago? Dear god those were painful to watch. If you knew anything about Canadian Tire's previous marketing attempts, you'd be assuming it's accidental too.  They do, their social media is pretty on point. Also, they're ALWAYS running sales. Their shipping to the US is decently priced.
You even get the name of the person that shopped the warehouse on your receipt.

I'm a big fan of their HD-1 hoodies. Don't forget the Canadian Tire money! It should be its own formal currency. One of the liquor stores from my home town actually accepts Canadian Tire money at face value. &gt;You even get the name of the person that shopped the warehouse on your receipt.

Thus, one might say that the order is...*senderverified*??? NICE TRY, MARK'S WORK WAREHOUSE. A poutine place I went to on a recent trip to Quebec City did the same thing. Guess this is a true Canadian form of discount! That'd be Ashton. It's probably the one place most people in Quebec City think of when "poutine" is mentionned.

Througout January they have this "Get X% off, where X is the weather in celcius". They have a 10% off minimum, even if its warmer than -10 C, but honestly this is Quebec City, Canada, that's not gonna happen.

http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/2sn7jj/ashton_a_famous_quebec_city_poutine_chain_offers/ God bless Ashton That's absolutely genius marketing. The colder it gets the less likely people are to go out shopping, but with this system the colder it is the more you save and so the more you'll want to go. They're ensuring that the least busy times are when people will be most attracted to their store. As if that wasn't enough this company is also owed by a tyre company. "You going out in this weather? Best to be safe and get some new tyres, and how about some snow treads while you're at it?". Genius!

Edit: I would also be willing to bet that they don't think twice about capitalising further on this system and pushing sales of thermal clothing to deal with the cold. "Oh look, they have a rack of hats, scarves, and gloves right here by the counter! It was quite chilly on the way here. How thoughtful!". I wouldn't exactly call Canadian Tire a tire company, despite their name. They are more of a hardware store for vehicles than a tire company. Also, if the weather is already that bad everyone who is going to put winter tires would have already done so. I put my winter tires on when the temperature was around 0C. They say you should put them on once the temp is reliably below +7. They work better than all seasons at that point. &gt; I wouldn't exactly call Canadian Tire a tire company, despite their name. 

Were they ever? They do sell tires, so kinda. Decades ago, they were just a tire company.  Then they started offering installation.  Then they expanded into a full service garage/repairs + tyre sales.  And also a gas station.  Then they started selling maps, camp equipment, and then bicycles and sporting goods.  And so on.  

Nowadays, it's like a combination hardware store, garage, gas station, and bed/bath/beyond.  Also, they sell tyres.  You're not far off. More than anything else, Mark's caters to people who work outside, year round, and require good clothing to do so. Thermal clothing and winter wear are what I go to Mark's for, and even though their prices are reasonable, knowing it's being discounted would draw me in despite the temperature. I like in Nebraska, and at a restaurant called Runza they have temperature Tuesdays. Whatever the temperature is at 6 AM, is the price you pay for a runza(their signature sandwich) Is this only in the winter or something? Because paying $60 for a sandwich is ridiculous Yes, it's only in the winter. And it's in cents, not in dollars. This seems strange to me. No matter how warm it gets, they're selling *sandwiches* for less than $1? [Assuming this is the sandwich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runza) you're talking about, that sounds ridiculous. You could feed a family for under $10.

Not saying you're lying, I just think I'm missing something. How much do these sandwiches cost when it's not winter?

Ninja edit: [I see here](http://www.runza.com/_resources/dyn/files/1403183z31f01b50/_fn/Temperature+Tuesdays+Week+%235++2-3-15.pdf) that you must purchase fries and a drink as well. That makes a lot more sense. #####&amp;#009;

&gt;

&gt;A __runza__ (also called a __[bierock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bierock)__, __fleischkuche__, or __Kraut Pirok__) is a yeast dough bread pocket with a filling consisting of [beef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef), [pork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork), [cabbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage), or [sauerkraut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauerkraut), [onions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion), and seasonings. They are baked in various shapes such as a half-moon, rectangle, round (bun), square, or triangle. In [Nebraska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska), the runza is usually baked in a rectangular shape. The bierocks of [Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas), on the other hand, are generally baked in the shape of a bun.

Yep. Nebraskans are still weird. First thing I did when opening this post was search "Runza".  Hey from a fellow Nebraskan!  Same here! Hello hello! There's a poutine chain here in Quebec that does the [same.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B7UqArSCUAA3AGh.jpg:large)

 calisse... -29 il fait frette en esti. Jokes on you, it's -18% off: you pay more. -18C% off? Clever marketing, but the units and the minus sign are driving me crazy. Yeh the price would increase and you'd have to pay with $C, which isn't a real currency. It's simple! You get 18 degrees cooler* for every one hundred items you buy! 

^^*_Actual_ ^^_degrees_ ^^_may_ ^^_vary_ ^^with ^^_individual_ ^^_heat_ ^^_capacities_ ^^_which_ ^^_depend_ ^^_on_ ^^_body_ ^^_composition._ Oh man, I wish Vancouver was as cold as the east cost...NAHT Vancouver just needs less rain.. they should throw an absolute value sign around the thermostat reading. Our mcdonalds around here have deals like that, buy one big mac, get a second for yesterdays temperature.  Should have tipped some liquid nitrogen or dry ice over the sensor and then just walked out with a TV. It's a clothing store.  Right. Well, we've bought the dry ice now, seems a shame to waste it. Maybe they've got a TV in the back for staff to watch on a break. Take that.

I was expecting some bright spark to tell me that it'd only be 78% off with dry ice or something like that :) It'd only be 78% off with dry ice or something like that! They do the same thing at Chez Ashton's in Qubec City! The only time we wish for the -50 degrees celcius to hit on Saskatchewan... Was this even in Saskatchewan? -60 sucked I walked home in that shit wearing blue jeans and a parka once.... Only a thin toque and some shitty snow board gloves to keep me warm! I used to live one block from university. I walked there one day in -40 (without wind chill) and I couldn't feel my face when I got inside. It maybe took me 10 minutes from door to door. ITT: People throwing a fit (or being snarky) about the negative sign before the number but completely ignoring the degree sign. Selective fit-throwing. Discount would be better in Fahrenheit. 'MURICA

Edit: Not even going to lie, I did not realize that -18C would be 0F. Am too high for measurements Try again...Minus 18 celsius is 0 degrees Fahrenheit. 'CANADA... Just wait till it hits -40, then we can all just get along! Can be arranged. -SK resident -SK? So you left Saskatchewan? Nah, the sign doesn't matter.  It would be higher in farenheit if it wasn't negative. Why don't we just convert this shit to Kelvin so they pay us no matter what? The best option here would be to switch to Kelvin 

Edit: Okay, I know that we don't experience temperatures in negative Kelvin.  I was trying to suggest that we replace the integer *and* the unary with a value for temperature in Kelvin. Wait until it gets warm Arizona in the middle of the summer warm.  \&gt; warm Who dat saying they gonna get a discount? My local coffee shop takes the number of cents off your coffee whenever it's past -30C.

i.e. if it's -38C, you save 38 cents.

Here in the Yukon, it happens for months on end. (It's -35C right now, going to be -40C/F this weekend) I miss the Yukon so much. Spent a few months living up there.  Someone is going to go breath on the thermometer and ruin everyone's good deals. 

Also I'm glad they don't have this here in Arizona, I couldn't afford +110F markups  I love Marks! Never seen this sign though, is it a special promotion? Maybe I should get some new work gloves if they've got this going on

Oh wait, I just realized I'm in Vancouver and it doesn't go below -3c, and that's only at night. Nevermind... Depending on location that is pretty damn brave. Here in Manitoba every store owner would be flat broke. It looks like half of the first digit is painted with a sharpie so it won't go above "1"... So, tops 19% Wouldn't -18% off mean they add 18% more to the bill? -18% off? So an 18% markup Wait, does that mean you pay 18% more? Shoppers are only there to keep from freezing to death.  -18 isn't even bad. I leave this thread a little stupider for reading a lot of the comments. A frozen yogurt place I know does something like this. The number of degrees below zero it is = the number of cents off each ounce of yogurt. Gee, that discount actually covers all the sales tax. I feel bad for all of you. Here in California it ranged from a bit of a nippy 55 to a nice warm 75. Perfect weather. ... This makes sense if they're advertising warmer clothes does it work both ways ? There's a regional restaurant chain called Runza that has Temperature Tuesdays during the winter: the temperature at 8 AM is the price of a regular sandwich, in cents. (If it's below zero, it's just free.) I certainly hope it doesn't do the opposite in the summer.  -18% off... would you pay more? My home town's gelato place does the same, which makes a little more sense since people would be less likely to get gelato the colder it gets. I always thought stores lack promotions like this. I work at a clothing store and I always thought Super Bowl Sunday would be the perfect day for a big sale to draw woman that didn't want to watch the game.

Same for snowy days. It could boost business on days when people don't want to leave the house.  And 10% off for Union members! I'm not even union but get the discount card from my company.  It says Carhartts right on it, but they wouldn't give me the 10% last week when I bought new pants... HEY I SAW THIS TODAY AT HEARTLAND SHOPPING CENTRE... I love marks carhartt clothes for life What if some little shit started messing with the sensor? Not a sensor, just paper and sharpie ah For all my fellow Canadians who may not be aware...

Marks is owned by Canadian Tire *Gasp*

I found this mildly interesting when I discovered it. Technically -18% off means additional 18%. -18% off is a double negative.  OP is paying more for his goods. Technically they're adding 18% on.  So...if you take off -18%....isn't that adding 18%..? Sounds like a surcharge to me.  If they're taking away -18%, isn't that a double negative? So you pay extra because it's cold. They should be glad they don't use Fahrenheit "Mom it's cold as fuck"
"Fucking sweet Billy let's go shopping" There's a bar in Kalamazoo MI, The Beer Exchange, which sells beer similarly to stocks. You can get some great beer for dirt cheap. 

I know it's not temperature and clothes. But who need clothes in the cold, when you have beer  I wouldn't pay 18% more. [Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/kPBBSDV.png)

Don't like this? Message me! Its really cool! -18% off is X1.18... $761 from NIST. Choosy quality assurance and metrication engineers choose Standard Reference Material peanut butter.

[Edited for spelling. Autocorrect, etc.] &gt; $761 from NIST

I have never wanted to eat peanut butter more than I do right now. I must know what reference PB tastes like. You need some reference jelly to go with it. I tried searching the NIST website for standard reference jelly, but came up empty. Sorry. What about jam? Or marmalade? Preserves? Well, their website is actually jammed right now. Lone Starr!!! There is only one man who would *dare* give me the raspberry! I've lost the bleeps, I've lost the creeps and I've lost the sweeps. The what, the what, and the what? Yes, it is the platonic ideal of peanut butter. even peanut butter is getting friendzoned now
