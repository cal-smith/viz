Having worked for the same security company that was doing the venue here, I can confirm that the security is pretty shitty. Most of this is in part because most of the regular guards just don't care. \n\nUsually it's the event head of security that only cares about his job, of which I can attest that they are usually good guys, with the exception of a couple. Problems like this occur during moments of complacency, which comes easy at small venues, especially when you are getting paid $8 for the job to just stand around and risk your safety for no benefits.\n\nThe security company (Swetman's Security) has an interesting hierarchy, and if you aren't a member of their clique, you really get the shit end of the stick. I'm not saying this as a disgruntled ex-employee, but more-so from an understanding on the guards point of view. When the company you work for sometimes puts you on a job site, with no relief, food, or water for 8-12 hours at a time, it's kind of shit deal. \n\nWhat's worse is when I had the chance to see the contracts made with the security company for protection, small venues, or even low value events (like graduations because the school districts can't pay much) is between $18 - $25 a head for a guard, and the staff is only being paid $8 an hour, there is a big difference. A lot of people say it's for overhead; it's not... They only staff a very small handful of people to oversea this entire operation, and the headquarters is in a tiny house, that shares with his construction company, and his rental properties management. He still requires his employees to go pick up a paper check, as he won't do direct deposit. \n\nWendi Swetman is a multimillionaire, is one of the board of supervisors for the county, and is looking to run for political office next election term, and is gathering a large amount of funding at local fundraisers. God forbid if you cross the man however, considering the large amount of pull he has in this region. If you piss him off he will blacklist you so hard, and getting a job any where is damn near impossible. To those that think, that isn't applicable in today's world anymore, it all depends on where you live. Here on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, you can out perform, be more qualified, and an overall better candidate for the job; but if someone played football with your hopeful employer, and their son is complete fuck up - he will still get the job before you.\n\n\ntl;dr\n\nSwetman Security Service, the security company for this venue is run by the cheapest and one of the worst employers. As such, he under staffs events, and what employees he does have, usually don't give two shits, due to poor treatment; thus leading to security flaws that allow the public to get on stage. This was an extremely small venue, and isn't the first time something like this has happened down here.

The employees, as you say, really don't care. Most of them are so old, frail, or other that I wouldn't trust them with my safety, so I don't. \n\nBut what you mention sounds illegal. We always have giant water coolers posted anywhere someone is stationed that requires them staying put, like the back wall, stage L and R, and exits leading to back/staging areas. They also give us coupons for free/discounted food at whatever venue we work. And I don't know how your's does it, but we have people working as breakers, who constantly walk big circles and make sure *all* staff, security, ushers, ticket takers, etc are given adequate bathroom breaks. The meal situation sucks for us, but isn't illegal; a paid 15 minute meal break for each 4 hours scheduled. But by the time we get our food and to an area we are allowed to eat, it's been 10 minutes usually haha. \n\nFinally, it's been claimed that he was handling his own security, which would mean Swetman, if anything, would be running a skeleton crew. I would also guess that Afroman would have his people at the stage and backstage entrances only, as his security entourage probably isn't *that* big.
