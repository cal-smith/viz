It's pretty clear to me that these two started collecting late in the Beanie wave, and I wouldn't even be surprised if this were part of why the ended up getting divorced. Most of their retired beanies are from the series that retired just before the most infamous release of beanies ever: Hiss, Iggy, and Rainbow.

Were I trying to select a Beanie in this, I think my next choice from among the middle pile would be Crunch the Shark, though at the time I might have gone for that tye died rooster because it might be a Doodle which was forced to have it's name changed to Strut, and was Doodle for only a very short time.

But Fingolfin gleamed beneath it as a star; for his mail was overlaid with silver, and his blue shield was set with crystals; and he drew his sword Ringil, that glittered like ice.\n\nThen Morgoth hurled aloft Grond, the Hammer of the Underworld, and swung it down like a bolt of thunder. But Fingolfin sprang aside, and Grond rent a mighty pit in the earth.

But the king sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish, or by dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age.

His wife (\"spirit of the river\") very much shows all signs of a woman who drowns herself, they were usually depicted exactly like Goldberry. And while the Hobbits struggle with death (see being killed by the tree...) Frodo can barely resist the temptation to get absolution of his quest by Bombadil. But I think Bombadil sees in the Hobbits the will to fight, because some people, especially those who are happy and contempt and *want to protect what is dear to them and what is dear to those they want to protect*, can overcome their fears and find strength in the thought that they could end it anyways, but that they have to fight for now.

The reason why I don't share them all is because they do not belong to me, and if the direct owners haven't shared them before, that is their decision.\n\n\nThere are many more pictures in the album. I've chosen a few that do not directly identify my uncle's family so as not to disturb their privacy any further. If you end up sharing these, please grant my wish by stating that they are part of a private collection and that they have been shared without permission, which is all I can do to take responsibility for it. I am concerned for breaching their trust, but I also believe that this bit of history belongs to all Mexicans and the allies they worked with. May they find some solace in this pride, specially in these times where we are deeply concerned about civil unrest.\n\n\n* [P-47D's flying with both the USAAF and Mexican insignias](http://i.imgur.com/5IZvAFG.jpg)\n\n\n* [The first and last time the Mexican flag is raised on foreign territory during a war campaign](http://i.imgur.com/jgB6cxx.jpg)\n\n\n* [In Memoriam - Those who did not make it back, from the quest for freedom](http://i.imgur.com/U0AiqAa.png)\n\n\n* [An aerial photo of Taiwan being bombed by the Mexican Expeditionary Air Force and the USAAF](http://i.imgur.com/e3cojXG.png)\n\n\n* [Escort for the flag](http://i.imgur.com/Kf1I0M1.jpg)\n\n\n* [Many members of the 201st squadron and support crew](http://i.imgur.com/f5smC0z.jpg)\n\n\n* [\"Aztec Eagles, Squad A\" barracks in Porac Air Strip, Philippines ](http://i.imgur.com/oEsfAWH.jpg)\n\n\n* [US MajGen Henry confirmation of Mexican bombings](http://i.imgur.com/kbUfUpc.jpg)\n\n\n\nThey come from my great-uncle, who did serve in the 201st squadron. I am just a distant nephew, and my uncle's family treasures all these memories, not just as memento, but also because they, and my family (my father served with them in a special forces group) still serve to this day with a lot of pride and honor, and with this legacy in mind.\n\n\nYou'd be healthily skeptic to doubt me in light of all the drug trafficking, corruption and violence levels in the country, even within the military; but boy, would I be fucking damned if I let anyone slip every Mexican soldier under that umbrella.\n\n\n\nThe stories I have access to, of my family and theirs, when faced right in front of life and death decisions; to sell their country, to betray their fellow soldiers. They've chosen death every single time and have come out of it with their honor intact. Some paid it direly, some walked off with demotions and other unavoidable consequences. There's a rumor that even the organized crime has come to respect that.\n\n\nThe reason why I'm daring to share these without my uncle's consent (and THAT is something I do NOT take lightly) is in the hope of shedding light over a couple of easily forgotten facts:\n\n\nMexico has a very proud history of standing up to oppression, domestic and international, and they've paid for it with their finest men, in the front line.\n\nYou can call out a LOT of Mexicans, for being corrupt, greedy, violent, and so on. But, this country will be damned to hell the day it goes down without the bravest and most honorable having their say. We get frequently dissed for having obsolete weapons due to US regulations in place (not because we want to), and mocked for entertaining one of the most absurd, cynical and corrupt governments of the world.\n\n\n\nBut just as every other power has done in the past, you'd test your luck the day you try to vanquish us all, because THEN you'll have to deal with the real Mexicans: those who carry on their shoulders both shame and glory of their co-nationals without fanfare, every day, and which do not necessarily belong in the army.\n\n\nIt could be a military family with pride and honor, it could be a teacher that has dealt with troubled youth without even getting paid for decades, a mother with three jobs supporting her children while suffering some disease ailments of her own, an artist that ventures head first into the international scene without a shred of fear, an athlete that works till their last drop of sweat in less than ideal conditions and sometimes without any help, a student that travels many kilometers for many hours every day to aspire for a better life. Those are the ones you never hear about. True bravery is being able to do without witness what anyone would be willing to do before the whole world.\n\n\nSure, we're all amigo and tacos... until you get on our bad side. So please, let's get along and cherish our blessings. Do come join us to our slice of paradise with beautiful beaches, jungles, desert. Let's dance to the advent of the 6th sun like our Nahua ancestors did and let's eat the wonderful dishes with exotic spices we've been blessed with... after all, a lot of good men have died for us to be able to do so.\n\n\n\nLet's all work out our domestic and international differences in an ordered and well-intentioned way; we will take a lot of flak and get back on our feet many times, but you can trust that we will see it through as long as we keep our freedom and peace... lest the aztec eagle feast on somebody's heart once again, even if it's our own.\n\n", "gilded": 1, "score": 124, "created": 1423878193.0},{"body": "Thanks for sharing these.
