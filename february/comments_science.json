CRISPR provides a basic bacterial \"immune\" system by incorporating genetic information from previously encountered phages and using that information to produce templates that will allow special proteins to recognize that viral sequence and destroy it. We can take advantage of this process.\n\n\n&gt;Since 2013, the CRISPR/Cas system has been used for gene editing (adding, disrupting or changing the sequence of specific genes) and gene regulation in species throughout the tree of life.[7] By delivering the Cas9 protein and appropriate guide RNAs into a cell, the organism's genome can be cut at any desired location.\n\n&gt;It may be possible to use CRISPR to build RNA-guided gene drives capable of altering the genomes of entire populations.[8]  \n  \nand  \n  \n&gt;Editas Medicine, a $43 million startup, aims to develop treatments that employ CRISPR/Cas to make edits to single base pairs and larger stretches of DNA. Inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anemia are caused by single base pair mutations; CRISPR/Cas technology has the potential to correct these errors. The \"corrected\" gene remains in its normal location on its chromosome, which preserves the way the cell normally activates and/or inhibits its expression.[100]\n\n&gt;After harvesting blood cell precursors called hematopoietic stem cells from a patient's bone marrow, CRISPR gene surgery would correct the defective gene. Then the gene-corrected stem cells would be returned to the patient's marrow, which would then produce healthy red blood cells. Replacing 70% of the sickle cells would produce a cure.[27]\n\n&gt;Other pathologies potentially treatable by CRISPR include Huntington\u2019s disease, aging, schizophrenia and autism, not to mention modifying DNA in living embryos.[27]\n\n&gt;Improved targeting is required before CRISPR can be used in medical applications. Current guide RNAs may target sequences that differ by multiple base pairs from the intended sequence.[16]\n\n&gt;In 2014, UCSF researchers used CRISPR to create disease-free versions of induced pluripotent stem cells of beta thalassemia patients.[101]  \n  \nThis is really, really important technology.", "gilded": 0, "score": 20, "created": 1423018375.0},{"body": "Yay CRISPR!

Which means that a gene has passed from one species to another without sex. \n\nIt is frighteningly common among bacteria, who actually have specialized chunks of DNA called plasmids that they can exchange with each other. This is a very real concern when dealing with antibiotic resistant bacteria.\n\nHospitals are constantly battling bacteria that have built up resistance to different types of antibiotics. If multiple species of resistant bacteria come into contact with each other, then there's a chance that one of them will receive resistance genes from the other, resulting in a new strain that is resistant to both antibiotics.\n\nThis has occurred multiple times in hospitals around the world and now we're dealing with superbugs like Totally Drug-Resistant tuberculosis.\n\nAmong more complex organisms, HGT is much rarer but it does still happen. Most often it's caused by viruses. You probably understand the basics of how viruses work, they incorporate their DNA into the host cell's DNA. The viral DNA takes over the cell and forces it to construct more viruses to infect more cells.\n\nSometimes though, bits of host DNA gets mixed up in the new viruses. Additionally, sometimes when a virus inserts it's DNA into the host cell something goes wrong and it doesn't make new viruses. When these happen together, that's horizontal gene transfer.\n\nSome bacteria are known to cause HGT as well. [Agrobacterium tumefaciens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrobacterium_tumefaciens) is one that is very frequently used in making genetically modified plants.\n\nSome species can even preform HGT all on their own. [Bdelloid rotifers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotifer) are small organisms that commonly live in puddles. They have the ability to survive being dried out thanks to enzymes that reassemble their DNA upon rehydration. These enzymes sometimes pick up random bits and pieces of DNA from the environment. This trait has let them survive even though they lost the ability to sexually reproduce millions of years ago. By picking up random bits of DNA they're able to continue evolving even though they only reproduce asexually.\n\nAnd that's just a few examples of HGT, which is just one particular evolutionary mechanism. An even faster and more common (in plants at least) mechanism is whole genome duplication.\n\nIf you cross two plant species, one of which has 10 chromosomes and the other with 12, you'll get a hybrid offspring with 11 chromosomes. This odd number can't pair off in meiosis and so the plant is sterile.

Although gene therapy treatment is still massively lagging behind mass acceptance, due to the death of Jesse gelsinger because a mistake by researchers, and issues with leukemic development in ADA-SCID patients, this treatment is totally viable. The issue would be, first cost. The one accepted AAV drug on the market, glybera, only licensed in the EU, costs $1.6 million for a one time dose.\n\nNow, cost aside, the other issue is that HIV can use two Co-receptors for integration - ccr5 and cxcr4. Now, I've seen that ~50% off AIDS patients are ccr5 tropic, but if the virus mutated it could use the cxcr4 receptors. Blocking this receptor is more difficult since it is integral for hematopoetic stem cells. Also, this treatment only targets circulating virus, but latently infected cells, such as hematopoetic stem cells that aren't cycling wouldn't produce the virus and you would still have long-lived cells in your body.

Here, they used a (non-HIV) viral vector to get the monkeys' bodies to start making a specific protein (the eCD4-Ig). IOW that protein was not a natural immune response - it was put there with intent. Once the animals were producing the protein, the researchers attempted to infect ('challenged') the animals with live HIV virus (a variant anyways) to see if the eCD4-Ig developed by their immune systems prevented infection. And it did!\n\nThe next logical question I suppose would be, why don't we start doing this with all people immediately? It's not really my area but essentially gene therapy which is very tricky.

Why ? because HIV is also a self replicant virus that uses our own defensive cells as a benchwork to replicate itself and then blowing it up to dissmeniate its newly created HIV cells. SO in the end, what kills you and actually turns into AIDS it the fact that HIV has destroyed too many of your defensive cells.

I really think, like most things, anti-western approaches to cancer treatment come from an ignorance of what the disease actually is. People think that cancer is some unnatural result of our modern world (which in some cases, and some ways, is true). But cancer has existed as long as there has been biological organisms. Cancer is an extremely *natural* disease. It is our own body, our own cells essentially getting bad instructions or confused signals and thus grow in ways that damage the functional and important parts of our body through inflammation or the blockage of important functions. It is a change of the cell types, and thus losing their proper function. Everybody gets cancer all the time, it's just that our body is prepared (999 times out of a 1000) to catch it and deal with it without our knowing or intervention. It's just that sometimes, in some people, with some bad luck things get out of hand... and the cancer grows too powerfully to be stopped by the body's immune system alone. The cancerous cells break off and get into the bloodstream or lymph stream and spread to the rest of the body (metastasis, stage 4 cancers) and spread all over the body to grow in places they shouldn't, further causing countless problems until we die.\n\nUnderstanding all this allows one to fully understand how and why we western doctors use the drugs/chemo/radiation therapies we use. Antibiotics have little side effects because they can specifically target things in bacteria that do not even exist in the human body, because we are evolutionarily so different. But cancers are our OWN cells... so how can you design a drug to kill a cancer cell that doesn't kill the rest of our good cells? That's the challenge of the oncologist, and all the pharmaceutical researchers who spend their entire careers trying to come up with better and more specific treatments. And you know what? They've been incredibly successful in the last half a century. Drugs *are* becoming more specific, more targeted to individual cancer types. We're a long way from having side-effect-free cancer treatments (and honestly, that's probably never a possibility given the nature of the disease), but we've made great strides. Cancers that used to kill 80-90% of people who got them, are being caught earlier with good screening in high-risk populations and are being treated successfully. There are many cancers that used to be a death sentence that are not routinely stopped in their tracks. Unfortunately, again, we still have a long way to go, but the future is bright. Medical research needs more funding. And not just the big names like breast cancer, but also prostate cancer and stomach cancer, etc. It *all* deserves funding and smart, passionate people who can creatively come up with new ways to tackle these problems. \n\nWhat it *doesn't* need is more ignorance, more disdain for the medical professionals who spend decades studying these things to save people's lives who don't *have* to study any of it in order to receive the benefits of such hard work. We don't need more naturopaths, or acupuncturists, or chiropractors claiming that chemo is \"all bad, unnatural poisons\", or that they have any kind of treatment that is effective. What are their methods? They don't study shit about cancer, except for traditional quackery not backed by any significant research.

Well, we have had a solid model describing the first part of that statement for a while: one cell acquires several mutations that allow it to rapidly divide when it shouldn't, resist cell death when it shouldn't, and other other sneaky things that ultimately leads to tumor formation.  All of the cells that make up the tumor therefore should be \"clones\" of the original bad guy (though this isn't the whole story, for the sake of simplicity I'll leave it at that).  \n\nSo, conventional therapy involves targeting specific elements of these clones. The most commonly targeted aspect is rapid cell division. But there are many problems with this strategy.  For our purposes, the main problem is that these tumors come back, even if treatment appeared to kill all the clones.  So someone had the bright idea that maybe there was another population of cells in the tumor that wasn't rapidly dividing but could still make a whole tumor in the short time span that we see relapses in these patients.  \n\nBut that's a paradox: how can a population of cells that is too small to detect form millions of tumor cells without rapidly dividing? Well, the only thing we know that can do that is a stem cell, which divides asymmetrically.  This means that every time a stem cell divides, it produces one cell identical to itself, and one daughter cell that is different that can go on to eventually become a totally different cell or several totally different cells.  This solves our paradox, as the stem cell does not divide rapidly but the daughter cells can.\n\nThe proof for this phenomenon is actually fairly strong.  If we take a solid tumor and pick out the stem cells, these cells can form tumors when injected into a mouse.  In fact, sometimes only 5-10 of these cells are required to form the tumor.  On the other hand, if we take all the cells that are not stem cells and inject them into a mouse, tumors will not form even if we injected 100,000 of these non stem cells.\n\nMake sense?\n\nFull disclosure: I am not a csc guy nor do I fully buy this theory.  The truth, I think, lies somewhere in between the two models I described. Also, Cancer is super general term so what may be true for cancer A may not be true for cancer B.

When we say that this or that virus can cause cancer we're pointing in the right direction. A virus can normally be destroyed by our immune system using oxygen - first there is detection of the antigen, then the pathogen is surrounded by neutrophils as though it were being eaten by a blob. There is a Russian doll sort of action that comes next - the neutrophil engulfs the invader with hypochlorous acid which in turn releases nascent oxygen, which blows the virus to smithereens by tearing it apart at the electron level. \n\nThis shows why oxygen is death to a cancer cell. If a cell pulls in oxygen as fuel, any indwelling virus will be destroyed and the cell will return to it's normal schedule.\n\nDoing pretty much opposite of what this study suggest is actually a proven therapy.  If you either have brand new mitochondria forming, or if you restore the existing mitochondria to a normal state, a compromised cell will stop using glucose as fuel. Any internal pathogen will then die and the cell will basically return to normal - dying if it was supposed to have died.

As a parent of a child with a severe allergy, nothing pisses us off more than someone who puts the blame on the parent because I'm willing to bet that the vast majority of us would give our lives if it meant our kids wouldn't have the allergy (a sentiment that goes beyond allergies as most parents would give their lives up if it meant that their children would be better for it).\n\nEmotions aside, for your question of \"why now\" there are different theories. One is the way the US processes nuts. I cannot find the link but it was along the lines of how we process our nuts (e.g., dry roasting). This doesn't make a lot of sense since the peanut protein still exists regardless of the roasting process (doesn't get hot enough to breakdown the protein). There is a difference in  peanut oil, cold press isn't safe but heat processed is safe because the heat is so high it breaks down the protein that is dangerous. Another theory is the way we treat crops, what is added to the soil, pesticides, genetically modifying, etc. To me this line of theories seems more plausible.\n\nFrom what I've read nothing has been pin pointed as to why it appears more now compared to 30yrs ago. Speaking anecdotally, there were no peanut allergies in my school. That doesn't mean they weren't there. As a kid I really only cared about myself and friends. Schools also didn't talk about allergies all that much. A kid with a severe allergy was probably more likely to be homeschooled as epipens and such weren't publically available until the 80's and you can bet they were expensive as all hell.

There's even \"17-4 PH\" precipitation hardened stainless steel.  \n\nAll alloys have trade-offs (if one were strictly better we'd just use that for everything).  Titanium alloy is light and very strong, but expensive.  Aluminum alloys are even lighter but less strong (strength/weight not necessarily as good), and are still more expensive than steels, albeit cheaper than titanium.  The cheapest possible steel is heavy and not particularly strong, but is easy to work with and is \"good enough\" for many applications (e.g. buildings).  More expensive steels are still heavy but can be incredibly strong.  \n\nThis new development appears to be an attempt to keep the fairly low cost of steel alloys while reducing the overall density through a high aluminum content and simultaneously increasing the strength, resulting in desirable strength/weight ratios.  The high aluminum content means they have a *lot* of the hard, brittle intermetallic particles, so they had to do some fancy processing trickery to ensure they stayed as well-dispersed tiny particles instead of joining up into great big crunchy brittle areas.  In the article, they not only successfully kept the metal from becoming brittle, but it has much higher toughness (energy absorbed during plastic deformation before ultimate failure) than the titanium alloy they tested it against.  \n\nWhether this takes off will probably depend on whether they can scale up their production method well.  If you can only make it in small batches, I suspect it will end up as yet another more-expensive-but-sometimes-worthwhile high specific strength alloy, but if you can make tons and tons of it they might be onto something very interesting.  Ease of manufacturing is also important- welding is a very popular manufacturing technique, but it can be a pain in the ass on something like this, since letting the metal melt and re-solidify ruins all the careful processing effort you put in to get the microstructure just right.

Also, the precipitate hardening is done during heat-treatment of the cold-rolled steel.\n\n\nSteelmaker here: so we currently use aluminium (or silicon) in steel to kill (deoxidise) the liquid when pouring it out from the furnace; it's the best deoxidant around and we add up to 0.1% by weight. We also use it for grain refinement (making the microscopic metal crystals smaller) by adding up to 0.03wt%; again, we can use vanadium+nitrogen, niobium/colombium or titanium to achieve the same effect but aluminium is the best grain refiner, or 'microalloy'.\n\nWhen we roll microalloyed steel (e.g with V &amp; N), we heat-soak it first to ensure that the V and N are fully dissolved, or 'in solution' in the austenite phase (this is the type of crystal structure that steel takes above ~700\u00baC), we roll at this temperature, where the microalloying ensures the grains don't grow so big as they recrystallize between passes, and then we ensure that the final rolled product is put onto the cooling bed above the solution temperature, where the microalloying limits grain growth, but also forms a fine dispersion of precipitates when the steel cools below the V+N solution temperature. This 'Precipitation hardening' is what the researchers are saying they've done with aluminium.\n\nThe thing is, we already use aluminium to precipitate-harden stainless steel and, as above, precipitate-hardening with other microalloys is well-known. I reckon the key bit of research is determining the role of nickel (which is a common alloy in stainless) and applying it to non-stainless steels, and the solution temperatures for rolling.\n\nAnd finally, a nitpick: stainless and weathering steels are the only steels with oxide coatings.

Below the yield point, the material will spring back to its original shape and size if you let go.  Above the yield point, they will spring back a bit, but will still have permanent deformation.  This is not time- or cycle-dependent.  It can happen the first time you use the material, or the millionth time.  A more ductile material will deform more after yielding before it cracks or snaps.  A less ductile (more brittle) material may not even yield at all - it will just snap.\n\nFatigue is cycle-dependent.  It's when you stress something below the yield point (no permanent deformation/bending) so many times that microscopic cracks begin forming, causing below-yield failure.  The number of cycles to failure is measured in powers of ten: \"low-cycle\" fatigue is like 10^4 cycles, while materials with higher endurance can go to like 10^9 cycles.  Fatigue is usually plotted on an [S-N Curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:S-N_curves.PNG).  The y-axis is stress level, the x-axis is the number of cycles at that stress level.  If you go above the line, the material fails.\n\nWhen people talk about a material being good in fatigue, what they usually mean is that the material has an [endurance limit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_limit).  This is what you see with the blue steel curve in the example S-N curve in the picture above.  Notice how below a certain stress level, it flattens out?  That's the endurance limit.  If you don't load it above that stress level, there is no fatigue failure.  You could cycle load on/off that material for the entire lifetime of the planet, and it wouldn't fail in fatigue.\n\nSteel and titanium both have an endurance limit.  Aluminum does not - it continues sloping downward no matter the stress level.  This is why maintenance of aircraft fuselages is such a big deal - they go through thousands and thousands of pressurization/depressurization cycles, so they are a real fatigue risk.  \n\nSo your question, reworded, is rather apt: steel has an endurance limit, but aluminum doesn't, so does a steel-aluminum alloy have one?  The article doesn't say.  But \"strength after bending\" isn't the same as fatigue.  Steel, titanium, and aluminum all actually get stronger after bending.

Patient derived stem cell therapies are still a ways off for a number of reasons:  \n  \n*  Patient derived stem cells require reprogramming of adult stem cells (iPSC). Currently the best way to do this is to introduce factors through using viral transmission (adenoviral etc). This obviously brings some major concerns with viral integration into the patients DNA. \n*  Embryonic stem cells are considered the gold standard and while iPSC are improving everyday, reprogramming and differentiation efficiencies are still not ideal.\n*  Treatment requires a fair few cells depending on the injury. For example, a heart attack can cause a loss of 1 billion cells upwards (irrc). In vitro you can produce not nearly enough (~6 million per 96 well plate from my experience) and scale up is another major issue.\n\nThese are just some of the main issues. It should vary depending on the disease/injury but does show incredible promise. Some benefits are treatment of currently untreatable conditions, lack of rejection (with patient derived iPSC) and regenerative applications (skin grafts, bone repair etc).

Especially for an MCL tear, you're trying to repair a ligament which is connective tissue, not cells. So cells simply couldn't be used to repopulate or mend the tear. The best you can do is flood the area with growth factors and hope the body will heal itself faster.\n\nAnother \"stem cell\" treatment you might have heard about recently is Jadeveon Clowney, who will have microfracture knee surgery to repair some stuff. It involves stem cells, but through a brutal method. You fracture the bone to release stem cells which can (hopefully) heal and growth factor stuff, like mentioned above. Even that is hit or miss though. You're really just relying on the body to heal itself through growth factors, which is why the outcome is so random. It has maybe ruined as many athletes as it's helped.\n\nIn general though, I encourage people to be extremely skeptical of \"stem cell\" therapies. Most people are fumbling about with biotechnology that we don't really understand. Note: In all the discussed examples, even this study, the details suggests we don't really understand what we're doing. We have some tool, we apply the tool, and then good things happen. That's still really the bulk of our knowledge though. It sometimes works, we have little idea why, and cover that fact up. Because $$$. Refining these tools has been incredibly challenging and has caused us to confront really complicated questions of biology for which there are no clear answers. Researchers are promising the moon and the prominent ones are having money shoveled at them. There are billions and billions to be made. Conflicts of interest abound. High-profile researchers are getting caught red-handed pushing out fraudulent data. Which is exactly what you'd expect in this kind of environment.

Stem cells are enormously important to the advancement of medicine however, even if they are not directly used as a therapeutic device.  The reason I say this is that despite many years and many billions of dollars, stem cell technology has not produced the results it was expected to back in the early nineties.  This does not mean it is not worth pursuing, it means that many of the benefits we will get from this research will be slightly different than what we expected.  \n\nWhen people think of stem cells, they typically imagine injecting these cells into an injured area of the body with limited regenerative potential.  The stem cells grow, and the injured tissue is healed.  This would be nice, and may be possible in some situations, but there are many logistical obstacles that first need to be overcome.  These obstacles include, but are not limited to cell sourcing, delivery, and maintenance.  I can go into more details about this if you are interested but I'm trying to make a larger point here.  My point is that in the interum between now and when this type of therapy is commonly available, we will likely benefit more from the knowledge of developmental and cell-signaling pathways described within these research papers than from actual clinical application.  Additionally, we may be able to use stem cells to treat damaged tissue even if the stem cells themselves are not localizing and growing in the targeted region.  This could be due to the ability of stem cells to signal surrounding cells to maintain an environment suitable for regeneration, thereby activating local dormant cells with growth potential.  \n   \nLet's say that there is a commonly available therapy using stem cells:  in this case there are many benefits of using your own cells.  Avoidance of rejection is the main benefit, but there would also be no need for embryonic stem cells and potential ethical disputes.  The (largely religious) outrage surrounding embryonic stem cells certainly set the field back many years due to financial and cell line restrictions.  But as much as I hate to admit it, something good has come out of our need to side-step ethical concerns.  \n\nThis brings me back to your original comment about having cells collected and cultured for use in your own body.  Limitations on embryonic cell lines prompted researchers to develop methods of reverting differentiated cells such as fibroblasts back into stem cells (induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSC\u2019s).  While these cells are indeed pluripotent, they do seem do retain some of the epigenetic markers of differentiated cells, but researchers have made progress in returning these cells to a \u201cna\u00efve\u201d state.  \n\nStill, one of the biggest problems with using stem cells as therapy is that these cells, in addition to being pluripotent, are characterized by their capacity for indefinite self-renewal.  This means that even we can properly target viable stem cells for therapy, there is always the concern of tumorigenic potential.  In fact, the way we have tested cells for pluripotency even since the 1960\u2019s is by analyzing their potential to form tumors consisting of cells from each of the germ layers. \n\nSorry for the long post.  I know it sounds mostly negative but that is because I did not have time to write all of the positive outcomes and advancements that have resulted from stem cell research.  The bottom line is this:  stem cells research has great potential and has already produced many valuable discoveries, but stem cell use in everyday treatments is still a ways off due to the issues described above.  But yes, this is the way forward.

However, a question I tend to see asked a lot that the news article did not cover is the source of the stem cells.  These are human embryonic stem cells that they started with, before they differentiated them into neural progenitor cells.\n\nAlright, I finished going over the paper, and am posting a summary.  I expect I'll be including a decent number of their histology pictures, because whoever they had doing it took some beautiful pictures.  I'll try to have a short, simple explanation at the end of each of my longer paragraphs. \n\nDisclaimer: I am a first year grad student with a primary focus on biomaterials.  While I pretty much understood what they did (I think), it is quite possible I will make a mistake in what I say.  If you see any mistakes, let me know and I'll correct them.\n\nSo basically, this study focused on showing that they can treat the loss of oligodendrocytes in the brain due to radiation.  Oligodendrocytes are the cells that produce the myelin sheath around nerves, which is more or less equivalent to the rubber insulation around power lines.  The first thing they had to show was that they can actually replicate this loss in their animal model.  To do this, they took a batch of rats and subjected them to radiation.  They found a decrease of about ~25% of a protein that indicates myelin, and this decrease was present throughout the entire brain.  They took histology slides, seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/bunrCGd.png).  This slide shows the rat brain that had not been irradiated (Control) and the one that had been irradiated(XRT).  Dapi, the blue color, is a stain that stains all cell nuclei.  O4, the red color, indicates the presence of oligodendrocytes.  You can see how there is much less red in the irradiated rat brain.  Finally, they did behavioral testing and showed that the rats and showed that irradiated rats shopwed a decline in novel object prefrence and object location tasks (which show cognitive and memory properties), as well as a decrease in their time spent on a rotarod wheel (manual dexterity test).  In short, they showed that they can reproduce the cognitive decline and loss of oligodendrocytes in a rat model.\n\n\nThe next step was to cultivate their oligodendrocyte progenitor cells(OPCs).  OPCs are a bit of a pain to grow because they take a very long time to mature.  In this case, they started with human embryonic stem cells, and it took between 70 and 100 days of culturing before they had their OPCs. I'm going to basically skip the methods here, because if you really care about the details of how they cultivated the OPCs you are probably better qualified than I am to understand it. Suffice to say, they cultured OPCs using both their ESC line, and another ESC line plus 2 other induced pluripotent stem cell lines (derived from adults), and all of these produced OPCs.  This means that they were able to successfully and reliably grow OPCs.  They also confirmed they were able to induce the myelination of axons in vitro with their cells.\n\n\nNext, they took 10 immunocompromised nude rats (because putting human derived cells into rats with immune systems is a problem), and irradiated them. 4 weeks after irradiation, they injected the oligodendrocytes into the corpus callosum of the test rats, with 1 million cells per rat.  There were also control groups that either did not receive irradiation, or received injections of an inert solution instead of oligodendrocytes.  They then performed behavioral testing on all of the rats, testing for novel object prefrence, object location tasks, and rotarod testing.  Both the grafted and the control irradiated rats showed poor performance initially. The results after 10 weeks can be seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/WObVuwc.png).  Basically, the grafted rats improved to basically normal levels for the cognition tasks.  They did not show any improvement for the dexterity task.   In short, they successfully implanted the oligodendrocytes in the rats and produced improvements in the behavioral tests for cognition and memory, but not in the test for motor control and coordination.\n\nNext, they sacrificed the rats and examined their brains.  They found that there was significant evidence that the human derived oligodendrocytes survived and spread throughout the brain.  You can see some of that [here]( http://i.imgur.com/LIxktDU.png).  What this shows is the location of human derived cells (in red).  They used a marker for the human derived cells to identify them.  The brain slices show the location they found the cells in, and the histology slides show details of the corresponding area.  You can see substantial numbers of human derived cells (red) around the other cells present (all types of cells had nucleus stained blue).  They also performed tests on the human cells they found which confirmed that the majority of them were oligodendrocytes.  To show that the human oligodendrocytes were contributing to mylenation, they took samples of [nerves]( http://i.imgur.com/4PR5d5v.png).  The green is myelination, the red is human cells, and the blue is all cells.  You can see there is much more myelin in the graft rats versus the control, and you can see human derived cells are present throughout it.  In short, they showed that human oligodendrocytes spread through the brain and helped myelinate the nerves.\n\n\nThey also showed the proportion of neurons sheathed in myelin increased in the graft rats.  62% of the neurons were myelinated in the control group, 27% in the irradiated untreated group, and 53% in the graft group.  They did not see any change in the total number of axons between the groups (so it's not just that unmyelinated axons died off in the graft groups).  They performed electron microscopy on axons and their myelin sheaths, which can be seen [here]( http://i.imgur.com/cU9kMxA.png).  You can see how the grafted neurons show more myelination than the nongrafted ones, and look much more similar to the control.  The scale bar in the top row is 2 \u00b5m, and in the bottom two is 500 nm.  \n\nNow, the last part of the study.  In the first group of rats, they found no human cells in the cerebellum, which controls motor coordination. Thinking that this may be why they didn't see any improvment in motor skills, they repeated the entire experiment except they injected cells into either the cerebellum alone, or both the cerebellum and the corpus callosum.  The rats with cerebellum injections did not show cognitive improvements, but did show motor control improvements.  The rats with both injection sites showed improvements in both cognitive and motor control tests. There was evidence of remyleination in the cerebellum, using basically the same techniques as they used before.\n\n**TL;DR** They took embryonic stem cells, differentiated them into oligodendrocytes, and injected them into radiation damaged rats.  The areas they were injected to showed improved myelination, and the rats performed better on tests.  More research is needed before this could be done in humans.\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 65, "created": 1423267875.0},{"body": "This study, along with many, if not all, of the studies I have read from this field use nude/athymic animals.

The problem is that pretty much all the data we have on this subject from before around 2000 was restrospectve and observational studies without sufficient neurocognitive testing and no baseline examinations. We do know that many patients with metastasized cancer (and especially brain metastases) do have neurocognitive deficits in comparison to the healthy population regardless of their treatment, and the number of confounding factors (radiation, chemo, surgery, tumor progression, paraneoplastic syndromes, comorbidities and tumor-associated symptoms such as fatigue as well as psychological factors) makes it pretty much impossible to tell how much each of these factors contribute to neurocognitive decline.\n\nThankfully, this was recognized and prospective trials that include radiotherapy to the brain (whole brain radiotherapy and/or stereotactic radiotherapy / radiosurgery) now regularly include a neurocognitive assessment including baseline examination and regular follow-up. Interestingly enough, for patients with brain metastases those trials have so far shown that tumor progression is actually the most important factor contributing to neurocognitive decline, and for patients with manifest brain metastases (and a median survival time that is unfortunately still measured in months for most patients) radiation can actually preserve and sometimes improve neurocognitive function due to the response of metastases. However - and this is where it gets interesting - it is the patients who are lucky enough to live longer due to good responses and better local and systemic therapies who are at risk for development of neurocognitive decline, and there is data indicating that such a delayed decline after whole brain radiotherapy exists, although it seems to be mostly moderate and does not affect all patients. The best data regarding this comes from the prospective trials of prophylactic whole brain radiotherapy in lung cancer, since those patients do not have manifest brain metastases at baseline and live longer. To be noted is that most of those trials did not show a significant difference in neurocognitive function between the groups, but you can definitely see a trend in some and we still need a longer follow up and more precise assessments to reliably measure this effect.\n\nI'm not trying to sweep this possibly severe side effect of radiotherapy (and especially whole brain radiotherapy) under the rug since I am a radiation oncologist myself, I just wanted to point out how complex this question is and that it is an area of active research where many questions are unanswered. I have seen patients suffering from neurocognitive deficits such as severe short term memory loss due to various reasons and it is devastating, therefore everything needs to be done to prevent and/or minimize such effects (we are currently participating in a trial that examines hippocampal avoidance in prophylactic whole brain radiotherapy for small cell lung cancer, which is hopefully able to reduce these risks further without jeopardizing treatment outcome).", "gilded": 0, "score": 2, "created": 1423318898.0},{"body": "Quick question I always assumed the damage to the brain would be minimal since majority of cells are not actively replicating.

The first is that \"malaria\" is used to describe parasitic infections caused by four species of Plasmodium (falciparum, vivax, malariae, and ovale). You can add in P. knowlesi as an emerging malarial disease, although right now it is very geographically restricted. Each species is relatively distinct and has a different evolutionary history, so developing a single vaccine is relatively complicated since it would be almost impossible to get the broad antigenic coverage necessary to protect against all species.\n\nOne way around this problem is to focus on a malaria vaccine for the most deadly species, P. falciparum (the one mentioned in this article and the one responsible for most malaria deaths worldwide). Even limiting it to this species, there are other problems, the most serious of which is that P. falciparum has a complex life cycle (mosquito-&gt;human blood-&gt;human liver-&gt;human blood-&gt;mosquito; this is simplified) and that each life cycle has different vaccine \"targets\" so that a vaccine that works well against the first blood stage may not work against the second blood stage. Additionally, since malaria replicates intracellularly (in liver cells and red blood cells), while it is living in those cells it is \"protected\" from our immune system by our own body. The need to target specific stages means that one can on the first blood stage (preventing infection/disease) or the second blood stage (preventing disease/transmission). \n\nEven after accounting for all these problems, there is a good degree of variability in antigenic expression between P. falciparum populations (e.g. Kenya is likely to have different antigens expressed than Cambodia), so finding a) a universal target b)a universal target with a conserved antigenic sequence and c) a conserved sequence which can reduce disease when targeted is an extremely challenging task.\n\nOn top of all this are more standard concerns about vaccine dosing, length of protection, and worry that vaccination can shift the transmission dynamics such that older children are affected more strongly, thereby increasing the risk of cerebral malaria and potentially lowering the \"repeat dosing\" that is thought to provide some protection in adults in highly endemic areas.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is a (very) simple explanation of a complex topic. It's not my field of expertise so I have not included some critical details.\n\nIf you're interested in more detail, here is a good summary: http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000398", "gilded": 0, "score": 267, "created": 1424417120.0},{"body": "&gt; there are other problems, the most serious of which is that P. falciparum has a complex life cycle (mosquito-&gt;human blood-&gt;human liver-&gt;human blood-&gt;mosquito; this is simplified)\n\nOne other point based on the complexity of the life cycle: parasites are really difficult to deal with in the lab, since you usually can't just grow them without their hosts.

P. vivax, which also infects humans and causes a less severe form of malaria, only grows in special \"young\" red blood cells known as reticulocytes, which are impossible to maintain in culture (thus far). \n\nOther parasites, such as Leishmania, have certain forms that can grow outside of host cells, but since the applicability of any results from these studies is limited since it might not be fully representative of what actually goes on during infection.\n\nIt's hard to accurately study parasites.

This derivation makes sense as the first vaccine was derived from cowpox (also called vaccinia) which prevented against smallpox (also called variola). The idea behind vaccination is that you expose someone to pieces of the pathogen before they are exposed, so that the body has a memory of that pathogen and can kill it before it causes you harm.
