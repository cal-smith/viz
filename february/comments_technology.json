Note: I like to keep my learnings brief, if my interest isn't sparked I don't usually travel very far down the page.  Bad things happen when you go too deep into Wiki.  Note 2: I'm also giving brief 411's of what I come across along with other stuff I'm doing, so the times here are a bit askew.\n\n- 11:00 AM - Googling \"Hardware AES decryption\" led me to Wiki's [Advanced Encryption Standard Instruction Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set) page...but it was bare, so I hopped over to the main [AES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) page; many more blue links here.  Basically, it's an addition to \"normal things CPU's do\" to include encrypt &amp; decryption of electronic data.  It supercedes/replaces Data Encryption Standard; from '77.  Fun fact: AES beat out 15 other \"competitors\" over a 5 year process to become the Federal Information Processing Standard in '01, it is also included in the/as a ISO/IEC standard.  High speed &amp; low RAM requirements were a criteria for its implementation; older CPU's could use AES at 20-60MB/s, while i3's and up have up to 700MB/s per thread.  For reference, a toaster could maybe do 128KB/s.\n\n- 11:08 AM - Let's see what [DES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard) was all about.  Developed by IBM (surprise, surprise) to protect sensitive unclassified government data, aforementioned National Bureau of Standards (NBS) chose a slightly different encryption technique (+3 buff to differential cryptanalysis, -3 debuff to bruteforce) and due to NSA's adoption, DES (or it's similar brethren, not sure) was widespread almost immediately.  What the fuck is differential cryptanalysis?\n\n- 11:14 AM - [Differential Cryptanalysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_cryptanalysis) is a specific form of study to identify hidden aspects of information systems.  Loosely akin to \"hacking\" a single-player game with Cheat Engine to find the value of your \"health bar\" (bar, not number.  A specific health number doesn't need to be \"found\", you know exactly what it is), and lock it so you never die...in a way.  \"chosen-plaintext attack\" sounds like I can hack someone with Notepad.  This looks promising.\n\n- 11:19 PM - The brief description of [Chosen-plaintext attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack) is confusing as fuck.  Basically, it applies cryptanalysis techniques to gain more information about the \"cipher\" (the 'key' to encrypted information), assuming that the victim of the \"attack\" has the partial unencrypted message, and the cipher.  Kind of like WW2 codebreakers; they were plaintext cryptanalysists, if I understand this correctly.  Brain is beginning to beg for mercy.  These big words aretoo much for me to handle; I'm gonna back up and check out this attack model page.\n\nI closed all other tabs at this point; there's no going back now\n\n- 11:24 AM - [Attack Models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_model) are basically a testing ground for cryptanalysts.  They specify how much information the cryptanalyst has access to, and they attempt to see if they can break the cipher; gaining access to the sensitive data.  I could understand this as a much more complicated form of \"bruteforce my password, it's between 8 and 10 digits long, has no 'a' in it, and has only two numbers\".  This page has a link to lead me back to Chosen-plaintext attack; I'm not making that mistake again.  Farther down is stuff about Related-key attacks and how WEP (FAMILIAR TERM!) was vulnerable to it.  Finally, something that makes sense to me.  Let's refresh ourselves on WEP, because I only know it as \"wifi password type\".\n\n*sips coffee*\n\n- 11:29 AM - A steady 5m/page.  Not fuckin' bad for all this typing &amp; wiki standards, but I'm not too into the whole \"bigass words I have to google while I read\" thing, so I've honestly just been skimming. [Wired Equivalent Privacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy) is basically the grandfather of [Wifi-Protected Access](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access) (WPA); which has knocked WEP-40 and WEP-104 (less &amp; more secure WEP connections, respectively).\n\nThis I did not know; WPA &gt; WEP.  WEP has been/is being deprecated.  'sup with WPA.\n\n- 11:36AM - WPA was developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance.  Hahahaha fuck the rest of the page, these guys sound hilarious.\n\n- 11:37 AM - The [Wi-Fi Alliance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Alliance) is a non-profit organization that promotes Wi-Fi security.  No shit.  They even have a [logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Alliance#mediaviewer/File:Wi-Fi_Alliance_Logo.svg) and everything.  They're loosely a group of companies, 3Com (sounds familiar), Nokia (UNBREAKABLE WI-FI, ANYONE??), Symbol Technologies (now Motorola).  The page also lists some big-name sponsors; Apple, Intel, Sony, LG just to name a few.  Good shit here.  The \"WiFi-Certified\" logo/certification does supposedly cost a fair bit, but it sounds like these guys are rather prestigious.  Big entry here, but this was notable: \"*A focus on user experience has shaped the overall approach of the Wi-Fi Alliance certification program: Wi-Fi Certified products have to demonstrate that they can perform well in networks with other Wi-Fi Certified products, running common applications, in situations similar to those encountered in everyday use.*\"  They basically beat the fuck out of the routers until they establish what it takes to make them \"not work\".\n\nMy coffee is finished; I must refill.  If it interests the reddits, I may document my further travels, but something tells me it's going to stay IT-relevant.  I read up on that last page for a good 20~ minutes.\n\n*edit* GOLD?!

The times will be even more askew.  Continuing from the Wi-Fi Alliance:\n\n- 1:07 PM - [Interoperability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability) was a term I came across a few times...it's exactly as it sounds: a loose term for the ability of making features, devices, corporations or groups of people work together - inter-operate.  Like you guys urging me to further my IT knowledge; we're Interoperating.  Like a well-oiled machine, my friend.  This can get gruesomely specific, let's break it down (I'm sorry if this looks dumb, I don't know how to make Reddit syntax look pretty):\n\nSyntactic interoperability - If two or more systems can community, they Syntactically Interoperate.  If you're reading this comment, your computer has Syntacically Interoperated its packets to &amp; from Reddits server.  Congratulations!  You've successfully configured your machine to Interoperate, syntactically.  WE'RE INTEROPERATING!!! *waves hands in the air*\n\nSemantic interoperability - The automatic interpretation of data &amp; information exchanged meaningfully and accurately.  Kind of like speaking to someone with broken English; it's not \"perfect information exchange\", but it makes *enough sense* to understand.  Like when someone gives you a broken URL and you fix it, throw it in your browser and the page loads; you've employed Semantic interoperation.  Grats, brohan and/or broette.\n\nCross-domain interoperability - Interoperation of one or more people or organizations striving for a common goal.  I can only guess it's vaguely related to \"ratification\", where a group or movement is \"unofficially\" representing a given cause.  Like #KONY2012; that was some cross-domain interoperability.\n\nThere's a link to Unicode here; I've never really delved into the depths of its intricacies so this seems like a nice place to go.  I hope they're nice people.\n\n- 1:19 PM - [Unicode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) is an industry standard for consistent encoding, representation &amp; handling of text.  Exactly now Notepad only displays English-standard characters (A-Z, #'s &amp; special characters), Unicode supports funny stuff.  More than 110,000 characters, to be precise.  UTF-8 and UTF-16 (8-bit and 16-bit encoding) are the acceptable Unicode standards nowadays, which have superceded UCS-2.  UCS-2 used a 16-bit \"code unit\" (two 8-bit bytes, instead of the single 16-bit unit of UTF-16) which could not support the entire Unicode arsenal...which UTF-16 can cover by extending its ***interoperability*** to two 16-bit units (specifically 4 x 8bits) to support the additional Unicode characters.  And oh god I really hope I used interoperability correctly.  Snippet from the page: *\"In August 1988, Joe Becker published a draft proposal ... [t]he name 'Unicode' is intended to suggest a unique, unified, universal encoding\"*.\n\nNeat little tidbit of info; unique, unified, universal.  Unicode.  Bears.  Funny fact: Joe Becker speaks \"survival-level\"  Mandarin Chinese, French, German, Japanese, and Russian.  Dwight ain't got shit on that.  There's really nothing that appeals to me on this page....I hovered over \"8-bit bytes\" because it's phonetically pleasing, and it's apparently an \"octet\".  Heh.  *click*\n\n- 1:45 PM - An [Octet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_%28computing%29) is a unit of digital information consisting of 8 bits.  Your IP consists of four octets; 172.16.44.241 &lt;-- example quadro-octet.  Yes I just made that word up.  Snippet: *The term is often used when the term byte might be ambiguous, as historically there was no standard definition for the size of the byte.* Bytes have historically had no definition?! HOLD MY BITS, I'M GOIN' IN\n\n- 1:48 PM - A [Byte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte) is a unit of digital information etc etc we've been over this...that \"*most commonly consists* of eight bits\".  Whoa hold up, most commonly?  I thought 8 bits were **required** for it to technically be a Byte.  Interest sparked.  Apparently the de-facto standard of a Byte is 8 bits, because it's conveniently a power of 2 (computer's magical number).  One Octet unit specifically denotes a sequence of 8 bits; whereas [I'm guessing] a Byte can hold *up to* 8 bits.  So....this is kind of like having an 8-sheet folder; having 5 sheets in it is still technically a folder, but if you fill that folder, it is technically correct to call it a Binder.  I hope that makes sense to you lol.  A Byte is a Byte, as long as it has at least 2 bits in it...otherwise it's just a Bit :p.  I think I'm paraphrasing here.  Byte was officially coined by Werner Bucholz during early design for the IBM Stretch.  It is intentionally \"misspelled\" from *bite* to avoid any confusion from typos regarding \"bit\".  Fun fact here: the development of 8-bit processors popularized the 8-bit storage size, and the predecessor of the Intel 8086 (x86; aka Windows 32-bit), the Intel 8008 was one of the last microprocessors that could perform small-number operations...as I understand it.  I'm 40%~ sure that could possibly might probably be incorrect; but I'm not slowing down this knowledge train.\n\nBrief pee &amp; coffee break.  Link to \"Data Hierarchy\"; sounds interesting.  Let's see who's the King and who's the Peasant.\n\n- 2:10 PM The [Data Hierarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_hierarchy) is basically each \"level\" of information.  A \"Database\" holds *all* the informations! --&gt; A \"File\" holds a collection of specific informations (a table of names &amp; addresses, per se), --&gt; a \"Record\" could be one line from the File; John Doe @ 123 Fake Str, --&gt; a \"Field\" would be John Doe, --&gt; \"Byte\" 0100 1010, the UTF-8 value for \"J\", --&gt; \"Bit\", the initial 0 value in the Byte value for aforementioned \"J\".  This is making way too much sense to me so clearly I must be confused.

For starters WebRTC leaks the private network IPs (your LAN address of this computer) and the IP of the VPN adapter. However only on Windows does it also expose the ISPs IP address. Mac and Linux do not leak your ISPs IP. AFAIK the reasoning for this is the way the route table works in Windows. If you modify the route table to route 100% everything through the VPN then WebRTC can no longer detect the ISPs IP. \n\nAs far as disabling WebRTC goes it's a new feature and only some browsers support it. I don't think devs will ever fix it as from my understanding being able to determine the IP is one of the features of WebRTC necessary to make Web apps reliant on its other features work. The issue of it exposes ISPs IP isn't in the browser, it's in Windows. In Firefox it is very easy to disable WebRTC you can just go in about:config, in Chrome there was an addon to block WebRTC however it was quickly leaned that was easy to circumvent and so it's no longer effective and devs haven't updated it. As it stands Chrome for desktop you can not disable WebRTC. You can disable WebRTC in Chrome for Android using Chrome flags, the reasoning for this is on Android WebRTC isn't considered stable to chrome let's you disable it. Should be noted though that on Android it never exposes the ISPs IP to start with. \n\nThe most effective way to block WebRTC is to take it up a set and make it so that your computer has no knowledge what so ever of your real IP.

Now by using a VPN you create an encrypted tunnel to a remote server to funnel all your Internet traffic. So previously connecting to a website meant You &gt; Server. Using a VPN it goes You &gt; VPN &gt; Server. Now because it's encrypted your ISP can only tell that you are connecting to that VPN server, the bandwidth used, and that it is a VPN (if they even take notice). The ISP can no longer tell what websites you visit and what activity you are up to. So it strips the ISPs capability of monitoring you. Now also when you visit a website that website doesn't see your IP it sees that of your VPN. So now you can make any website think you are on the other end of the world and a website can no longer trace activity back to your approximate physical location as you have fooled them. You can do things like getting  around content restrictions this way as well. \n\nEdit: By being encrypted and the ISP not able to tell what info you are sending they also can't treat certain info different from others. This means no throttling. If your ISP for example says all traffic is fast except for Netlfix, we want that to lag.

The first is to provide clarity for advertising and technology companies in the face of ever changing advancements and technological capabilities while the second, and less publicized, is their focus on creating guidelines and rules of how personal data is used.\n\nThe second reason is what's important here as the industry as a whole, has pretty much embraced this form of self regulation to prevent government interference in a multi-billion dollar industry. That multi-billion dollar industry will also continue grow exponentially over the coming years. One example is that online advertising expenditure will surpass that of television advertising (approximately $75-85 billion per year) within the next two years.\n\nWhat AT&amp;T has announced here is that instead of offering (free) opt-outs from behavioral and contextual targeting, or what the IAB has been pushing since the days of Myspace, they are giving a giant middle finger to not just those in my industry, but also the Feds who are looking for any reason to bring the hammer down. \n\nIn fact, Verizon was sued just last week for their use of data for targeting users who had deleted their cookies or opted-out of advanced IP tracking ([here's a link, click it!](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/243540/verizon-turn-sued-over-tracking-technology.html#)) What AT&amp;T is proposing would potentially allow the same type of targeting.\n\nThis is why I'm going to go as far as saying that what the FCC proposed for net neutrality does not do enough, nor does it address what broadband providers are currently capable of, not to mention what they will eventually be able to do. Telecommunication companies need to be reeled in and classified as utilities to prevent your AT&amp;T's and Verizon's of the world from mining personal data for commercial gain without offering free opt-out capabilities and also keeping the web as it is.\n\nWhether you choose to believe it or not, Google and Facebook have led the charge when it comes to protecting your personal information and data online. Say what you will when it comes to the reasoning behind this (public pressure vs. self regulation), but at least these companies offer you the ability to opt-out of online data mining for targeting online.", "gilded": 0, "score": 47, "created": 1424286875.0},{"body": "Years from now it will come out that they were still collecting data from people who payed to opt out.

Years of battle with GM by other plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers had turned up several devastating documents. The key was a 1973 memo written by GM engineer Edward Ivey. It seemingly put a price tag on each human life lost in a fuel-fed fire. The Ivey report estimated that \u201cfatalities related to accidents with fuel-fed fires are costing General Motors $2.40 per automobile in current operation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Ivey memo had been known by some lawyers for years,\u201d said Mr. Panish.

It was also a time when the public internet did not even exist, so his stint with the cable industry was all about television.\n\nYes, later he was head of the main wireless trade group. That started at a time when cell phones were just starting to move from expensive, rare items that would get people to stare at you in awe and wonder when you used one in public to expensive, but reasonably prevalent items. He was in that position up through the point where cell phones started to become ordinary, and cellular internet was just starting to get to the point where it was useful.\n\nOne of his main roles in that job was representing the industry in front of the FCC, and it was his suggestions, proposals, and feedback that played a big role in shaping the Title II framework that was used to regulate wireless voice. That has been a huge success both from a consumer point of view and an industry point of view.\n\nBetween and after the above two jobs, he's done a variety of things. Some had nothing to do with telecom (he started an aerospace component repair company, did venture capital stuff, has been on boards of things like PBS and the Kennedy Center). Some had plenty to do with telecom...including an attempt to start a high speed information service that failed because he could not get the cable companies to let him have access. In other words, he had a business of his fail **because there was a lack of net neutrality**.\n\nHe also managed somewhere in there to write a book a history book called [Mr. Lincoln's T-Mails: How Abraham Lincoln Used the Telegraph to Win the Civil War](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Lincolns-T-Mails-Abraham-Telegraph/dp/B003GAN40O).\n\nIt's pretty clear that at heart Wheeler is a telecom policy nerd. Both times that he has taken jobs as industry representatives (the cable job and the wireless job) have been at times when those industries have been at their formative stages, where they had great potential to provide much good for consumers and society, and under his tenure in those positions those industries in fact moved them well along that path.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of guy you want to appoint to regulatory agencies. A nerd in the relevant field. Experience with the industry being regulated. A track record of making things better for both the industry and the consumer when he lead the industry trade groups.\n\nI've never understood why people think that there is something suspicious about regulators coming from the regulated industry. Where else would they come from? If we are searching for a new head for the FAA, for example, we want someone with intimate knowledge of aviation law and policy and the aviation industry. Are we supposed to try to find a farmer, or a doctor, or a sales manager who just happens to have aviation law and policy as his passionate hobby and has become an expert in it?", "gilded": 2, "score": 900, "created": 1424974796.0},{"body": "&gt;  A nerd in the relevant field.

I don't use Time Warner or Comcast, but I do use an ISP provider from where I live (Canada). What you must understand is that the cable companies have huge capital costs to lay down the infrastructure for cable internet. In other words, these companies paid a huge cost upfront, many years ago, and are recouping their investment over time. So in any given year, the cash \"profit margin\" will look really high... But what you're not accounting for, and what the article makes absolutely no mention of, is the depreciation and amortization of the fixed costs (i.e. spreading out the large infrastructure cost over 20+ years). Yes most of you are right in saying that it doesn't cost them much to provide internet service... but it's also not cheap to dig up roads and lay down miles and miles of cable.   \nNow with all of that said, I realize that TW and their ilk are still monopolies in many markets that they operate. So their profit margins are probably still \"too high\"... But not as high as you might think. If you actually take a look at Time Warner's financial statements, the ones that include D&amp;A (Google finance should have this, look up their stock ticker TWX and click on financials in the left side) their profit margin is only about 10% in the long term.  \nFor those of you calling for regulation of the profit margin, believe it or not, that's already being done. Cable is a natural monopoly and the government knows this - it's already one of their top priorities to ensure a fair price. If you try to limit it any further, then no corporation in their right mind would want to put up the billions of dollars to build these things, because they would lose money on it plain and simple. Then, instead of having only one ISP in your area, you simply won't have internet service AT ALL.   \nDon't get me wrong, I'm not defending the big cable companies. I think their attitudes to customer service are deplorable, and they are lax about it because of the monopolistic structure of the market. In order to fix that, you either need competition, or regulation. But not because the prices are egregious, because when it comes down to it, the regulating body has already done a fairly good job of managing that. I think there needs to be \"quality control\" regulation, so to speak. But that in itself is not an easy task. So no, I don't like cable companies.

To put things in perspective, Apple Computer had just introduced the Macintosh and \"Ghostbusters\" was the hit of the year when Wheeler left his post as the head of NCTA.\n\n&gt;\"He is no more a former lobbyist than I am a former high school student,\" said Reed Hunt, a fellow Democrat who served as FCC chairman from 1993 to 1997.\n\nand\n\n&gt;In 1984, the then-38-year-old Wheeler took over NABU Network, which offered specially designed home computers that could access news, games and other applications through the cable television network. The National Museum of Science and Technology later described the network as the \"Internet -- 10 years ahead of its time.\" A few blocks from NABU's Alexandria, Va., office, 27-year-old Steve Case was working on a similar project that tapped into the telephone network, which Wheeler derided as inferior.\n\n&gt;\"We used to look down our noses at them because they were so slow,\" Wheeler recalled in a half- hour-long interview last month.\n\n&gt;But it was Case's company, America Online, that became an Internet titan during the dot-com boom. NABU folded in 1985. The difference between the two approaches? Wheeler's company relied on a closed network.\n\n&gt;\"Steve [Case] could build a national footprint immediately, and we had to go from cable operator to cable operator to ask permission to get on the network,\" said Wheeler. \"That is exactly the situation that entrepreneurs face today.
