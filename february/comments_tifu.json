Apparently about 10% of people can't smell the additive to some degree, and apparently it's genetic. When I was in high school, a malfunctioning gas line prompted our entire neighborhood to be evacuated by the fire department - and I couldn't smell a thing.\n\nYears later my husband came home to our then-apartment, which was filled with gas, and I was sitting there oblivious. I saw an ENT and he said a lot of people just can't smell it. The husband was a chemist at the time so we had fun tracking down which compounds did what. I can barely smell skunks and I don't smell livestock much, but I previously thought it was occupational olfactory fatigue. In all other areas except mercaptans, I'm practically a bloodhound. And unfortunately I can tell when he's had Chipotle for lunch.\n\nEver since my inability to detect a gas leak was confirmed, we've been religious about having multiple natural gas detectors.", "gilded": 0, "score": 58, "created": 1423894625.0},{"body": "~~Carbon monoxide sinks~~, so a detector should be low/closer to the ground.\n\nEDIT: i was mistaken!

So if you do decide to do it again, trust her, go back and get it done and stay on a schedule. Your hair grows in cycles so when you go back 1) the roots won't be as deep an 2) it'll be less hair. If you stay on this schedule it won't be as time consuming or as painful. Getting brazillians or brozillians is definitely painful, but it does get slightly better. \n\n\nShe's a  licensed professional, and it is her job to do the service you have requested ( which involves a lot of up close and personal time) the absolute best she can while making you as comfortable as possible. She may have never had anyone cum from it before, but trust me. She's seen some shit both literally and figuratively if she's done this any length of time at all. So, it's ok. \n\n\n The \" light slapping\" is actually applying pressure to the area with recently removed  hair. The pressure helps with the pain of yanking that shit out.  The oil applied afterwards is to both clean up any left over wax plus helps soothe the area. You have to apply pressure during this in some spots if there is wax, so honestly it probably was the best part of think experience for the twig n berries. \n\n\nShe HAS to move your penis out of the way for multiple reasons. 1) you don't want your dick stuck in wax to your leg or fupa. Ow. 2) you HAVE to pull the skin taught before removing the wax every single time. Especially in this area because of the delicate skin and folds and wrinkles. If you don't pull everything as flat and tight as possible you run the risk of tearing or lifting, and this, my friends, kills the penis. Not really, just a nice visit to the ER.\n\n\nLastly, it is very VERY common for men to have wood during this service. Not because it feels wonderful, obviously, but because the moving around, nerves, blood pumping, nice warm wax. Sometimes this actually helps the process because of the whole pulling your skin tight bit of the waxing experience.  \n\n\nSo, you're not going to go to jail because of a natural and normal bodily reaction. You would go to jail if you were verbally harassing her and stroking your member while she was doing this service. Bit of a difference.  Having that area completely bare is probably one of the most amazing feelings during sex, but even more so during oral. Definitely do 69 now if that is in your comfort zone. \n\n\nI've had them done and done them for years.
