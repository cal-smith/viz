If all else fails, if you at least have another PC, a smartphone, or a tablet with internet access, then you can certainly find a newbie-proof guide on YouTube and/or find solutions to any problems you might run into.  \n - Go to your manufacturer's support page, enter your laptop's model number, and download *at minimum* your laptop's wifi driver.  As long as you have internet access you can install any other required drivers later, and Windows Update will probably do most of them on its own.  Put the wifi driver on an empty thumb drive and set it aside.  Don't use the thumb drive for the next step.  \n - Go [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery) to legally download an official Windows disc image directly from Microsoft.  Get the same version of Windows as your computer came pre-installed with.\n - Your laptop likely came with a tool to create recovery media.  This will allow you to create a set of discs or a thumb drive which can reinstall Windows exactly as it came from the factory.  It's a **very good idea** to do this, always.\n - Your hard drive likely has multiple partitions, one that's very small (~100 MB), one that's very large (many gigabytes), and one that's relatively small (2-20 gigabytes).  The biggest and smallest ones are safe to delete while installing Windows.  The medium-sized one (if it exists) is a recovery partition and should be left intact in case you need it later.  *Always* leave it intact, it's not worth getting a tiny bit of extra hard drive space in exchange for an emergency backup.  \n - Starting with Windows 8, PCs come with a serial number that's permanently pre-installed into your computer and you shouldn't need to enter a serial number or jump through hoops to activate while installation.  \n - Windows takes *forever* to install and finish updating, Windows 8 in particular.  You won't be using the laptop during the day you reinstall.  Most of the setup is unattended, meaning you hit \"okay\" and leave it to do its thing, then come back and hit \"okay\" again... repeat.  One important thing though, always install ALL the available Windows updates before installing a service pack (\"Windows 7 SP1\") or starting the free Windows 8.1 upgrade.  The three times I've been unfortunate enough to bear witness to attempting to install a service pack or the 8.1 update prior to all the regular Windows updates being installed, it got half-way through the update process (hours) and then decided it couldn't update and needed to revert all the changes it'd made (more hours), then once I'd installed all the regular updates I had to install 8.1 again (hours)...", "gilded": 0, "score": 17, "created": 1424367901.0},{"body": "&gt; Update: Mozilla Firefox does not appear to be affected by the SSL man-in-the-middle issue, because it maintains its own certificate store.\n\n**[Edit]**\n\nAs /u/elliotanderson mentioned, some people have reported that superfish tries to install its certs in Firefox store.

It's written by a Human Rights Watch official who represents some victims of the 1994 attack.\n\nHe describes these problems with the Iran/Kirshner hypothesis:\n\n* Former secretary general of Interpol, Ronald K. Noble. says no revocation requests were made for arrest warrants against Iranian suspects, and that Nisman wasn't telling the truth (whether intentionally or not).\n\n* Carlos Menem is of Syrian descent, and was a friend of Assad.\n\n* After the bombing, \"Yitzhak Rabin, sent a personal envoy to Argentina just hours after the 1994 attack to agree on a common interpretation of events\" - blaming Iran. This was apparently to get Syria off the hook, because Syria was supporting Rabin's Oslo accords, way more important than the bombing, and accusing Syria would torpedo them.  This doesn't mean, naturally, that they *knew* it was Syria, and not Iran.  Just that it was inconvenient to accuse Syria.\n\n* A deal for Iranian crude is allegedly unlikely because its sulfur content makes it unsuitable for Argentinian refineries.  (This one is a big shaky).\n\nThe whole thing is a mess.    This hypothesis - that some members of the Old Guard want to keep the Iran angle going (and get rid of Kirchner) instead of re-opening the Syria angle - isn't so nutty.\n\nA *big* question is why did Nisman say in 90 different places that there were attempts to rescind the arrest warrants, when the Interpol guy in charge of the warrants said this simply wasn't true.

In engineering, you pretty much HAVE to have an industrial partner already or it's difficult to even get any government (Canada) grant money.\n\nRight now scientists are being told to find outside (i.e. non-government) funding, but then getting criticized that the people funding them have their own interests and thus increase possible (but not necessarily actual) bias. No shit. When funding isn't tied to deliverables then scientists are criticized for not having performance incentives. When the funding IS tied to deliverables then the scientists get accused of \"creating the results they want\". When scientists are funded by governments they're not contributing to economic prosperity and draining the budget. When funded by corporations their results are \"all biased and can't be trusted\". There's no winning here.\n\nMost people don't get into science for money. If they did, then they're an idiot, because the money isn't there. As such, the funding source probably wouldn't directly determine the \"honesty\" of the results. That is, the results reported are probably accurate given the methodology used. However, funding does definitely determine research direction, and even possibly the methods used. When you push people to get industry funding, you can be sure that the things researched are going to be those of interest to the industry in question.\n\nWhile I'm (extremely) bothered by the fact that the ethical guidelines weren't followed and funding source was left unreported (that's pretty bad, actually), these papers apparently passed peer review.

All models are wrong, it doesn't matter if it's a climate model, an investment model, or a simple pulley and string model. Models take complicated problems and try to simplify them into quantifiable sets to make predictions. Due to the variables ignored, these predictions are never perfectly correct. As far as I understand, the current oversimplification with climate models is due to the lack of processing power. All climate models average large areas together to treat them as homogenous cells. With current petaflop machines these cells need to be very large due to time and budget considerations. I've heard some people say we'll need to get to exaflop before the cell sizes get small enough for their artifacts to be minimal. Another issue is the unknown-unknowns. How much energy is being adsorbed into oceans? How much is in ice-water phase shifts? How much is in increased wind speeds? How much is in nematode migration?\n\nSo, are the models to be ignored because they don't perfectly match measured trends? Should they be ignored because they might not have every variable in them? If all models are wrong why do scientists, financiers, businessmen, mathematicians, artists use them? The answer is simple. Models don't answer questions, they point in the right direction. They minimize risk. For climate we know how CO2, CH4, and water vapor interact with various wavelengths of radiation. We know that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and oceans has been rising as a direct result of human activity. We know there is an apparent correlation between CO2 and temperature in paleoclimatic proxies. And the models point in the same direction as reality. \n\nA good parallel is oil exploration. We're drilling holes in the ocean floor deeper than 35,000 feet based on limited data-sets. The information we use has either very poor coverage or very poor resolution. Since we're missing huge amounts of information, our models have huge flaws in them. These holes cost hundreds of millions to over a billion dollars to drill and all too often we don't find what we're looking for. Since our models don't always hit 100% accuracy should we just go home? So should we stop drilling for oil or should we use our models as guides to minimize risk?\n\nYou can pull apart any model to show it has flaws. They are flawed by definition. The question is if they are too flawed to be of use. I'll leave with saying I wish oil exploration models were as accurate as climate models.\n\ntl;dr.

I do however work in compliance at  a large US bank that I can promise every US citizen has heard of.\n\nFor starters, a little bit about how anti-money laundering regulation (AML) works. AML law in the US is controlled by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and has been updated and changed over the years by various acts such as the US PATRIOT Act. A number of government agencies are involved in the rulemaking process of the BSA including but not limited to the Treasury, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN),  and The Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC). The OCC is the organization that actually conducts examinations of financial institutions and determines the adequacy of the institution's AML policies, controls, and procedures to detect and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. \n\nNow here's the key to all of this. **Banks are not required to detect and prevent all money laundering and terrorist financing, they are *only required to have reasonable controls* to detect and prevent money laundering.** Initially this might seem shocking to many of you but it's actually the appropriate way to enforce AML law. As much as banks do to prevent money laundering, there are people out there who spend their lives trying to find ways to get around banks' controls. Trust me, I have seen some absolutely crazy stuff. To provide an analogy, even though there are cops crime still occurs and crimes go unsolved because expecting all crimes to be detected and prevented is impossible. \n\nSo to go back to the OCC examining the adequacy of a bank's policies, procedures, and controls to prevent money laundering, if the OCC determines the controls to be inadequate they will issue a \"Matters Requiring Attention\" or MRA. MRA's are like getting a C on a paper and a chance to re-write it for a better grade. They don't mean the bank intentionally aided in laundering money or funding terrorists, just that they lacked appropriate controls. MRA's are rather commonly issued. Now to go back to the paper analogy the OCC meets with the bank and together they agree on a reasonable date by which the MRA should be addressed by the bank. 99% of the banks out their will accept the MRAs and correct it. I've worked at a number of banks and never once seen an MRA resulting from intentional gaps in AML controls. \n\nAs an aside, this is the point where banks like JP Morgan Chase and Citi have gone wrong. They did not intentionally aid in money laundering or terrorist financing. They did have significant gaps in AML controls and rather than comply with the MRA decided to fight the OCC on it thinking the legal battle would cost less than the cost of implementing the controls. They lost and not only had to implement the controls but spent billions on legal fees and fines too.\n\nSo at this point everything I have discussed can not lead to criminal charges and jail time. So at what point then do individuals actually have to face the threat of jail time? Willful violations of the BSA can result in up to $250,000 in fines and or 5 years of jail time. If a pattern of willful violations exists it can result in up to $500,000 in fines and or 10 years of jail time. **A willful violation is not a gap in controls**, like what JP Morgan Chase and Citi had. A willful violation is the structuring of transactions to avoid AML reporting requirements.\n\nBased off of the alleged activities, a pattern of aiding clients in laundering money and funding terrorism, HSBC has committed a willful violation and individuals who knew of the violation would be subject to BSA penalties if the allegations are true (which they seem like they are, but hey innocent until proven guilty in a court of law).\n\nEverything I have said here is irrelevant though. This is because the crime was not committed by a US bank or a US subsidiary of a foreign bank and the BSA only applies to those two groups. However, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an international organization that sets AML standards. Most developed countries have implemented laws to meet those standards and those laws are similar to the BSA.

Notably, Naji discusses the value of provoking military responses from superpowers in order to recruit and train guerilla fighters and to create martyrs. Naji suggests that a long-lasting strategy of attrition will reveal fundamental weaknesses in the ability of superpowers to defeat committed jihadists.[6]\n\n&gt;Management of Savagery argues that carrying out a campaign of constant violent attacks in Muslim states will eventually exhaust their ability and will to enforce their authority, and that as the writ of the state withers away, chaos\u2014or \"savagery\"\u2014will ensue. Jihadists can take advantage of this savagery to win popular support, or at least acquiescence, by implementing security, providing social services, and imposing Sharia. As these territories increase, they can become the nucleus of a new caliphate.[2][6] Naji nominated Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, North Africa, Nigeria and Pakistan as potential targets, due to their geography, weak military presence in remote areas, existing jihadist presence, and easy accessibility of weapons.[7]\n\nEDIT: Since this comment is climbing, I want to take the opportunity to let everyone know that Karl Malone got a 13 year old pregnant when he was 20.
