This is a **big deal**, and not just because it is adware.

It is installing a "certificate" which is what your computer uses to tell what websites, software and drivers to trust and what not to trust.

That would be bad just by itself, but they hid the private part of the encryption key inside the software and as of about an hour ago, anyone that knows what they are doing is able to find it.

What does that mean?

* Bad people can "sign" malware with this certificate, making the computer think that the virus you just downloaded is totally legitimate
* Bad people can forge SSL certificates for websites (already happening to [Bank of America](https://twitter.com/fugueish/status/568253665095450625)),  letting them to spy on your every move. You might see a lock at the top of your browser, but it's a bad guy on the other end and not your bank.

If you get a security warning, you are safe. If you don't, you have Superfish on your computer and need to remove it immediately.

**Edit:** Thanks for the gold :) A Dutch researcher already has cracked the adware ssl certificates, so theoretically he can listen to people while they do online banking and other supposedly "secure" things on the internet.

&gt; Hey @lenovo I'm enjoying the #SuperFish private key! Look at me ma' I'm a CA! http://pastebin.com/CFsqPgfq   The encryption password for the private key was "komodia", the name of the company that made the software.

Just google the first line and you'll see more info. hunter2 Obsecurity wins the day again  Chrome told me "Your connection is not private. Attackers might be trying to steal your information from canibesuperphished.com (for example, passwords, messages, or credit cards)." But allowed me to continue to the website if I forced it to. Am I safe? Here is how to fix it on a windows. This is all the linked website says. 

start&gt;type in certmgr.msc into search bar &gt; launch the program (it's certificate manager for windows) &gt; open trust root certification authority &gt; click on certificates &gt; go down to the S section (should be alphabetical) &gt; delete Superfish inc.  The issue with this method is that it only removes it for the current user. You have to specifically add the certificate snap in for the local computer account so that you can remove this cert for all users.


* Open the MMC (Start &gt; Run &gt; mmc).
* Go to File &gt; Add / Remove Snap In
* Double Click Certificates
* Select Computer Account.
* Select Local Computer &gt; Finish
* Click OK to exit the Snap-In window.
* Click [+] next to Certificates &gt; Trusted Root Certification Authorities &gt; Certificates
* Locate and select the Superfish Certificate.
* Right Click and select Delete Is there any way to check if there are any "trusted" certificates in that list that shouldn't be there? 

For instance I have a certificate from GoDaddy and I've never even visited that website on this computer.  Nonono. That's not how trusted CAs work. GoDaddy is a huge hosting provider, if you delete their CA you won't be able to visit any websites that are signed with their CA anymore (without getting a security warning that is).

SSL / HTTPS relies on a chain of trust with the highest authorities (like GoDaddy) at the top. Thank you, that's why I asked! You're the hero /r/explainlikeimfive needs. You can buy certs from go daddy. They are considered trusted.  According to OP, yes. What this Superfish does is skip that warning, because it makes your PC think "everything is fine!". So if you get the warning, that means you don't have the Superfish. Oh thank god. That's... not quite right.  Basically Superfish screws with the certificates that your computer trusts to add it's own.  That's not good, because normally the only certificates your computer will trust are from enormous companies whose entire purpose is to create and sell these certificates.  If you don't have Superfish, you get an error like that because your computer realizes that that certificate hasn't been issued by one of those big companies (i.e. it could be some Russian kid in his basement generated it).  If you do have Superfish, when you hit that website it finds the Superfish certificate in it's list of trusted certificates and lets you on through.

Edit:  Exception:  Firefox may not be a good browser to use to test this.  Supposedly Superfish has workarounds, but Firefox maintains it's own certificate store so you may want to check using IE to be sure. Right, sorry, I was oversimplifying things to answer his question and asure hinm it was safe. Never oversimplify anything on reddit!  You have to practically write a whole god damn thesis or else someone will find some minute and pointless thing to complain about. This drives me fucking crazy about reddit.  I think most of us are capable of understanding that a comment might be a generalization or quick reference to a larger topic that if I'm interested I can find additional information.  

I'd rather see a reply like this: "there's more to this point; if interested follow this link for an in depth answer".  Exactly.  The question was basically "shit, I got this warning, does that mean I'm safe?", not "can you please restate what OP said in a more convoluted way?". And when they can't find it, they invent something to complain about. I got a security warning *and* I have superfish on my computer. maybe you have two superfishes and they cancel each other out /r/ShittyTechSupport /r/googleultron  Firefox supposedly manages its own security certificates, so it wouldn't be affected in the way that IE and Chrome are (which use Microsoft's own certificate management system). so if i got the error on chrome I'm definitely cool? If you have the superfish root cert on your system you should remove it, period. Do you use firefox? This is also quite interesting: http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/02/extracting-superfish-certificate.html  

The information towards the bottom is particularly disturbing. Holy cow.  That really makes the false cert look deliberately malicious rather than an incompetent way to insert ads.  

It's also a bit disturbing how easily he broke into the thing.  

TLDR He converted a memory dump to strings using a simple script, searched for 'private key', tried look at the cert in openssl, got a password prompt, and then used the dump as a dictionary to brute force the password in a couple seconds.   &gt; He converted a memory dump to strings using a simple script... and then used the dump as a dictionary to brute force the password in a couple seconds. 

That's very clever. But it implies that the password was in plain text which is mind boggling (leaving aside the entire MITM stuff). It wasn't quite in plain text, it was part of the compiled executable. 

I also don't know that I'd call what he did clever.  Usually reversing something nefarious or security related should be at least somewhat difficult, and this is both.  There's a reason he called it "ghetto reversing".  I can't believe that a simple search for strings in a memory dump spat out both the key and the password. Just because it's compiled into an executable binary doesn't mean it's not in plain text. The data is stored exactly the same bit for bit, it's just interpreted differently by default. Kind of like if a password is stored in plain text, but it's stored in a database, it's still stored in plain text. Copying and pasting what I wrote on another comment: 

&gt; It doesn't really matter though. Since the private key had to be decrypted on the user's computer anyway in order for the on-the-fly certificate generation and signing to be done, the key decryption password would have to be included in the code on the user's computer, meaning someone looking at the code could find it no matter if it was complex or simple.

The short key decryption password isn't really an issue. There would be just as much protection realistically if the private key was stored completely unencrypted. The password is komodia My computer seems to be save, although I am using firefox;

&gt;[]altindian 7 points an hour ago 

&gt;Update: Mozilla Firefox does not appear to be affected by the SSL man-in-the-middle issue, because it maintains its own certificate store.


&gt;[]elliotanderson 4 points an hour ago 

&gt;Some researchers that have managed to reverse engineer it have found code that suggests it has work arounds for Firefox and Opera (source)

not sure whether or not this has to do anything with it. Either way, for the people who have a Lenovo laptop as well and are affected; how would they delete Superfish ? I guess it is not simply listed under Programs and Features or is it?  Simply uninstalling Superfish doesn't remove the Superfish root CA. It needs to be manually removed from the Trust Store. If anyone here can give me a little info I could make a little tool that will remove that easily for the computer un-savvy amongst us. If anyone is worried I'll have it so you can see exactly what the guts inside do too.

Edit: For those worried I might pull a fast one here the file will be viewable in plain text in notepad so you can see exactly what it will do. I have 0 malicious intent, but being wary is always good! Who knows I could be 1337 haxx0r wearing a ski mask. Press the start button and search for certmgr.msc

When it opens up go to third-party root certification&gt;certificates

When you're in there look for Superfish, Inc. Right click it and select delete.



edit: I only read the first half of your message and thought you needed help deleting the cert. Oops Hijacking top comment to post Lenovo's statement

http://news.lenovo.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1929
 A very deceptive statement:

&gt; We have thoroughly investigated this technology and do not find any evidence to substantiate security concerns.

Either they didn't thoroughly investigate, it, or they did find that evidence and are lying about that. Everyone else has found it. Complete subversion of the https mechanism is a very serious security concern. 

&gt; The relationship with Superfish is not financially significant; our goal was to enhance the experience for users.

Also, when have users ever said "what we really want is more crapware on our computers"? It may not be 'significant' but you can bet it helped someone meet a budget target.  &gt; The relationship with Superfish is not financially significant

They also just started this a couple months ago so of course it is not  financially significant yet.  Well it'll be financially significant now (ie. hopefully people get adequately upset). I used to recommend Thinkpads to people because I've enjoyed mine (two of them), seen a lot of them live unnecessarily long times, and generally think they're well built.. 

I will no longer be buying or recommending Lenovo. I hope this statement will come back to bite them in the ~~ads~~ ass. 

Save this webpage and their statement.  ~~Should they later alter it.~~  
**Edit:** It looks like the damage control has been turned up to 11.

Compare this:

http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/lenovo-honestly-thought-youd-enjoy-that-superfish-https-spyware/

to the current text on http://news.lenovo.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1929

As /u/Matoking below me posted, they have already started to change their statement.
 They already did, I can't find that "We have thoroughly investigated this technology and do not find any evidence to substantiate security concerns." sentence on that page anymore. Thanks for this, I got s Lenovo around thanksgiving and really ought to check this out. Removal instructions? Lenovo, you were supposed to be the chosen one! Would this be a significant problem for a tax prep business that files tax returns through IE? No, they have much bigger problems to worry about. I don't know for sure but it seems like it could be, given that SSNs, names, and addresses are on them. &gt;Even though Hopkins says the company has stopped installing the software on computers, it appears thats only temporary until the company behind the software makes some tweaks to stop pop-ups.

Because, you know, pop-ups are the visual component that the adware is running. Removing the pop-ups will only make the adware that much more invisible.  [deleted] Lenovo isn't just installing some shit software on their machines and shipping them out.  They're installing a certificate that can be used to break security on websites and a proxy server to inject ads directly into pages you view. They are doing both. They made a deal with superfish, a creator of malware, to take money in exchange for shipping computers with their software installed. Part of installing that software is adding superfish's certificate to the computer's cert store. Lenovo did not issue the certificate or create the proxy. Superfish did. Lenovo took money in exchange for exposing their customers to that shit. Whether that's any better is debatable - I don't think it is - but don't mix up the facts. Well, that means that **they gave superfish the ability to operate millions of MITM attacks**, and that, hardly makes me doubt how much of a wrong thing it is. [deleted] Or [PC Decrapifier](http://www.pcdecrapifier.com/) 

EDIT: This is very common in IT circles people. I know it looks sketchy, but it'll automate your bloatware removals so you can just let it do its thing instead of sitting there and uninstalling every piece individually. I have no idea why people are downvoting you. I work in IT and we use it all the damn time.  To be fair, this isn't a tech related subreddit so assuming any tech knowledge beyond "browser lets me use the internet" isn't a great idea.

I think all the upvotes are coming from other CS and IT people lol Oman n0t good with comput3r pls to help What subreddit is this from... there's this subreddit where the CSS is all fucked up, and this is everywhere. 

Please link if you know. I believe you are thinking about /r/Ooer
 That honestly looks exactly like most of the malware I would be looking to bin with a fresh install to begin with.
Not saying it is the same. It just has *that* look. Oh, I agree. It looks sketchy as hell but it's great if you've got a new laptop. You just select all the bloatware, and it uninstalls them quickly, saving you a nice amount of needed SSD space.

I'm a CS student, and most of us programmers really don't care about how something looks when it's as simple as this. Ask around your IT circles though, this thing is great. There's one called super-anti-virus that looks like a Malaysian 5 year old made it. My old boss called me daily to soak with IT to confirm it wasn't a virus I'm a fan of SuperAntiSpyware. Soo fucking sketchy looking. That's the one. It looks like a fake Antivirus you'd have on a child's play-laptop I used this and CCleaner when I bought my Lenovo a few months ago. It had a ton of bloatware (which in all honesty I'm thankful for as it reduces the price of the laptop) and only takes about 30 minutes to clean up.  PC Decrapifier is a legit tool. How can you reinstall windows on a prepackaged machine without the original bloat ware as well? I always thought that when you wipe and reinstall it would also reinstall the bloat ware automatically. [deleted] Why would you pirate it? You can download it directly from Microsoft.

[Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery)

[Windows 8.1](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media)

[Edit]

As mentioned in my [other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2wezbk/lenovo_caught_installing_adware_on_new_computers/coqfinp), about 2 weeks ago, MS removed links to isos that work with OEM keys, so sadly this link only works for regular windows keys
 Doesn't work with my product key. I assume most large OEM's keys don't work. for win7 you use the key on the COA sticker, not the one stored in the registry.  for win8 it will read the code out of your bios. if not you can read it yourself with RWeverything.  Windows 8.1 and Windows 8 install disks use different keys. It's retarded, because 8.1 is a free upgrade. Make sure you install the one that came with the computer. I did it with a coworkers Dell laptop 2 weeks ago, but it seems that Microsoft has changed the downloads and it doesn't work with OEM anymore.

&gt; Notice: As of February 6th, 2015 the links to the various versions of Windows 7 listed below are no longer functioning, this may or may not be a temporary condition, as an alternative (as long as you have your product key) you can use the link to Microsoft's Software Recovery web page:

&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery

&gt; Note: You may receive a notice to contact the PC manufacture if you have an OEM key that came with your computer, but it can't hurt to try. ^[1](http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/digital-river-iso-downloads-not-available/c9c8f17f-17a1-4f42-b1fd-e258986f793a)

Which sucks balls. Did you download the right version that matches your key? Can't you just reformat the computer and fresh install yourself?  The problem with this Lenovo malware is not the ads but the fact that it can conduct a man-in-the-middle attack on any secure connections you attempt to make. They can spy on your banking and all your website passwords. And their storage of the same certificate, with the same private key, on every computer means that third parties can easily use this to steal your information too. Calling it adware is giving it a pass. It should be called malware and spyware. As a software developer, I think the individual developers behind Superfish should be subject to criminal prosecution. Yeah. The person that reverse engineered their software to find their private key:
http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/02/extracting-superfish-certificate.html#.VOX5Ky57RqE

Found that the software they are likely made by a company called Komodia and using their SSL Digestor product
http://www.komodia.com/wiki/index.php?title=SSL_Digestor

In the description of how it works they say straight out that it is a man in the middle attack. This screams 100 kinds of illegal. 


&gt;How does it work?

&gt;The SSL Digestor is a modified Man In The Middle attack, what it does is "talk" with the application on one side, and talking with the target server on the other, and the Redirector being the man in the middle, just as someone who gets a secret whispered in each ear, normally the browser/app would raise an alert because of the modified certificate, but the Komodia's Redirector installs a root CA certificate in advance which means the browser will not send an alert because the certificate created is legit from SSL point of view. &gt; Found that the software they are likely made by a company called Komodia

LOL, and "komodia" is the password to their private key.  These fucking guys. "Password... hmm, password. How about... guest?" Are you applying for the Head IT position at Sony? You sound more qualified than the last guy. **Archer**: Seriously, our security is atrocious. "I can't believe that worked. Our security sucks." It's perfectly legal to do all of that stuff with permission (e.g. on your own machine). It becomes illegal when you install it on other people's machines without their knowledge. It sounds like Lenovo are the ones who actually installed this software. Yeah, I think that komodia is going to get dragged into this rather interestingly, because while their technology does have legitimate uses, [they market a product specifically for adware](http://www.komodia.com/ad-injection-sdk/)

I think what they are saying here is that it has anti-anti-virus capabilities to make it hard to detect.

&gt; The SDK has anti virus capabilities and each compiled version generates a totally new version.

And who wants pesky browser distributors preventing your adware?

&gt; Browser companies (Mozilla, Google, Microsoft) limit the usage of Toolbars and browser extension.
&gt; Soon users will only be able install extensions approved by Google on Chrome.

But best of all, this technology helps you compete with other adware cartels who rely on such simplistic techniques as proxying all your traffic.

&gt; Some of the big players are using this method (and they formed a cartel so they work in collaboration) which means that on any computer that a big player is installed youll need to either fight them, or your solution would not work at all (unless you can get into this cartel, but its only if youre big enough to let you in the club).

Microsoft, Google and Mozilla all need to seriously curbstomp this software and Lenovo needs to be globally shamed, perhaps prosecuted. Superfish's core development team is in Israel, it's an Israeli company. But they have some key people in Silicon Valley too. 

 So the jews did this?

Holy shit dodgy toolbars are big fucking business. I was going to buy a set of 30 Lenovo machines at work on Monday, I will be looking for other options now. 

Edit: More information.  The machines were to be in a school, I need a class set with touch screens for some computer science projects.  

All machines are reimaged.

The reason to change my plan is I don't like what they are doing as a company, voting with my wallet.   [deleted] I wish more people did this. Voting with your wallet actually does work. A guy from my last workplace just scrapped their order of over 200 machines after this news broke. 

Bad move Lenovo.  I hope all of you are contacting Lenovo and telling them why. I'm not sure if he did or not, I'll have to ask him. I assume he would based on his personality (he's a very loud and direct person). 

It's sickening that companies would do this kind of thing.  I was about to buy a Lenovo H50 desktop in a mini-tower case.  However I read in the reviews that it doesn't have a conventional power supply, it is somehow integrated onto the motherboard, sort of like a laptop.  Since power supplies are probably the most common thing to fail on a PC (next to hard drives maybe), I don't want a PC with some sort of proprietary PSU.
 This is fucked up. I have been a loyal lenovo customer for years and often times suggest their thinkpad products. Its sad I wont be doing that anymore.  Same here :( They better not have this shit on thinkpads! it's strange that a company like Lenovo would risk doing this... Not strange or surprising to me, at least not anymore.

The once reputable CNet is now bundling adware with legit downloads. 

Sun/Java bundles crapware with java updates.

Adobe (!) by default includes Mcaffee crapware along with Flash updates

Sourceforge (!!) is now including adware with fucking *open source* downloads.

The list goes on and on. I wrote this wee userscript for my mother. This should avoid getting the adware installer on sourceforge. I've only tested it with the Filezilla download as this was were my mother got all that crap. So **no guarantee** it will always work. This is just some wee script to reduce the trouble of having to remote-access a computer that's been messed up by some adware. I am by now means a programmer.

Disadvantage is having to wait 5 seconds for the download to start as the fast download mode is only available with the bloated installer. Obviously the normal install file may still include adware by the programmer. You can recognize the adware installers through the icon. If it is a sourceforge one, it's the bloated installer (note: this is most likely the smaller file as it is basically a downloader for whatever adware and programs you select.

Tested on my computer running Windows 8.1, on Firefox with Greasemonkey 2.3, on Opera with Tampermonkey 3.11.4552 and on Chrome with Tampermonkey 3.9.202.

Code below:

    // ==UserScript==

    // @namespace   /u/groundtraveller

    var query = window.location.href.split("/download").slice(0, 1).toString().concat("/download?nowrap");  
    window.location = query; What's with this pattern? It's become increasingly difficult to avoid adware. I recently had an installer that flatout installed adware without a warning or opt-out (fuck [CBR Reader](http://www.cdisplayex.com/)).

Some of these pieces of adware have become so well known I can actually name them from personal encounters alone (like those cocksuckers at Conduit).

I now try and avoid even using official installers because of this crap. [Ninite](https://ninite.com/) is a shining example of how an installer should work (although I wish it supported more programs -- I wonder how it works on their end?). Package managers and building from source work.

I wouldn't mind a service that lets me search if an installer has bundled adware. I wonder if there'd be interest for it if I made it myself... &gt;What's with this pattern?

Simple.  The gravy train of a "free" internet has run out (along with the world economy slowly going off a cliff).  Companies are now attempting to monetize everything.  Some (Adobe, Oracle, etc.) are just greedy while others (Sourceforge, etc) are trying to survive.

It's gotten to the point where I now look to see how the producers of a free product are making money before I download it.  If they are not charging for a paid version or selling something else, I assume there is something nasty buried in the program.

 &gt; I recently had an installer that flatout installed adware without a warning or opt-out (fuck CBR Reader).

I installed that recently.  It *does* have an opt-out, but it is the most deceptive one I've ever seen.  The opt-out box is greyed out at as if you can't click it (and it stays that way even when you do).  This is combined with the other standard tactics, such as disguising it as a terms agreement. I hate that.  Many years ago I told my parents to only download stuff from cnet.  I go on there now and it's a sea of predatory adware filled crapware.. I got hit with the CNET thing when I just clicked through their installer without realising it was putting crap on my computer. My own fault in retrospect but I'd had no problems with them in the past. I had to reinstall Windows to fully remove all the crapware, most of which wasn't even unselectable in the installer. Fuck CNET. Click the tiny direct download link :)  I just make the extra effort to find the developer's official site or use Ninite. Lenovo has gone down hill, at least their business lineup, it's like they don't even care about that sector anymore and completely changed it for worse and basically screwed all their loyal customers. My w520 was the last good ThinkPad made. I just replaced my w520 with a w540 with no complaints so far. I guess the track pad is not as usable, but I use a mouse 99% of the time so that doesn't affect my use personally. We'll see how it holds up.  Not an engineering major anymore, so no more W series for me, but I have heard quite a bit of negative feedback, the W540 had a keypad, which is just a no-go in general, touchpad is awful, as mentioned, also it throttles under heavy loads (loads used in most work environments where the W is intended to be used)..  To me the number pad on a laptop is a plus, but I understand a lot of others have the opposite preference. It's a minor issue on my workstation unit because like I said I'm docked and using a keyboard/mouse most of the time. I haven't noticed any performance issues, but I haven't put it through much heavy work yet.  What is wrong with the Thinkpad X1? I've always thought it was nice laptop, and have heard from those who have owned it that it is well designed.   I have one.  I like it.   IBM sold this to a chinese company years ago. I just assumed that the machines would be compromised sooner or later and I also expected the quality to plummet.

Those IBM laptops were fucking tanks.  Fuck. I just got a Lenovo too... Even without this *enormous* clusterfuck on the part of Lenovo, it's always advisable to install a fresh copy of Windows on a new laptop.  *So much* crap comes pre-installed in new PCs now that just slows them down, hassles you to register them, or hogs storage space - apparently even on what I'd call (until today) a "good" brand like Lenovo.  Here's a site that describes where and how to **legally** download Windows installer images directly from Microsoft:

~~http://www.howtogeek.com/186775/how-to-download-windows-7-8-and-8.1-installation-media-legally/~~ Links in the article are dead, here's a fixed one: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery

Your computer should have a baked-in OEM Windows serial number in your BIOS so you won't need to enter it during Windows installation or do any sort of activation stuff.

Go to your laptop's support page to get a copy of all the drivers you'll need and put them on a USB drive for later.  There's a good chance all the drivers you'll need will be included in Windows or automatically installed by Windows Update, but be sure to **at least get at least a copy of the wifi driver** since without an internet connection obviously you won't be getting far.

If the laptop has a built-in recovery partition then you don't have anything to worry about but if it doesn't have one and didn't come with backup discs then you might be smart to create a set.  There should be a software tool pre-installed to do this, or else a process described in the laptop's manual.  If you use a USB drive for the recovery media, don't use the same one you copied your drivers to!

edit: for a bit of added insurance, you can use [this tool](http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-recover-windows-88-1-product-key-from-bios/) to see if you have a baked-in OEM serial number and see what it is.  Write it down just in case you need it.  You probably won't.  If it doesn't find one, then the serial should be somewhere on your computer.  If you have a replaceable battery, it'll probably be beneath the battery. It's worth noting that the link you provided to Microsoft's software recovery downloads does require the input of a *non-OEM* Windows product key in order to start the download. In other words, nearly all laptops (and desktops) from major manufacturers will *not* qualify to be able to download from that site.  Install Linux or Windows straight from Microsoft.  So, when I get the computer, I should make sure I have a Windows key, download a fresh copy from Windows, then use my key to install it fresh?  [Lenovo is actively and *belligerently* trying to silence reasonable discussion of the topic on their community forums.](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Security-Malware/Potentially-Unwanted-Program-Superfish-VisualDiscovery/td-p/1794457/page/2)

I could understand if people were just posting "fuck lenovo!", but how is [this post](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Security-Malware/Potentially-Unwanted-Program-Superfish-VisualDiscovery/m-p/2029319#M1777) not appropriate? Thanks for the headsup. Looks like I will never buy another Lenovo product again. The evolution of corporate *dick move* policies. Always working 24/7 to better screw over their employees as well as their customers. Superfish paid Lenavo to install this program on their machines. 

Superfish is adware and they pay a small fee per machine now, to make money form ad revenue in the long term.

Lenova probably had no idea that superfish was using these invalid certs. Good lord, if thats the case it is a terrifying lack of quality control on Lenovo's part Well, there goes my business forever. Fuck you Lenovo. Don't forget Lenovo recently bought Motorola so skip their phones while you are at it. ***They're actually defending it?***

That's one sure way to make me never buy any of their products ever. GG Lenovo. Microsoft should immediately revoke their OEM status.  MS need to talk some control of this!  What a damn stupid thing for Lenovo to do. I really like their hardware and they've made some great stuff in the past, but this completely taints their reputation to me.  Did they really think that no one was going to notice or complain about this? Lenovo is about to learn a very harsh lesson.  SOB. I just bought a Lenovo and I keep getting these ads and survey popping up on chrome...Like first thing. I didn't install anything or download expect a few chrome extensions. This is absolutely infuriating! I suggest performing a fresh install of Windows. You can use this guide: https://www.thurrott.com/uncategorized/1146/clean-pc-walkthrough-windows-8-1-ultrabook2-1 

It's a pretty decent one and links to previous articles that show you how to get a legal copy of Windows and reuse your activation key from your existing laptop. So it'll be a clean install with the same license you bought the computer with. 

Just make sure you read all of it and backup your data before doing so. SWEET! I just bought one yesterday! What a great feature! Honestly, it's always worth it to just reinstall Windows ASAP. So much useless shit comes with laptops, it's better to just start over. Plus you get to avoid this bullshit. **Article summary:**

&gt;* Superfish appears to affect Internet Explorer and Google Chrome on these Lenovo computers.

&gt;* It looks like Lenovo has been installing adware onto new consumer computers from the company that activates when taken out of the box for the first time.

&gt;* Reports of Superfish being pre-loaded on Lenovo computers have appeared on forums as early as mid-2014.

^I'm ^a ^bot, ^v2. ^This ^is ^not ^a ^replacement ^for ^reading ^the [**^original ^article**](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/02/19/lenovo-caught-installing-adware-new-computers/)^! ^Report ^problems [^here](http://reddit.com/r/bitofnewsbot)^. 

**^Learn ^how ^it ^works: [^Bit ^of ^News](http://www.bitofnews.com/about)** I was a Lenovo fan... was. No Mo Lenovo for me :( *You* were the Lenovo fan? That must have been hard work. I could hear you blow all the time. truthfully the oscillating function was the hardest part of the job.  No mo Lenovo fo yo. I don't understand why a business would do this. Lenovo your job was to make laptops... not this garbage. Lenovo can go SUCK it now. Also will never recommend a lenovo laptop again.. if anything I'll say its a POS. 

Recommended course of action: Hire a better PR firm... "temporarily stop"... no just STOP the bloatware, someone should slap whoever is in charge and fire them. Everyone should let Lenovo know that you won't be purchasing a computer from them if this isn't fixed.  Go to their website and at the far bottom right there's a contact link.

Anyone with a Lenovo laptop should follow these steps:

- [Go to this web address](https://www.canibesuperphished.com/) and check to see if you get a security warning.  
 - if you DO get a security warning, you're probably not infected  
 - if you DON'T get a security warning, you're almost certainly infected *(exception being if you've disabled security warnings like an idiot)*

- If you're infected, or even if you're not and just want your computer to run faster and have less pre-installed poop, install a fresh copy of Windows.  
 - It's always a good idea to install a fresh copy of Windows on a new PC since virtually every OEM pre-installs all kinds of borderline-malware.  You should be at least a little computer savvy to do this.  If you're infected and don't feel comfortable reinstalling Windows, you don't have many options.  If it's in the return period, return it.  If not, you might have to find a friend or family member who's more computer-savvy.  If all else fails, if you at least have another PC, a smartphone, or a tablet with internet access, then you can certainly find a newbie-proof guide on YouTube and/or find solutions to any problems you might run into.  
 - Go to your manufacturer's support page, enter your laptop's model number, and download *at minimum* your laptop's wifi driver.  As long as you have internet access you can install any other required drivers later, and Windows Update will probably do most of them on its own.  Put the wifi driver on an empty thumb drive and set it aside.  Don't use the thumb drive for the next step.  
 - Go [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery) to legally download an official Windows disc image directly from Microsoft.  Get the same version of Windows as your computer came pre-installed with.
 - Your laptop likely came with a tool to create recovery media.  This will allow you to create a set of discs or a thumb drive which can reinstall Windows exactly as it came from the factory.  It's a **very good idea** to do this, always.
 - Your hard drive likely has multiple partitions, one that's very small (~100 MB), one that's very large (many gigabytes), and one that's relatively small (2-20 gigabytes).  The biggest and smallest ones are safe to delete while installing Windows.  The medium-sized one (if it exists) is a recovery partition and should be left intact in case you need it later.  *Always* leave it intact, it's not worth getting a tiny bit of extra hard drive space in exchange for an emergency backup.  
 - Starting with Windows 8, PCs come with a serial number that's permanently pre-installed into your computer and you shouldn't need to enter a serial number or jump through hoops to activate while installation.  
 - Windows takes *forever* to install and finish updating, Windows 8 in particular.  You won't be using the laptop during the day you reinstall.  Most of the setup is unattended, meaning you hit "okay" and leave it to do its thing, then come back and hit "okay" again... repeat.  One important thing though, always install ALL the available Windows updates before installing a service pack ("Windows 7 SP1") or starting the free Windows 8.1 upgrade.  The three times I've been unfortunate enough to bear witness to attempting to install a service pack or the 8.1 update prior to all the regular Windows updates being installed, it got half-way through the update process (hours) and then decided it couldn't update and needed to revert all the changes it'd made (more hours), then once I'd installed all the regular updates I had to install 8.1 again (hours)... &gt; Update: Mozilla Firefox does not appear to be affected by the SSL man-in-the-middle issue, because it maintains its own certificate store.

**[Edit]**

As /u/elliotanderson mentioned, some people have reported that superfish tries to install its certs in Firefox store. However, I couldn't find any other source substantiating this.

However, according to this [tweet](https://twitter.com/ETFovac/status/568425380513771520), Lenovo machines come pre-installed with WindowShopper Firefox extension which installs superfish's certs in Firefox store as well. Hence, even Firefox users are affected if they have this extension installed.

Also, EFF SSL Observatory [found 44,000 superfish MITM certificates](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/further-evidence-lenovo-breaking-https-security-its-laptops), **including significant numbers of Firefox victims**

&gt; The fact that there are significant numbers of Firefox victims somewhat contradicts the speculation that Firefox is safe because it doesn't use the Windows root store. This either indicates that Superfish also injects its certificate into the Firefox root store, or that on a large number of occasions Firefox users have been clicking through certificate warnings caused by Superfish MITM attacks. Some researchers that have managed to reverse engineer it have found code that suggests it has work arounds for Firefox and Opera ([source](https://twitter.com/supersat/status/568343079268327424)) Lawsuit incoming.  This is as bad as Sony rootkit.   &gt;Hopkins defended the adware, saying that it helps users find and discover products visually and instantly analyzes images on the web and presents identical and similar product offers that may have lower prices.

Ahh, yes. Telemarketers who call my family's landline at dinnertime only want to alert me to new products audibly. I was wondering when Lenovo was going to fully embrace being a Chinese OEM. Allow me to scratch another company off of the ""people I will buy from" list.   Oh wow lucky me. I was looking at laptops 2-3 weeks ago and was deciding between a Lenovo or asus and decided for the Lenovo. They didn't have it in stock and I didn't feel like waiting (i haven't had a laptop for about a month at this point) so I decided to buy the pricier Asus. No problems and it works great too.  Any chance the Kaspersky announcement last week of a Billion dollars being stolen in a cyber attack on banks and this is related?
If they are installing a certificate that the Bank of America uses... You never know. The thing is this has come to light because the right people discovered it. The software has been in shipping computers for at least a year. The certificate itself is not related to the Bank of America specifically. It puts all HTTPS connections through a proxy. And here is how you can hack the cert [Extracting the SuperFish Certificate](http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/02/extracting-superfish-certificate.html#.VOYKJPnF9u0) ...and I just ordered a Lenovo Y50 laptop a few days ago..god help me its worth it... Before you reinstall Windows, make sure you have a windows product key. If you don't then it may be embedded in the BIOS. You can use [this tool](http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-recover-windows-88-1-product-key-from-bios/) to retrieve the key. 

You can also use a product key viewer to view the product key used on the current installation. 

Lenovo has been known not to include the product key as a sticker on their laptops anymore and will not give them out. They require you to pay to send them the hard drive so they can reinstall windows and their bloatware and this superphish thing apparently.
 AFAIK, all manufacturers now do this, I have yet to see a windows 8+ PC with a visible key I have the y500, it's amazing Just do a clean install of Windows. How about Lenovo browser guard and yoga picks? Both general malware and something that we have to remove as soon as the box is opened at the computer place I work at. Browser guard by default filters search results and is made by MOTHERFUCKING CONDUIT, proud creators of shitware like search protect. Yoga picks makes your default screen saver Lenovo advertisements. Fuck their "software" so hard.  Ever since about mid 2014 I have seen really all the new lenovos I work on to have browserguard by Lenovo installed out of the box. 

This software was created by the guys and gals behind conduit and search protect.  

Once I saw that ... I knew something was up with good old Lenovo.  Holy shit this is good timing. I literally was buying a Lenovo Chromebook this weekend. Fuck EVERYTHING about that. 

Now I have to find out if other Chromebook manufacturers have similar problems.  Lenovo has already issued a press release regarding it.

* Has now completely disabled server-side interactions between Superfish and Lenovo machines
* Stopped preloading Superfish in January
* Will not resume preloading Superfish in the future

http://news.lenovo.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1929 &gt;We have thoroughly investigated this technology and do not find any evidence to substantiate security concerns.  

_
 I'm sure that's their legal department telling them to cover their asses and not to admit any fault in case of a future lawsuit.  None of their comments address the security certificate so even if you uninstall Superfish you're still at risk.

[edit]

&gt;We have thoroughly investigated this technology and do not find any evidence to substantiate security concerns.

&gt;...

&gt; The relationship with Superfish is not financially significant; our goal was to enhance the experience for users.

I'm drowning in the enormous levels of bullshit. Work at a BestBuy, unfortunately noticed this a month or two ago. We specifically can't knock any brand, let alone the hellstorm that would come from people were we to tell them "Oh you want this Lenovo? Well you REALLY want to buy our PC Setup service 'cause this computer has Adware out of the box" So it's more of an, "Yeaaaaahh why not try this Asus over here instead?" Also noticed that webroot would pick up lenovos "browser guard" as a virus as well Because it is one. It's made by Conduit. let's all congratulate lenovo for soiling there own reputation with greed ! This is a serious Lenono 4 months ago, I was ridiculed by a number of people on reddit for posts that I had made about this topic - Lenovo IdeaPad u510, the Superfish software takes the form of "Visual Discovery".  I'd thought I'd had a virus, thought it had corrupted the recovery partition, and only realized it came installed when I exchanged for a brand-new one.

I was mocked, derided, and accused of lying about having a Master's in CS. 

Hope those individuals happen to see this.  Eat my degree and all the hard work and passion for technology that went into it, should they read this. the first thing I do with laptops I buy is format them and put a clear install on windows on it. I made a post on this a while ago on the lenovo subreddit

http://www.reddit.com/r/Lenovo/comments/2q5pz3/superfish_software_adwaremalware/

Didn't get much attention Lenovo used to be a respectable company, but now they just seem like they are getting shittier and shittier. Adware! Amateurs! They need lessons from the NSA! can atest to this. My ex got a new lenovo and holy shit it was fucked. adblock was the only thing I installed and after leaving firefox on the homepage for 3 minutes adblock stopped over 200 things.... it was fucked I will never buy Lenovo again. When fingered for using Superfish, instead of dropping it, they want a different version of the *crap* to remain on their laptops.

*Never again.* Bet they and Best buy had an agreement they put it on their and best buy charges that set up fee to get it off. Fuck, I just bought a new t440s a couple weeks ago too. Is all I have to do look for Superfish and uninstall it?  I really wish I read this a month ago. I brought a Lenova Yoga Pro 3 and straight out of the box
 connecting to the Internet I thought I had been conned with a second hand model. 


With no exaggeration, it was almost unusable with the amount of pop ups and redirects. The default search engine was a really weird one which I had never heard of and it kept trying to install stuff. 


I took about 5 hours to get it running 'normally' by installing and running MSE, MWB, CCleaner, a ton of Google searches and Adblock which I have never used before. 


It was pretty awful 1st experience with Lenova. Hey!  And suddenly I'm out of the market for a Lenovo laptop. What does this mean for companies that use basically only Lenovo stuff? If the company loads their own image on the systems, it's no big deal. If they just take them out of the box, then they probably have this on some of their systems. It depends on how long Lenovo has been doing this, and what they are doing with it.  Any reasonably sized company is going to have a volume license agreement with Microsoft and will create their own images with the software of that company's choice.

It's the smaller companies that could be getting screwed. That is a shame, my old lenevo was good to me.  That's disappointing. My last few laptops have been Lenovo and I'm usually very happy with them. I also often recommend them to friends.

Guess I will have to reconsider that. My old office manager absolutely refused to sanction the purchase of any Lenovo laptops - primarily due to 3 purchases in a row that broke down, or failed to work out of the box. For a small company that is a big deal, even though we purchased around 20 or so laptops per year. 

Suddenly I'm quite grateful to her that I'm not using a Lenovo right now. A little known fact -- you can actually get your hands on [legit Windows ISOs](http://www.howtogeek.com/186775/how-to-download-windows-7-8-and-8.1-installation-media-legally/) distributed on Microsoft's behalf by Digital River.  You still obviously need a product key (i.e. this won't help you warez windows, not even slightly), but using the officially sanctioned media means you won't get any shitware installed with your windows. Where the fuck is this world going? Why do we want to destroy each other and just profit? Animals are more human than we are. They already load them up with a ton of bloatware. Any computer you buy should be formatted right out of the box. A clean copy of an OS should then installed do not use the disks provided with the machine.  If you don't know how to do this, learn, before you do anything else with the machine. I just purchased a Lenovo G50. What can I do to make sure this isn't on my computer?  Format the disk and install from a clean source like an ISO from microsoft directly (do not torrent one), not Lenovo's restore disk/partition. 

 Do a fresh windows installation.  consider installing Ubuntu Linux.  Step 1: Purchase new laptop

Step 2: Wipe hard drive with low level format

Step 3: Install fresh copy of your favorite OS

Step 4: Enjoy Step 1.5: Download drivers for laptop Just bought a Lenovo laptop a few months ago. Can confirm. It's a good thing this problem is solved by installing a fresh copy of Windows or Linux. Actually, laptops should have an option of being sent without OS, they are always installing lots of software that you never use and then you don't really know what is installed there. I really prefer do my own Windows/Linux installation than use the one out of the box.  This isn't just adware, it's malware. It breaks SSL security by doing a local man in the middle attack and snooping on expected to be secure traffic.  "Consumers *HATE* them." That's why you never buy a Laptop with a pre-installed OS. If you did, wipe it and make a clean install. This is why you always reformat and do a clean install after buying a PC. No excuses. Yup. its easier now with windows 8 and up, since you don't have to fumble with the key Bloatware and adware is common practice for many laptop companies. It needs to stop. I smell a class action lawsuit happening.  Literally just bought a Lenovo laptop today. Fuck. Literally return it. I literally might We need an Internet bill of rights. Unfortunately our politicians work for the companies and we can't trust them to not bend us over. Adware is just a polite way of saying Malware.
 And now time to vote with my wallet - LENOVO and MOTOROLA are both on the banned list.

See ya dickheads. I know nothing about Cuba but do they have enough internet speed to stream videos ? i'm in cuba right now, at an embassy using satellite internet and let me tell you. Skype is difficult. 
it's also ILLEGAL. 
embassies are exempt but no way can the average afford netflix let alone pay for internet capable of streaming Why is Skype illegal?

Or satellite internet is illegal? i dont know why. i originally heard for "propaganda reasons"

satellite internet is illegal too. also, cubans can have internet(dial-up/dsl) in their houses but ONLY IF a foreigner signed for it

i remember they used to confiscate gps devices and cellphones at the airport. they no longer do that though American. I spent some time in cuba a few years ago. I was basically net dead for the month. The lines for the state controled computers were hours long. The net at the hotels ( which fuck them ) was like 30 dollars for 15 minutes. 

Do you get to travel and stay at Casa Particulers? Have you done the hitchhiking route? Been to the cave disco ? I loved it there and miss it dearly. I wish I could go back.  i'm a student. so i am "considered" a cuban i experience the "real cuba"

which i love but it's like going backwards in time to the 1940's

i remember my first cuban girlfriend didnt know what peanut butter was or sardines.

it's gotten MUCH MUCH better.

when i first came nobody in my class had seen a laptop before now lots of them have tablets I left flash drives with full cracked versions and how to in spanish books about using Microsoft office. I was surprised how often students asked me for them. 

The sad thing is they might have the devices but I didn't see any real use / exploring what those devices can do for them. I didn't see the education for it. But I only saw it from my point of view as a backpacker with a thumb.  But 99% of them can read! people could read before the internet I think that Gamion meant that Cuba may not have a lot of tech, but it has one of the highest literacy rates in the world. thanks for explaining that. I thought he/she was being sarcastic Cave discos? Now I really want to go back.  How do you see the two countries finally relaxing tensions affecting Cuba in the short and long run? it's long overdue. the embargo doesnt hurt the cuban government, only the cuban people. which is ironic because it's the government who benefits most if it gets lifted.

on the plus side, the government will no longer be able to blame its shortcomings on the embargo.

seriously, no matter the problem the culprit is always the embargo Skype is probably illegal because it allows people to make cheap international telephone calls. Cuba will want foreigners to use the state-owned telephone service because they'll have a monopoly on international phone service and will be able to charge a hell of a lot for it, probably in hard currency.  don't forget how easy it is to monitor state-owned telephones, don't know if microsoft will give a fuck when cuba wants some information yeah. it's called etecsa. international calls are like $10 or more a minute  The mostly get their shows and movies through pirated copies passed by usb.  or from paquetes Five years ago they took my apple but ignored my iPhone completely.  I bet his boss chewed him out screaming "Wrong Apple, you idiot!" My cousins in Holgun use Skype all the time.  I've watched them use it at their house in Nuevo Holgun to communicate with a cousin who emigrated to Canada.  Oh, and it's pronounced "Eh-Skype." What do you do there? Ama? i'm a student. in my last year of a biochemistry degree. How did you end up in the embassy as a student? Does one of your parents work there? no. my country was one of the last caribbean countries to open an embassy in cuba and our ambassador is a cool dude. last time I check (in 2009), they have a total internet speed (using an USA satellite company) of 128Mbit down and 65Mbit up for the whole country. Priorities are (supposedly) schools (including universities), hospitals and hotels. There was a fiberoptic cable from venezuela which was supposed to help on that area, but I never heard of this having a significant influence on the available bandwidth. [deleted] Relevant username? The hops went through Montreal, which led me to believe that it was a Canadian satellite company, but I heard the same thing about a fibre optic link to Venezuela being built. I bet the resorts, which are probably in a meeting right now carving up the coastline, will be the first to roll out broadband. Netflix will be positioned w first movers advantage, open up a new market, probably a drop in the bucket cost wise, so why not just do it. All those vacationers will also have access, and will love Netflix even more for being there for them. I'm Cuban. My uncle makes like 5 dollars a month, and works like an animal. There's no way that any cuban will pay $7 a month when they could barely afford food, or clothes.  Well they don't have Comcast, so that's a plus... *yet CommunistCast CommieCast That actually sounds the most harmless. Cute even. it'd be cuter without all the red flags It all makes sense now If they don't have a good internet infrastructure right now, and they're going to have one implemented soon, then I think they will have a better chance of getting top-tier internet than US.

Godspeed, Cuba. If Cuba gets Google Fiber before I do, I'll be seriously pissed. If they get it, I'm moving there.
Free healthcare, Google Fiber, Latin Chicks.  
 Kickass food and cigars, too. Following the Google's trend on giving the places that need internet the most Google Fiber, Cuba will probably get it before you. Give it a week. Comcast will find them. Now presenting **COMCASTAMUNDO!** &gt; COMCASTAMUNDO!

Goes where he pleases El Comcasto! Comcasto Gigante! Amazing to me that Cuba is getting Netflix before Australia, New Zealand or Japan. What a world.  Aus and NZ are scheduled to get it next month, though. 

Edit:typo.  Which was a long scheduled roll out I'm sure. Cuban relations with the US were literally just normalized weeks ago and BLAMO! get ur Netflix here.  It's easier to run over to the tip of Florida and fling DVDs really hard across the 90 miles than it is to throw them all the way to Australia, duh. Plus they'd come right back when sending to Australia.

Get it? It's a boomerang reference. Japan is tough to localise but Australia is surprising  It's no surprise. Foxtel is the answer. Fucking Foxtel I might just be reading  what you said wrong, but why is it hard to localize? Because you have to hire Japan's translators to translate every *show you want to offer into Japanese You could say the same for every country however I thought? I don't know where else has Netflix but I pretty much assume most euro countries and NA has it so you could just translate like those countries.  Advantages of Cuba it's they already have Spanish subs The vast bulk of Netflix's content is of American origin which is fine in Canada, Europe and south America where American film and tv is popular. For Japan Netflix would have to sign deals with Japanese distributors for Japanese content as Japanese people tend to prefer home produced content. They probably will launch in Japan eventually but it could take time.   Knowing the resourcefulness of Cubans, Netflix will sell one single account, and everyone in the country with Internet will know the password. Who's watching?

&gt; Zamira, Jessica, Luis, Daniela, Yeny, Javier, Liliana, Rolando, Mayelin, Ernesto, Tumelo, Alberto, Oumar, Issabella, Manuel, Yamy, Marco... I like your commitment to real Cuban names!

Im so happy my parents didn't follow the trend



**EDIT:** [I get it, reddit likes making the same joke over and over again](http://i.imgur.com/D9pKYBz.png) 

Since I don't have time to respond to each joke about my name please choose one of these responses:

- My Parents were on a very serious guayaba high when choosing my name

- My Parents let me name myself (Because they were on a very serious guayaba and cafecito high)

- [My name is an ancient Santeria name handed down to me by Chango himself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santer%C3%ADa)   That's what it's called "Generation Y."  I have a few cousins whose names begin with Y. No Yolanda?  I have TWO Aunts named Yolanda. Do they ever have argument?

"_This land is yo' landa_"

"_No, this land is *my* landa!_"

edit: It's been brought to my attention that this doesn't make sense. I've decided to not care. Why would they argue if they are in agreement ? But they're agreeing  You forgot Usnavy and Yotuel.

Yep. "U.S. Navy" and "Me you him". I know Yohannay (You and I) but this is the first time I hear about Yotuel, that is amazing!!   USNAVY ! You're forgetting other great ones like Yuniesky, Usnavy, Yamil, Yasmanny, Yurisleidy, and I can't think of any more.  I never thought I'd be so familiar with Cuban names, but then I started following baseball more closely. Hey, it's better than Dominican names The only Dominican guy I ever knew was named Pibay. It was like eBay with a p. Pretty rad name if you ask me What? Are you saying Yannisareli is a bad name? In Brazil you see lots of black people (for some reason white people don't do that) with broken english phrases or broken english names:

Ulintoun (it is spoken like english Wellington), Madeinusa (popular with children of cleaning ladies, seemly they think Madeinusa written in the t-shirt tags is a pretty word), Maicon (Mike, and does not sound the same because of the random n at the end), Jaquisoun (Jackson).

Or all versions of that, but wrote even wronger (Like, Wulinto, Rincoln, Linco, Lincorn, etc... Axilei, Rater) some of those are not valid in english, or portuguese.

And there are many people named after places (Neuiorqui), corporations, (Coca-Cola), and so on.

Since Brazillian law has almost no restriction on how to name people, there are lots of people running around with absolutely bizarre names.

The upside that you can have a name of your original culture (lots of japanese descendants have japanese names...) Those Cuban names sound just like Dominican names. My fucking name is Yandy. Fuck the Y generation lmao Then you get the one dick that changes it. It's like the prisoner's dilemma of 2014/15.  Javier and Juan don't know each other but both are given access to a Netflix account.  It is in their best interest as a group to keep using the account as is.  At the same time, the threat that the other user will change the password and lock them out forever is constantly looming.

*So Javier...do you continue using the account and hope that Juan is a rational actor, or do you change the password now and secure yourself for the new season of Oranges: the New Black?* &gt;Oranges: the New Black

Strictly economically and  within the context of the scenario, the rational action is to change the password.  With not changing the password, you have 50% chance of a good outcome and 50% chance of a bad outcome.  By changing the password, you have 100% chance of a good outcome.

The social consequences of making a dickish choice are not part of the prisoner's dilemma. &gt;The social consequences of making a dickish choice are not part of the prisoner's dilemma.

This always seems like a major stumbling block for game theory. The prisoner's dilemma is supposed to assume that the only payoffs and consequences are those defined in the game table. I've seen a few experiments on the prisoner's dilemma ([example](http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-prisoners-dilemma-cooperation-20130725-story.html)) but they don't seem to make any effort to incorporate social consequences into the table, meaning they aren't actually testing their theory.

Of course, measuring social consequences would be an insanely complex task, if its even possible. The social consequences are somewhat taken into account if you play an iterated version of the game: 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#The_iterated_prisoners.27_dilemma

There are many different ways to set up an iterated prisoner's dilemma where the Nash equilibrium tends toward cooperation. Plus, you can have a fun dinner party with it:

http://www.betrayersbanquet.com/ There'll probably be a friend of a cousin who can run a cable from Miami to Havana to get DirectTV.  For a few extra bucks, sure, can run another cable for more internet.  

It's going to be amazing seeing the Cubans very, very quickly get connected up.  Wonder if they will, or just go with a massive wifi/cell phone system.  Going to be fascinating to see how they deploy the tech.
 I bought a half hour of internet access at a hotel in Cuba 
It took that long for Hotmail to load  Reminds me of the 90s internet. because Hotmail When I was a kid I thought Hotmail was just for adults to use as a cyber sex platform... you're thinking of Hotmale Then it would just be Homail. and an AOL disc in the mail Everyday. For years. When? Because it greatly improved (it's still slow, but not that bad) around January 2013. Last July in varadero  Yup same experience, same place. Luckily Gmail asked me if I wanted to load a much more basic inbox because it detected a really slow load time. Keep in mind you were in a *hotel*. Hotel internet also sucks here in the US most of the time too, especially when using WiFi. Truth. I was at a Hilton family hotel in Atlanta last week. Less than 1 megabit up and down on their hotel wifi. Tethering to my phone was far faster. What caused this great improvement? Added infrastructure? Kinda, Cuba is connected trough a cable that goes to Venezuela (Chavez had an agreement with Castro, before that it was literally just dial up), as far as I know the cable did not improve but it was opened to the "public" (for some definition of "the public"), before that it was government only, so stuff like universities and the like. Cubans watch House of Cards and Walking Dead, think them to be documentaries, and immediately reinstate the embargo. I think a season of Honey boo Boo will do the trick.
 Wait, is Honey boo her first name, and Boo her second? I've never seen it capitalized that way before. It was just a nickname. A nickname of endearment, it would appear.

*Closet Honey Boo fan spotted.* They prefer to be called honeyaboos.  Like a dumbass I just Googled 'honeyaboo'.  I'm on a list now aren't I? No lists here, carry on citizen. Remember to keep your cell phone charged. Why, what were the results? Now I'm scared to google it. child beauty contestants Definitely on a list  Her name is Alana Thompson
 Her name was Roberta Paulson. Reddit generally prefers to keep perpetrators nameless. Her full-name is Honey Boo Boo Child Not necessarily. Godzilla was introduced almost a decade before the embargo. It's entirely possible it could be seen as picking up where Ishir Honda left off. Or Godfather II Walking Dead is already one of the most popular shows in Cuba. Americans act like Cuba is North Korea, it most definitely is not isolated from the rest of the world or from global popular culture. Cuba is what North Korea could have been if North Korea had not been run by paint-huffing madmen. Exactly. I went to Cuba a few years ago and one of the nights we went to a bar/club connected to a hotel. The music was mostly popular American music and the folks at the club were from the city, not all tourists from what I understand. It's ironic, our propaganda is so successful that  we all have our own warped view of a country so close to us. They have a more badass zombie movie

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOquktXvkT4 Juan of the Dead! Top zombie movie. has netflix looked at the internet the get in cuba...aint no streaming gonna happen until thats dealt with Ground floor opportunity. Especially if Google decides to turn Havana into a fiberhood in order to utterly humiliate Comcast.

&gt; 5% internet access, 1% access at speeds above 56k to 90% gigabit in under a year. Tell me again how the infrastructure investment is cost prohibitive? Of course by "they" you mean either the people spending 40% of a month's salary to use an internet cafe for an hour, or the people who've got those rare permits to own a computer.

I don't think Cuba will be showing up on the top countries for Netflix use any time soon. You would make more money in Cuba if you sold and rented VCR's.  Somewhere a former Blockbuster exec just got a hard on Well, somebody's got to use the Netflix nuclear stockpile of DVDS... you mean by "the" :( You'd be surprised. Netflix could probably bag some pretty sweet movie rights for Cuba, since nobody else has ventured into the market there yet. Pretty sure they are going to go with their original model of mailing out CDs until the Cuban Internet catches up.
 House of Cards isn't a documentary? No it's watered down, the real Washington is much worse Look, its obviously a fictional show because its also a Congress that gets shit done.

-Kevin Spacey  Despite the attribution, I still picture Frank Underwood saying that into the camera while seated in the Capitol. Veep is much more of a documentary than House of Cards. The West Wing was more of a fantasy and House of Cards is more of a dark fantasy. It didn't work so well when Romania was airing episodes of Dallas to show how decadent the USA was. ...and then it turned out that communism was just a dream. :D There is one small problem here:
No one in Cuba has Internet fast enough to allow streaming. 

In addition to this, 8 USD per month is A LOT. Most people make about 20$ per month. This is barely enough to get you decent necessities.   [Never give up, never surrender!](https://manboobz.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/galaxyquest.gif) Just in time for _House of Cards_ season 3! Oh fuck, I completely forgot that was coming up! I can't wait! I've never seen it. I wanted to wait until season 3 so I can binge. Don't want to make the same mistake like I did with Peaky Blinders and Marco Polo. The fact that there isn't more Peaky Blinders makes me so sad.  It is so damn good.. I think I might just rewatch it this month Comes out the day after my birthday. Bingeing the previous seasons would be a damn fine way to spend my birthday. Cheers Scarface will be streamed infinitely for those first few days I'm Tony Montana, a political prisoner from Cuva "You know what capitalism is? Getting fucked!" You bastard I got so excited thinking that scarface was available to stream haha its available on Canadian Netflix  I know that there is a plugin to watch US Netflix in Canada. So i would think there would be a plugin to watch Canada Netflix in the US.  Hola Unblocker, any country. Don't forget about Cuban Fever and Juan of the Dead. Netflix should be a fucking culture wonder in CIV5 cuz shit is about to get SPRUD My citizens are buying your blue jeans and watching your Netflix!  seriously, 

requires internet: each great work of art produces +1 tourism

Edit: alternatively to - production, all other civs great arts also have +1 effect on you because your citizens can watch their movies to.  -1 production per population. It's all fun and games until your rival builds The BBC and pulls the rug from under you.  NETFL

 I wish there was more spanish speakers to understand this. This is hilarious. **Article summary:**

&gt;* Streaming video service Netflix will be available to Cuban customers starting today, at the $7.99 U.S. per month rate that it offers in the U.S., the company announced today.

&gt;* Itll still require an international payment method for now, as well as Internet access (which still isnt ubiquitous in the U.S.), but its an early start that Netflix says it wanted to offer in order to have it available as Cuban Internet access expands, and debit and credit cards become more available to Cuban citizens.

&gt;* With this move, Netflix becomes one of the first U.S.-based companies to take advantage of the U.S. governments decision to relax trade restrictions that have been imposed on Cuba since the 1960s.

We are delighted to finally be able to offer Netflix to the people of Cuba, connecting them with stories they will love from all over the world, Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings said in a statement released by Netflix. Cuba has great filmmakers and a robust arts culture and one day we hope to be able to bring their work to our global audience of over 57 million members.

Part of the plan to increase trade with Cuba included provisions aimed at allowing U.S. telecommunications companies to provide better access to communication and internet services, and this appears to be a move by Netflix to participate in said introduction of services, even if at this stage the services introduction is largely symbolic.

**^Learn ^how ^it ^works: [^Bit ^of ^News](http://www.bitofnews.com/about)** WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK?

Cuba gets Netflix and in Spain we still don't?

What the fuck. I'm speechless. North Americans first sorry bro  Bros before EuroHoes In other news, Spain secedes from Europe to join North America. Been Cuba, not sure how this will work. Internet speed is horrible.  How was your time as Cuba? Hot Sooo can we get cigars now or? Seriously, what is the hold up?
 naranja es el nuevo negro

Note to all Cubans.  House of Cards is not a documentary. **Last Week**: Cubans so desperate for connectivity that they make illegal networks and punish users who connect the network to the internet because that's even more illegal/problematic.

**This Week**: Online only streaming video service expands to Cuba.

[Well that escacalated quickly.](http://i.imgur.com/9FGtjqh.png) What about fucking Europe guys? Surely you would get more profit from installing a server in Sweden and Belgium and letting all EU use it? Or just allow me to fucking view Netflix from the American servers??? Because it's never an issue of technology or servers, it's an issue of negotiating with greedy rightsholders. If even Google can't get half of youtube legalized in Germany, do you think Netflix would have better luck? this is by far the dumbest thing ever that I think is mostly pr.

I am currently in cuba and in order for me to have access to unrestricted internet that has good bandwidth I would either have to go to a politicians house or an embassy.

i am currently at an embassy because i dont know any cuban politician.

those are the only people who could benefit from this

cuban internet is otherwise VERY SLOW and SUPER EXPENSIVE.

it's weird because my native country, St Kitts, doesnt have netflix and we have high speed internet for YEARS now.

plus, the average cuban would never pay/cant afford this.
also, everything on netflix is available on "paquetes" &lt;== 1-2TB hard-drives filled weekly with movies, series, music, software, games, etc all for about $1-10 USD.

even though cubans only have about five tv channels, those with computers could just go copy a paquete and pay much much less than what netflix charges.

i repeat, only the government and ambassadors can benefit from this
 It's 100% PR, anyone who thinks otherwise probably gets their "facts" about Cuba from Michael Moore.  And I still can't get Netflix here in the middle of Europe... This is easily the most pointless expansion Netflix has made yet. They are expanding to a country with piss-poor internet coverage.

Where next, North Korea? Cuban here.

In Cuba, you would have to be crazy to buy any Netflix service. You see, there's this thing being sold in Cuba called El Paquete (the package). For $2 you get about about 1TB weekly of all the latest TV episodes, not only American but Brazilian, Colombian and so on as well, which the Cuban are particularly fond of.

Every Cuban I know inside Cuba with an Internet connection (and there are many in universities, hospitals and so on) is laughing about this, not just because there's absolutely no bandwidth for streaming videos anywhere in Cuba but also because even if there was, you would have to enforce copyright legislation in order for something such as Netflix to have a chance (as in being cheaper than the good quality pirate copies that people sell everywhere). Good luck with that.

Edit: To be more specific, the problem with enforcing copyright legislation is that the main violator is the cuban government itself who routinely passes american movies in public television without paying anything to anyone. So before any copyright agreement can be made between the two countries so that people selling "The Package" can be persecuted, the cuban government would have to agree to not infringe itself those agreements. This does not seem to be a priority in the current negotiations. I cant believe a country which was under embargo just recently gets netflix while we in india do not. Wow...  So Cuba gets Netflix after all these years of embargo but I have to use a VPN to use it in Haiti? Wtf [What a joke.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Cuba)Only around 25% of the population has access to the internet. Who is going to watch when the average salary is only $20 a month and internet access costs $4.50 an hour at government run internet cafes plus the $7.99 for Netflix. It'll cost the average person their whole monthly salary to watch one movie on Netflix. Also, add to that the fact that Cubans will need access to a foreign credit card or bank account to pay for Netflix.  agreed, this seems like more of a symbolic/PR move by Netflix. "We're making it available in Cuba!" even though we know no one at this point will really use it. Knowing Cubans, they'll probably pitch in money as a neighborhood and watch it that way. goddamn right.  Source: am cuban and do that with my cousins. That's kinda badass. As long as that actor from dexter doesn't show up pretending to be Cuban  with his terrible cubano accent  Hold on, Cuba gets Netflix before Poland and most of European Union. Seriously? I've never thought that it will be easier to legally watch good TV shows in a communist dictatorship than it is in Poland.  It's because movie studios think they can squeeze more money without Netflix. Cuba getting Netflix before Europe is a proof of that.  $7.99 U.S per month [cost 40% of the Average Cuban Salary](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/cuba-is-getting-netflix?utm_source=mbtwitter)

edit: grammar Who needs to eat when you can subsist off Bryan Cranston's theatrical magnificence? I would plea for my country (South Africa) and similar countries to get access to Netflix and Hulu, but that would be futile because our internet is so bad it shits the bed trying to play 240p Youtube videos.


There's a lot of reasons for and against pirating, but sometimes it really is the only option.


Edit: to clarify on pirating: it's possible to leave a torrent overnight or during work (a few times) and then being able to watch something whereas streaming is just impossible. Also; we don't get access to a lot of new content. Netflix is so fast it's there before the internet! This is brilliant, Netflix is trying to become a network, a media conglomerate. It's a late comer and has to deal with all the bullshit from the likes of Comcast (NBC Universal), Disney, HBO and the like.  That's why there is House of Cards and the last season of Arrested Development. They are cutting out the middle man and becoming content creators and distributors.

Granted, Cuba has a very limited access but because of the restrictions, it's wide open. Cuba may turn out to be like East Germany and develop Modern Infrastructure quickly. They are first to an untapped market.  go CUBA!!! This was my thought exacryly. It seems like with this they'll have a chance to become integral to TV markets and the internet in a way that's impossible in developed countries. Good for publicity, useless for normal Cubans  And thus productivity in Cuba ceased to exist due to everyone binge watching to catch up. 

That my friends, is how you defeat communism.  So, Cuba gets Netflix ahead of, say, Germany, Spain, and Italy (and Israel... sigh)? How does this make any sense financially? Or is it a matter of Cuba having being embargoed for so long, that all the IP rights legal mess skips over it somehow? IP is probably a breeze with cuba, you're right about that...but a lot of countries have their own bullshit getting in the way of netflix.

Regulatory bullshit, political bullshit, anticompetitive bullshit.  It's not that Netflix doesn't want to be there.  They'll make a whole lot more money off of Spain or Germany than they will in Cuba.

But here' how it probably went:

Netflix:  We'd like to do business in Cuba now.

Cuba:  Ok, sounds good, when can you start.

Netflix: Uh, we're an internet company, how about next tuesday?  Get ready for a slight peak in traffic, though....

 But Germany has Netflix since a while now. ZEIG HEIL NEIN NETFLIX I'm guessing legality or licensing is easier in Cuba than any of the other countries you've listed. I'm actually surprised it's not in those countries either. It was probably easier to get rights for content since there would be drastically less viewers compared to a first-world country like Germany/Spain/etc. Also this was probably a PR stunt more than anything for Netflix. Because hyper-regulatory governments cut both ways. Which is ironic because Cuba loves to regulate shit, it just never had any IP to create regulations for. It's probably a matter of getting a foot in the door before any political bullshit can come in and ruin any future potential. Things are bound to improve for Cuba now that the US is opening up. This would be great if Cubans actually had internet access. Your talking about a country where horse drawn carts are still a common form of transportation in small cities and towns. The only internet access I could find was $5 an hour for a shifty connection. When will they expand it to EU members countries? Not having movies readily available to me is what causes me to pirate them you know.  [deleted] I'm a consumer not a creator. And if you don't like me complaining - you can just 'git out. [deleted] Most likely cost/profit ratio of licensing a shitton of foreign movies. Plus netflix is already available in germany, UK, netherlands etc, just not where I live. Now all they need is the internet... Thanks Netflix. I'm sure Cuba will have the best Netflix library, if only there was a way to see it without going to Cuba Fidel Castro once again declares victory for the Communist way of life over Capitalism while he binge watches "Matlock".  cubans watching netflix on timed terminals in gov't run cafes getting a whopping 56k.

I predict it as a total success. Is it racist that I immediately thought of "I Love Lucy." Smells to be of strategic origin from the Council of Foreign Relations Bingo!  Now they just need internet.  and TV.   So Netflix is going to be in Cuba before it comes to Italy?!?! FML  I'll be impressed when they get PornHub. In other news, Lamborghini has opened a new dealership in Somalia.  Drafting an arrest warrant for a corrupt president takes some major balls. Specially when it was a 26 page document.
&gt;The 26-page document, which was found in the garbage at Mr. Nismans apartment, also requested the arrest of Hctor Timerman, Argentinas foreign minister.

 Oddly enough I just wrote about Timermans's father, Jacob, in my Spanish lesson today. He was a writer who was persecuted for expressing opinions against the corrupt Argentinian government between the periods of coups and "Los desaparecidos" in the 70's and 80's.  Wow, his son turned into a dick.  Sucks. alleged dick Thanks, CNN. TIFU by drafting an arrest warrant... [deleted] Why the fuck is Amazon telling me people frequently buy two book safes and a can of barbasol shaving cream?

Yeah,  kinda funny that the assassin Kirchner sent threw it in the trash,  rather than destroy it. Maybe the prosecutor had just thrown a draft in the trash, and the assassin only took a completed one? Maybe they had already attempted to serve it? Maybe the assassin switched the draft with one that has lots of mistakes and will lead to an innocent verdict? At this point, we're all just speculating out of our asses, of course. Maybe the assassin made the draft &amp; left it in the trash on purpose.  Whoa. I read that in Keanu Reeves voice and it sounded true. That assassin's name? The president of Argentina. Lawyers don't just throw documents in the trash. The article say 'at' his apartment not 'in' his apartment. I seriously wonder if he went and planted a copy in the common garbage bins, since he clearly knew Kirchner's guy was coming for him, and he probably figured the wetwork guys would search his place meticulously, but only the police would bother/be able to look in the common garbage. I'm done speculating. There's nothing more I can get from this story, except maybe some jokes with my Argentinian next door neighbour about their country's politics. Assassin's Creed VII: Paper Work. Hey he killed the guy.  It's an extra billion if you want the garbage emptied. Moral of the story? Major balls causes depression which leads to suicide. The only people who consistently survive shots to the head and live are boxers and pornstars. There was a Scottish suicide where the guy shot himself in the head twice then threw the gun away 60ft. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_gunshot_suicide

&gt; One particular case has been documented from Australia. In February 1995, a man committed suicide on parkland in Canberra, Australia. He took a pump action shotgun and shot himself in the chest. The load passed through the chest without hitting a rib, and went out the other side. He then walked fifteen meters, pulled out a pistol and shot himself in the head. After reloading the shotgun, he leaned the shotgun against his throat, and shot his throat and part of his jaw. He then reloaded a final time, walked 200 meters to a hill, sat down on the slope, held the gun against his chest with his hands and operated the trigger with his toes. This shot entered the thoracic cavity and demolished the heart, killing him.

I guess he suicided because he couldn't do anything right. "Cojones" In Agentina we say "huevos" instead of "cojones". Eggs? I only know this from breakfast foods. Pelotas, cajones, huevos, mormones - there's a lot of slang for balls.  Mormons? They always come in pairs. That's hilarious It really was clever. I'm never that clever.  Hey, nobody ever always or nevers.  That's what I tell my kids, and it stands for you, too.  You ARE that clever! Is this real? I can never tell online  You'd be surprised- much of Latin American slang insults are pretty clever.  Bolas Nicol? apology for poor english 

where were you when ugin dies  ugin is kill? 

no Ded ugin is here[SOURCE](http://magic.wizards.com/sites/mtg/files/images/wallpaper/CruxofFate_FRF_1920x1080_Wallpaper.jpg)

R.I.P. in peace

forgive me i am russia [I get that reference](http://magiccards.info/scans/en/lg/286.jpg) It's like saying how americans say balls, only gringos say cojones anyway We say it in Puerto Rico, quite often too.  Anyone from Argentina want to chime in on the local view and media coverage? The media is savoring it like a last meal. You have two sides: the newspapers against the government (who practically say or imply very heavily that Cristina killed Nisman) and the ones who agree with the government (who mentions that this is a political campaign using the dead body).

I personally believe that the timing was completely awful (two days before going to court and in a election year, even if Cristina can't run again), but to see how a few politicians practically celebrating it like Christmas is really really fucking awful. There is one candidate who mentioned that he doesn't trust the government (and of course, his will be better), but that guy got involved a few years back in a little local version of the NSA scandal, so that shows you the hypocrisy that make the rounds around here.

I also think that this comes perfect for those who really want to distract the people from the main problem (IMO): we had a bombing here in 1994 (the article mentions it) against jews. We still don't know what the fuck happened, and it's been 21 years already. People are focusing in the draft or the "suicide" itself but ignore the main event, so to speak. The families of those who died still haven't found peace and aren't any closer to get it after this (and an argument could be made that they are even farther away from the truth now).

Hope this helps. A French politician said once that the best way to cover up a scandal was to create another scandal inside the scandal.  a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma packaged as a conundrum. With a little bowl of 'the fuck is that?' dressing. Add some broth, a potato.  Baby, you got a stew goin'! Wasn't it Charles Pasqua? This man is a legend for all the wrong reasons. &gt; A French politician said once that the best way to cover up a scandal was to create another scandal inside the scandal.

"For example, if George W. Bush was quoted about ways in which to cover up scandals, he could simply re-attribute that quote to a generic "politician" working for the scandalous French."  

 A French politician So that MI6 guy should have been locked inside a room from the inside? It's pretty easy for pros to make a door look like it was locked from the inside. Spies have been able to do that since the Cold War. He wasn't locked inside a room. "  His decomposing naked remains were found in a red North Face bag, padlocked from the outside, in the bath of the main bedroom's en-suite bathroom."
(Wikipedia)

Death was ruled accidental.

 Give the guy a break, like you've never accidentally trapped yourself in a duffelbag before. It's pretty easy for suicidal MI6 guys to make a bag look like it was padlocked from the outside.
 Yeah I realize that. I wasn't implying anything about this case in particular. Just that the locking of a door is not really significant evidence either way. Excuse me. A British court ruled on that and found that absolutely nothing was suspicious about it. Judge got a Knighthood afterwards too, so clearly he was doing his job very well. Thanks for that, and some questions if you don't mind. Is someone going to pick up the draft of the warrants and continue what Nisman started? How do you see the current level of anti-semitism? Is it feasible that the Argentine Intelligence had something to do with the planning of the bombing, or are they under scrutiny for covering up information after the fact? 

And yes, it is atrocious that some politicians are 'celebrating' this, as you said. I'm reading up a bit more now, with other links from the article. 

Any Argentine newspapers you recommend? (Che, hablo Gallego!) &gt;Is someone going to pick up the draft of the warrants and continue what Nisman started? 

He worked with some other people and all his important papers are still available. That's the thing that makes me feel that this is a setup, because let's say you kill him and hide all the documents. In that case, yeah, it's shady as fuck. But in here, all the information are still available. The case is still open, people still want justice. It's weird.

&gt;How do you see the current level of anti-semitism?

Also shady as fuck, since there were always pockets here and there, but now it appeared when Nisman died (or killed himself, whatever). The truth is that I don't live close to any of the places where incidents happened, so I can't give you anything else that newspapers mention.

&gt;Is it feasible that the Argentine Intelligence had something to do with the planning of the bombing, or are they under scrutiny for covering up information after the fact?

Completely feasible. They are shady and some members are still working there since the military dictatorship. They have been involved in some cases, and the fact that Cristina decided to decommission (dunno if that's the correct word) the names of the agents involved in this case as soon as this happened, makes me think that she has some information of who the guilty people are. 

As for newspapers: Clarin, Infobae, Infonews and Diarioregistrado. Not saying they will be absolutely reliable in their info, but you might get a better picture of the whole thing if you read them and draw your own conclusion. &gt; But in here, all the information are still available.

A clear outcome is that now if Nisman's investigation turns out to be shit people will still think "hey, he was killed for that, so it must be truth". That could have a huge negative impact on CFK's image and diminish her power to appoint her successor.

 &gt; He worked with some other people and all his important papers are still available. That's the thing that makes me feel that this is a setup, because let's say you kill him and hide all the documents. In that case, yeah, it's shady as fuck. But in here, all the information are still available. The case is still open, people still want justice. It's weird.

This. How many people had heard of Nisman and his investigation before his death? He had already published the accusations and decided not to go forward with the arrest warrant (the draft was from June). For Cristina to be behind this just makes no sense. I'm an Argentine too and I mostly agree to what Ghondar said but I really don't like it when people say the terrorist attacks of the 90's were 'against the Jews'. I mean, obviouly they were targeted because of religion/politics/whatever, but first and foremost I consider it an attack against the Argentine people. They blew up two buildings right in the middle of Buenos Aires!  You wanna hear something weird? They found almost no fingerprints in the house... Not of nisman or any family member or the help, they couldnt even found fingerprints of the real owner of the gun who gave it to him very recently before the assisted suicide, the only fingerprints in the gun where nisman's I live here and it's weird, just think about it, elections are coming and literally (besides the dead guy's family) the only ones that suffer are in the current government since it's bad publicity. Adding the fact that the whole report is now public, why do it? And why right now? Like it makes 0 sense, Kirchner was the one that ask him to research this, the investigation was super public because he has been accusing the government for weeks now and the last person to saw him alive was a businessman with ties to the opposing political parties.

Usually when someone like this happens you want to ask who stands to benefit, or who isn't harmed the most. And that definitively points to someone else, because the current government wins nothing with this. I've only heard bits and pieces of this story over the last few days, but is it possible that Nisman would testify some new information to Congress that would point to someone else or connect group of important people to the coverup? Or has all the information been recorded elsewhere already? Wow, this is starting to sound like Hollywood. May the perpetrators be brought to justice.  Could easily be an episode of House of Cards  That's something that bugs me about that show, that it is meant to be shocking but this shit actually happens daily in some government around the world.  Not hating on the show, just that it's rather depressing to think about.   LA Confidential Hollywood is based on a real story.

 House of Cards: Argentina As someone who doesn't really follow politics *that* closely, I thought "Holy shit, all of a sudden the killing in House of Cards seems plausible."  /r/conspiracy has been completely ignoring this story since it first broke. I guess when you can't blame the Jews or the CIA they don't care.  Mossad this Mossad that, that subreddit is so embarrassing. There needs to be a more serious conspiracy subreddit.   This story is on the front page of /r/actualconspiracies

 Dude look at the Holocaust Denying bullshit on the front page.

They're denying Jews were systematically targeted &amp; saying gas chambers never existed, with upvoted comments basically implying that there was no real huge numbers of Jews killed, and that the entire idea of the *"Final Solution"* revolved around a *American Jew* that had nothing to do with the Nazis.

Oh, and let's not forget the *"critical thinking"* revolving around the large number of countries &amp; times Jews have been persecuted through-out history, so *clearly* Jews must have been at fault for pretty much all of that.

Oh, and below it, there's a meme implying how the Jews are to blame for most of ISIS's actions.

**THE JEWS ARE FUCKING EVERYWHERE, DOING FUCKING EVERYTHING, CONTROLLING EVERYBODY, SINCE FUCKING EVER** There was a funny joke I heard about Jews during the Holocaust once.      

A rabbi was sitting on a train reading a newspaper known to spout Nazi propaganda. A young boy asked him why he was reading that instead of a Jewish newspaper.      

"If you read a Jewish newspaper, our populations are dropping, Jews are intermarrying and forgetting their heritage and an entire nation wants us dead. If you read the Nazi papers, we own the banks, we own world governments, we own the entire press and we're close to owning the seas too. It's uplifting." Then the train arrived at Auschwitz. Well? Don't make me hold my breath here, what happened once the train arrived? They couldn't hold their breath long enough. No silly, they came up for air to the top of the swimming pool the nazis provided them. Then they went to the theatre, checked out some books at the library, and had fun at the brothel.

[I'm not making this up. They're actually making that argument over there](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2unglb/what_holocaust_revisionists_deniers_actually/co9yjp4)

My favorite comment

&gt;If it weren't during a war, I would send my kids to Auschwitz. I am that confident that this genocide smear is what it is -- a money grab and a hoax.


Said without sarcasm [deleted] They all had to participate in a big game, and the winner received a tank. &gt; Jews are intermarrying

Well, we can't have that? The Jews are so clever they even built a network of camps inside occupied territory and left behind mountains of bodies, ash, and the belongings of dead Jews, as well as thousands of dying people in order to make the conspiracy look more believable. Impressive... It's there anything they can't do?  Tip  'Cause they're missing it.  *m'norah* Would you like to know more?

/r/isrconspiracyracist All 14 million of us. Controlling the world of 7 billion. Hahaha You're leaving out the magical, shape shifting lizard Jews.  But they go to another synagogue. You're mixing two different ideas.  The illuminati (who are the shapeshifters) are not necessarily Jewish.  They are led by the Rothschild family who is, of course, Jewish, but many of the other 12 upper families (13 total) are non-jewish like the Rockefellers.  Then a very large amount of the lower ruling families (Bush, Clinton, Carnegy, etc.) are also non-jewish.  The upper ruling families are shapeshifters with reptilian DNA, though the lower ruling families merely retain some reptilian DNA.  

Good stuff.  Then again when I read this information it was from a website with a black background and neon trim, so super reliable.  You need to find a reliable source, like a six-hour Youtube video with a montage of spooky photos and muffled narration. That's where the solid info is at. Or the comment section of a Jay Z music video. You know the old expression, for every two Jews there are four reptilian tongues.  Thats no argument against - The wealth of the 85 richest people equals that of half the world's population, according to oxfam. It'd be a much more peaceful place :( I would LOVE for them to explain to me where my great-great aunts and uncles went. Same place the Sandy Hook and 9/11 victims went  The woman who played his great great aunt in the photos of the *shtetl* was also interviewed on CNN after Sandy Hook! You've cracked the case wide open.  That's probably the stormfront crowd that always leaks in other subreddits. I visited /r/stormfront last night. High quality subreddit, would recommend. I'll listen to almost any conspiracy, but Holocaust denial is insane. Anyone who doesn't think the Holocaust happened I encourage to read "Ordinary Men" by Christopher Browning. That should cover it.  Perhaps the thread is run by the Mossad, to try and implicate them in every story, because statistically they will be right every so often, but if everyone just dismisses what they say because they always claim it is Mossad then they will get away with the real stuff that is attributed to them.

At least, a friends, sisters, husbands, nephews, cousins, teachers, daughers, boyfriend knows a guy in Mossad and confirms this is true. It's on the front page there four posts from the top. That is quite simply not true? It's on there. There is a post there submitted before your comment by 2 hours. Then why is there a post about it on the front page posted 9 hours ago? [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2uo5la/draft_of_arrest_warrant_for_argentine_president/) Yeah I went to that sub for a few mins to see what it was like, literally every single conspiracy involved the jews.

Probably the most bat shit crazy sub around.

Aren't they mainly interested in the more obscure conspiracies (and theories thereof)? This one's already been blown wide open. There was never a snowball's chance in hell of covering it up.

Edit: [They do have a thread about this, actually.](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2uo5la/draft_of_arrest_warrant_for_argentine_president/) Kirchner has gotta be f'ed now, right?  Right??? Not necessarily.

Not if she has Bob Massingbird as her lawyer:


"I remember Massingbird's most famous case, the case of the bloody knife. A man was found next to a murdered body, he had the knife in his hand, thirteen witnesses that seen him stab the victim, and when the police arrived he said, "I'm glad I killed the bastard." Massingbird not only got him off, but he got him knighted in the New Year's Honours list, and the relatives of the victim had to pay to have the blood washed out of his jacket."

    Blackadder +1 Baldrick Not to mention when he got Big Butch Oscar Wilde sent to jail for being a whoopsie. With the level of corruption, we will be lucky if she gets a slap on the wrist and 20 minutes in the naughty corner. I'm guessing the cause of death was Suicide - two gunshot wounds to the back of the head with the body found in a suitcase padlocked from the outside and dumped in cement.  Clear-cut case of suicide. *Argentine prosecutor slips, falls on knife 67 times* Actually, even Kirchner has acknowledged this wasn't a suicide. Only question at this point is whodunnit. Cui bono I knew that fucker was up to no good.  He couldn't fool me with his stupid sunglasses and his philanthropic efforts.  I will admit that murdering an Argentinian prosecutor kinda came out of left field though. Her initial response made her look so guilty, though. Surely, the Argentinian justice system will deliver..   surely...   surely...  


::insert pic of skeleton waiting next to a computer:: http://i.imgur.com/W9s7kes.jpg [Did I do it right?](http://img.squakenet.com/snapshot/6372/17992-GrimFandango.jpg) http://i.imgur.com/Rw7zr.jpg Kirchner was a well known scumbag long before this. After her attempts to win populist support for attempting to annex the Falkland islands, again, it's going to be fun to know that she's catching hell.  &gt;attempting to annex the Falkland islands, again

Anyone who thinks we would seriously consider another Falklands war is a moron or a troll, or just has no idea what they're talking about and had been fed this idea by moronic media outlets trying to peddle clickbait. The war is seen as the stupidest thing we have ever done in the history of the country. It's like saying that rising nationalism in Germany means they'll annex Poland again aaaany time now. To be fair, one should never underestimate Argentina's ability for self-destruction. Nor its ability to do the same thing ten years later. I agree, no one wants another war in Argentina everyone supports a diplomatic solution. Every time Argentina is brought up on reddit everyone basically claims that we are north korea, that we are a shithole where no human rights are given and kirchner is Stalin. Things could be better sure but every country has it's issues and Argentina's situation is better than other countries in the region. I also don't get how everyone condems "dictatorships" like chavez and gaddafi's but when a real dictatorship such as the military junta (wich was endorsed by the west because of the cold war) does some stupid shit to keep the people distracted, such as the war over the islands, suddenly it's Argentina's fault and we will always be "the bad guys" &gt;and Argentina's situation is better than other countries in the region

Not so fast. Chile is superior to you in almost every way (except poverty ball).  I disagree with chiles perception of how an education system should work (excluding 90% of the students that apply) or the privatization of the health system as well as their social policies beeing in the hands of a catholic organization that would rather give fish than teach how to fish. Having said that you are right. Chile's economy is better than ours but i never said it wasn't. i never said that our situation was better than every other country in the region. Another thing to consider is that Chile has always been more in line with what the world powers demanded (adjusting, privatizing, unprotected markets, etc.), since, it's expected that those who live in such countries get sweeter versions of what's going on in Chile from the media. Argentina is kind of a unique example of a country with great potential throwing its future away through idiotic politics.

IIRC it was one of the greatest economies in the world in the early 20th century, it had and still has a very educated population, and its people keep making amazingly bad choices fueled by populism. Even to this day, after all that happened in the late 90's and early 2000's. Brazilian here. You can disagree with Chile all you want, but it is the only major country around not currently going to shit. Argentina is in deep shit, Venezuela is in even deeper shit, and we are heartily following the path to shit, also. Chile doesn't sound better off because it licks the ass of any world powers, it sounds better off because it **is** better off, and it is better off because the country has not embarked on a populist downward spiral for the past twenty years. [You reap what you sow.](http://dadaviz.com/i/3092) The Brits better watch out, this is the kind of revalation that needs a military invasion to distract attention We should give her the diplomatic gift of a glass bottom boat so she can admire her air force and navy afterwards.

Oh *SNAP.* Ok, I guess she'll want to see her submarines but they don't have any underwater plaOH NOW I GET IT! Bravo. Argentina's military is not even close to have the capabilities it had back in 1982; back them they had about 400 warplanes and a decent navy (with an aircraft carrier).  Today not even 50 warplanes and the brits have better defenses now. Brits here: Dispatching appropriate Naval Fleet to deal with Argies.

I think Argentina's had bigger scandals... Sloppy wet work The entire fucking world is one corrupt ass place and anyone who doesn't see or believe it is straight up delusional.   Wouldn't it make more sense to burn or seize said arrest warrant, than to put it inside of the garbage, where it could be easily recovered? That seems a bit odd.  Found in the trash?  Sloppy clean up work.  That's what you get for getting your assassins off Craigslist. Could of been planted.  I mean who does a professional hit like this and doesn't go after the incriminating evidence.   Leaving it on a desk with his hand still holding a pen would be too dramatic. Yep, deff a suicide... Johnson, sprinkle some crack on him and lets get out of here. guy broke in and hung up pictures of his family everywhere 
 Anyone who defends Kirchner's government is either getting a piece of the cake or a complete idiot When you try to fuck with powerful people (good or bad), you are not only messing with them, but their puppet masters and others who have a vested stake in keeping the status quo. It usually does not end well for the shit stirrer. I still wouldn't rule out the Iranians carrying out the assassination, especially since they did the initial bombing that started this whole fiasco. 

They're at a crucial point with talks with the US so they want to keep their noses looking as clean as possible, so its just a possibility but still interesting to think about  &gt; I still wouldn't rule out the Iranians carrying out the assassination, especially since they did the initial bombing that started this whole fiasco.

Their role in the initial bombing is unclear.  The US FBI agent who collaborated in the investigation said that there was no conclusive evidence.

The only thing clear is that the bomber was from Hezbollah, which cooperates with both Iran and Syria.

Here's [an interesting opinion piece in the NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/opinion/reining-in-argentinas-spymasters.html?_r=0).  It's written by a Human Rights Watch official who represents some victims of the 1994 attack.

He describes these problems with the Iran/Kirshner hypothesis:

* Former secretary general of Interpol, Ronald K. Noble. says no revocation requests were made for arrest warrants against Iranian suspects, and that Nisman wasn't telling the truth (whether intentionally or not).

* Carlos Menem is of Syrian descent, and was a friend of Assad.

* After the bombing, "Yitzhak Rabin, sent a personal envoy to Argentina just hours after the 1994 attack to agree on a common interpretation of events" - blaming Iran. This was apparently to get Syria off the hook, because Syria was supporting Rabin's Oslo accords, way more important than the bombing, and accusing Syria would torpedo them.  This doesn't mean, naturally, that they *knew* it was Syria, and not Iran.  Just that it was inconvenient to accuse Syria.

* A deal for Iranian crude is allegedly unlikely because its sulfur content makes it unsuitable for Argentinian refineries.  (This one is a big shaky).

The whole thing is a mess.    This hypothesis - that some members of the Old Guard want to keep the Iran angle going (and get rid of Kirchner) instead of re-opening the Syria angle - isn't so nutty.

A *big* question is why did Nisman say in 90 different places that there were attempts to rescind the arrest warrants, when the Interpol guy in charge of the warrants said this simply wasn't true.  This tells me that some of his information was deeply flawed, or that Interpol is lying.

None of this implies that Iran good, Syria bad, Kirchner good, or whatever.  I think people are politicizing this based on their pre-existing prejudices. I don't understand why this isn't being covered more? Why are there are no mass protests? There have been mass protests in Argentina over this. Here's a refresher article to give this one more perspective. 

http://m.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/01/Argentine-President-Cristina-Fernandez-de-Kirchner-Doubts-AMIA-Prosecutor-Alberto-Nismans-Suicide/384750/ Seems a little to obvious for me. If it was a goverment hit they would have ransacked the sob. It's 2015 our governments really don'T hide shit. They move their agenda in plain sight at this point. They are brazen.They have gotten away with so much shit the past 14 years at this point they dont give a fuck.They know they have the sheep complacent and divided against the people being vocal for everyones best interest.It5 is what it is right now.Little by little baby steps Not surprised to find most of the comments here to be memes, jokes and people trying to 1-up each others jokes any more, but it's becoming *really* difficult to search through all these trash comments to find something of actual relevance.  Reminds me of a movie I saw called "I will be murdered". I won't spoil it, but you might want to watch it. Can anyone give me a brief summary of what's going on in Argentina? Earlier today I saw a chart showing the misery level of multiple countries, and Argentina spiked up the most. Then I see this, so it seems something serious is going on. I was watching some shit on ISIS dressing up as FSA. They had these two guys admitting they called the FSA, and led them out into a field, then they admitted they werent FSA and shot them both. They said something that makes me look at things differently. "war is deception".  
  
If you went through the trouble of entering this mans home and shooting him in the head, why would you leave the document in the trash?  Because you didn't know it was there and you didn't have time to search the house? Argentinians: how deep does this go? How systematic is the corruption? I was there, and I suppose I didn't sense the same 'conspiracy' air that you do in certain countries that do have such things happening.  Corruption is everywhere in any level. The government is a reflection of it's people.  Didn't seem so bad, but perhaps tourists are shielded from it (not much bureaucracy for us). Sad, but would you say it's improved from the 20th century?   Holy shit. It's like *24* in real life. First she tries to repay government debt only to get knocked on her ass, and now she can't even properly cover up a murder? It's like watching a shitty mafia sitcom.  Just my very brief contribution to this discussion. Politics is a very dirty game. We are living in times when moral values and ethics are less and less of importance. The top ruling parties are becoming more mafia-like clans or organisations.  There was a recent discussion in one of those thread about prosecutors needing police to bring them people to convict so they'll rise int he ranks, therefore prosecutors don't go against their own. 

In this case, the prosecutor goes against his own gov't to try and bring justice and dies tragically before he can present his report. The few times someone tries to shed light on corruption and it goes bad. I hope more prosecutors gain the courage to go against the big boys and stand up for what is right. 

RIP Alberto Nisman When killing your opponent might create less of a scandal then letting them live, you've done some shady shit.

Her relationship with the media reads like Satan having a child with Stephan Harper and letting Kim Jong-il babysit it.
 [deleted] As a Canadian, he's not far off. He won a majority government with less than 40% of the popular vote; his mandate is to basically tell 60% of Canada to fuck off, and he has done so. Worst Prime Minister ever, imo. He has single-handedly taken so much of the pride out of being Canadian with his policies and foreign relations. It's gross. We are basically mimicking George Bush's transformation of the USA but the Canadian version (meaning less guns). 'Murica (lite)? &gt; He won a majority government with less than 40% of the popular vote; his mandate is to basically tell 60% of Canada to fuck off

Lol, change those percentages to 50% and then you have Cristina Kirchner &gt; "Worst prime minister ever"

You do know that the Canadian prime minister during WWII said this about saving Jews from the Nazis: "none is too many"

And this is how Wikipedia describes his relationship with Nazi Germany prior to WWII:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lyon_Mackenzie_King#Ethnic_policies

&gt;Possessing a religious yearning for direct insight into the hidden mysteries of life and the universe, and strongly influenced by the operas of Richard Wagner (who was also Hitler's favourite composer), King decided Hitler was akin to mythical Wagnerian heroes within whom good and evil were struggling. He thought that good would eventually triumph and Hitler would redeem his people and lead them to a harmonious, uplifting future. These spiritual attitudes not only guided Canada's relations with Hitler but gave the prime minister the comforting sense of a higher mission, that of helping to lead Hitler to peace. King commented in his journal that "he is really one who truly loves his fellow-men, and his country, and would make any sacrifice for their good". He forecast that "the world will yet come to see a very great manmystic in Hitler. [...] I cannot abide in Nazism - the regimentation - cruelty - oppression of Jews - attitude towards religion, etc., but Hitler, him - the peasant - will rank some day with Joan of Arc among the deliverers of his people."[61][62]

Harper would have to do a lot more shit to be considered the worst. Regardless of his personal opinion on the matter, Canada fought bravely against the Nazis in WW2.

Harper's personal opinions mean nothing to me when his policies are actually hurting others on the planet as well as stripping Canadians of their pride and national programs, amongst other things. 

If a Prime Minister can separate his personal opinion from his policy, I have no problem granting that person their freedom of opinion. It is the policies of Mr. Harper that make him (imo) the worst PM ever.  Hate on King all you want, his take didn't influence what Canada actually ended up doing. Harper is the complete opposite. &gt; He has single-handedly taken so much of the pride out of being Canadian with his policies and foreign relations. 

Obviously it is a subjective matter, but as a holder of multiple citizenships, Harper's governance has been the only thing to nearly tempt me back to Canada. I, for one, am exceedingly proud of him. But then, given the parties I support in my other countries of citizenship, that's to be expected, since I align with either the right-most or libertarian-most parties depending on context. Canadian values tend to fall to the liberal socialism and Stephen Harper is the polar opposite, doing all in his power to sell large swathes of Canada to the highest bidder to destroy the environment and actively stifling any opposing scientific research. He's an objectively terrible, terrible human being. Lets not forget this week's Terrorism Bill......... Whereas once upon a time you could be arrested for planning an attack.... Now you can be arrested if you *may* be planning an attack....  ie: on assumption. Doesn't sound like much, but it basically opens the door to arrest almost anyone if they see fit. 

Swell fella that Stephen.  I think most Canadians have some leanings towards good ole fashioned 'conservative values', but when Canada is the only veto on delivering aid to Palestinian war zones, I am ashamed. Why has the supreme court had to intervene multiple times to uphold our rights and constitution repeatedly against his government? Maybe from afar, Harper looks competent, but here it is clear that we are going down a very dark path towards more military involvement, complete subjugation to corporate lobbyists, and excessive pandering to the US and Israel. Hopefully our next government will bring things back a bit and allow Canada to be a compassionate nation once again. He basically trashed Canada. Our public systems are barebones, and hanging on by a thread. Our scientists are muzzled while their funding is slashed. The economy is in the shitter. Our environmental regulations are inexistent. We have been kicked out of the UN security council.  Even his senior ministers are leaving the sinking ship.

Canada is a pariah on the world stage, and Harper is entirely at fault. &gt; Canada is a pariah on the world stage

This is something the Canadian left keeps insisting, but I see no evidence to support that proposition. True, he has, as you would expect a right-wing elected leader to do, embraced right-wing policies. And it is further true that in some areas, particularly with certain environmental concerns, taken a harder line than other countries. But on the whole, I defy you or anybody to bring proof that it has caused any measurable harm to Canada's international standing.  Some American tourists used to wear backpacks with Canadian flags on them in order to fair better overseas.... they don't do this anymore. That's a great anecdote, but it hardly represents the sort of real proof I want these staunch Harper critics to provide in support of their extreme and facially absurd claims.  Yea I hate to say it but it's probably a good thing that we're not on the security council considering how much of a lap dog we are for Israel at this point... I think that's also a big reason we were kicked out.  Harper is the polite Satan that convinces you his pathway to hell isn't so bad.  That's a really important point; if Nisman was alive and talking, could she just deny the whole thing? Or did he really have that much power to put the fear of God in her...? I remember when she accused the US of planning to assassinate her This is statecraft. They murdered the guy and made it look like a suicide, but didn't look in the *trash* for the very document that caused all of this?

I call shanagins. http://imgur.com/r/gif/aiEJH Is there anything they don't do? /r/conspiracy has the truth! /s Awkward.... Traveling to Argentina in a month.  What a time to visit. It's the same as visiting any other time Its going to be cheap at least Suicide by a .22 on the eve of your biggest day. o_O You know what else is a coincidence? The king of Saudi Arabia just recently died, and look how quickly oil prices are rising! There is never a coincidence...never /s Damn. This investigation needs to go all the way.  This investigation has been going since 1994 it won't end anytime soon.  That's sad.  Nothing goes all the way on 'Merica. When did they find this draft?  Was it before or after their president effectively shut down their intelligence agency?  I could not tell from the article.  Could be a strike back from some pissed off intelligence people.  More conspiracy! This is probably just a coincidence. &gt;He has accepted more than $1.2 million in money from the fossil-fuel industry over the last decade while failing to disclose that conflict of interest in most of his scientific papers. At least 11 papers he has published since 2008 omitted such a disclosure, and in at least eight of those cases, he appears to have violated ethical guidelines of the journals that published his work.

Ouch.  The question then becomes, will he continue to be published? Or will he be blacklisted from scientific journals? The journals will probably retract the papers if it is shown he actually did violate ethical guidelines. Harvard/Smithsonian _may_ censure him, they are more flexible than the journals - depending on if he disclosed the payments to Harvard/Smithsonian's Conflicts of Interest and Commitment Disclosure oversight. If they don't do it publicly, he'll be quietly asked to leave in which case he'll move on to some other institute and continue his "work". He will continue to be published, but scrutiny will be higher.

I worked at a large institute for 15 years and saw this happen 2-3 times. "Tonight on Fox News: We expose the Liberal Cabal that's censuring the one man brave enough to break ranks from the global warming conspiracy!" Just reading that spiked my blood pressure Then you'll get a kick out of /r/climateskeptics  I hate how they have bastardized the word "skeptic." I am a skeptic about all things, including climate science. What that means is I don't accept anything on faith. I believe in nothing unless it's proven to me, or at the very least there is strong evidence pointing in that direction.

The vast majority of the evidence shows that CO2 concentrations are increasing, the temperature is increasing, and that human activity is the chief cause of it. 

These so-called "skeptics" are doing the exact opposite of what a real skeptic does. They're ignoring data, cherry-picking what they want to hear.  I agree. 
Skepticism (for me at least) means proportioning belief according to evidence. And the evidence for anthropogenic climate-change is overwhelming. 

 &gt; proportioning belief according to evidence.

That's a great way to phrase it. For me, it's a combination of the evidence and the "size" of the claim. I don't ask for much evidence for simple, easy-to-believe things (that grey blur I saw dart across the yard was probably a squirrel. I don't need a DNA test) but I require a lot more evidence for extraordinary claims (you're telling me that was actually Chupacabra? You're going to need to catch it, then.) And that's precisely why you and your ilk will be the first to fall in the coming *Chupacabra Wars.*

Make your time. "I believe in evidence.

I believe in observation, measurement, and reasoning, confirmed by independent observers.

Ill believe anything, no matter how wild and ridiculous, if there is evidence for it.  The wilder and more ridiculous something is, however, the firmer and more solid the evidence will have to be.

-  Isaac Asimov

Relevant quote is relivant Yes. Agreed again. What constitutes sufficient evidence changes depending on context and claim. 

And, if I may add, when you are not in a position to assess all of the evidence, then deferring to the consensus of experts is acceptable. Another reason to accept anthropogenic climate change.  &gt;I require a lot more evidence for extraordinary claims

Shame most people don't accept this point of view.

The stuff I see posted by anti-vaxxers can be painful :/ [Merchants of Doubt](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3675568/) And for an additional dose of irony they regularly brigade the /r/skeptic subreddit to accuse them of not being true skeptics because that forum overwhelmingly supports anthropogenic climate change  I used to be part of a secular and skeptics club at my old university, and we got some of these crazies. Our favorite was a guy that tried to tell us that ancient aliens helped build the period, and when we called bullshit, he told us that we "couldn't be so skeptical as to blind ourselves from the truth." He never returned, but we still quote him.  are you suggesting aliens are the cause of menstruation? Someone made a parody of that subreddit over at /r/climatskeptics. It's not always that easy to tell the two apart.

Edit: for an actual [skeptical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_skepticism) viewpoint on this topic (and others), I recommend /r/skeptic instead... Go to http://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics+climatskeptics and see if you can guess which post comes from which subreddit. That's a drinking game to get wasted I can see it ending badly very quickly. I never want to go there again... I wish they would get on a ship with the anti vaccine people and fly into the sun You will find that Antivaccine people and Global Warmers are very often the same people. You don't need to be one to be the other but one is almost always also the other.  I wonder if they go to war on each other from time to time.  That's like the regular olympics going to war with the special olympics. Not sporting. which one's the special one? Poe's law in subreddit form The really scummy subreddits are never the ones that surprise me, it's the subtle but absurd ones that really get me. God dammit of course this exists.  I took a quick glance in there.

Topic: [Why aren't we all dead yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/2wnww7/why_arent_we_all_dead_yet/)

&gt; "Environmentalism has morphed into an earth-worshipping cult. They demand guilt of original sin (modern civilization is evil), become ever more apocalyptic in predictions"

The stupid. It hurts. The simple answer is usually because we do something about it. Why are the rivers in Cleveland no longer flammable? Because we put in waste regulations. Why is the ozone hole no longer growing and actually shrinking? Because we replaced the chemicals causing the issue. Why is unleaded gasoline a thing? Because we put in a cap and trade scheme in. Why do these things that I ignore what people are working on go away! Indeed, although I think the danger currently is that when it comes to global warming the masses think "the scientists are dealing with it np," when infact they are being ignored.

We're still exploring for oil, despite our current reserves containing far more than what has been deemed a "safe" amount to burn before 2050 (2 deg C warming).

We seem to be looking at the most likely outcome, whereas for everything else in our lives we look for the worst case scenario. An example I heard recently is that no-one would take cold medicine that has a 5% chance of killing you.

edit: just to clarify, the "most likely outcome" bit is referring to global warming we "expect", when really we should be looking at the global warming that is merely *possible* and could rip us a new one. &gt;Because we put in waste regulations.

&gt;Because we replaced the chemicals causing the issue.

&gt;Because we put in a cap and trade scheme in. 

You mean "Because we decided to worship the earth and stop focusing on the furthering of mankind at all costs"?  'cause that's what you stupid earth centrist people believe in - come on, there's PROFIT TO BE MADE! Wow, I didn't know my english teacher was on Reddit. Hi, Mr. Miller! If you just discovered your English teacher is brony I'm guessing class is going to have a field day on him.  It's not as absurd as /r/Geocentrism   There's no way this exists, no freaking way.

Huh.
If anyone needs me I'll be binge watching Cosmos and fearing for the future. At least when you find subreddits like those you can console yourself in the fact that they're not very popular at all.

Looks like something being upvoted into the triple digits is cause for rare celebration in that subreddit. Downvotes are not allowed on /r/climateskeptics. [deleted] I think it's mostly people from this thread going there, actually.  Sure they are. Just turn off CSS. or go to /r/climateskeptics+null That is brilliant Are you sure about that? How do you know it's not just a natural variation of your blood pressure? Or there could be an external force you're not accounting for.

In any case, there's no need to be concerned. Your body has the ability to regulate its own blood pressure. Even if you could lower your blood pressure at will the solution will probably be worse than just learning how to live with high blood pressure. Sadly there are many who eat that right up. My mom's like that.  She'll believe anything she sees on *The 700 Club* and nothing I or any of my siblings say can convince her otherwise.  She wasn't always this bad.  I'm just glad anti-vaxxers weren't a thing when I was a kid or I'd be screwed. Can someone explain to me why we don't have laws preventing outright LIES to be said on the news? I don't mind advertising or marketers lying to sell a product cause that's kind of their prerogative but why is it ok to intentionally misinform the public?

I mean you can circumvent it by explicitly denying that you did the research to show the failure of fact checking your news story. But wouldn't continually having to publically disclose how you didn't do due diligence on an article mean that you aren't reputable as a news source anyway?

There are many ways to frame facts as they are to fit your narrative or bend them as such, but if people are aware that the facts are 100% irrefutable wouldn't that at least count as something? Thom Hartmann tells the story -http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDKLFn0pty4 We do to an extent, but the Fox News Hour specifically states at the beginning of the show that everything expressed on it is their opinions.  They made this change after they were sued for lying in the late 90s.  There are actually people that still believe them thinking that any attempt to silence them is a "liberal conspiracy."  And I wish I were making that last bit up.  Confirmation bias is a really tough thing to get people to think about. Sadly, the kind of people who watch Fox News religiously don't give a flying fuck about the disclaimer, and probably think that it's because of 'liberal censorship' or something. It's called freedom of speech, not freedom of popular speech, or even freedom of speaking truth. This is especially needed because who is to say what is truth? The government Ha Ha good one. There are countries who successfully censor "false" news while maintaining freedom of the press.

For example, [Canada bans lying on broadcast news.](http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/a-law-against-lying-on-the-news)

Yet Canada actually ranks higher than the United States in the [Press Freedom Index.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Freedom_Index#Rankings_and_scores_by_country)

Americans are overly paranoid when it comes to free speech. Most people seem to think that if you restrict the press from outright lying even a little bit, the next thing you know we're all goosestepping in Times Square and saluting Commandant Obama. Sadly too many Americans repeatedly fall for the slippery slope fallacy. 

Allowing broadcast news to tell us blatant lies benefits only certain corporations and particularly clever politicians. Journalism is considered the 4th estate and as such DOES have to abide by some rules. They cannot outright lie about people or they'll risk a massive libel lawsuit.

However, through opinion pieces (aka what most of Fox News' primetime personalities are doing) they can basically say whatever they want as long as they frame it as an opinion. Most people can't tell the difference. They're not any more obligated to tell the truth than a blogger though, right? I can sue a blogger for libel as much as I could sue a "real" "reporter." I'm not sure as a non-American, but I think you guys have regulations in regards to public news (most developed nations do), and the way a lot of the networks get around this is to say they are entertainment programmes..

For example the Bill O,Reilly show or whatever its called, its an entertainment programme dressed up as a news show.

The other thing is, most news programmes just run the official line from the Government, without investigating, and so end up as a mouthpiece for Government policy. [deleted] i have basically lost my father to fox, they have driven him nearly insane. he recently went out and bought himself and my stepmother guns because he thinks liberal muslim benghazi terrorists are coming to get him. and since i don't drink the fox kool aid, i too am the enemy. The world changes from what you knew as a child, and that can be frightening.  Having a channel where everyone shares your fear, and responds to that with anger and outrage in terms you can understand is very comforting.

It's an insidious little form of programming that they've refined into an art.

&amp;nbsp;

"It is merely a matter of course that I should compromise my integrity.  Duh." The comments for that article are just sad and infuriating that people like that vote.... I suppose from a purely academic stance that may be the correct path. An ethical violation in the past may not necessarily invalidate research he does in the future. Actual scientific research is true or false independent of his past. Just so long as there is heavier scrutiny on his future work. Punishment plays a role; it's not just about salvaging him as a researcher, but ensuring that it doesn't happen again. If he benefits from his shenanigans it's a slap in the face to honest scientists &gt;Actual scientific research is true or false independent of his past. Just so long as there is heavier scrutiny on his future work.

That's not the problem. The problem is in verifying that the work/data/analysis presented is genuine and in good faith and also validating results by redoing experiments.

Guess what? In practice, because of the publish or perish mentality no one does this. I guarantee you, 99% of peer reviewing is posturing, esoteric debate about little details just to say something, complaining about lack of originality (again, at the detriment of performing validation), and sometimes dick measuring when you end up against a competing researcher. No one says "can I see your raw numbers please?", or better yet, "can I visit your lab and look at the experiment first hand?" (besides politics, there are also practical reasons why this is often not possible).

So reviewers put a great deal of implicit faith in authors. No one has time to give this researcher any heavier scrutiny--and why should they? Academia is too rife with politics and competition to give anyone without a perfect ethical history the time of day. Journals may turn a more thorough eye to what he's writing, but "news" blogs and articles will continue to take what he says as fact, simply because Ph.D. They'll take it as fact because it reinforces what they want to believe, the fact that he has a PhD just makes them feel that much more secure they are being persecuted. Dr George Ricarte with Johns Hopkins was caught falsifying an MDMA study. After being called out by Dr Rick Doblin from MAAPS, Dr Ricarte admitted "oops, yeah we accidentally used meth instead" IRC he was getting funding from the NIDA. There were no ramifications for this obvious manipulation of results to make the drug look bad at a time that it was peaking in popularity. I expect the same with this gentleman  Falsify science, manufacture hysteria through the news-media, rally people/lawmakers to ban the "menace," and employ police to jail people that associate with the "menace."

Irreversible damage that takes decades of lobbying, research, protests, and extremely hard, constroversial work, to correct (if at all). After this, I doubt any legitimate scientific journal will touch him. He's done. He may pop up in some Murdoch paper, but he'll no longer be credible to the scientific community, and that's all that matters. Anytime he brings something up, someone else can just point to the fact that he's a known sellout, and he'll be immediately discredited.  &gt; He may pop up in some Murdoch paper, but he'll no longer be credible to the scientific community, and *that's all that matters.*

Not really. Scientists are not swayed by so called "experts" like this. These people are dragged out on FOX news shows and regularly quoted by the AM radio troops to counter expert testimony. When a group of scientists present evidence the right wing nuts say.....see we have a Harvard scientist who agrees with us....the juries still out. They did this for years with cigarette smoking, I remember it, it was appalling......and the people who allow themselves to be used like this? Despicable!

The fact that he's exposed as a "gun for hire" won't make him any less useful. The right will simply insist that he's being persecuted by "libruls" for "telling the truth!

Expect to hear more from this tool. Shouldn't (potentially) falsifying congressional testimony be a pretty big deal? I'm sure the Republican controlled congress will get right on that.  Still on vacation in Hawaii. Come back latter. Love, Congressman McGuffin. god damnit this sucks.  &gt; Anytime he brings something up, someone else can just point to the fact that he's a known sellout, and he'll be immediately discredited.

Actually I hope very much that won't happen, because that is a terrible thing. He should be discredited for poor methodology, not character flaws.
 Coming to a conclusion based on who's paying you, not what the data suggests, is poor methodology.  God damn.  Every single paper you submit to a journal, at least in my field, is preceded by a cover letter in which you specifically state that you have no conflict of interest.  It's part of the normal process of getting an article published and is critical to the integrity of peer-reviewed journals.  So by not disclosing this conflict of interest, you are not only omitting such a conflict, but explicitly lying about not having one, because in the communications you have with the editor(s) of the journal in question, it is *required* that you positively state that you don't have one, not just implied.  That fact only makes it worse. In the process of submitting a paper right now. I just filled out a form with all our funding sources and a very legalese form about conflicts of interest with a warning that if a conflict of interest is found after the fact the editors have full right to retract your paper. The way it's worded, you give a very clear and explicit declaration of no conflicts of interest. They do not fuck around and it's not something that can be easily misinterpreted by the submitting authors. Yeah, there's no gray area here.  It's extremely explicit.  I think people that think otherwise haven't seen this before and are talking out of their asses. Juicy!

&gt; The documents show that Dr. Soon, in correspondence with his corporate funders, described many of his scientific papers as deliverables that he completed in exchange for their money. He used the same term to describe testimony he prepared for Congress.

and

&gt; Though often described on conservative news programs as a Harvard astrophysicist, Dr. Soon is not an astrophysicist and has never been employed by Harvard. He is a part-time employee of the Smithsonian Institution with a doctoral degree in aerospace engineering.

(It's telling that he never corrected them) Considering most people who deny climate change think that scientists are lying about it to get that sweet sweet grant money, this is kind of ironic.  It's the environmentalist lobby man. They're the ones pulling the strings.  Yeah, look at all the power environmentalists have in Washington.  /s All they care about is their *precious* ecosystem with no regard in the world for the down trodden Koch brother just trying to make ends meet. THANKS OBUMMER [deleted] It sounds less like companies approached him and more like he approached them asking for money and publicity  They should send him to science jail. Art school?  Ken Ham's Creation Museum He said science jail, not science hell. I don't care if there's no crime committed, he should be reamed for basically profiting off deceiving humanity.  [deleted] Got rich. Doesn't care. People will say anything for money? I'm shocked, shocked I tell you. Give me 10$ and I will be "shocked" as well. I'll give you $5 to shock my nipples.  Will lick 9V batteries 4 gold.  Will provide dead batteries and take your sweet lucre.  A small subset of people actually have integrity, and have a purpose in life above maximizing their wealth. What sad, strange people they must be. 
*Rides off on Jet-Ski* In my opinion, The most disturbing thing about these cases is just how little people will sell their integrity for. 1.2 million is worth your life's work? Or did he just know that whatever recourse taken against him would only harm his reputation, not ruin it? Either way, it's a small amount in the grand scheme if things, especially when ~~you're already employed by Harvard~~ **he was never employed by Harvard, I fucked up** [deleted] He isn't even an astrophysicist his degree is in aerospace engineering. $1.2 million / 10 years isn't much, and if (but not IFF) research grants = bribes, there's an awful lot of bribery in academic research.  Still should have disclosed it though. According to the article, this guy is a part-timer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, which is *not* Harvard University, but "a joint venture between Harvard and the Smithsonian Institution". Also, he's not an astrophysicist. actual quote from article:

&gt;Though often described on conservative news programs as a Harvard astrophysicist, Dr. Soon is not an astrophysicist and has never been employed by Harvard. He is a part-time employee of the Smithsonian Institution with a doctoral degree in aerospace engineering. He has received little federal research money over the past decade and is thus responsible for bringing in his own funds, including his salary. Also from the article, I write proposals; I let them decide whether to fund me or not, he said at an event in Madison, Wis., in 2013. If they choose to fund me, Im happy to receive it. A moment later, he added, I would never be motivated by money for anything. &gt; I would never be motivated by money for anything.

That'd be just crazy! I'm motivated by money everyday. Why the hell do you think I have a job. Well that's a relief.  Also according to the article, they weren't bribes ... they were "grants." Grants are disclosed public knowledge. Bribes are kept in the dark.  So what's the difference between a grant you fail to disclose and a bribe? At that point it's just a word.

Just because I ask for a grant of 1 million to return her or I cut off your daughters fingers... that doesn't somehow make it legal or unethical.  except they weren't disclosed. Undisclosed grants is a known and bad thing.  Its happened before and people treat it with disdain.  Yeah, OP's title is misleading, sensationalist, and editorialized.  But the guy in the article is still a douche canoe. &gt; OP's title is misleading, sensationalist, and editorialized.

Make sure to report it to mods here. Disinformation is bad no matter what. As a researcher I think there are a few things we need to clear up here:

* It is normal for researchers to rely on external funding. I work with sustainable transportation and reducing car-dependence but have received money from the car industry for some projects. Why? Because out of 5 funding sources they were the ones that accepted my application. Nothing spurious about that and I don't care where the money comes from. They have actually been some of the best sponsors since they didn't require a lot of additional BS administration and paperwork during the project, whereas you can set aside 10% of a research grant just to deliver progress reports with some public funds.

* In terms of research grants $1.2 million is not a lot of money. The funding alone is not really a problem and can't be used as an argument against the quality of research. I certainly don't deny anthropogenic climate change, but I understand the feeling of having your research interests overlooked again and again by public research grants and needing to seek funding elsewhere.

* There is nothing shady about promising deliverables. Nothing at all. All publications in a research project are called deliverables, no matter the source of funding. It means you have promised to publish your results (to *deliver* a report or article is a target *deliverable*), not that you have promised what those results will be.

Now, that doesn't mean Willie is in the clear, it just means that NY Times are mixing real concerns with nonsense and bringing in the wrong issues for 80% of the article. His research should be evaluated based on the data, methods and explanatory power, all of which are criticised by many experts in the field. The only two things that really matter in this article are that he failed to disclose his funding sources for 8 papers and that the impact of his findings is criticised by his peers. That is serious enough, but all the other fluff in that article is completely normal research practice.

edit: words

edit2: **tldr**: NYT doesn't know what is up and down in research funding, but the guy is still in trouble. Your first point is very, very true, and was what I was thinking when I read the headline.

The second point, though, isn't really true for this sort of research. $1.2M for something biological or medical is a pittance. For any kind of data analysis where you're not taking ice cores or setting instruments....that's a pretty healthy sum.

And your third point....I've never **heard** of anyone calling any journal article a "deliverable" in that sense. A "deliverable" is when you have a client; a journal article is not for a client. That, and not disclosing to a journal, is troubling. Well, I've written more grant requests than I can remember, and in all of them a list of deliverables was part of the grant request.

Most of the grant request and the subsequent paperwork (government grants :( I hate them!) was listing all the deliverables we will be giving in exchange of the money ("a comprehensive study of ..."). Otherwise how will they check that you did or didn't fulfill your side of the research agreement? Fellow researcher here, my institution routinely refers to grant reports and papers as "deliverables". Our research-grant department will typically email me a reminder about deliverables as a grant is nearing its enddate, worded like this:  "Professor NorthernSparrow, this is a reminder that grant X, titled "Effect of Snow Shoveling on Pissy Attitude of Bostonians", ends 3/31 and it has the following 3 deliverables listed: (1) Final Text Report, (2) Manuscript To Be Submitted To Journal, (3) Final Financial Report. Please advise as to the status of these deliverables."

... I get those damn emails all the time. 

That said, only rarely is a paper submission promised in a grant. The usual 2 deliverables are the grant report and the financial statement. But sometimes you write a proposal specifically to cover salary to write up an existing dataset - in that case production of the paper is the whole point of the proposal and the paper becomes a deliverable. I had a grant like that last year. &gt; I've never heard of anyone calling any journal article a "deliverable" in that sense. A "deliverable" is when you have a client; a journal article is not for a client

That depends entirely on the nature of the client. For a public grant you can also be required to outline project deliverables in an application (including scientific articles) to be published throughout the project. If you do not meet your deliverables you must be able to justify why, because you were granted taxpayer money to produce state-of-the-art research, which means it is expected that your work can pass peer-review. If you are not able to live up to that it could potentially have some consequences for the grant. There really isn't anything suspicious about it in my book, unless NYT can provide more details about what exactly he agreed to deliver and on what terms. When I did my graduate research we had a deliverable. I'm kinda confused by all the huff and puff from all these arm chair PhDs. And on the peer-review point. If these papers published didn't meet some standard of scientific validity, then how did they get accepted? I'd start looking more at the journals than the authors. $1.2M **over ten years**. That's 120K per year. Assuming overhead rates of 50% (which is probably a vast under-approximation for a government organization) that is 80K a year with which he pays his salary.

I'm not saying he didn't break ethical codes and shouldn't be let go/pulled publications, I'm just saying 1.2M over a long period isn't a whole lot. Don't forget fringe benefits. (health insurance etc). Those are also required by the home institutuom, are automatically deducted and typically take another 25%. That brings it $60K/yr, which isn't even full-time salary for someone at his point in his career.  It could work differently for different fields, but for most of my grants journal articles, conference presentations, reports ect., are generally listed as deliverable in proposals. &gt;  I've never heard of anyone calling any journal article a "deliverable" in that sense. A "deliverable" is when you have a client; a journal article is not for a client. 

Maybe you don't work in science/tech Academia ? Because pretty much all sources of funding I have heard of, require a shit ton of deliverables to even read your grant proposal. &gt; $1.2M 

That's 2-3 years operating budget for a bog standard small biomedical basic research lab that does nothing exotic or very expensive. Stipends for a couple of post-docs, couple grad students, a tech/lab manager, and reagents and supplies.   I'm also a researcher. You're right that industry money is often received by academic scientists without any major conflicts of interest. But in some fields, like climate science or tobacco research in the 80s, industry-funded scientists are the **only** ones who disagree with the academic consensus. In those cases it's pretty clear that industry is essentially manufacturing dissent in order to manipulate public opinion and legislation. Add to that the fact that Soon didn't disclose his funding as required by the journals he published in, and it's pretty clear there's something nefarious going on here. Indeed. Like I said, there are many things wrong with his work, but NY Times does not do a very good job of highlighting those things because they bring in a lot of nonsense to muddy the waters. I agree. The biggest issue here is the lack of proper disclosure. It says he violated ethical guidelines in 8 different published articles. That's pretty bad. Does it mean his conclusions are necessarily wrong? No. But they should be looked at MUCH more closely. If he HAD properly disclosed the funding it wouldn't make his work any less credible, just might have warranted more in-depth review. It's the fact that he hid his funding sources that makes me the most skeptical of his conclusions.   &gt; You're right that industry money is often received by academic scientists without any major conflicts of interest.

Kind of a "fox guarding the hen house" sort of situation with some convenient "miscalculations".

It's kind of *funny* how all these kinds of "errors" end up favoring the foxes and not the hens time and time again, isn't it?

&gt;But in some fields, like climate science or tobacco research in the 80s, industry-funded scientists are the only ones who disagree with the academic consensus.

It's in far more cases than that, unfortunately.  And, in many cases there's vasty more opaque industry sponsored studies and very few *transparent* third party studies available due to various industry obstructionism.

That's not to say that I think all conflicts of interest and industry sponsored studies are flawed or manipulated.  However, there's a lot more issues with industry-influenced, opaque methodologies than you may be aware of.
 Note that he said it *often* doesn't lead to conflicts of interest, not *always* - pointing to some cases where it has lead to conflict of interest doesn't really refute his point.

I also happen to agree with him - most scientific research is not so loaded with politics or industry influence. For example, no political or industry groups really had much to gain or lose if the Higgs Boson was found. Logged on just to upvote this. A lot of scientific research is supported by corporate grants or partnerships. Money has to come from somewhere, and it's not like governments have a lot of cash these days. In engineering, you pretty much HAVE to have an industrial partner already or it's difficult to even get any government (Canada) grant money.

Right now scientists are being told to find outside (i.e. non-government) funding, but then getting criticized that the people funding them have their own interests and thus increase possible (but not necessarily actual) bias. No shit. When funding isn't tied to deliverables then scientists are criticized for not having performance incentives. When the funding IS tied to deliverables then the scientists get accused of "creating the results they want". When scientists are funded by governments they're not contributing to economic prosperity and draining the budget. When funded by corporations their results are "all biased and can't be trusted". There's no winning here.

Most people don't get into science for money. If they did, then they're an idiot, because the money isn't there. As such, the funding source probably wouldn't directly determine the "honesty" of the results. That is, the results reported are probably accurate given the methodology used. However, funding does definitely determine research direction, and even possibly the methods used. When you push people to get industry funding, you can be sure that the things researched are going to be those of interest to the industry in question.

While I'm (extremely) bothered by the fact that the ethical guidelines weren't followed and funding source was left unreported (that's pretty bad, actually), these papers apparently passed peer review. So, at least a couple of people in the same field reviewed these papers and found them fit to publish. Maybe the methods used were outdated and some assumptions invalid, but that becomes part of the scientific conversation. His peers in turn either refute his work or point out gross omissions. If the work in question was of so low quality that it was unfit to publish, then it's not just the researcher who failed, but also the reviewers who are supposed to act as gatekeepers to publication.

I'm not saying that nothing at all is wrong here... but if people are really troubled by this, then the issue is probably a lot more systemic than we'd probably like to acknowledge. It's not just "one asshole". There's some societal-level questions here. In an era where all the money is controlled by non-governmental organizations, how do we fund science in an appropriate manner that will ensure integrity? Which fields need extra scrutiny? Which fields should never be funded by industry? Are we willing to fund research that does not have a direct economic benefit? Does the political situation play a role in this?

I dunno... I feel like I could rant forever... and probably miss a ton of points... oversimplify... make mistakes... I don't have any answers. Treat this comment as it is, a rant... nothing more, nothing less. There's no data here. Not sure why I even wrote this now. *shrugs* I would upvote this twice if I could.   You hit the nail on the head.   Research for the sake of knowledge is a hard sell, but is essential.    The title made me think it was going to be cash-stuffed envelopes, but the only story here appears to be the lack of declarations of funding sources/COIs that are the normal part of publication. These are great points. Sadly, most people seem to rush to judgement without understanding the context. 

&lt;rush_to_judgement&gt;

That said, many journals have conflict-of-interest disclosure clauses, and the NYT claims he violated those. That sounds a bit fishy. 

&lt;/rush_to_judgement&gt; Yes, that is problematic. To give NY Times some credit they also cite some actual critics of Willie's work (of which there are plenty). My problem with the article is that 80% of it is a criticism of perfectly normal research practice that the journalist doesn't understand. You're missing a lot of the details.

Failing to disclose sources of funding and failing to disclose conflicts of interest are massively unethical. Any journal worth it's salt has clearly defined rules about this. If you're willing to not disclose this, you're willing to falsify data.

He was receiving money for "deliverables". I've never heard of a grant where money is tied to publishing a paper. There might be some sort of yearly review, but giving bonuses for publishing something isn't done (because it incentivises falsifying research). Your first point about the conflicts of interest is absolutely correct.

For the second, I suspect it depends on field. Almost all grants in my field require "deliverables," which are often reports for this type of work. Most funding agencies strongly encourage publication of these reports. It's not a bonus for publishing something - it's a required final report. This applies to almost all of the funding sources we pursue. Yeah, well... you're smart and have relevant knowledge and/or experience so why should we listen to you? ^^/s 1.2million over ten years is pretty cheap in science.

edit: Not to say that he shouldn't be expelled from science, just that he probably could have gotten more for his integrity. DADDY CAN'T BUY A BOAT WITH INTEGRITY MAN. Hmm - nobody has mentioned his name yet.

We should be getting this info out there as much as possible:

&gt;Wei-Hock Soon, known as Willie, a scientist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics  Well, his name is in the article. Psh, who reads those? Reads what? You expect me to READ!?  I posted it here for the people that don't read the article and for search engines / exposure / etc.

I don't really see any point discouraging it either - comment space is free and endless and it doesn't do anything to you personally. This man was willing to risk the extinction of the human race for $1.2 million. Not only do I hope they revoke whatever credentials he has, I hope he is forced to disappear forever.  The end of the world is a 4th quarter problem. Right now my biggest problem is figuring out what to do with all this money! My new pangolin farm start-up for example.  Yo that might not be a bad idea really. A Pangolin farm would create the kind of competition against poached Pangolins that would really help alleviate pressure on wild Pangolins. $1.2 million over the last decade. 

It's really not that much money, which is even scarier IMO $120,000 a year puts you into the top 10% of incomes in America. and 1.2 million for 10 years work isn't really that much i think extinction of the human race is a little harsh He was being pretty dramatic, but he has a point. So many unnecessary deaths, homes destroyed, extinction of species, and billions of dollars in damages for a measly 1.2 million dollars. Fucking pathetic. playing devils advocate:

that assumes this guy had a major impact on whether or not people believe in climate change.

last i checked the scientific consensus was overwhelmingly for manmade climatechange, and he might have figured that him being the one guy or one of the few arguing against it would have no real impact whatsoever, and arguably it might not have had.

it really is **way** too dramatic, but its still incredibly scummy, and id say both the briber and the bribee should be punished. but hey, its america, and he has money now :) He may not have had an impact on reasonable, informed people, but keep in mind who is currently running our country. This guy was often used as the sole reason for climate change still being debated in congress. Because the fossil fuel puppets in congress were able to cite him as a reason antrhopogenic climate change is still in debate, many of the less corrupt, albeit sheepish, congressmen may have gone along with it. 

It doesnt matter that most people know this guy was full of shit, what matters is the people who are making our laws and regulations believed him and decided not to act, potentially dooming many species to extinction along with everyone else who is incapable/doesnt have the resources to adapt.  &gt; he might have figured that him being the one guy or one of the few arguing against it would have no real impact whatsoever

We've got a measles outbreak in 2015 because of a woman whose credentials entail taking off her clothes in a magazine. All it ever takes is one jackass to start a bullshit argument and the people who that argument suits will turn them into a poster child for their cause.

There's only ever been a handful of scientists denying climate change. But they said it, the right repeated it ad infinitum, and now my republican family believes that climate change is a 50/50 split of people that confirm it and deny it. And no argument I make can change that because "there's scientists that say it's not real, he was on the news!" Now they'll vote as such for the rest of their lives or until they're running the air conditioning in January. Yeah except media's false equivalence gives 50% of the attention to the climate deniers which makes this guys voice staggeringly powerful. Why is extinction part of the discussion? From what I heard, that isn't on the radar of possible outcomes, or even close. DENIER!!  apocalypse at least  when the illuminati complete their objective of making the earth habital for their reptilian masters (by raising ocean temperatures), they will descend and pacify any remaining resistance. Just curious, in how many years would humans be extinct if we continued our current trend? Edit: No one *in the scientific community* said the human race will go extinct. CO2 levels have been triple or quadruple current levels at other periods in earth's history, and life flourished during some of those periods. We'll live. The issue is that it will be a different world, one that we aren't prepared for (rising seas, mostly). The general warming of the globe and melting of polar ice caps could potentially disrupt the flow of global ocean "conveyor belts" that bring cold, dense oxygenated water to the deep ocean near Earth's poles. This process is necessary to eventually nourish the organisms in the ocean that supply oxygen to the planet. It's possible that an anoxic ocean brought about by processes like this contributed the the End Permian mass extinction, when 95% of ocean life died out. 

Here's a basic article describing the currents. The last paragraph summarizes the ecological aspects of its existence
http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/oceanography/ocean-current3.htm &gt;Caught Accepting Bribes

The word 'bribe' does not appear once in the linked article.  You're right. Should say "accepting undisclosed funding." Getting grants from places like Southern Company shouldn't be considered too malicious. They're a very forward thinking utility with a large and rare research department (for a utility). No shame there. But why didn't he disclose the funding? That's weird.  .. which would be misleading because he disclosed the funding in some papers. 

More like: "accepting funding and only sometimes disclosed it".  Yeah, why is the editorial allowed in this post but removed elsewhere?

 &gt;He has accepted more than $1.2 million in money from the fossil-fuel industry over the last decade

That is a tiny amount of money especially if that was over a decade.  And many research labs take grants from a lot of different companies and industries.  So that is not really a big deal.

&gt; while failing to disclose that conflict of interest in most of his scientific papers.

That on the other hand is a big deal and brings doubt in anything that he has reported. &gt;&gt;He has accepted more than $1.2 million in money from the fossil-fuel industry over the last decade

&gt;That is a tiny amount of money especially if that was over a decade.  And many research labs take grants from a lot of different companies and industries.  So that is not really a big deal.

It is only 120k/yr for 10 years. 

But then again his research isn't expensive field sample collections or expensive chemical lab analysis. He was just plotting data points and wrapping a spun theory around it.

 But didn't the article say he is a part timer at the institute? $100K a year for part time work is not bad.  Why is the editorial present in this title allowable when others are not?

Certainly it doesn't have anything to do with a distaste for the Koch's political leanings? Psychiatry is like this too. Every leading expert in ADHD is paid off by the drug companies. Naively thought that scientists with Harvard/MIT etc credentials possessed some sort of academic integrity that matched their superior intellectual ability. Guess not. I think it's pretty obvious this type of research gets done with money supplied by energy companies with a goal of getting a different result than typical climate scientists with grants not from energy companies. The thing that always gets me is that people that deny climate change always think it's a cash grab by scientists, and a power grab by politicians while ignoring the massive amount of money and power of energy companies and where their climate research funding goes to.  And this will change nothing \o/ But don't mention all the scientists who have been found out as frauds with manipulated data. A lot of people can't really be TOO surprised. I mean, it's hard to believe someone that smart can really be so stupid. If you're a climate change denier who's *not* getting paid by the oil industry, you're doing it wrong. From the article:

&gt;Dr. Soon has found a warm welcome among politicians in Washington and state capitals who try to block climate action. United States Senator James M. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who claims that climate change is a global scientific hoax, has repeatedly cited Dr. Soons work over the years.

The plugin: http://allaregreen.us/ I don't support these types of shenanigans, but this is an issue that permeates all facets of "scientific research".  Don't think for a second that research that supports global warming isn't paid for by people and groups who support such research.  Also, don't think that research on an litany of subjects isn't paid for with grants from companies, non-profits and individuals who have a vested interest in the outcomes.  The dirty little secret of 'research grants' isn't just a result of conservative interests, but rather money comes from a huge variety of sources, all with invisible strings attached.
 Misleading headline.  Corporations fund science all the time, this doesn't make it a bribe any more than government or NGO funding would make it a bribe.

Corporations will fund people who are supporting their beliefs, this doesn't mean their beliefs are due to that funding.  You should have left the original headline because it was a lot more accurate.The article is interesting enough with this sort of misrepresentation but I guess that's reddit for you. But you list funding sources in your papers . he did not. 

My opinion on climate change is irrelevant, but this made me chuckle: "Leading climate denier".

So being a skeptic requires a leader now?   Such a lame hyperbolic article.

Why don't we see the headline:
"THOUSANDS OF CLIMATE SCIENTISTS CAUGHT ACCEPTING BRIBES FROM THE GOVERNMENTS USING GW AS AN EXCUSE FOR A REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL POWER GRAB"

Oh wait cause this way we get to circle jerk about conservatives.  For the record I acknowledge we affect the climate, but deny that the trillions proposed (carbon trading, carbon taxes) do anything but enrich new special interests while doing little to solve the problem

DAE le Koch bros evil??
 This thread is a big circle jerk over how much everyone hates the Koch brothers. I think this science guy is a complete twat, but the title here has such an unbelievably biased twist to it. 

This is "world news" not "change words in the news to fit my personal bias because le Koch brothers are evil"  &gt;Though Dr. Soon did not respond to questions... he has long stated that his corporate funding has not influenced his scientific findings.

It's cool guys he's totally not influenced by over a million dollars of industry funding. At least he wasn't caught doctoring data like SOME people. ;) Climate denier?  So, he like, denies there's a climate?  Follow the money indeed:

 How is this different than the scientists that claim climate change that work closely with the politicians that preach it and give millions in funding to those same scientists? Corporations funding science is only a bribe if I disagree with it. What the title should say is he took money without disclosing it. That is what the thing showed the other link has not been established. Man, this would be bad enough if he was doing serious research on stuff that could possibly save human lives, but from what I read numerous scientists have basically debunked his research already. He's going to have a hard time not descending into Fox News correspondent territory if 8 different works get pulled from journals.

If he really is as media adverse as the article makes him out to be, then this may hit him especially hard. He might descend down to a creationist science institute level. Its bribes when he is a Denier, but if he was a supporter its donations. Al Gore can personally make millions of dollars being on one side of this issue and nobody bats an eye or questions his motives.  A scientist receives $1.2 million for research and I've literally seen comments here that call for him to be "disappeared".  Seems a bit out of balance to me. Anyone who fails to disclose a conflict of interest is in the wrong. Period. I'm not sure what mental gymnastics you've done to convince yourself otherwise. I have to agree with that statement No, then it's called "funding" because those scientists just get their funding from the normal scientific agencies that fund scientific research rather than from third parties who have a financial interest in the specific outcome of the research. Like green energy companies? Plenty of climate science is done with money from corporations with financial interest in the outcome of the research. The source of funding doesn't determine the validity of the research and data.

The research he's working on isn't even denying climate change. He's collecting data on how much solar variations have caused changed in temperature over time, which is based on the premise that climate changes. Like the government?  You might find that there's a slight difference in the amount of monetary insentives involved. Very few have anything to gain from the global warming point of view. Except green energy companies that wouldn't succeed if people are convinced that there will never be a need for more expensive alternative energy. And the companies also need to convince government that they need subsidies. Green energy companies didn't even exist when the global warming debate started up, nor are they at this point an economic power house in comparison to the fossile fuel based industry. No donations == no jobs for them

Thats enough of an incentive If getting money was enough of an incentive, every researcher would be anti global warming. If the journal asked him to disclose any funders of his research, and he did not disclose this industry funding, that is a serious ethical breach. This. I don't know what people are finding so difficult to understand about this issue. Misleading/senationalized title - these were grants, not "bribes".  External funding for research is normal in academia and 1.2 million over ten years is nothing (that's an average of $120,000 yr, barely enough to cover a couple of full-time graduate assistants). Then why wasn't it disclosed? Maybe he forgot, mistakes can happen. What school did you go to where graduate students got near $60000 and do you have any openings for physics graduate students? Pleeeeeease??? Ha - It doesn't all to to the grad assistants.  There's overhead as well. Unfortunately Reddit won't stop to see the truth behind what actually is going on here. They'll just look at the editorialized title and reaffirm their beliefs with some witty political comments to rack karma. My father has tried to sell me this guys work before saying, "see Harvard scientist says it's a lie!"

Well, I just showed him that article and he brushed it off and goes, "the other side does it too."

Ugh... You can't fix stupid, but time can. With or without them. Right-wingers NEVER admit fault.  They just say "Well the liberals did this and this and this..."  Basically, they can be free of ethical principles or logic because they think the people they view as evil do the same. Tell him:

-This guy is not a Harvard scientist (read article),

-The 'other side' isn't funded by one industry, never mind an industry that would profit very much from the findings.

-The 'other side' is 33 times larger than the climate denial 'side'. Oh trust me, I've gone into it. It doesn't matter how many facts I present or how logical my argument is; some people just believe what they want to because the consequences of admitting that they may be wrong are too much to stomach.

I'm optimistic though; humanity will see massive shifts away from fossil fuels AND more sustainable ways of supporting human life become more prevalent. It's just going to take some time.  &gt; Well, I just showed him that article and he brushed it off and goes, "the other side does it too."

He's correct too.  The other side has conflicts of interest that are far more severe, but nobody cares about that. There is no "other side." There is one side: that of 97% of scientists. The "other side" argument is a straw man designed to make you doubt actual science, as evidenced by this case of this ethically bankrupt "scientist." How can researching the climate qualify as science if they cannot perform controlled experiments and therefore cannot employ the scientific method?

They're making educated guesses, and so far their computer models have been proven wrong.  When your model is proven wrong, you need to revisit your assumptions, such as "carbon emissions are the leading cause of global warming".

During the past 17 years our carbon emissions have increased faster than ever before, yet there has been a net increase of global temperature of exactly zero.  How any group of people could deny that empirical reality and call themselves "scientists" boggles the mind.

EDIT:  [Here is a good recent article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-science-is-not-settled-1411143565) that explains how unsettled the "science" of climate change is. Do you consider astrophysicists scientists?  [deleted] You're using the same (way too narrow) definition of science as young-earth creationists claiming that there is no evidence that the earth is more than 5000 years old or that evolution exists. 

Even that article you linked (from the former chief scientist of BP (!!!)) does not claim that there was no increase in global temperature in the past years, he just says it's slower than predicted:
&gt; it [global temperature] has increased much more slowly for the past 16 years, even as the human contribution to atmospheric carbon dioxide has risen by some 25%. &gt;You're using the same (way too narrow) definition of science as young-earth creationists claiming that there is no evidence that the earth is more than 5000 years old or that evolution exists. 

Bullshit.  The fact that you don't want the scientific method to be a part of science just means that you have no idea what science actually is.

&gt;Even that article you linked (from the former chief scientist of BP (!!!)) does not claim that there was no increase in global temperature in the past years, he just says it's slower than predicted:
&gt; it [global temperature] has increased much more slowly for the past 16 years, even as the human contribution to atmospheric carbon dioxide has risen by some 25%.

Fine, there has been close to zero temperature growth over the past 16 years, not exactly zero.  It's still a major problem for the climate researchers who claim carbon is a primary cause of warming. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method

Climate models and hypotheses can be verified by waiting a few years and comparing the results of your model to reality - and adapting it if necessary. If that's not enough for you, then a bunch of things that are commonly accepted as science (age of the universe, evolution etc.) aren't scientific enough by your standards, either. Including astronomy - when is the last time you heard about anyone conducting an experiment with planets?

&gt;Fine, there has been close to zero temperature growth over the past 16 years, not exactly zero. It's still a major problem for the climate researchers who claim carbon is a primary cause of warming.

Not really, did you even read your own BP-sponsored article? He claims that the global warming caused by carbon dioxide was mitigated by another factor, not that carbon dioxide doesn't cause warming. &gt;Climate models and hypotheses can be verified by waiting a few years and comparing the results of your model to reality - and adapting it if necessary.

That's the exact problem.  Their models completely failed to predict realty, and they have not adapted them because they refuse to reexamine their completely faulty assumptions about carbon.  That is the opposite of a scientific process.

In other words, their hypothesis about carbon has already been falsified by the evidence.  However they cannot change the hypothesis because all of their funding comes from sources who want the hypothesis to be "proven true".

In science you need to always be attempting to falsify your hypotheses to strengthen the premises for arguing in favor of them.  The "climate scientist" charlatans working for the IPCC are guilty of ascertainment bias and confirmation bias on a ludicrous scale.  They are ethically bankrupt.

&gt;If that's not enough for you, then a bunch of things that are commonly accepted as science (age of the universe, evolution etc.) aren't scientific enough by your standards, either. Including astronomy - when is the last time you heard about anyone conducting an experiment with planets?

Astronomy is obviously not a hard science.  Neil DeGrasse Tyson is absolutely not a scientist.  The theory of evolution is absolutely a scientific theory, and it could easily be falsified if it were not true.  All evidence that has been collected supports the theory.

Economists build complex models based on economic data that takes account of an enormous amount of data.  They adjust their models over time in am attempt to get them to better model reality.  This is the exact same thing that "climate scientists" do, but economics is not a science.  What's the difference?

Why should we put more any more faith in one group of people with flawed computer models than we do another?

&gt;Not really, did you even read your own BP-sponsored article? He claims that the global warming caused by carbon dioxide was mitigated by another factor, not that carbon dioxide doesn't cause warming.

That's an extreme distortion of what he said in the article, and I never implied that he said carbon dioxide doesn't cause warming.  The argument I'm making is that the contribution to warming from carbon is vastly overstated for political reasons. &gt; Astronomy is obviously not a hard science. Neil DeGrasse Tyson is absolutely not a scientist.

Neil Tyson has a doctorate in PhD in astrophysics, which is a branch of physics and closely related to the rest of the discipline. It doesn't get any more "hard science" than that. What's next,  Stephen Hawking is not a scientist?

Climate scientists and economists aren't the only ones using numerical models. They're used to model protein folding, engineers use them to simulate car crashes or how fuel particles move around in a reactor. Economists would have to predict human behavior which is an entirely different beast.  &gt;Neil Tyson has a doctorate in PhD in astrophysics, which is a branch of physics and closely related to the rest of the discipline. It doesn't get any more "hard science" than that. 

He doesn't perform experiments at all so he is not a scientist.  He describes himself as an educator, not a scientist.

&gt;What's next, Stephen Hawking is not a scientist?

Correct, Stephen Hawking is a physicist.  The distinction is useful.  It is unfortunate that you were never properly taught how to determine what science is and what science isn't.  I'm not trying to take anything away from Physics, but the approach to doing physics is different than the approach to doing science.  Some physicists do experimental, scientific work.  Stephen Hawking does theoretical work which is more mathematical than scientific.

&gt;Economists would have to predict human behavior which is an entirely different beast.

The economy is a highly complex, non-linear system which you can attempt to model but your model will never approximate reality.  The climate is a highly complex, non-linear system which you can attempt to model but your model will never approximate reality.  I fail to recognize what the major distinction is that makes the work of the climate "scientists" any more scientific than the work that economists do.
 [deleted] [deleted] There are three types of anthropogenic climate change deniers:

1. People who have not sufficiently studied the topic. 
2. People who have studied the topic but lack the ability to comprehend such a vast and complicated subject.
3. People who have studied the topic, are capable of understanding it, but are lying for some gain.

That's it. 100% of climate deniers are either lazy, stupid or lying... and now we know which box this guy fit into.

Source: I'm a geochemist/geophysicist doing paleoclimate and environmental work for a very large oil company. 

 I think there is often more nuance involved than is considered here. Let me also open by saying that I don't deny the existence of anthropogenic climate change.

That said, the non-deniers are often guilty of a similar level of dishonesty as the deniers. Specifically I often see headlines quoting IPCC worst case scenario numbers used to later promote 'change', i.e. reduction in GHG emissions. But, if you follow those worst case projections then you should also follow their conclusion, which is we're fucked no matter what we do. If your going to use those projections to draw attention to your position you should not be talking about prevention, you should be talking about mitigation as prevention is no longer on the table. 

The problem in this whole thing isn't the deniers, it's the lack of meaningfully actionable information clearly presented to the populous. Well, that and a populous that can't see past next week, but that isn't a problem that is going away any time soon. &gt;The problem in this whole thing isn't the deniers

The problem is the politicization of science There's a lot of money to be made in the green-scene, on both sides. Wind farms wouldn't be around without the billions they get in subsidies and tax-breaks.

I'm not a denier, but I'm more disgusted with the "green" side of energy production, because they take their government funds and retain their air of moral superiority while they do it. Uh, and this is a problem because of what, exactly? The entire reason for government subsidies is to allow the existence of an industry that wouldn't otherwise be profitable because it has non-revenue-generating qualities that we find worthwhile. In the case of green energy, we find it worthwhile because it doesn't destroy our planet. Yet we are apparently supposed to begrudge these businesses the subsidies they receive?

 Uh, yes. They're corporations that lobby for handouts and protections to sell an inferior and more expensive product. Is what they're offering even relevant after that? I mean, we've set up a situation where corporations are laughing all the way to the bank with our money *and* we're congratulating them for it. If that's not worthy of disdain I don't know what is.

I'm hoping future technologies will be our solution, not the implementation of bad ones at the taxpayer's expense. OK, so it seems like an explanation of subsidies is in order. New technology, like green energy tech--Tesla is a good example of a green tech company that's been subsidized--is expensive because it's new and still bearing large development costs and hasn't been ramped up to large-scale production. This new technology is often desirable for various reasons: new tech sometimes makes the economy better in general because of efficiency gains, other times it might make the world better because it helps the environment like green tech, or for some other reason. 

We decide that we'd like for the new tech to be successful, so we give it a leg up with a subsidy, which basically allows the company to compete on equal footing with the more mature and established technologies. As a result,  the new tech becomes successful faster and becomes more widely adapted faster. That's the goal of a subsidy, and it's the reason we've used them with green tech. 

So again, how is this a problem? This isn't about "inferior and more expensive" products, it's about ushering in the future, which seems to be something you're in favor of.  My problem lies with the fact I'm skepitical wind and solar are ideal alternatives, and I feel we're desperate and well-intentioned enough to dump billions in state funds into corporate pockets to fund inherently inferior (albeit greener) technologies.

I'm holding out for more development of nuclear, geothermal, hydro,  and in the future fusion power to be our best alternatives; alternatives both cheaper and less polluting than fossil fuels. The problem is they're not as easily marketable to uninformed taxpayers as wind and solar. How are you defining "inferior" technologies?  Sure, oil and coal are cheaper than solar or wind, but that's not factoring in the substantial social and environmental costs associated with fossil fuel based power generation. It's easy to nitpick over which options you think should receive funding, and I do it sometimes too, but I think it's better to focus on the bigger picture, especially as we're still trying to feel out what the next generations of energy tech will look like. I agree with you about those options all being among the most promising for the immediate future, but I also think it's important for us to include those options as part of a holistic approach that takes every possible angle. Wind and solar aren't ideal options *now*, but in 30 years they might be.  Solar and wind are the ideal accompaniment to baseload nuclear generation, while they aren't perfect by any means they are clearly superior to coal. Not sure why you got downvoted. Redditors be silly sometimes.

I'd like someone to name me one energy industry that has not been heavily subsidised by the government. Oil and coal got their free guv'ment money, there's no reason to begrudge the renewable sector for getting the same leg up.  I think exactly because industries like oil and gas have gotten subsidies, people view them as little nuggets of free money that you get from being corrupt, instead of seeing them for what they are actually supposed to be. I remember there was a big uproar earlier this year about how Tesla wouldn't be profitable if not for their "dirty" government subsidies, and I'm sitting here like, "Okay, so the subsidies did exactly what they were supposed to do! What's the issue here, exactly?" A problem born from ignorance, but if you try and educate these people you'll likely be accused of being a "leftie" (or a "rightie") or whatever convenient stereotype they can apply to you. &gt; Not sure why you got downvoted. Redditors be silly sometimes.

I down voted because:

&gt; In the case of green energy, we find it worthwhile because it doesn't destroy our planet.

Requires a strong citation. I know it's the common argument, but for most 'green tech', it doesn't hold water under scrutiny, and I've spent a lot of time working on it.

 Haha, and now you've been downvoted for providing a totally reasonable explanation. 

People must just love clicking that down arrow.

Since you down voted due to no citation, how about throwing up some of your own? I've never seen any reports that say renewable tech does more damage to the planet than fossil fuel extraction, but I'd love to be taught otherwise. The "moral superiority" isn't because they aren't taking money from somebody, it's because their industry isn't doing serious damage to the planet.  If you misunderstood their motives that thoroughly, you really haven't been paying the slightest attention. What's funny is that the scientist in the article isn't a climate change denier either.  He's researching the extent to which solar variation is affecting the climate which requires him to accept that the climate *is* changing. Wait... What? He's researching the extent to which solar variation affects climate.  He posits that solar variation is causing climate change along with greenhouse emissions and various other phenomena.  Right there he stops being a climate change denier. There's also a massive economic incentive to be ahead in these fields that should factor into your judgement.  Oil companies have probably gotten more tax breaks.

http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2014/04/oil-subsidies-energy-timeline &gt;I'm not a denier, but I'm more disgusted with the "green" side of energy production, because they take their government funds and retain their air of moral superiority while they do it.

Don't they deserve it? The moral superiority comes from "green" energy generation, not being profitable. This is bullshit. Just because there isn't consensus on every little thing about climate change doesn't mean that there isn't agreement about many of the things that we can do in general to counter it. The problem is absolutely in the deniers, because they give politicians the cover they need to do nothing to solve the problem.  The fact that this person is even saying shit like "the *non-deniers* are often guilty..." is problematic. You fall into the "polarized" camp of "non-deniers" if you acknowledge facts, and likewise you're equally guilty? Apply that logic to any other situation in which one antagonistic group of people is fanatical and uneducated on a topic and is rejecting observable facts about it. It would be outright insane. Somehow the anti-climate science PR campaign has convinced people that it's socially acceptable to be batshit crazy in this one area. Because you're a "skeptic." You're "critical."

No. Fuck that "everybody has an opinion" bullshit. I'm so sick of this childish hand-holding we do for people with terrible opinions. You don't get a fucking participation ribbon for being an ignorant asshole. There is a wealth of data proving the trends these scientists are discussing, so this whole thing inquiring about a unanimous consensus is already pushing positivist logic into an opinion-based area where it probably doesn't belong. 

This person - like probably millions of others - is confused about modeling and the fact that media representations are not written up and reported by the scientists themselves to your TV screen. A single model out of dozens makes a bold prediction - media outlets hype it up - it doesn't pan out that way - therefore science must be wrong? No.

You're right - the problem absolutely is deniers, and more specifically the people who fund them. Their entire goal is to confuse and misinform the public. They don't get to have equal footing with the people whose intent and job duty is to inform the public honestly.  Surely mitigation is the prevention of some damage? I'll admit I fall into the latter category. I remember growing up the polar ice caps were supposed to be completely gone by something like 2025. It's hard to take predictions seriously when they keep presenting moving targets. 

I think it's happening, but it's not as dire as people put forth.  I'm curious, are mitigation and provention significantly different courses of action? 

If we *don't* assume the worst case scenario, is that a viable position upon which to base future plans? If these are viable 'worst case' scenarios, then it's not dishonest to promote them to draw attention to the issue. Denying the issue exists at all, however, is outright dishonesty, no? 

If you had a 'small' tumor, and the Dr said "hey, it's only little, these things sometimes go away all on their own, lets not bother treating for it." - how would you feel about that?  To use an example, should we:

A) Focus on reducing emissions

B) Focus on planning Netherlands style sea walls around coastal cities and relocating populations we can't protect.

I'm not saying either is 'correct', but if you argue for the worst case IPCC projections, then plan B is the only option as plan A isn't going to have a meaningful impact on the need to do B. Thanks for expressing what I have been trying to say for months but couldn't find the words for! what the wat? 

"dishonesty" is warning about the worst-case scenarios predicted by the models? 

"Fucked no matter what we do"? Well our "fuckedness" is not a binary . There are degrees of fuckedness and we can always do something to reduce it. 

Are you saying that there is dishonesty in saying we can prevent climate change? Find me a single paper or scientist who claims we can completely stop climate change. I think in every case "prevention" is referring to the extent of the problem. 

And yes, the deniers are a problem. Also the millions who describe themselves as "unsure" because of the work of the deniers. And because the deniers have done well to demonise solutions to the point where they are political nightmares. There are clear solutions, the problem is political will which is a function of popular opinion leveraged by corporate pressure.  Have you thought about doing an AMA perhaps? I hate these articles labeling coal &amp; the oil industry as one giant group called "fossil fuels industry".

It's so sophomoric, sadly, most citizens of the world don't realize that oil company &amp; coal company interests are often opposites.

I don't know of any significant oil company which doesn't accept that human accelerated climate change is a truth.

I mean, the CEO's of Shell/Chevron/Exxon are either engineers of geologists or geophysicists. 

I understand I'm coming across as "butthurt" to most Redditors, all I wanted to say is that the oil industry employs the world largest concentration (and most talented) geoscientists. I don't know of anyone who I work with who doesn't believe in climate change.

Disclaimer: Am reservoir engineer intern at a supermajor. CEO of Shell is chemical engineer, CEO of Chervron has MBA and no engineering or geophysics experience and CEO of Exxon has a civil engineering degree. Neither of these 3 has geophysics/geology degrees; MBA and civil engineering are not even related to geophysics/geology. Chemical engineering is sort of relevant.  Chevron's CEO is an odd one out.

CEO of Shell/Exxon/Statoil/BP (previous CEO of BP was geophysicist) all had a ton of experience in upstream oil and gas- reservoir engineering or drilling.

Major doesn't matter so much as job profile. A Civ E can become a drilling engineer, a Chemical engineer can become a reservoir engineer. &gt; I don't know of any significant oil company which doesn't accept that human accelerated climate change is a truth.

Yet they have also [funded lobbying groups that cast doubt and spread misinformation surrounding climate change.](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/28/climatechange.fossilfuels) And yeah, they cut funding to many of those groups. When they got called out on it.

Furthermore, while they acknowledge the existence of climate change they [downplay its impact and the need to take action.](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/28/exxonmobil-climate-change-rex-tillerson)

As far as I'm concerned that puts them in category 3:

&gt; People who have studied the topic, are capable of understanding it, but are lying for some gain. He's not wrong. Humans will adapt to cleaner energy by ourselves. Economics is the only way of achieving a result, sorry to burst your idealist bubble.within the century, we will stop using oil for transportation, that's a given. So we should wait for it to work itself out, and in the meantime make no attempt to minimize the damage? Recognizing a problem and addressing it is not idealism, its just common sense. I never said that we aren't fixing it:) electric vehicles and solar power are becoming more popular as we speak. Emissions in the EU &amp; North America have been substantially reduced, and the fuel economy of all vehicles is rising at breakneck speed. There is no need for drastic measures, that is my view.Why break some teeth along the way if you shift abruptly?
 As far as I know there is one and only one oil company still denying anthropogenic climate change... Koch Industries. 

In coal I believe Koch has a partner with Peabody and Alpha. Even Arch and CloudPeak admit reality these days.


 Koch Industries isn't an oil comapny.

They don't operate any wells, they don't drill, they aren't a servicing company.

They are a midstream and downstream pipeline/refinery operation.

Hardly an oil company. Also, the two brothers are religious zealots. Koch Industries operates three production facilities in Alberta and holds over 1.1 million acres of leases there.

Koch Exploration operates their Rocky Mountain and GoM holdings.

KEC has been drilling wells since the 1950's

I don't know where you're getting your information, but the Koch's have been in up, mid, and downstream for decades. I went to their website and judging by how it looks...it's about as big a company as Aptera Motors...you're going to call koch industries an oil company based in a tiny,tiny shell company that probably produces enough gas to power Dewey,Oklahoma for a week.Yea ok... &gt;judging by how it looks

Always a great idea to judge a company based on their website. Let me introduce you to Berkshire Hathaway... the investment company valued greater than the entire Russian economy:

http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/

I guess Warren Buffet is really a paperboy in Iowa based on that website.

 Every single oil company says how much it's production is, etc. This company doesn't show anything. Furthermore, I've never heard of koch exploration. It's a tiny, tiny company.Irrelevant. Every single publicly traded company states it's production. Koch is privately held. Therefore they have no legal responsibility to declare and furthermore not declaring gives them a strategic advantage. The reason you know little about KEC is because they use an amalgamation of smaller subsidiaries. People ignore when Mom-N-Pop oil buy a few thousand acres... Then a different Mom-N-Pop buy the neighboring couple thousand... Then a different one buys a few. Everyone notices when Koch buys a chunk. Just look at how they used smaller subs to out-maneuver Shell and Strata in the Peace River Play.

Just because you don't know things doesn't mean they don't exist. Seriously, spend 5 minutes looking up things on DrillingInfo before you post. 

 Koch Exploration isn't even in the top 20 private oil companies in North American production...

So my point still stands. You're trying to make a big fuss about an insignificant enterprise. Climate change isn't hard to explain and understand. All you need is one semester's worth of chemistry knowledge.  [deleted] *Psssst*...CO2 traps longwave radiation.

EDIT: I wish they hadn't deleted their comment; it was a solid set of points about how to respond to denialists, with just one understandable mistake.  I hope I wasn't an asshole in the way I said that. I find it humorous that this list works perfectly for people that believe in the religion of climate change as well. You could make the claim he just did about any subject. It's bulletproof. Disagree? You're lazy, stupid, or lying. Poof! No argument necessary. Conclusory statements are fun. Yeah the whole thing is political, and wholly unscientific.  how is it unscientific? Science is supposed to be the unbiased observer of the universe. It does not take political sides, it does not say things like "denier" and it certainly does not draw conclusions on insufficient data.    I'll agree on everything

How is the AGW unscientific though? &gt;religion of climate change...

sigh I think I am a number 2.
Can you explain a few things for me?

The global temp has not gone up for over 18 years despite massive amounts of CO2 being released. What I can't figure out is, as the heat should be in the mid to lower troposphere as the models predict to give us the 2 to 3x positive feedback that will produce catastrophic warming, but it is not there. The models don't care about surface temps since they cover only 30% of the earth. And if it is in the oceans as they now think it may be, the models don't plan for this or account for it, are the models wrong? And which model is correct? +1c or +2c or +3 or +4c? Even the average of them shows more warming than is actually there.
How come the actual temps recorded by weather balloons and Satellite measurements are much lower than the models predict? The IPCC wrote about it in the last report, that the models don't match reality but they didn't go beyond just recognizing the pause in warming.Does this mean the models are wrong and if they are wrong aren't the dire predictions of these models then also wrong?

Thanks for your help, I have emailed climate scientist with these questions but no one was contacted me with answers and as you seem versed in the subject I am hoping you might be able to provide some answers. This is a great series of questions! I do modelling of a pretty well understood science within very small systems and the models always have variances in them. I'd like to know how climate models are validated with such certainty. I'm not being passive-agressive here or anything, I'm genuinely curious! It often seems that the explanations being given, as Cli-Che Guevara pointed out, are poorly understood by the layman. What explains these variances in climate models? Another honest question I have is who sponsors the climate research that everyone tends to agree with? Everyone is quick to point out when energy companies do it but is there another side to that coin? Do people/companies that stand to benefit from the demise of traditional energy supplies ever sponsor research that is beneficial to their side? Genuinely curious as it never seems to be asked (people don't seem to look into the sources of research dollars unless it goes against what they believe which seems short sighted) and people always tend to find/gravitate towards articles, research, etc. that align with their narrative of a situation. Allright, I'll bite... Earth scientist in training reporting in, here.

Global circulation models of the type often used to forecast climate predictions for the next several hundred years are validated through hindcasting of the known temperature and climate record of the past 150 years. In layman terms, that means that the model is developed independently of known temperature records and so forth, fed as little data as possible other than needed source/sink terms, (anthropogenic emissions, solar radiation data, etc...) and tested by generating a 'prediction' of climate for the past century and a half. Most of the models cited by the IPCC and other major scientific bodies perform this hindcast with excellent accuracy, increasing confidence in their ability to forecast climate.

Variance from model to model often depends on differences in assumptions made when parameterizing each model. This of course differs from research team to research team, and accounts for the fact that the community may not yet agree on, for instance, the precise magnitude of marine biological fluxes of carbon, and can therefore cover both bases this way.

As for sponsors, **JUST READ ANY ACADEMIC PAPER**. Specifically, **READ THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS SECTION**. Often, it's the National Science Foundation, or maybe NASA, or even the Department of the Navy. Abroad, it's generally some analogous national scientific foundation or body. It's really that boring and simple, unless you happen to subscribe to the whole 'secret funding by anarchists and communists' conspiracy theory, in which case I'm just wasting my breath. 

I'm a PhD. student in oceanography, by the way. Private sources of funding for our kind of research are virtually nonexistent. We're not biomedical engineers or cancer researchers. That kind of money isn't interested in what we do.

A bit of common sense goes a long way. The expected financial incentive for renewable energy interests to shadily sponsor a climate modeling paper is **nil**. The connection between some random climate model and any potential future revenue is **far** too **ludicrously** tenuous for **any** self-respecting marketer or accountant to justify to upper management. At any rate, it doesn't take a genius to open one's eyes and notice just how much **comically** larger the oil and gas corporations' war chests are when it comes to dollar amounts. 

Seriously... if science could really be bought en masse to the degree evidenced by the global consensus on climate change today, climate science would actually have allied itself with fossil fuels a long long time ago. Wow! Thanks for the answer. Much appreciated soon to be Dr. Nikita! Us layman sometimes need hand holding to understand the ludicrous nature of our questions and I, as I am sure many others, are not often able to **READ ANY ACADEMIC PAPER. SPECIFICALLY THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS** so we differ to those better versed. I just thought I'd ask a question. 

TIL! Two words. Google Scholar. &gt; Another honest question I have is who sponsors the climate research that everyone tends to agree with? 

Various science academies from around the world support the consensus on AGW theory. There is no one single source of financing, but many, including private and public ones.

If AGW was a fake issue manufactured by scientists hired by Big Green, it would have fallen apart by now. Remember the theory is more than 100 years old... &gt; The global temp has not gone up for over 18 years despite massive amounts of CO2 being released.

[Is this really true?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming#mediaviewer/File:Global_Temperature_Anomaly.svg).

It's true that the 5 year running mean (which gives a bit of smoothing of year to year variations) has not gone up *much* since about 2004 (11 years, not 15), but before that (2000-2004) there was a sharp rise, so a longer smoothing timescale would give an increasing temperature curve.  There was similar fall/plateau from 1989 to 1994 and then temperature took off again.  And the error bars (green) are fairly big, obscuring variations on short time scales.

And the annual means after 2000 (black squares) are reaching a new peak every 3 or 4 of years, though the average is pulled down by lower intervening years.

This is like saying "the stock market doesn't go up over time because it was flat last autumn."

You're rebutting a strawman argument, the idea that for global warming to be in effect we need to see rising temperatures over a timescale of X (where you got to pick X). Ocean temperatures Your information is hopelessly out of date.

Instead of emailing people, check out Dr. Gavin Schmidt's [blog](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/05/start-here/) for yourself--it answers your questions as well as most of the common pseudoscientific arguments that have been trotted out over the last few decades. I'm not sure what information I've provided is out of date as I have only asked a few questions. Thanks for the blog, I'll give it a look!  &gt; The global temp has not gone up for over 18 years despite massive amounts of CO2 being released

Google image search for ["global temperature trends"](https://www.google.com/search?q=global+temperature+trends&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vA3pVJ_sC8eyggTDw4OwCg&amp;ved=0CEUQsAQ&amp;biw=1297&amp;bih=955)

I did find one clearly downtrending graph that led me to [this page](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-h-gleick/breaking-news-climate-cha_b_2994164.html).

Perhaps you don't fall into category two after all.  I doubt you're a category three guy.  You've clearly studied it, so you aren't category one.

Perhaps /u/Cli-Che-Guevara left off a very important category, category 1B: People who have clearly studied the topic, but have not paid attention to the credibility of their source material.

There is a subgroup of this category as well: People who have clearly studied the topic and have paid attention to their sources, but sincerely believe that the majority of scientists are being duped by a cabal of malicious interests that prevent the actual truth being known; or that most scientists are actually part of aforementioned cabal, to secure lucrative research grants for fictitious issues.  Anti-vaxxers, flat-earthers, moon-landing-deniers, fall into this category.

Edit: a word I love the idea that there's a cabal of people and groups maliciously interested in the environment - with deep pockets - and that it *isn't* oil and gas businesses, and industrialists... Having secret meetings, rubbing their hands together, twirling their moustaches...

"gentlemen, plan "Make The World A Better Place" is a go....muwahahahahah1!!" It's a Chinese plot to curb cheap energy production in the United States. Or its a liberal money making scheme where they're able to manipulate carbon credits to their advantage, and push expensive green projects with federal aid/taxes.

Those are the explanations I've heard. I do like yours the most, though.

edit: sneaky autocorrect on new phone. Also Al Gore. He's the mastermind somehow. He invented climate change doncha know.  Excellent point but I'd call it 2B because these people are failing to understand how to judge sources. &gt;but sincerely believe that the majority of scientists are being duped by a cabal of malicious interests that prevent the actual truth being known

I don't think climate scientists have been duped by anyone. I think climate scientists generally believe climate science is the most important thing going on today and if everyone doesn't do what the climate scientists say the climate scientists believe things will be bad. &gt; I did find one clearly downtrending graph that led me to this page.

*Sigh*.   There will now be idiots bookmarking that page and quoting it in their arguments until the end of time.  I can see it now:  
"Sir, in your argument against human related climate change you quoted (and posted a graph from) a HuffPo page posted on April 1."

"So?" Where does the stupid idea that there has been no warming in 18 years come from? [Last year was the warmest atmospheric year on record]( http://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/january/nasa-determines-2014-warmest-year-in-modern-record/), despite no El Nino. And 2010 before that, and 2005 before that, so apparently despite this "pause" the hottest year on record has been broken 3 times since 1998. Not to mention that 1998 was an outlier year with a powerful El Nino, all of the ten hottest years on record other than 98 have been Since 2002. I mean, I get why people wouldn't understand what an "outlier" is, because statistics are the tool of Satan or something, but seriously... It was big news, on every major network but Fox News. You'd think that people who pride themselves on saying that they're "well-informed" would at least have had the decency to have come up with some tortured explanation for how it doesn't count because of reasons. &gt; Last year was the warmest atmospheric year on record

Maybe, according to NASA it was 0.02C warmer than 2010, but with a 0.1C margin of error. Note that the margin of error is 5 times larger than the measured increase.  And yet the same record high was measured across three major and separate climate analyses, including NOAA, NASA, and the [JMA](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/record-2014-hottest-year-18502). Even if we dismiss that as meaningless, the margin of error for the past decade being warmer than the previous one is far, far less due to a larger dataset.

2010 wasn't the baseline being brought up, either - it was 1998. That margin of error also means that the warming could be much worse. But we use the data we have, not how we hope the data is. This appears to be the kind of thing that they're talking about.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_hiatus

Global average surface temperatures have not risen substantively for the last 18 years.  This is only one measure of global warming, where other measures (like sea rise, polar ice, etc.) continue to show evidence of warming.  This would also not be the first time in the last century or two where global warming did not rise on a short term average, but over longer measures (say 30 year averages or more) the trends are still robust.

I believe the last IPCC report referenced this indirectly, pointing to a deceleration (not halt) of increased temperatures over the last, say, 30 year window.  I'd have to reread it.  I think they also made specific reference to models which had descriptively shown why that might be occurring.

The scientific consensus appears to basically be that this "halt" was measured over too short a period, and exhibited in too few measures, to be considered a harbinger of anything.

EDIT: In reference to your specific source, check out their graph at about 36s into the video.  5-year running-average global surface temperatures, over that timeframe, are basically flat.  But year to year to year, they flick up and down rapidly.  [More data here](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/) Again, that doesn't mean that the long term trend isn't still increasing, and there are other indicators that are still climbing.

EDIT PARTIE DUEX: The relevant summary from the IPCC Working Group I report on the science and data concerning climate change [[Report available here]](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/) gives the following summary in SPM (Summary for Policy Makers) Part D1:

&gt; The observed reduction in surface warming trend over the period 1998 to 2012 as compared to the period 1951 to 2012,
is due in roughly equal measure to a reduced trend in radiative forcing and a cooling contribution from natural internal
variability, which includes a possible redistribution of heat within the ocean (*medium confidence*). The reduced trend
in radiative forcing is primarily due to volcanic eruptions and the timing of the downward phase of the 11-year solar
cycle. However, there is *low confidence* in quantifying the role of changes in radiative forcing in causing the reduced
warming trend. There is *medium confidence* that natural internal decadal variability causes to a substantial degree the
difference between observations and the simulations; the latter are not expected to reproduce the timing of natural
internal variability. There may also be a contribution from forcing inadequacies and, in some models, an overestimate of
the response to increasing greenhouse gas and other anthropogenic forcing (dominated by the effects of aerosols). {9.4,
Box 9.2, 10.3, Box 10.2, 11.3}

*medium confidence* and *low confidence*, in this context, are qualitative descriptions refering to the number and consistency of lines of evidence for a particular claim.  *low confidence* would largely indicate that there are few lines of evidence and incomplete agreement among them.  *medium confidence* indicates that there could be more lines of evidence but less consensus, or that there are few lines of evidence, but their consensus is robust, or somewhere in between. The warming has really been much slower in the past 15 years, just check the IPCC reports.

EDIT: This is from the latest IPCC report:

"The rate of warming of the observed global mean surface
temperature over the period from 1998 to 2012 is estimated to be around one-third to one-half of the trend
over the period from 1951 to 2012" It actually says since 1880.. Which means it was warmer 140 years ago what?! Well yeah if you think the Earth was created a hundred years ago. If you believe the Earth is older... http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/01/21/2014-among-the-3-percent-coldest-years-in-10000-years/ &gt; The global temp has not gone up for over 18 years despite massive amounts of CO2 being released. 

That's not really true. [Most datasets show warming for the past 18 years](http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/from:1997/mean:6/plot/gistemp/from:1997/trend/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1997/mean:6/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1997/trend/plot/uah/from:1997/mean:6/plot/uah/from:1997/trend/plot/rss/from:1997/mean:6/plot/rss/from:1997/trend), despite what the denialists keep claiming. Furthermore, remember that this is only for about 4-5% of the total warming. Most of the warming goes into the oceans, and that has shown no sign of slowing down, so, no, global warming has not stopped for the past 18 years.

Now, it is true there has been an apparent *slowdown* in the warming rate since 1998 (a very warm El Nino year), but the truth of the matter is that the warming often "slows down" and "speeds up" when you look at [relatively short periods of time](http://www.skepticalscience.com/graphics/Escalator1024.gif). This is why it's important ot look at the *multi*-decadal trend, and not at cherry-picked periods where short-term natural cycles can (temporarily) mask the [CO2 warming signal](http://www.skepticalscience.com/graphics/FR11_All.gif).

&gt;The models don't care about surface temps since they cover only 30% of the earth.

Not sure what you're trying to say here, but that sounds wrong.

&gt; And if it is in the oceans as they now think it may be, the models don't plan for this or account for it, are the models wrong?

The problem with models occur on "short" decadal periods, mainly because ocean-atmosphere heat exchange cycles (such as El Nino/La Nina, the PDO, etc.) are very hard to predict. Such cycles, however, are trend-neutral on longer timeframes, and so the models are actually more accurate when these get "evened out" over time.

&gt; And which model is correct? +1c or +2c or +3 or +4c? 

That doesn't make sense. It is now how models work. Are you referring to Climate Sensitivity?

&gt;Even the average of them shows more warming than is actually there. 

Actually, climate models are pretty good at predicting multi-decadal trends. It's not fair to fault them for something they're not made to do in the first place (new prediction methods for some of those ocean-atmopshere heat transfer cycles should help, thougt).

&gt;How come the actual temps recorded by weather balloons and Satellite measurements are much lower than the models predict?

Again, they're not really much lower on time scales that matter.

&gt;The IPCC wrote about it in the last report, that the models don't match reality

Yeah, they didn't write this.

I think you may be getting too much of your information from denialist sites, which routinely misrepresent the science in order to mislead people.

&gt;Does this mean the models are wrong and if they are wrong aren't the dire predictions of these models then also wrong?

Unfortunately, it doesn't mean the models are wrong, or that we don't have to be concerned about man-made global warming.

&gt;Thanks for your help, I have emailed climate scientist with these questions but no one was contacted me with answers and as you seem versed in the subject I am hoping you might be able to provide some answers.


[This](http://www.skepticalscience.com/) is a good place to start, and you can also try asking those questions over at /r/askscience. For the uninitiated,  /u/dickmnixon 's comment is a great example of an informal logical fallacy called rhe Gish Gallop. It's basically a spiel of misinformation so voluminous to be practically unanswerable.  Since he cites no sources for any of his claims, there is no way to discover where he gets his ideas from.  Since a scientific argument hinges on the credibility of its sources,  most scientists wouldn't attempt to engage something like this- there is nothing there to argue with.  It looks impressive to some people, though. Yep, I've seen creationists who think Duane Gish is totally awesome for developing this. Conservapedia praises him as a "prolific debater" Easy problem to solve. Just blame the Kochs like you normally would. No climate scientist emailed you back because your questions are based on incorrect information. Do you think they have time to answer the questions of every misinformed person? I see your point. I wasn't trying to sound like a dick btw, sry if it came off that way  It is true that there has been little warming in the past 15 years or so. This is explained in detail in the IPCC reports, see page 679 of this report: https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter09_FINAL.pdf.  The short answer is that there is a lot of variability in the climate, which is hard to model. The models will work fine if you take long enough time intervals. There is good evidence that energy is still being pumped into the system (meaning earth) and that overall the physics is understood well. During the past 15 years sea level has continued to rise at a steady rate for example. The way I understand it, it's not fully understood why precisely the models fail, but it's probably a combination of several factors. &gt;I think I am a number 2

Yes, but *who do you work for??* I am a landscape photographer who lives in Vienna Austria. I don't have a job, my wife works so I can take pictures. /r/askscience exists exactly for this reason... overly technical replies to simple questions. Have you tried posting there? &gt; pause in warming

Have you read this? 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_hiatus

Seems to have a few ideas, including volcanic activity (which has been in the news) I'm not a climate modeler so I won't be the best person to answer the specifics of  your questions but I may be able to help you with an apparent misunderstanding of how science works.

The problem with the models is that they are models. All models are wrong, it doesn't matter if it's a climate model, an investment model, or a simple pulley and string model. Models take complicated problems and try to simplify them into quantifiable sets to make predictions. Due to the variables ignored, these predictions are never perfectly correct. As far as I understand, the current oversimplification with climate models is due to the lack of processing power. All climate models average large areas together to treat them as homogenous cells. With current petaflop machines these cells need to be very large due to time and budget considerations. I've heard some people say we'll need to get to exaflop before the cell sizes get small enough for their artifacts to be minimal. Another issue is the unknown-unknowns. How much energy is being adsorbed into oceans? How much is in ice-water phase shifts? How much is in increased wind speeds? How much is in nematode migration?

So, are the models to be ignored because they don't perfectly match measured trends? Should they be ignored because they might not have every variable in them? If all models are wrong why do scientists, financiers, businessmen, mathematicians, artists use them? The answer is simple. Models don't answer questions, they point in the right direction. They minimize risk. For climate we know how CO2, CH4, and water vapor interact with various wavelengths of radiation. We know that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and oceans has been rising as a direct result of human activity. We know there is an apparent correlation between CO2 and temperature in paleoclimatic proxies. And the models point in the same direction as reality. 

A good parallel is oil exploration. We're drilling holes in the ocean floor deeper than 35,000 feet based on limited data-sets. The information we use has either very poor coverage or very poor resolution. Since we're missing huge amounts of information, our models have huge flaws in them. These holes cost hundreds of millions to over a billion dollars to drill and all too often we don't find what we're looking for. Since our models don't always hit 100% accuracy should we just go home? So should we stop drilling for oil or should we use our models as guides to minimize risk?

You can pull apart any model to show it has flaws. They are flawed by definition. The question is if they are too flawed to be of use. I'll leave with saying I wish oil exploration models were as accurate as climate models.

tl;dr. Ignoring a tiger because it's stripes look a little different from what you expected is a bad decision. It's still a fucking tiger. Thanks for the explanation. I get the idea of them pointing in the right direction is a better indicator than asking for exact predictions in the models. My next question would be at what point do you invalidate a model because it is so far outside the empirical evidence? Because a lot of the climate models are indicating heating that is not there and it is these over heated models that some climate alarmist tend to claim is what will happen in the future. &gt; The global temp has not gone up for over 18 years despite massive amounts of CO2 being released.

This link explains everything you need to know: http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-stopped-in-1998.htm

TL;DR: The global temperature *HAS* gone up in the last 18 years. &gt; I have emailed climate scientist with these questions but no one was contacted me with answers

Understand that these people don't have the time to put up with every person who is simply unwilling to accept that factual data that is out there. They've published the data but you aren't willing to accept it. I'd love to be wrong, but I'm guessing that you aren't about to reconsider your position on climate change despite your information being proven incorrect by multiple comments. Instead of looking at what the data supports, climate change deniers look for data to support their view. And there isn't any, so you have to make it up. All for the want of a more convenient world where humans can do whatever they want. Its like thinking that you can eat nothing but junk food and smoke all you want and their will be zero health consequences.

All you really need to know is that increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increases the greenhouse effect. Denying that is like denying that gravity attracts objects. Its really that simple. I would say we have a better understanding of the greenhouse effect than we do of gravity.  Watch out, he's tied to the fossil fuel industry.   What an utter crock. How about 4?

&gt; 4. People who have studied the topic and find the entire premise awash in pseudo-science, alarmism, and politically charged claptrap?  

Nah, has to be bad motives. I hate to break it to you, you're a category 2 guy.  If they have studied the topic, are capable of understanding, but are upset by any pseudo-science, alarmism, or claptrapary to the extent of denying anthropogenic climate change as a whole... they still fall into #3.
 Why so defensive?  If you really believe in anthropogenic climate change then you should let the facts stand for themselves instead of name-calling.   Yes, because climate alarmists [never lie.](http://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/18888-embarrassing-predictions-haunt-the-global-warming-industry) Not what he said. Non sequitor / tu quoque.  In this subthread: "Stop insulting people who reject gravity! You act like gravitationalists never lied about universal expansion. If gravity's real then why hasn't the moon fallen down, huh?" 

Sometimes there really is only one side to an argument. Human impact on the planet can absolutely fuck with climate, and all evidence suggests it has. The consensus is more one-sided than a Russian election. In related news, evolution is real, the Earth goes around the sun, and diseases are caused by germs.  I'd add 

* People who don't even care about the issue's merits but argue vociferously against it for the sole reason that the "other side" supports it.  Facts become unimportant when weighed against hyperpartisanship.  There are more than three types. I can come up with a fourth one:

People who have studied the topic, are capable of understanding it, but the implications of anthropogenic climate change to previously held ideas about personal responsibility and way of life causes a heavy [cognitive dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) that people resolve the dissonance by actively denying to themselves that information which causes conflict. It's not lying, but something people don't even realize they do.
 Where on the scale would you put [this guy](http://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-science-is-not-settled-1411143565)? Non of the three. He is not a denier. 

&gt;Nor is the crucial question whether humans are influencing the climate. That is no hoax: There is little doubt in the scientific community that continually growing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, due largely to carbon-dioxide emissions from the conventional use of fossil fuels, are influencing the climate.
 Hardly anybody 100% completely denies that, the question is how much carbon dioxide really does influence the climate.  Considering the the best models that the climate scientists could come up with predicted temperatures would increase far more that they actually have over the past few decades, I think it's time to reevaluate some of the central assumptions of the climate models.

There has been a significant amount of fear mongering and scare tactics surrounding carbon emissions to the point where certain people have become obsessed with their "carbon footprint".  Reality doesn't match up to the predictions, so forgive me for thinking the "inconvenient truth"  attitude of the fear mongerers is complete bullshit. And your username is very cute. [deleted] Ah, the classic case of ad hominem attacks, where an uneducated individual has nothing worth stating, yet feels he must state something to support his beliefs without evidence. [deleted] Makes sense you would be the type of person who would call anyone who uses a pragmatic term nerdy.

Edit: Welp now /u/bob_barkers_pants deleted his comment. 1) Stop calling people 'climate change deniers', aside from loons no-one claims the climate changes. Stop it.

2) If we're going to play that game there's only three kinds of 'Climate Believers':
- People who have not sufficiently studied the topic.
- People who have studied the topic but lack the ability to comprehend such a vast and complicated subject.
- People who have studied the topic, are capable of understanding it, but are lying for some gain.

The fact that both sides have been shown to engage in insane displays of confirmation bias, profit driven corruption, career building and general ideological 'true faith' style bullshit means the issue isn't just one side or the other but the state of modern science and it's vulnerability to human weaknesses.

That's why the big name politically popular fields are notorious for this kind of nonsense. The politicization of science is an absurdity.
The problem with the scientific community today isn't the fallacy of the ivory tower, but become one of "capture the flag" where you have to pick a side and try and 'win' rather than find the truth.

Ridiculous. Maybe if we paid our scientists what they're actually worth to society we would:

1) have more scientists

2) it would be more difficult to bribe them People who are motivated by money tend to be the easiest to bribe. The US congress is seemingly more corrupt than ever in spite of the fact that [the majority of congress are now millionaires](http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2014/01/10/261398205/majority-in-congress-are-millionaires) for the first time ever. Of course in some instances you could replace "in spite of" with "and as a result of" but most were already wealthy to rich before striking congressional paydirt. You don't win big elections in the US without big money.

I think it's safe to say that scientists, in general, are not motivated by money. It's far more often just a cumbersome means to an end. I think the last thing we want is to have scientific research seen as a way to make a good buck. And like was already mentioned, there are already far more researchers than there are positions and that all so sacred grant money for. Most scientists are not greatly motivated by money anyway. Those I know want to live comfortably and have good funding for their research. Beyond that - no interest. Nobody becomes a scientist to get rich. So it's our fault.... We already have way too many scientists. Federal grant acceptance rates are at like 10%. Top journals have acceptance rates below 5%. The number of graduating PhDs is far higher than the number of job positions for them.  Point 2 is just absurd.  You don't know human nature at all.
 What are scientists "actually worth"? How do you know the correct price for scientists and the market does not? [deleted] OP is not a moron--he's a good little propagandist. Most people will only read the headline and won't delve any further to learn that this was a grant that Soon didn't disclose. The misleading "bribe" meme will live on in all subsequent discussions about this highly politicized topic. not disclosing such a huge conflict of interest show a monumental lack of judgment, basically means anything he has said that hasn't been verified by others is void  But... But.. DAE LE EVIL KOCH BROS?  Not only that, but 1.2 million over 10 years is _nothing_.  I saw a speech a few years ago where a scientist derided the Oil industry for spending 16 millions dollars over 10 years on "anti-climate change" lobbying and advertisements.  I was thinking, "Is that it? Is that all you got?"  I worked for a large corp for many years, and we spent like $250k on snacks every year. I love how they use over 10 years to try and make numbers appear larger. An average of a 120k grant a year to a Harvard professor Is nothing. He isn't a Harvard professor.  I'd like to see how much money Senator James Inhofe has accepted from such sources.  He's the kind of whore who gives whores a bad name - selling out not only the futures of his children and grand-children, but the future of the entire human race. He's either a despicable piece of shit or the biggest moron on the planet. Why choose only one option?  Since the good Senator called for hearings based on ["Climategate"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1qa9xprJ4s) (emails from a few  climate scientist that were illegally hacked), we can be certain that we will soon see his face on C-span condemning the professor.&lt;/s&gt; This.. happens all the time. Just most don't get caught. What a shocker.

My girlfriend is sitting next to me, raging about this. I can only imagine the papers, grants, and applications he reviewed that he should have been kept twenty miles from. The post title should be labeled as misleading. Said denier neither works for Harvard and nor is he a scientist (or, at least, the article accuses him of being a highly unethical one).  risk humanity for a bigger house.  depressing... This is such despicable and disgusting corruption. What if the kid is smoking in the car? You have to shoot him on the spot.  *Club him. This is England remember.  &gt;Club him

[his face after a while](http://summerworkersaccommodation.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Night-Club-Clubbing-Jobs-Abroad.jpg) risky click of the day &gt; risky click of the day

The reply comment that confirms it's safe to click Stabbings seem to be the thing to do there. *Stern talking down to. Wtf do you think this is, some colonial country? England is great.  All the jittery little muggers have knives.  It's like living inside a cartoon for a visiting American. Children shouldn't have to push second hand smoke onto their parents. It might lead them to start smoking. First cell phones, then texting, now smoking.  What's next, not being able to do a line of coke while on the highway?! Driving.

When you think about it, how could you justify putting anyone who can afford it, (regardless of their mental state and whether or not they hold the right political opinions) behind the wheel of 2 ton death machine? Cars cause carbon emissions and destroy the roads that taxpayers expect to be properly paved. As driving is the leading cause of unnatural death in young people, we deserve better from our government. Ban civilian driving! "The cars are fine, its the people driving them that are the problem"

-Google Automated Transport Ad circa 2025
 Sooner than that, I hope. Driver's licenses should be a special permit, like carrying a concealed firearm, notarizing documents, or importing oranges into California. 

But seriously, it shouldn't be "a thing you just get because you're old enough." It should be a thing for enthusiasts and people who have been proven to be safe, aware drivers. I had to do tests to get my license, but then I lived in a Nanny State that controls every facet of my life. I take it you get them there from vending machines or something? Truly the capitalist way is best! You're joking, but I can't wait until we have fleets of electric self-driving Uber cars in every major city, available at the tap of a button. The efficiency boost will be unprecedented. We won't need such large parking lots everywhere because the cars won't have to park the way they do now, sitting completely unused while people eat or shop; traffic accidents will be significantly cut down; transportation will become cheaper (it could realistically be possible to take a self-driving car from A to B at only $.50/mile), so much so that folks won't even need to own their own cars anymore; and it will all be more environmentally friendly.

I honestly see this happening in our lifetime, maybe in a decade or two at most. And it will be revolutionary. So many people say they can't wait for this but as a car person I'm dreading it, I absolutely love driving Honestly, I only think the self-driving cars will rule inside the cities.  
I mean you're not saying, as a car person, that you love driving in the inner city?  

I love driving, but I loathe traffic. If I wouldn't have to deal with traffic and could keep the actual driving to just the highways, I'd be so happy. Think of the way horses went though. Main mode of transportation one day, owned only by enthusiasts the next. I imagine there will still be areas where one could take their car out for a drive in the same way there's trails for other recreational uses. It will probably just be very expensive to own, maintain, and operate one. Meaning it will probably be for rich 5 percenters and mostly illegal.  That's not true of horseriding, so it shouldn't be true of manual vehicle operation. Me too. I do however hate sitting in traffic. I'm both looking forward to and dreading the day self driving cars start being sold to the public. I will love the ability to get stuff done while sitting in traffic or flat out avoid traffic thanks to a more connected less response delayed mode of transportation. Or being able to get hammered and being able to still take your car home. I know when this day comes the timer will start until human drivers are considered too error prone to control cars. They will likely ramp up penalties/fines until driving becomes only for the wealthy and then it will banned. All human driving will be limited to race track/course driving which isn't bad but it's like running on a treadmill when you could be running through a forest. I really hope this comes well after I'm too old to drive.  .50 a mile seems a bit steep  Drinking coffee, sode or eating a sandwhich, peanuts or fries. I have no idea what a sode is, but it sounds like an awesome olde timey insult.  Shut it you goddamn sode. It's called *class*, ya sode.  Or eating a burrito. Never forget the burrito. Next is you're not allowed to drive at all,

/r/selfdrivingcars I want a self-driving car. One that works in inclement weather. I just want to load up directions in Google Maps and let it drive me to White Castle. Is there a White Castle here? I don't even know. I'd settle for KFC... go buy a double down dog and leave vomit trails down the highway while my heart dies from salt intake. That sounds like fun. Let's do KFC.

You comin'? ...Did I just get advertised at? You comin' or not?

You know what? You're not invited. You can't come ride around in my vomit-propelled death car. No. Wait. You're invited. But! You're paying half on fuel. New White Castle slogan.

White Castle: You Comin'? 3am...

"Take me to White Castle."

"The closest White Castle is four hundr..."

***"Take. me. to. White Castle."***

"Commencing drive." &gt;Take me to White Castle."

&gt;"The closest White Castle is four hundr..."

&gt;"Engage"

&gt;"Commencing drive."

If I can't command my vehicle like Jean Luc Picard, what's even the point of it having a computer at all? It wouldn't matter if there is a white castle here. Let the car take you a few hundred miles while you sleep.  Wake up to white castle. Then we can finally Text, Call and Drink in the car! Great. Another reason to get pulled over while I'm curing my hams on the go.

Is there no where safe for a modern butcher? There really isn't. The supermarket chain I did my apprenticeship at has been slowly but surely getting rid of all their butchers in favour of knifehands. The small store I'm at now is struggling to compete with the prices that the supermarkets have with their buying power. Luckily, I'm still young enough to study something else. I really feel for the forty somethings that are watching their career become meaningless but still aren't old enough to retire. What is a knifehand?
 Untrained butcher, less choice for the customer cos there not as well trained but a big saving for the boss because not many people want speciality cuts. Same reason your local butcher shop will never die out. Supermarkets just can't compete with the quality and skill of a local butcher. I always buy my meat from a butcher. Although some supermarket chains have let independent butchers open inside the store. Infact, my local butcher has grown over the last ten years despite having a Tesco and Sainsburys in my small town. I have yet to see a butchers close since they opened nearly 20 years ago. 

I appreciate a butcher.  Also being a knifehand is a great way to LEARN to be a butcher.  Especially if you have experienced butchers working with/above you. Phrasing. I don't get this. I have lived out of home for 20 years now (in Sydney) and eat a good variety of meat. I've never needed a "specialty cut of meat". What's in the supermarket shelves had always been more than adequate. In your defense, I'm sure that it's very hard to cook a gourmet meal without a kitchen.  That, that was fucking good. It was....alright. Its that supermarkets cut meat for profitability. A butcher will cut something to specification. A half inch steak is cool. but an inch and half steak if amazing. its not that it is a "speciality" cut. its more of a custom cute. Conversely, Southern people saying "Bless your heart" is a cute custom. Except that often, it means, "You're a dumbass but I'll be nice about it."

Southern folks have mastered shit talking directly to the face. Non-southerners on reddit need to stop spouting that it "often" means that.

Most of the time, it's meant sincerely. It's not often said to call someone a dumbass, but is definitely used with the correct tone of voice to do so in some situations. No, they have mastered doing it slyly. Go to NYC or Boston if you want true mastery of shit talking with no bull shit :) Well, for you, yeah. If *everyone* wanted specialty cuts, there would be a lot more butcher shops, and butchers at all the grocery stores. It's a martial art strike. These are not pockets, they are sheaths for my knife hands! This seems like it'd be a hilarious cartoon. I wonder what the name would be.

*knifehands* KiYAAAAAA Time for fun martial arts facts: "Ki-hap" is the Korean term for "yell" in martial arts, like Taekwondo. The Japanese term ("Kiai") is very similar, and both are meant to be the words describing a martial arts yell, rather than actually being the words one would yell. Martial arts movies using poor translations contributed to the western view of a martial artist actually yelling "KiYAAAAAA" rather than simply yelling in a martial-artsy manner. Partial Arts a dude with a knife in his hand that makes the same cut over and over again. easier and cheaper to train or hire than a butcher who knows how to cut up many different animals. How the hell do you remember your username? It's a swastika on the number pad.  holy fuck it actually is hahahahhahahaha A tradesman's assistant. Someone who has skills used in the industry but hasn't done an apprenticeship. By law you can't have a knifehand do a butcher's job (it's like a protection racket) but you *can* break that job up into separate tasks and pay someone to do those tasks. The supermarkets have big boning rooms where they can have one person marking a body then another person breaking it, and so on etc. Not so much "by law," more by contract. Shops aren't required to unionize, but many (most) butchers won't work in a non-union environment. Gross, they should do that boning shit at home. Butcher you can pay less. [It's how you point without being rude.](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2169/2178978695_ce8210dbf8.jpg)

 it's so sad how meat has lost its meaning. something that should be respected and valued enough to enjoy good butchering. My small hometown had a butcher shop that we went to every Saturday.  They'd custom cut everything you ordered right there at your request.  They also had a smokehouse on the premises.  I never realized how great it was to have that until I moved away.  I haven't been able to find a single decent butcher anywhere.  It's the only thing I miss about my hometown. It's political correctness gone mad Broken Britain. Cameron's Britain. Vote UKIP! (seriously though, don't do that) &gt;It will not apply to anyone driving alone

... Yes. Good observation. Or was that actually written into the law? No, it's written in so that if a child is smoking whilst driving, they don't get charged with the extra crime. That actually makes a lot of sense I know they did it for kids a few months off the legal age but all I'm picturing is a toddler smoking a huge cigar speeding down the highway. I imagine that it is because the driving age in the uk is 17 and the smoking age is 18. There is no 'smoking age' here in the UK, only a purchase age (18). Smoking age is 18 in the UK, driving is 17. So it (kind of) makes sense. Even if the children are in the trunk? Should be, it's a separate compartment, so I don't see why not. I put my infant in the glove box.  I guess you can say he fits like a glove  http://i.imgur.com/4OQG3At.jpg I'm imagining a sketch comedy where an officer is writing up a ticket for someone smoking because there's a tied up kid in the trunk.  I think they call it the boot in England.  So, even if the boot is in the trunk? I think you mean the boot.  *the boot My kids are going to be pissed they can't smoke in the car anymore.  JOKES ON YOU I GOTTA CONVERTIBLE^and^no^kids Really Tim? It's only 14mg of nicotine. convertible in england? are you sure? England has hugest convertible purchase rate in the world. We are the most sarcastic bunch of optimists you'll ever meet. I saw a dude with his top down in an older convertible Mercedes when it started hammering it down out of no where in the middle of October. He was on the M62 doing 70 in the pissing rain with a scarf slapping him in the face. Looked hilarious. [deleted] If I lived in England and had son, that little son of a bitch would take bus from now. This should be a rule everywhere. I'm not anti - smoking, but you should not be passing secondhand smoke on to your kids.  Especially since they are literally in your charge. Adults have the right to smoke, they don't have the right to force their kids to endure their poor decisions. There are just so many reasons it's a fucking terrible idea to smoke with your kids in the car: asthma, being treated differently by peers (because they smell like smoke), not to mention actually smelling bad, and finally because vaporizers are a thing now, it's not even like you can't get your nicotene fix cheaper and safer in the car anyway. Few parenting decisions strike me as more truly irresponsible. [deleted] Man, my parents and my grandparents would smoke in the car windows rolled up...with me in it.  I was just so accustomed to it. I don't recall any adult or kids making fun of the smell. I started smoking at 13 and thank fucking damn I finally quit last year at the age of 35. Best damn thing I have ever done.  I can't imagine being made fun of for smelling like smoke, but like 50% of my peers in HS smoked. You sure that's the only reason you were made fun of, Coney_Island_Hentai? You might be on to something Fedora_Trenchcoat! Jinkies gang, I think somebody found a clue! My childhood was a walking embarrassment. Between being a ginormous fat kid, everything I owned was drenched in cheap cigarette smoke stench. 

It's been over 20 years and I still remember kids pointing it out and making fun of me because of how strong the smell was. 

2 parents, 3 packs a day each and the belief that windows were designed to stay permanently closed, even in the car, and cheap cigarettes like "Basics" for my mom and "Kools" for my dad sure didn't help the smell at all.  what year was this? I grew up the same way (windows always closed) this is the 80's- 90's Me too, I used to try and cover my face with my shirt in the back without my grandma seeing because if she saw she got really pissed at me. Would never crack a window and everything I took to her house came back stinking. Even my damn Nintendo.  Oh man, my Nintendo consoles. I was astonished when I saw one my friends owned, I just assumed the yellowing was natural.  Do expensive cigarettes smell better? Stale smoke always smells bad to me, especially when it's in large concentrations.

Fresh smoke from a more expensive cigarette seems to smell better, but smoke residue on clothes... I'm not a smoker mind you, so I'm kinda ignorant of this.  Not enough that kids would notice. Do your kids a favour: only smoke expensive cigars in the car. I had chronic ear infections and many surgeries as a kid because of my parents smoking.  I was in horrible pain for a good part of my childhood and missed so many fun events because of it.   I can empathize. I practically grew up in the hospital, under a plastic tent full of mist so I could breathe, constant ear infections and chest colds. My parents smoked in the car and in the house until doctors told them they were probably going to destroy my lungs and I'd have asthma for the rest of my life. Lucky me, I'm now 30 and spend $98 a month on inhalers. -_- I am 30 now but while growing up my mother smoked, my father smoked, my brother smoked, I even had my suspicions about the dog. 

However *I* have never smoked and because I'm use to it other people smoking doesn't bother me, I have no illnesses, no medical problems and ym biarn wroks jsut fnie. I vape, but there's still no way I'm exhaling nicotine infused vapor in my kids face.  And yet, it's not illegal for a pregnant woman to smoke.  I'll take this nanny state law seriously when they make that illegal.   Good luck enforcing that.

Cop: You can't smoke while pregnant ma'am.

Woman: Just because I'm fat doesn't mean I'm pregnant!

Cop: But you're obviously pregnant

Woman: Prove it

Cop: Nevermind  Give cops ultrasound equipment.

Problem solved. That would be even better to see go down. Officers trying to coax women into letting them spread jelly all over their bellies to prove an arrest. as long as the baby has no rights before birth, this still will remain legal.

Edit: seriously? you want to get into this? not entirely sure what US laws are, but in Canada a fetus is not considered a person until birth, and therefore has no rights. That means that any action taken by the mother that can harm the fetus is perfectly legal, as in the eyes of the law, it is only affecting her body. This is the legal framework that establishes that abortion is legal here.

unless that were to change, and call into question abortion law, stuff like this will never be illegal, as as far as the law sees it, the mother is only harming herself. As a pro-choice, I actually have to hand you this argument. Bravo. Yea but what would you do? Put a pregnant woman in jail? That's even worse. Also: hey!!  No smoking when your pregnant. Girl: I'm not. Cop:Uh....  The same thing you would do if she was smoking in the car on the way home from the hospital according to this law. It's a big inconsistency to enforce one and not the other. I doubt you'd be sent to jail if you were in violation of this law. There are many laws that won't result in you going to jail for breaking them. You'd just get a fine. I smoke. I have a kid. I would never ever ever ever ever smoke in the house, in the car, or around him outside. If I want to smoke I smoke like 50 feet away from him. 


He didn't make a shitty life choice, I did. 

Edit: you've all got wonderful advice for me and I do appreciate it I promise. I am in the process of quitting (down to maybe one cig a day if that anymore, so I know I can cut it out entitely). I'm also aware of third hand smoke.. I wash my hands and change my clothes when I can. I look forward to a day when I'm down to none a day.  Speaking as someone who lost their father 2 years ago to lung cancer and just lost my step father to lung cancer last month, if you don't want to hurt your family, quit now. This has been the law in Ontario for quite some time. I ignorantly assumed it was the same everywhere else, good on the UK. Similarly in Australia. Along with pubs, clubs, restaurants, workplaces, beaches, playgrounds, sport stadiums, within certain distances of building entrances, any outdoor eating or drinking place, pedestrian malls, bus stops, taxi ranks, ferry wharves, train stations, light rail stops and public pools. Although the laws aren't universal across Australia, it seems pretty fair to say the Government is pretty keen to cut smoking rates.  So they should. If a person chooses to be a smoker, fine, that's their business - but absolutely no one else should have to put up with second-hand smoke.  Somehow I've lived in Ontario my whole life and never knew this was a law... but I suppose it became one after I was a kid. My parents both smoked in the car (and house) even when I finally got the courage to tell them it was fucking disgusting for me. Unfortunately, the same thing happens to this day if I'm visiting or hitching a ride from either them or my sister. My dad at least tries, but the other two don't even care. I never had any health issues as a kid, but I'm pretty sure it is bound to catch up to me at some point. My Dad used to have a job selling avionics when I was a kid; the company would allow him to use a single-engine plane to fly around the southeast U.S., plus he got to use it a bit for himself, which involved trips for us to visit the grandparents, and also small vacations.
My Dad would just about *chain smoke* in that little cabin - even with the little ventilation ducts, it would be almost suffocating!
 It became the law maybe 6 or 7 years ago I think  Already is in Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Maine, Oregon, Utah, &amp; Vermont. Australia has had this for years. All the way until 16 I believe. So has california.   Up to 16 is the rule, but I find it odd. I grew up in a country town and we all started fagging when we were 13 or 14, thinking we were the bee's knees while we chucked a couple of mainsies with boys who had their Ps. I wonder about how they'd go about ticketing a driver who was smoking in a car full of teeny boppers who were also smoking  Recently saw a similar article posted on Facebook and most of the most liked comments were from Americans blaming Barack Obama for this. Dear President Obama,

I am writing to you to thank you for banning cigarettes in my home country of Great Britain. As I'm sure you know, cigarettes are very detrimental to people's health and not, necessarily, just to the people's directly using them. I wish more foreign heads of states had as much influence on our nation as you do, and I hope you are able to exert the same kind of influence on other countries besides mine.

With Love and Sincerity,
Grateful Brit Dear Queen of England,

You often look like you have a resting bitch face and I want to bang you granddaughter in law.

Thank you, 

America

 I'd bang Kate but I'd also bang a young version of the queen. Like you wouldn't bang present day queen just to say you did... I'd need to think it over for a while but I probably would to be honest. Y'all need Jesus.  Didn't even need to think- I would definitely bang Jesus, given the chance. Now *that* is a personal relationship.  At some point its not about enjoyment its about the prestige Dear America, 

Ew that's your cousin. 

Britain.

PS: please visit more often son. *Queen of the United Kingdom

(because someone has to)  People litterally blame everything on the usa, or Obama.  ...so I'm Canadian and I live in Canada. 

Anytime beer is dropped/spilled at a party a lot of us start yelling, "THANKS, OBAMA!" 

We're very entertained by how Obama is blamed for damn near everything.  Thanks Obama!  Obama banned flavored cigarettes in USA, he will come after them in UK. At least five US states ban smoking in cars with kids: Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Maine and Oregon.  I'm pretty sure its banned here in Canada. But there's also a huge sitgma against smoking here in Canada, more so than other countries I believe. Smoking in cars with children was never socially acceptable.  &gt;smoking in cars with children was never socially acceptable.

I'm going to assume you didn't experience the 80's Being able to remember the 70s and 80s: yes, it was totally normal. 

Those little round holes in the dashboard you plug your phone charger into? They actually used to hold cigarette lighters!
 Sounds a little biased, have you lived in other countries other than Canada. I personally think there isn't a huge stigma here in Canada, sure we put pics of dead babies on our cartons, hid them behind curtains and teen smoking is down but huge stigma is a stretch Canadian smoker here.  In Toronto area, smoking is common and accepted, in Vancouver, different story.  Visited San Diego once, felt like a pariah. I find it a little sad that this law even needs to be implemented. I'm a heavy smoker, but I NEVER smoke around children, even if it means crossing the the street or going out of my way to stay away from kids while smoking. If you smoke with kids in the car you're probably a shitty person.  Both of my parents smoked when I was younger, but they never did it in front of me, in the house, or in the car. Ever. In fact, I can't recall a single image of them smoking a cigarette in front of me. They used to sneak out to the garage to have a puff when I wasn't around. I would occasionally smell a faint odor of smoke from my dad, but that's about it.

Thankfully they both quit a long time ago before my brother was born. I grew up in the 70s. Both my parents smoked in the station wagon while my brother and I bounced around on the mattress in the back. Man those were the days.  My father smoked in front of me, in my room, in the car with me in it. I had/have asthma and maybe my heart murmur was because of it. I.don't know.  My mom would do the same, and didn't stop when I'd pull my shirt over my nose in the car or after I was diagnosed with asthma as a kid. We don't talk anymore.  Good.  My parents used to crack the window a little bit when it was cold, and sometimes it wasn't enough.  Once I started coughing and they didn't like that, so they rolled the windows up all the way and hotboxed me.  I was probably only 9 or so at the time.   This law won't fix shitty parents You're probably right.  But I wouldn't mind if they were punished more often for being shitty parents.  OK. I'll just smoke in my child's bedroom while he is sleeping to make up for it.  Damn it Skyler &gt;The overwhelming majority of smokers know it's inconsiderate to smoke in a car with children and they don't do it. They don't need the state micro-managing their lives.

I don't see the logic here. The law doesn't affect you at all unless you *are* smoking while kids are in the car. *Most people don't commit murder.  Why do we need laws against it?* Damn government micromanaging my life with laws against murder I'm gonna celebrate Americas freedom by driving around with a van full of children while chain smoking with the windows up all we need is the car manufacturers to take that into account and deliver more cars with a [limo-like passenger/driver segregation](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120501034140/tractors/images/e/ec/Limousine_interior_view_%28Montagu%2C_Cars_and_Motor-Cycles%2C_1928%29.jpg). the pro is you'll never have to listen again to "are we there yet?" given you buy the optional soundproof thing too. who wouldn't.  Like the Homer? As a child who's father brought up in a house of smoking (80 cigarettes per day) and told me to go outside if I wasn't comfortable. 

I 100% agree with this law.  As a kid I hated sitting in the smoke trap of a back seat as an Aunt or Uncle chained smoked in the front with only their driver window barely cracked. No, the smoke does not go out the window. Maybe I am the exception but being around an entire family of cigarette smokers made me not want to smoke. I am a smoker and I'm totally in agreement with this.

It's my bad habit. I have to at least make sure i'm not harming anyone else. **Article summary:**

**^Learn ^how ^it ^works: [^Bit ^of ^News](http://www.bitofnews.com/about)** I'm a smoker and even outside I try to stay downwind of anybody who might be affected.  This is just common sense. I wish they had this in the US, it's unreal how many times I see adults smoking around their kids. It's irresponsible &amp; so fucked up.  [It's illegal in California.](http://i.imgur.com/dPzTPJn.jpg) So's everything. except paying entirely too much for everything. [deleted] Your reply is nearly word for word what I wouldve written. I understand you brother/sister. Did she ever yell at you for coughing? My mom did :| My mom blew smoke in my face once for coughing. That only made me cough more. I have the same memories, but with my father :/. His car had an ashtray, so he never rolled down the window while he smoked. It was the worst. That glorious feel when parents  don't smoke.  Lol my parents smoked everything likewise. both my parents have been smoking ever since I was born, and I have asthma too. I blame them for it not getting any better since I still live with them (I'm 18) and still have to endure the secondhand smoke every day. my dad's chain smoking is also tearing the family apart and ruining his health. this ban makes me very happy if not just so people don't have to go through the same shit that we did.    
(edit: I apologize for blowing off some steam, but I'm sick of coughing and wheezing) Yeah it's obnoxious. Nowadays I'm strongly turned off by guys that smoke cigarettes. This law passed in Oregon a few years ago. Along with making it illegal to tan under the age of 18 with out a doctors note. It was a good day.  Is illegal in Alabama of all places as well.   This is excellent news, I'm from the UK and I think it's brilliant! This happened in Ontario a long time ago.  One story that made headlines was a 17ish year-old driver was stopped and ticketed for smoking in a car with a 15 year-old, who then proceeded to smoke her own cigarette in front of the OPP officer. "Drivers in England will be banned from smoking in their cars if they are carrying children as passengers."  

"it will not apply to anyone driving alone".

Well fucking duh. You need a law for this? Although, I see mums with strollers in one hand and fags (to keep with the lingo of article's demographic) in the other, and their kids nearby breathing in and I start to feel sorry for the little ones. I guess... you do need a law to protect kids against stupid people? Whenever you need to ask "you need a law for this?" just remember there are people out there that literally think vaccinations cause autism.
 Best fucking user name^ # [Relevant.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJD1Iwy5lUY#t=45) "Well, I have a million results that say they *don't*, and one result that says they do."

"I. knew it." That's what libertarianism and misanthropy go so well together.  

A stroll through Walmart is the greatest argument for fascism.   If you're so worried about dumb people having kids, just jump to the end result and require government approval to get pregnant.

*It's the only way to be sure.* You shouldn't legislate against those you consider stupid (actually just those you disagree with).

Kind of like how I bet you wouldn't approve of legislation forcing everyone to work until the age of 80. Because with the aging population it's good for society to keep the tax money going. It's *stupid* to think differently. I don't think that law you proposed is constitutional where I live...at least it doesn't sound like it.

Laws reflect our society. Not always in the best way, but that's the aim with this law in relation to our attitude on smoking in cars with children present. I'm only referring to the act of legislating against stupidity. It is a dangerous place to be. I wouldn't create a law that prohibits smoking even though smoking is a stupid habit (people who smoke aren't stupid, addiction is real. Just to clarify.) But forcing a child or an infant to inhale poison against his will? Fuck yea that should be illegal. If not, lets just legalize letting children drink while were at it.   See, again, you can't legislate against stupidity. Educate against it. Stupid people will continue to do stupid things. What about the house? Are you going to legislate against smoking in your house with kids? Or just prohibit smoking around infants\children  in general. Education doesnt cut it when the health of the innocent are compromised because of selfish assholes. Fuck their kids.

Parents that smoke around kids are degenerates. They are going to raise degenerates. Fuck 'em. With today's technologies, work has became so efficient as to not need as many work hours than before. Such an upfront solution won't do anygood, there's simply not enough work to be done to keep everyone working 18-65.

It's however right that pensions are longer than before (and work time is becoming shorter with a longer average studies length) and can't be paid the same way, but some more subtle solutions are, in my humble opinion, in order, such as promoting aprenticeship for young people  where unemployment is massive  with a newly retired mentor who would wish to keep working, although differently. Yeah, you're way off point. &gt; You shouldn't legislate against those you consider stupid

Indeed, you shouldn't legislate against those you consider stupid. You should, however, legislate against those who cause harm to public health. Fuck the public health. You can't run the world as an ambitious capitalist, materialistic society and at the same time legislate people looking out for each other.

It's contradiction on a societal level. &gt; strollers

Got the 'lingo' wrong! You called it!. They're called buggies, prams, or pushchairs here (UK). Hooray for perambulators! :D *Buggy (lingo update) &gt; strollers 
&gt; (to keep with the lingo of article's demographic)

"pram" I'd say buggy is more common https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R6_Chr2vro&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=12s We have several laws against people harming other people. You probably would have the same reaction to those as well (we really need a law to prohibit someone from deliberately taking someone else's life??)

People are selfish. The vast majority of laws are only needed because of a minority of people.  To be fair, your specific example isn't actually damaging for the kid. There's no evidence to suggest that second hand smoke in an open space can affect anyone, not even babies, in a cancerous way. I'm not saying they won't do the same indoors or anything, but specifically what you said isn't actually dangerous for a kid unless the kid responds to cig smoke as an irritant (which you'll know soon enough). Honestly smoking next to your child while outside is very very unlikely to cause any harm whatsoever. That just isn't how smoke works.

Smoking in the car with them, however, actually could be dangerous for them. I have no problem with this law. I don't mind if they're at least outdoors.  I don't smoke but I live downtown and strollers are at SUV exhaust pipe height and it makes me wonder if smoke is really the worst thing my daughter is going to have to deal with on a walk across town I'm surprised this isn't everywhere either. I'm not sure about all of Canada but in Ontario this has been a law since 2009. Manitoban here.  Proud to say it is in effect, and has been since 2013. Don't think it's a law in BC, friend. You get a $109 fine for it in BC. http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-sets-109-fine-for-smoking-in-cars-with-kids-present-1.838560 I think it's time for me to go to sleep.  I read that as "England bans smoking cigars containing children".  In your defence I'm at least 65% sure that it's illegal to smoke cigars containing children, so you weren't wrong. Anyway that sentence seems a bit off. "cars containing children". There should be a law to restrict the children content on car manufacturing :P 

(studying GMAT, I note these things now. Sorry OP.) Same here, we must have the same brand of dyslexia. "The law was passed after two bored law students were flipping through the criminal code and found there was, indeed, no law that prohibited the use of children as ingredients in tobacco products." It bewilders me that parents, knowing how smoking harms adults, still smoke in cars with children in them. 

Some more information on this:

Children are especially vulnerable to secondhand smoke. It is estimated that 23 Australian children under the age of fifteen died from illnesses related to secondhand smoke in 1998. In households where at least one parent smokes, the best way to protect children from secondhand smoke is by parents ensuring a total ban on smoking inside the home and car.

Also, a fact sheet on 'smoking in cars' 

http://ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_714.pdf
 FWIW I remember adults smoking in the house being a lot more noxious than smoking in the car.  In the car they usually had the window cracked and it wasn't too bad inside.
 I hate it when my car contains children Wahoo, another common sense law! Next they will be making it illegal to cook whilst wearing petrol doused clothing. Try and get that law passed in the US, trashy people everywhere will be in the streets protesting. Sigh. My mom smoked and I have irreversible damage from it. I'm a smoker and I wouldn't even think of smoking in a car with a child in it. I wish you were my Dad. My Dad wouldn't dream of NOT chain-smoking in a car with me in it as a child.  As a heavy smoker I endorse this. We already have this law in Australia. My smoking shouldn't have to be somebody else's problem.  sorry to all the kids in this thread who grew up with 2nd hand smoke from their parents Ugh, this is bringing back awful memories of being hotboxed by my mom's cigarettes wherever I went on car rides as a kid. It was a losing battle trying to ask her to please not smoke in the car, so I was forced to develop a defensive breathing posture of pulling my t-shirt collar up over my nose and mouth so I could filter the air a little bit. It sucked having to do that all the time, but not being able to breathe sucked worse, and she smoked so often that after a while all my t-shirt collars got stretched out. 

Secondhand smoke is torture on young lungs. I'm nearly 35 now and I still can't stand it. Ironically enough, however, I feel sort of blessed. All those years of being sick and repulsed by being exposed to secondhand chain smoking have *completely* turned me off to cigarettes. I've never been a smoker and never will be. I'm too conditioned.

This is a good law. It flabbergasts me how people can be so blind as to not understand the intrusiveness of a habit such as this one, and how much it bothers those around them when they light up, especially kids. That's me as well. Between my parents' smoking and the way they treated me when I complained, I can't even stand the sight of a cigarette now.  Coincidentally, I quit today. Third attempt.Edit: Thanks for support. I figure it's on my comment history now so I can't pretend I didn't go for it. /r/nosmoking Good luck sir or madam. All the good luck. Well done and good luck! If you haven't already then I recommend investing in nicotine inhalators to combat cravings. Safe, effective and more useful than patches. I remember this guy from Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown Russia episode...

  I remember watching this episode and thinking that Bourdain slightly over-estimated the danger Nemtsov was in. I figured since he's far from being the "leader" of the opposition movement, the chances of him being assasinated are slim. Thought it was added for drama. Boy was I wrong. Damn.  Bordain will do anything to be right. Bourdain is a dangerous guy.  Noooo reservations.  They poisoned the other guy to death. I thought it was a fair assumption.  Here is the clip

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EbtlpmdS4o
 &gt; Everybody understands *everything* in this country.

That line freaks me out. That caught my attention too but I think he speaks for most Russians.

An example is Gallup which is one of the leading polling agencies in the world talked a while ago about how they had trouble polling Russians properly. Most people hung up the phone. I believe they were polling about the economy.

When they do the same in lets say UK, many respond and they have an complete opposite affect of people ranting instead of short responses.

It's extremely difficult for the West to realize that some Russians do understand what's really happening and that they're okay with it so long as Russia is seen as a strong power in the world.  Its hard to accurately judge a someones opinion on a subject when people are being murdered for having the wrong opinion. The gleam in his eye is scary Huge fan of the show, I wouldn't have remember this. Thanks for sharing. Me too. Kinda spooky that Bourdain pretty much outlined how much danger this dude was in for speaking out. 
 No more trips to Russia for Bourdain, no more hanging out with Zamir :( He'll just have to stay Stateside with him for more adventures in the rust belt. Just watched that episode yesterday, pretty crazy. I have some questions for Russian people here:

1. Was he very popular in the country?
1. How is the Russian media reacting to this? 
1. What did he think about war in Ukraine? He was one of the organizers of the March set to happen on Sunday, one of the main subjects of the march is to stop the war with Ukraine, as said on one of Nemtsov's last [fb](https://www.facebook.com/boris.nemtsov?fref=ts) posts.
edit to add [this picture](https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/11018308_10153670957938327_8305848576988534057_n.jpg?oh=62facafbeee443f4c59e7e4d4f376331&amp;oe=55964B29&amp;__gda__=1435883606_cde2026981418a2003c963dd36dd2737) to get a sense of where this happened. Center of Moscow, 5 mins from the Kremlin, one of the most heavily-monitored places on Earth. So can we suspect his murder is related to the Ukrainian-Russian conflict?  I'd say that is is safe to say that the murder is related to his political career. As to who did this, so far I've seen among those blamed: Putin, the US, the CIA, Kyiv Junta, an anonymous jealous lover, a business partner, just random crazy russians who happen to be riding in a car with guns 5 minutes walk from the Kremlin. Edit: Well, guys, this takes the cake, [Life News Russia is reporting that "this might have been revenge for an abortion that an ex-girlfriend did"](http://lifenews.ru/news/150504) We should not be too quick to rule it a murder.  The Russian government may decide it was a suicide. Like that Argentinian prosecutor that said he had a case against the Argentinian government and was found "suicided" the day before the declaration.


Apparently, he managed to shot himself twice in the back of the head and them cleaned all traces of gunpowder. Obvious case of suicide Johnson, case closed! What? It was clearly Bosnian terrorists

Wait hold on. We dont need to go to war there anymore

I meant Ukrainian terrorists. What an outrage! We need to declare war now! [Time to step up and live according to current trends:  blame 'Ukrainian jewnazi negroe gay junta'](http://www.reddit.com/r/RussianUkrainianWar/comments/2wsfmb/the_hilarity_hysteria_and_madness_of_russian/).

http://i.imgur.com/xP8Wwyt.gif [deleted] [deleted] In the article itself, it reads:

&gt;In a recent interview, Mr Nemtsov had said he feared Mr Putin would have him killed because of his opposition to the war in Ukraine.

Some circumstantial evidence, here. Good news though!

Putin had said he will oversee the investigation himself! So I'm sure we'll find out if he was behind it.

&gt;Putin promptly assumed personal control of the murder investigation, said his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. The move was a measure of the shockwaves sent out by the crime.

Edit: source from opposite end of the political spectrum(just for you BoatMont! &lt;3) :

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/27/russian-opposition-politician-boris-nemtsov-shot-dead-moscow-reports

&gt;Putins spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the president would take the investigation into Nemtsovs death under personal control, and that he believed the killing to be a provocation.

&gt;Putin noted that this cruel killing has all the signs of a hit, and is a pure provocation, said Peskov. He said Putin offered condolences to Nemtsovs family.

 This is like something from The Onion. Russia is its own dark, awful satire. Unbelievable. What if Putin discovers he in fact did do it!?   Then he'll have egg on his face!  He will be his own prosecutor and his own defense lawyer, this will be an interesting case! Only thing more interesting would be a court case of Kanye West vs Vladimir Putin. Welcome to Russia, since forever.  Phew. That calmed me right down. Someone get Putin a trench coat, a magnifying glass and a fedora.  So, last we will ever hear about it? Nope. It'll probably turn out this was orchestrated by the Ukrainian government. Retaliatory invasion, ho! Add some sort of CIA involvement there, or at least NATO mercenary pulling the trigger. He was well known, not very popular though, but there wasn't anyone who didn't hear his name.

Media reacts as it would react at any murder of a well known person.

As opposition leader he was against the whole russian politics towards Ukraine. [Here's](https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/mumin-shakirov/who-was-mister-putin-interview-with-boris-nemtsov) a great interview with him so that you can get an understanding of who he was. &gt; How is the Russian media reacting to this? 

He was killed late night Friday, it's early morning Saturday in Moscow right now. You'll have to wait a bit. In answer to question 3:Allegedly he was planning to release a report about the situation in Donbass which was supposed to contain evidence of Russian troops there. Not sure if this is actually true, got it from twitter here (in russian): https://twitter.com/xenia_sobchak/status/571440472788504576

"Ilya Yashin [Nemtsov's close ally]  said that he was planning to publish a report about the war in Donetsk Peoples Republic with facts and document about presence of Russian troops there" He gave a interview 2 weeks ago where he said " He believed Putin was going to kill him" In just 1 minute ago as of writing: "Putin is taking personal control of the investigation into Nemtsov's murder". 

https://twitter.com/christopherjm/status/571440021317820416 The easiest way to cover up your crime is to investigate yourself.   Just ask FIFA!  Or any police department. Just like he did for Politkovskaya's murder. He seems to be fucking useless for this. Well, you wouldn't be too efficient either if you are investigating a crime you committed. Or rather, he is very good at shifting blame. Or more like he wants to just let the real culprits go, aka, the people working for him. THATS a fucking laugh!

http://martin.livejournal.com/366210.html The comments, or at least what I could make sense of after google translate, are kinda brutal. Brushing this off like it's nothing. Cyrillic LJ comments on anything remotely political are more cancer than comments on any news site. Or close to such. "The Kremlin said that Putin will personally oversee the investigation."

Yeah no doubt. that makes sense since he oversaw the assassination  **"I've found the murderer!"**

*'How did you find them so quickly?*

**"I said, *'Boris, did you do that thing I asked you to?'*, and he said *'Ya we took care of that.'* And so I know the murderer is Boris."** A quick, short list of murdered Putin critics:

EDIT 3: Refining last item to say "Putin regime" as others have pointed out from the Journalists w/o Borders org. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko Seriously who leaves out radiation poisoning guy?

That's obviously the most Bond villainy example. What was that even about? A show of "fuck-you" power that they can kill people in comically bizarre ways and get away with it? To make people afraid they might die in a similarly protracted way?

It doesn't seem like the goal was just to bump him off Yep. We can kill you whenever we want, however we want, no matter where you go to hide from us. That was the basic idea. Not just kill you.. but do it in the most horrible, agonizing way possible too. &gt; Anna Politkovskaya

"A week after the assassination, Alexander Litvinenko accused Putin of sanctioning the murder. Two weeks after this statement, Litvinenko was poisoned with radioactive polonium. " from her Wiki Page. I hope the exposure this comment gets motivates people to read some of Anna Politkovskaya's work (A Small Corner of Hell is a good place to start). She was murdered because of her investigative reporting, and likely knew that was the trajectory she was on, but proceeded to document the truth anyway. A brilliant writer and an incredibly brave individual, cut down by an authoritarian regime. 
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Politkovskaya
If her writings weren't enough just look at the circumstances of her "trial" and the ancillary victims that were necessary to bring her murderers to justice to get a picture of the state Russia is in right now.  /u/pantsmeplz was later found dead in his house, russian authorities concluded he commitied suicide by tying himself up, torturing himself for over six hours and then shot himself from behind in the head four times. Putin is taking personal control of the investigation into /u/pantsmeplz's murder, justice* will be served Guys I think I'm seeing a trend  Somebody get this man a job at Google.

I remember a story about her murder on NPR (or BBC?) after it happened. Criminal.
 As a Russian living in Moscow and wholeheartedly supporting opposition this news are shocking, sad and scary to me. More reasons to go to opposition's march on Sunday.

EDIT: Right, my inbox is blowing up :) Thanks for all the "stay safe" replies and thanks for being supportive, guys. March is sanctioned by officials and I doubt it's going to be anything but safe and peaceful, especially after that sad event. My main concern is that it's not going to have a large impact as majority of Russians choose to turn a blind eye to the sad state of affairs caused by our corrupted government.
EDIT: Thanks for the gold, stranger, although I feel that I did not deserve it really :) World News on Monday, "1000's dead after 'Ukraine Terrorists' bomb peaceful march". If you haven't already, read *Red Storm Rising*. "For my little Svetlana, who died without a face." I am just reading it, and loving it so much.  Tom Clancy's early novels are so good, right up until Debt of Honor I'd say

Check out Cardinal of the Kremlin and The Sum of All Fears. The latter's movie was pretty terrible, the book is gripping from start to finish though Yes, exactly.

(List provided for recommended reading to people unfamiliar with his works)

I read his fiction studiously for years, then it really got less and less plausible. That's what I liked about the early novels, was the feeling like "this is almost like it's a documentary, this is how it would really happen!". The later works were just long, overly pedantic ramblings about Mr. Clancy's alter-ego, Jack Ryan. It's too bad, I'm a huge fan and didn't even pick up his last several books.

(Edit: formatting, forgot Cardinal) Sad thing is, this is a totally plausible scenario. [It wouldn't be the first time.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_apartment_bombings) Well the FSB bombed four apartment buildings to start a second Chechen war, so it's perfectly possible. And people always wonder why the Russians also think everything coming out of the west is properganda. They didn't used to. That's what's so ironic about it.

In the USSR you *knew* that the gov't was telling you lies, so if Radio Free Europe said something else, they were probably telling you the truth. 

Now although people have unfettered access to the world's news services, they choose to believe all of them as being propaganda, and they believe their government. 

It has been very interesting to watch the changes in Russian society in this aspect over the past 30 years.  The architect of modern Russian propaganda is a guy called [Vladislav Surkov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Surkov). Adam Curtis credits Surkov as [perfecting a system of helplessness through confusion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcy8uLjRHPM&amp;feature=youtu.be) I mean, we live in the world where media is instrument big enough to be turned into straight propaganda machine that is perfectly suited to shape public opinion in whatever is currently needed. Be it conspiracy, "forgetting" facts or just making them up as it goes.  This is why we must always fight to keep media free. And here comes the other well known truth: even in the best case, it's all about the money, whoever can fund the media, can influence media's content. Jesus christ.....I can actually see Putin pulling this bullshit off too. As a ukrainian, I want to thank you for going to the march. Thanks for the courage and I hope that you will stay safe. Your motives may not be pro-ukrainian, but more anti-kremlin in terms of economy etc, but still, thank you very much! My motives are pro-russian, but mostly I go for myself. But I totally side with Ukraine in the recent war conflict. I feel ashamed for my government after their actions in Ukraine. Thanks for your words, they mean a lot. Best luck to you! Well this has all been very pleasant. Of course it is, the Russian and Ukrainian people have no reason to want to kill one another. Conflict has forever been the result of the powerful few trying to gain more power for themselves. War is a game played by the rich with the lives of the poor.  He actually said ["I'm afraid Putin would kill me"](http://sobesednik.ru/politika/20150210-boris-nemcov-boyus-togo-chto-putin-menya-ubet)

[BBC also quoted that article](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31669061) [This item is used by police and governments in most of the world and I'm sure it is used in Russia as well so you may want to leave your cell phone at home. Take care.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSI-catcher) Be careful. Hope it goes well for you.  Surely this was captured on a dash cam. You think anyone of dumb enough to show it? No one else wants to get suicided. In Soviet Russia, president assassinate *you*!  LOL! ...wait Every other period of Russian history too. This is why Russians never have a good alternative to Putin and his party. 

Anyone slightly competent in the opposition party shows up dead.  Not necessarily dead. There are hundreds of ways for the Russian Government to oppress the opposition. Yet, none of them can be described as a "fair game".

But that one clearly crossed the line. &gt;But that one clearly crossed the line.

Putin's been crossing lines for a while, why would he stop now? Well, the saddest thing is that he most probably won't. There are way more lines to be crossed. He's a habitual line-stepper. In fact, I don't think lines mean anything to him.  I think you're saying 'vacationing' not 'crossing lines'. It's more like he is annexing the territory across the line.  Especially Putin has shown he has an excellent ability to exterminate opposition, in any way available. This looks more and more like a dictatorship (if it hasn't already fallen into that description). 

Back in the 90's when certain people grew very rich and grabbed large parts of the industry, there were plenty of people dying, it was pretty much like a gangster/mafia movie in Russia amongst the rich; but then Putin came and he just started destroying his opponents one by one, most of them without even killing. Oligarchs' companies being "nationalized" one by one until every oligarch (minus those who support Putin) has fled the country. Not to mention politicians.  But will it change something? I talked to russians on the internet, they saw Nemzov as a "us-american puppet".

I respect that man (probably because I'm ukrainian and russian politicans got relevant for me aswell). He supported my country and did Anti-War protests in Moscow. A huge loss for the russian opposition! Is "American puppet" always the go to in Russia for anything they don't like?  Because in the US, at least until recently, Russians haven't been the go to scape goat since the fall of the USSR.  "Terrorists" have taken over that role.   Opposing Putin is very hazardous to one's health.  "I'm sorry mam.  The results are positive. you have stage 4 *Putin opposition*."

 "Oh no! What are the symptoms?"

"They can range from prison time to a bullet in the head, I'm afraid." "doctor... I... I think I feel a drive-by shooting coming."

"EVERYBODY GET DOWN! WE'VE GOT A STAGE 4 PUTIN OPPOSITION. SHOTS INCOMING!"

*Screams throughout doctors office and waiting room.*

*car pulls up.  Men with guns fire several rounds at office.  Kill everyone.*

Woman's last words: "Thanks Obama." "They must have infected you in the west with Putinoposinitis." The only cure is lead. We also have clinical trial that use polonium  The other day I watched Anthony Bourdain's "Parts Unknown" Russia episode and he interviews Boris Nemtsov. Nemtsov basically says he is not afraid of Putin, and will keep fighting for a better Russia knowing full well the potential consequences. It is apparent that he is a man of strong character. This is very surreal, hopefully this can be a catalyst for the type of change he was working for in Russia. He was very famous among russians and ukrainians, he always told the truth about ~~this kremlin hitler-midget~~ Putin's regime and all about his billionaire friends. This is basically warning for all other independent journalists and opposition politicians in Russia. What putin is delivering for everyone opposing or criticizing him is this - "you wont be intimidated or threatened or jailed - you will be killed, like a dog. "
Just before his death Nemtsov told he is frightened that he might get killed. http://sobesednik.ru/politika/20150210-boris-nemcov-boyus-togo-chto-putin-menya-ubet (10th of February 2015)

EDIT: Boris Nemtsov's last tweet was 4 hours ago about forthcoming anti-crisis rally 'Spring',scheduled for March 01,2015 https://twitter.com/borisnemtsov Indeed! Its a huge loss for russian opposition. He was murdered two days before a huge united opposition rally. We will come! Everyone must come to this rally on this weekend! 

[That is he agitating people in moscow metro to come on this rally. Just a week ago](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpsGJ2y61hA) Moscow sure has a nice looking subway system. Man I was doubting you because of your strong words with the 'sending a warning', but it seems that you're right. The link you provided was indexed by google on [feb 10](http://i.imgur.com/HNzspds.png) so it's not some cover up.

I can't believe this shit. I've met Boris multiple times and he's always struck me as an extremely intelligent person. ~~We~~He didn't give up on his aim of making Russia truly democratic after 20+ years.

RIP, Borya :( What does it mean when something is "indexed by google"? It means google found it and started displaying it in results on that date. So in this case it's a way of verifying the article was truly posted before his death.  Ha, I'm surprised by how naive you sound. Did you not know what Russia is like? I was in Moscow in the late 90's. It was a bloodbath. Yeah, You've seen it, we've lived in it. And this murder is mind blowing. He was very famous, it's just shoking. It's too much even for russian standarts.  Shot 4 times in the back. They didn't even bother to cover up the fact that it was murder. It's sending a clear message. 

 And they did it right in front of the Kremlin. Nothing more powerful than that to other political opponents, existing or potential. Born and raised there in the 90s (St Petersburg) , this is true, but, and down vote away, when ex KGB, Putin came in power, in his first term (8 years) his ruthless clean up of this crime was unparalleled, you didn't fuck with him / not even the highest mob bosses wanted to. He brought back the economy, and had Russia being respected again... and I guess like they say, you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become a villan.  And at this point, he's almost going full Stalin 

edit: I hear what everyone is saying, and I am speaking from my perspective as someone living there, and this is what the opinion of mine was and of everyone around me. 

Also fun fact, I didn't know what the Cold War was, or if it was even a thing, till I moved to the US. Just to put it in perspective. Perhaps he will become a martyr and symbol for change.  Optimism in Russia? Reminds me of the joke that you can summarize Russian history in 5 words: "And then things got worse." I thought it was "Russia needs warm water port." and then things got worse "Putin said he will personally oversee the investigation."

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!!!!!! Putin's approval ratings are through the roof. I can't see any major changes coming anytime soon. Anyone opposing Putin right now will be labeled a traitor/deviant/etc.  &gt; Putin's approval ratings are through the roof.

Ceauescu ratings were 90% few days before the revolution. Putin approval ratings through the roof - Putin-controlled media Nearly every Russian I talk to on here is prepared to get down and suck Vlad's dick right now if he tells them it's for the good of the country.

I think it's more likely that Putin's media is shaping and informing the opinions of the Russian population, rather than merely erroneously reporting on them. [deleted] &gt; Anyone opposing Putin right now will be ~~labeled a traitor/deviant/etc.~~ dead

FTFY TO THE GULAGS WITH YOU This is the new Russian definition of 'total coincidence' Oh my god this just scared me so much.

I was watching Anthony Bourdain's *Parts Unknown* earlier today, and Bourdain was talking to Nemtsov about opposition to Putin and how people were getting assassinated. Bourdain asked Nemtsov if he was every scared about being assassinated and Nemtsov said he did not care at all.

Hours later, I check Reddit and see this story. I'm so wigged out right now. I just watched an episode where this guy was interviewed about being assassinated, only to see a few hours later that he was assassinated. Upcoming RT.com headline: Boris Nemtsov Killed Totally By Accident A typical Russian suicide with four shots in the back.

EDIT: I wrote "shot in the back" for added rhetorical flair, but now it turns out he really was shot in the back. Cowards... "He, uh, fell on a screwdriver...18 times." "Death, uh, finds a way" He accidentally stuffed himself into a burlap sack then threw himself into a river... accidentally.  A few innocent vacationers totally not connected to the FSB accidentally shot him 19 times. He tied himself to a chair, took poison, stabbed himself 27 times and threw himself out of a third story window...twice.
When asked about the death Putin said " He must have been A little clumsy". &gt;Russian Opposition Politician Boris Nemtsov slips, falls on knife 68 times. I just checked it out, lots of comments suggesting the US killed Nemtsov to frame Putin... [Okay](http://i.imgur.com/O0a2hMD.gif). Go take a look at /r/russia. It's so cute watchng them try to blame everyone except Putin. America, Europe, Jews, the gays. It's false flags all the way down okay that was like stepping into an alternate reality One of the top comments is even blaming the organizers of the march he was promoting, to garner sympathy for their cause. Those people will believe anything RT tells them Bloody hell, I thought it would be just a few. It seems every single comment places the blame elsewhere! check out the comments section, pretty mental http://rt.com/news/236363-nemtsov-killed-politician-moscow/
 Holy shit, I mean I sort-of get the usual CIA conspiracy theories, but what's with the Jews this and that thing? Aren't these guys supposed to be antifascist? Judging by their spam comments on Polish forums they blame Jews, gays and Europe (all those are synonyms for them) for every evil that falls on the world. He was on Echo of Moscow (major radio station in Moscow) 2 hours before being shot. The message is clear, shut up on your own or we'll silence you for good. Kasparov, after a few arrests, eventually left the country.  &gt; shot ... four times  
&gt; in the back  
&gt; as he crossed a bridge  
&gt; in view of the Kremlin  
&gt; hours after appealing for support ... against the war in Ukraine

I guess we're past the point of even making a pretense of subtlety now. ... yea...

http://i.imgur.com/bLdOORT.jpg Damn, they all look terrified. File this under "not a coincidence" It's very strange that he was killed in the very center of Moscow, very close to the Red Square. This area seemed to be quite safe. Oh god... He was the leading critic of Putin and wasn't afraid to tell the truth.

Expect that the killers will never be found, because no-one will look in the Kremlin. The scary thing is that with other Putin critics, like ex-KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko, he was killed by the KGB in *Britain.* Like, a state sponsored murder took place in the UK. And it's not like they tried to hide it, it was a clear polonium-210 poising, which could be traced to the plane, just from radiation levels. &gt; And it's not like they tried to hide it

That's cultural.  No reason to hide it, just slap a bare-faced lie on it and dare you to challenge them on it.  It's the way the Soviet police worked, the KGB worked, Putin works.

It makes the murder even more effective, because it's blatant.  If there was reason to believe it was a random act of violence, it wouldn't be as effective at suppressing dissent. That's true, I think it was so obvious that I missed it. 

&gt;just slap a bare-faced lie on it and dare you to challenge them on it.

This is it, so much. It's an attitude like "Hey, come on, challenge us. We dare you." , an attitude of taunting and intimidation.  That's been Putin's entire approach to Russia's role in the Ukrainian conflict. Everybody knows his forces are balls deep into Eastern Ukraine, but he just throws the laziest lies out there because he knows no one in his own country will actually challenge them. The kremlin is always the last place i think to look.  I went there once on holiday and found all my previous tv remotes and 3 lighters. &gt;He was reportedly shot near the Kremlin while walking with a woman.

I wonder if Putin was watching from his window.  I wonder where this bullshit is going to end.  It's like the Russians and Argentineans are racing to see who can corrupt their entire government and public institutions first.   Russia's entire gov has never not been corrupt  Sorry pal. Argentina is not even in the same league [deleted] &gt; He was shot near the Kremlin while walking with a woman, according to Russian-language news website Meduza.

&gt; "Several people" had got out of a car and shot him, it added.


They did not use any subtility here. Why would they want to? When you control your populous through fear, you need to give said populous reason.

This was very much intentional. The USSR never ceased to exist, it merely changed names. Boris Nemtsov was under 24/7 Surveillance by the FSB leading up to the March 1 "Spring" Demonstration.

The place of assassination is in the most secure area of Moscow, right next to the Kremlin and Government buildings, with constant 24/7 surveillance of all kinds and Police/Agents on every corner, particularly considering the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

The Assassin obviously can easily get in the area with a concealed weapon, and perform the murder before anyone can respond.

How did the Assassin(s) escape the secure area without being caught?

They would have been instantly tracked by FSB with OMON / Kremlin Guards rapid response on the way to apprehend. 

The only answer is that for whatever reason - they were let go. The responsibility of letting them go ends at the desk of the commander of executive forces - Vladimir Putin. Do Russian people not see this and think, hmm, something's fishy here Part of the theme in 1984 is that people were persecuted for the criminal act of a thoughtcrime, for not believing in the Government media. Not everyone is brave enough like this man who was murdered. People would rather have their bread and circuses, and take care of their family, and you can't blame them. I'm not saying it's suspicious but it's sorta suspicious...
  Just now: "Unnamed interfax source: police now searching slain Nemtsov's apartment for docs, will seize his hard drive, question his neighbors"

https://twitter.com/michaelbirnbaum/status/571499185113059328 Just goes to show that if you oppose Putin move the hell out of russia, and be VERY careful of what you eat and where (for instance...Alexander Litvinenko.) There is a march of opposition on 1st of March, btw
 That was partly organized by him. I don't think it will have that much of an impact... Shouldn't there be even more people going to the march now? I know we'd all love to see a Russian Spring... Depends. Either many more will go out, or barely any, now that the organizer is dead... Not anymore, it's been canceled and an act of remembrance (is this a good word?) will happen instead. Don't you mean the March of Homosexual Fascist Jew Nazi's funded by the CIA?  Russia is now undeniably dangerous place to be politically active. Just the thought of what will/can happen at the protest against Putin on Sunday there scares the shit out of me.  It's always been a dangerous place to be politically active.

Opposing the Tzar was bad for your health, as was being on the wrong side during the Soviet era, and when that collapsed, you had a brutal mix of organised crime and political factions vying for controlling being only too happy to use violence. You're right, but still it seems like this is a turn for the worse. To be a politician and to get yourself killed in front of Kremlin a day before big protest you're supposed to be leading. At least I thought it was not this bad let's say 10 years ago -  correct me if I'm wrong. 

Also I don't think comparing this to what would have happened 500 years ago is relevant - you would've been killed anywhere in the World for opposing the leadership.  It's not even a turn for the worse. I mean, you certainly are expected to have health problems as a result of messing with governing party, but earlier it was even worse, to the point where just saying something not good about governing party would get you jailed. "now"

We've had politicians and journalists being dealt with this way for the last 25 years.  It's nothing even remotely new for Russia. Has Russia EVER been a safe place to be politically active?  At least Putin seems to be quite safe. Let it happen. Hopefully with large amounts of foreign media present.  The bullets are just going on vacation in his body. They're just volunteers. It's weird.  Every time something gets posted about Russia there are people who point out the US did this or that or we're on their doorstep blah blah blah.

Putin is a modern day Stalin.  He is a ruthless thug who knows no limits and unless there is a huge force build up in the border countries, which, ironically,  is exactly what Putin didn't / doesn't want, it's a good as bet as any that he'll invade.  I think it was forbes who said, "You can't do good business with bad people."  and Putin is a bad person; a KBG thug through and through.

I'm not sure how much carnage Putin will eventually cause before he's done but I do know he'll bring his country down with him and considering how much they love the POS, they'll have earned it. It is something I noticed a while ago.  Russians will always try to redirect the conversation to another country any time bad news comes out of or about Russia.  Many (not all) Russians seem to not be able to admit their government did wrong or fucked up,  they to like to blame the victim card but never admitting when their country is the wrong doer.  There's a reason people have coined the term "whataboutism". You criticize Russia and putinbots reply with "But what about america! America is also bad!" The victim card is innocent! Modern day Stalin? Hitler comparisons are like so yesterday...

 Its Russia.  Its perfectly apropos I am sure they will find some drunk somewhere to blame. Let's not kid ourselves who is responsible for this.

Just an example of Putin's administration by terror, murder and evil..... &gt; Let's not kid ourselves who is responsible for this.

It *might* not be Putin. But I doubt it. It could very well just be one of the MANY Russians that agree with Putin. 

I highly doubt Putin is *putin* hits on people, merely because he doesn't have to, his following is strong and people will take the initiative. 

I just wish this world wasn't so fucked up :| My problem is - what he has to gain from this.

With ratings at 86% he doesn't need to worry about some guy. And killing opposition? Putins style is puting them in prison, detaining for the time of the march.

I see no reason for Putin to order the killing of this man. But some fucked in the head rich guy who wants "Russia to be united?" yup. But not Putin, he may be cold, but not crazy. &gt; Putins style is puting

 It's off-puting. &gt; My problem is - what he has to gain from this.

&gt; With ratings at 86% he doesn't need to worry about some guy. 

On the contrary, it far easier to stay at a high approval rating when you don't have an opposition. Shooting the opposition strenghtens it. Look at the Maidan uprising, after snipers shot the protesters Yanukovych had to flee the country. And I'm pretty sure that the Russian government is not planning to assassinate every single person in the opposition.
 But this guy was a nobody. There's no reason to kill him.

And again. Putin detains/arrests/puts into prison. Not kills oppositioners. IIRC he poisoned the ex-spy who gave secret info to UK. agree, it seems pretty ham-handed for putin et al. not really his style As a Russian, I can confirm: Nemtsov was criticizing Putin for 8-10 years now, I think. Though, there were not so much people listening to him, to be honest. So, my opinion is -- I really doubt that it was Putin.

Western media poses him as a major figure, which he really wasn't. So Putin wouldn't care about more posts coming from that guy. More likely, some retarded pseudo-patriot, that didn't like Nemtsov's posts (patriotism towards Putin is really high in the country right now, so that's definitely a possibility).

Another version is that he was killed by some people that are stealing money in the field of medicine (cancer research, specifically), because lately he was criticizing it *a lot*, and his received a few death threats for it, even. So, death over some thug's money is really more likely. So if it turns out that Putin or his government was not behind this and it turns out to be one of the other things you mentioned, what will happen to them? I'm assuming trials and jail. Yeah, trials and jail it will be, most likely.

I saw a lot of people on Reddit suggesting that nothing would happen with the killer, if he'd be found. Which is kind of absurd: even if the theory about Putin being directly involved is true (especially if it is), murder would be punished. Jumping too conclusions is never good, it might have been supporters of putin, or something else entirely.

Very suspicous though. The thing is, many of Putin's fans are frighteningly cult-like in their devotion. It doesn't have to explicitly be ordered by Putin when your fans are devoted enough to suppress any opposition. Probably "someone who really likes Putin, but went a little too far in a way Putin would never condone."

That's my guess, but I'm sure there is absolutely NO connection whatsoever. Putin himself said it looked like a hit Hahahaha, fix your view on things please. Start asking the right questions, I help u no problem Because nobody else could possibly have a motive to shoot an opposition figure in front of the Kremlin...

I can only pity the narrowness of your mind. Some men embrace the truth and freedom. You embrace a tyrant.

The issue should be why and what are the consequences to the people who inherit a legacy of deception and lies propagated by people like yourself.
 I think his point is that people have an EXTREMELY narrow view. Is it likely Putin was responsible? Definitely is. 

Does that mean there could be absolutely no other possibility? We should look at this more critically and see what the possibilities are and not get angry at everyone who slightly questions this. 
&gt;Some men embrace the truth and freedom. You embrace a tyrant.

I don't really discount the possibility of it being Putin, but if you switch the sides to say something like "Michael Hastings was murdered by the FBI", then you will get abuse thrown at you for being a fucking nut job. It seems like people don't really care either way as far as evidence goes, you just want your narrative to be believed. BUT FREEDOM!  &gt; Some men embrace the truth and freedom. You embrace a tyrant.

He said that nobody should jump to conclusions when there is zero evidence to suggest who was behind it. How fucking brainwashed do you have to be to understand that as "embracing a tyrant"? &gt; Some men embrace the truth and freedom

no mames.

Te tienen bien idiotizado los noticieros anti Putin. El tipo no es un santo, pero no es tan estpido como para mandar matar a un opositor a media calle.  The turth??? there hasn't even been an investigation yet.

And you Freedom? Good luck with your gestapo surveillance state and self-censoring political correct media.  What would happen if you were to tell Putin to go fuck himself right to his face? [This has happened.](http://cdn2.spiegel.de/images/image-481311-galleryV9-cjyj.jpg)

He gave a thumbs up. The same thing that would happen if you threw a shoe at George Bush. That is rich coming from a Russian lol.

How is the free media doing over there? They kill any more journalists today? I'm not Russian, I can't speak Russian, and I have only been once in Saint Petersburg for 1 day a decade ago.

 That is even worse.. 

LOL It does make you a liar, but obviously that is of no concern to you. HAHAHA

You are precious my Russian friend. Well that's the difference right there, I don't need to lie to make sense of the world. Fucking exactly, think if this was in the U.S. If Mitt Romney was shot dead would we really think it was the Obama administration. Some would, some would critically think about the situation and think so, but only to be called crazy. Is it really that crazy people, to think one of Putin's crazed supporters wouldn't kill him.  The difference between Obama and Putin is that Obama is a politician and Putin is a dictator known for using extreme tactics to suppress and annihilate opposition. 

I'm sure it was also just one of his crazed supporters that killed Alexander Litvinenko, in London, using polonium-210.

Yeah, that's not a message.  You see, for all we know Putin is all completely legit and not a dictator what so ever like you say he is. You also often hear people in the U.S. claiming same things about Obama in the U.S. only to be called crazy. That's what the average Russian thinks about people with conspiracy theories that Putin is dictator. Uh... no. 

There are many reliable sources of information beyond "what people say." Think tanks and news organizations that are not state-run or otherwise corrupted. There are experts and academics and people who devote their lives to studying these things and informing others. There are international organizations dedicated to monitoring elections and measuring freedom of the press and other markers for a nation's relative liberty. 

Then there are the actions and policies themselves. 

There are the always those trying to subvert the truth, but by staying informed and attempting to take a holistic impression of what experts are saying, it's possible to achieve a very accurate impression of the truth. 

Putin is a thug. There is no legitimate debate on this fact.  I think the difference is that there haven't been a lot of republican leaders who wind up dead the last years. 

If they started getting imprisoned, threatened and killed more people would probably suspect things. If Obama was ruling the country for 15 years with critics and opposition leaders dying, I think someone would take notice. 15 years for them is completely normal, they're used to it, of course it seems odd for us. As for people dying, it kind of happens, especially with such political turmoil over there. I see no reason why it couldn't be a supporter of Putin's, they're are some of them who see him as a god and probably think they're doing something amazing for doing this. [deleted] Regardless of whether Putin was directly involved with this or not, the fact remains the man is a thug, a tyrant, a near autocrat with a poisonous nostalgia for the soviet union of old, and it is under his grip on power that Russia has shown itself again and again to be an extremely dangerous place for anybody who crosses him. Wanna have a fun read?  Google, "putin critic murdered"   I have stuff to do this week and my disk drive is almost full. Not sure I can afford to google that. Its OK, it autofills it in for you.  that's dark Russians need to show up in full force for the planned demonstration.  Hopefully level-headed citizens won't be intimidated by this thuggish behavior. They will be recorded, and at some point in the future if not on the day, be murdered as enemies of the State (which will soon be synonymous with Putin). This is the way of the world until people wise up and learn from history.  Yeah, nah, don't think that will happen. &gt; Hopefully level-headed citizens 

You mean the ones who were killed by Stalin? The knuckle dragging bootlickers are the only ones alive in Russia anymore.  Well let's not forget about the Russian scientists that first launched man into space *after* Stalin died.  You mean the Ukrainian scientist Sergei Korolev launched Gagarin into space. The Russians did free him from the Russian gulag camp though, where he was put in by the ... eh Russians. Ok... He said all the smart Russians were killed by Stalin. Since Russia and Ukraine were part of the same political entity at the time (and for a long time before that) that implies he meant Ukrainians too. 

Anyways all of that is beside the point, because regardless of Sergei's nationality, there were plenty of Russians involved in all aspects of the Russian space program from its foundaion until today.  Then it mean that those were the Soviet scientists, not Russian. The way the Kremlin propaganda works is - voice my part (Russian), silent others (Ukrainian, etc). Just watch Putin's speech on the Victory Day, May 9, he talks exclusively about the Russian contribution in the WW2 victory, which rightfully pisses off other nations that contributed more man power to the Red army than Russia, defended the Russian capital Moscow, and lost more of their people, both in absolute numbers and percentage, than Russia.
 non violent resistance and violent oppression dont mix.

things would be different if russia had its own "2nd ammendment". Every heard of Bloody Sunday? And why should they do that.

What does stomping and shouting do? We have already seen Maidan I personally do not want another Maidan in Russia, I think many Russians feel the same. If protesters start attacking police at tomorrow's rally I hope the police shut down the whole rally with batons and maybe machine guns.

Things in Russia arent so rosy, but having a massive anti government protest with western media having a massive fap over it isn't what we need as a solution . Silenced.... Shot 4 times in the back.  Fucking cowards. Can't really defend against bullets from any direction though. Putin is such a pig. There is nothing else to say, he is a pig and needs to be roasted like one.  If u wish death to people, u nothing better than the ones u criticize. So you're absurd  Russia is becoming European-Nigeria - by crime rate, corruption indexes, transparency, freedom of the press, population health indicators etc Russia is about the same level with African countries,

add to this the dependency on oil, big territory and big population and you get a second Nigeria on European soil ...

http://mgafrica.com/article/2014-12-23-yes-russia-is-nigeria-with-snow-and-other-metaphors-confirmed-or-denied
Back in 2002, Googles co-founder Sergey Brin said that Russia was nothing but Nigeria with snow, run by a bunch of criminal cowboys.

When the quote again began doing rounds on Facebook last year, one commentator created a few charts to show that the two countries are at very different levels of development and have virtually nothing in common.

That is, except corruption.

In 2002, when Brin made the comment, Transparency Internationals Corruption Perception Index placed Russia at number 71 out of 102, while Nigeria was way at the bottom in second last place, 101.

But fast-forward to 2014, and Brin was on to something there. This years Corruption Perception Index shows the two countries have caught up with each other, placing Russia and Nigeria in the same position, tied at number 136 out of 174. Dependency on shit. Russians might build a wall 50 meters high and survive an eternity without need to import stuff. Soooo all the resources hmmm? Who likes to start wars about oil and drugs? Hmmm? Did I it ring the bell? xD  Like the great O.J. Simpson before him, Putin has vowed to find the real killers. US person here: Can someone familiar tell me how important this guy was in Russian politics? Is there an equivalent US political office to his old post?

[looked through the first page of comments, didn't see anything] Only held positions back in the 90's, was their version of the Department of Energy's chair, as well as some third-tier (assume Obama/Putin are first tier) politician who doesn't have a direct counterpart in the US government. Thanks! his approval rating was 1%, he was a political impotent. This murder is absolutely unacceptable and insane, but this guy was no formidable opponent. It does not make any sense for Putin and Kremlin to do something like that, especially now. But it makes a lot of sense for someone who wants escalation, the same way as snipers were killing their own Maidan to escalate and create outrage. It is very bad, it means someone works really hard to destabilize the situation.  Thanks! I appreciate the info! That's not info. You've been fed some kremlin-bot bullshit. Enjoy. You're welcome to provide better info... Thanks for the info. I know the rhetoric has been really ramped up, with a major pro-gov protest in Moscow the other day with some really crazy points of view. I would call it tin-foil hat stuff. I wonder if someone did this on their own, thinking they were doing right by Putin and co?  Who knows. (worldnews sure as shit doesn't despite it's claims to the contrary)

Even general low grade corruption in Moscow is almost biblical in scope. Organised crime is everywhere and it's not as if the country lacks it's own ultra-nationalists, extremists and nazis.

What's actually the most entertaining thing about these threads is the automatic worldnews assumption that if the guy opposed Putin and promised everyone flowers and a perfect life he must somehow have been "clean" and it could on have been on Putins direct orders. 

Straight from the school of 'it's obvious' and 'stands to reason' etc with available evidence supplied by 'everyone knows and a friend of a friend or a bloke in the pub'.

 tin-foil is a termed coined by the US govt. to use on its own people. Hope you were aware. Bullshit, it was first created by Julian Huxley. But they are controlling us, sorry. I can tell you think you're "aware".  I see it being thrown around a lot lately, for those who oppose the American government. He was so powerless that you can't even call him the opposition.  There is no opposition in russia. Only individual dissidents.  He's more like Dan Quayle. A nobody from a long time ago. Putin's been tolerating him and his criticism for a long time; I don't understand why he was suddenly worthy of an assassination.  You know they're going to find out that he "fell on a bullet.* *"It's a suicide"*

"But he's shot three times in the back"

*"It's a very severe suicide"* At least they don't call it a suicide It was an assisted suicide. Which is weird, I mean he *did* speak out against Putin. and no one will go to jail.....


edit (one letter) Just like [no one did in 2012](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/outrageous-hsbc-settlement-proves-the-drug-war-is-a-joke-20121213), when they got off the hook for laundering drug money. 

[Too big to jail](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/gangster-bankers-too-big-to-jail-20130214). How do we the little people, stop this from happening again?

There has to be some way to curb this behavior other than a fine and slap on the wrist... I don't know enough about laws to understand why this keeps happening.

Damn rich bastards Learn how to not die when you get shot, because we've proved protests don't actually work and they're not going to just listen to us, that would be the democratic thing to do. They also have federal backup with access to armies and police who have very large guns.
Isn't anything to do. Wait 'till it falls apart and rebuild. They're doing a pretty good job at increasing the rate at which major fuckups occur.
Or "grab a gun and find a banker." Wait until it falls apart? I think we've seen that even "falling apart" doesn't stop large banks. They just get bailed out. Wait until "it all" falls apart. You can only climb so far into debt bailing out banks with imaginary money before you need bailing out. It's not just the banks fucking things up and getting bailed out. All nations and governments fall. The US happens to be the fastest to rise, and you know what they say... Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise?

Wait that's not it.

The bigger they are the harder we try to keep them from falling? The bigger they are, the more people they crush when they fall. HSBC is a British company, and the UK bailed out a bunch of banks in 2008 too.

And waiting for a final collapse means we'll all be waiting a long time. The banks will probably be the last thing to fall. And even if banks or financial firms fail, the executives simply jump ship to another firm.


Xavier Rolet was a high-level executive at Lehman Brothers just before the financial crisis. After Lehman went bankrupt, along comes the London Stock Exchange Group and offers him a job. As **CEO.**

It's completely fucked up. If it ever falls for them. It may just fail for us but those so high up can just keep making us suffer, and can push that pretty far seeming as people would rather just sit back and do nothing.  [deleted] In today's news:  Wealthy bankers targeted by online terrorist organization, congress poised to pass new NSA surveillance powers to protect innocent families!  &gt; innocent ~~families~~ children

Won't somebody please think of the children!
 Wu Tang is for the children. Which will, in turn, encourage even larger demographics to distrust and to get angry at their government. Direct action!  double action! Get active in politics.


Everyone says "I want things to change" yet when you tell people to go out and reach out to others/politicians all you hear is crickets. Local politician here. 

Why do you think I got involved? I can't let these people get away with it. It's alot easier to get elected to shit that you think people. You don't have to be super wealthy or influential or anything. I'm a broke college student and I pulled it off.  Dude, how?

But for real how do you start? It's a long story but basically I got involved in the local party and a seat opened up on the city council so I was like "fuck it" and went for it. Local political groups love young people, it makes them feel relevant. Just show up long enough and you'll probably get tapped for something  "show up long enough and you'll probably get tapped for something...." - politics Excuse my cynicism, but didn't the occupy movement make a ton of noise, only to be ignored, ridiculed and suppressed for long enough for the crickets to come out? 

Let's face it: reaching out to others/politicians will never get a banker put in jail. 

PS. Fuck Eric Holder and his weaselly sidekick Lanny Breuer. A more useless attorney general, there has never been. And that's saying a lot considering Alberto Gonzales was AG.  Politicians don't listen to little people. They listen to corporations and banks that's because little people listen to all the things these politicans spend corporate money on - and then vote I mean they only laundered the value of the life's work of about 50,000 people. No big deal, right?  Don't forget the blood that drips from their hands. HSBC essentially aided the cartels in the murder of over 120,000+ people since 2006. TL;DR HSBC is the financial connection between terrorist forces in the US and terrorist forces in their respective homelands. Well, though this only counts for the US, they did donate to Obama heavily.
 There it is. 
Thanks Obama 
 Obama!
https://gfycat.com/JitterySnarlingJapanesebeetle But it's ok tho, they said they were sorry. \#BIGSORRY Nick Allen should fine HSBC Launder 100 Billion dollars, still gets a smaller fine than CLG. shit. /r/leagueoflegends is leaking 

by far. The hidden sorry is the deadliest. They mean sorry they were caught these same fucktards are making all these feel-good commercials i'm seeing on Hulu. fuck these guys so much
 "We promise that we won't get caught next time." EU citizen here.

population = 350 million

1x10^11 / 3.5 x10^8 = ~300

I will accept a cheque. Words cannot express my anger. 300 off my tax bill this year will largely sate my fury. I just wish I banked with HSBC so I could tell them to fuck off.

HSBC owes me ~300 https://carbonrom.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/south-park-bp-sorry1.png http://i.imgur.com/AMjN2.jpg ^^...are ^^you ^^fucking ^^sorry? http://i.imgur.com/BFJKMSr.jpg Thanks for reminding this exist :) We're sorry followed by a link?

The 'south park bp' gave it away, but I had it in my head the moment the link followed "we're sorry".

It'll be with me forever now. [Hahahahahah, they're HSBC. They're not apologizing. If anything...](http://i.imgur.com/iuW5Dph.jpg) Ah. They pulled the old Canadian apology. Defendant: "I killed someone."

Judge: "Are you sorry?"

Defendant: "I'm sorry."

Judge: "Well, my job here is done. Who wants poutine?" Me! [Canadian Sorry](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Canadian+sorry) they promised to try harder and not get caught doing it again. I love how this get's the 1% off the hook every time. *"Sorry, we screwed up. Feel real bad about it. Promise to fix the problem. We'll need to pay ourselves off, however, to keep the economy humming along."*  It was a prank it was a prank!! Poor people commit *crimes*, rich people make *mistakes*. [meanwhile, stealing 3 worth of crisps will get you 8 weeks house arrest if you are poor](http://imgur.com/ZyyQbqZ) There's no point in being rich and powerful if you're only going to be subject to the same laws that the unwashed masses must conform to.  Fucking peasants. Not to mention the person below him got half that sentence for ACTUALLY, PHYSICALLY BEATING SOMEONE.

It's clear from this that politicians aren't out there to help people. Strictly about the $ Not only that, they won't even lose their jobs! Goddammit, what do you people *want?!* These busy busy ~~thieves~~ men have already taken two hours out of their schedules to answer a bunch of rude questions. Can't you let them get back to their jobs? Seriously. Ungrateful fucking children. These men are **job creators**, dammit!! We should all be on our knees, begging to blow them, 24/7/365, and instead we're criticizing them? What the fuck, Lenin? Do you hate America or something? Why don't you go back to Communist Russia if you don't like Capitalism?  With the amount of money they stole, there are people on their knees begging to blow them Politicians? they'll get bonuses, their bank will score record profits and they'll sit on hundreds of millions in cash and not hire anyone nor lend more money out We have to protect the job creators!

If we fined them too much or jailed them for their crimes they might give up all their money and take our jobs away.  Guys, it's okay though! Trickle-down economics says that the job creators will actually make us richer in the end! Just have **faith** in the system! this is exactly why the argument that "taxes will make people not want to work" doesn't make sense to me. People want to be rich and some people will work however hard they need to make that happen. After a certain point yeah people do get discouraged like the beatles and their 90% tax rate. But I think if you tax people more they are more likely to work harder to make up for it than they are to give up. Yup, might as well not even tell anyone because no one will be prosecuted and the public will foot the bill as usual. I need a beer and its only 10:30am. What are you, some kind of morning teetotaler? &gt; and no one will go to jail.....

No, but HSBC will be fined a few million (tens? hundreds?). I'm going to assume that the fees on shuffling around 100 *billion* Euros to launder it is pretty steep and even paying out hundreds of millions in fines is going to leave them with a nice profit.

Fining a bank to teach them a lesson about tax evasion and money laundering is only going to teach them that it's profitable so long as the fees for doing so are larger than the fine. You see a tropical holiday, we see a business meeting.

You see your grandmother, we see your inheritance. 

You see a kilo of coke, we see a liquid asset.

You see a tax bill, we don't see anything. 

You see a jail, we see record profit.  Except it just so happens that very rarely do these guys end up paying more than they stole. They just settle it all away for a mere fraction of the profits. Its so little its just a cost of operating.  That's the way businesses treat these kinds of things. When profit is the only goal, if breaking the law and getting caught still ends in a net profit, they will do it every single time.  A tickle and it's the bank that's paying, not the bankers that actually did the crime. Those bankers got bonuses. If I'm not mistaken; they write of the fines in their taxes.  They don't pay a cent fine them $100 billion. Every penny they denied tax revenue. A fine is the cost of doing business. If the profit made exceeds the fines then they'll do it. So, while it's a double standard that someone like me would go to jail for laundering money at the very least they should be fined an amount greater than profits of that activity. If not that's not a fine, it's a bribe.  That happened a few times in Chile , you just need add the fine in your book and be sure to get profit If corporations are persons, then they should "go to jail." [I think this is an interesting idea.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaAVZ7N8ojk) Actually they probably will still be rich when it's said and done. *Rich*? These men aren't *rich*. Shaq is rich. These guys sign the checks for the guys that sign Shaq's checks. Mike Tyson was *rich*. He lost it all. These guys are *wealthy*, the kind of wealth where you can't even spend it all, you can't even squander it. They'll give it to their kids, and their kids to their kids,  generation to generation, and it will just keep growing.  

Meet your real overlords.  Like the end of Entourage ...."you want an NFL team? Buy it yourself, because there's only a handful of people in the world who can."  I'm waiting to see some good ol vigilante justice. Isn't there a movie about a terminally ill man who has only a couple years to live, so he becomes an assassin and starts taking out corrupt government officials?

Or was that just a dream I had once?
 Most terminally ill people aren't in physical shape to be running around assassinating corrupt officials, unfortunately. You mean they aren't like the Termin(ally ill)ator? COME WITH ME IF YOU WANT TO LIVE FOR THREE MORE MONTHS There is a movie on Netflix, can't remember the name, but this guy and some like 13 year old go around the country killing people he feels make America worse, like bankers and some honey boo boo type people. It was interesting.  'God Bless America' is the name Oh yeah, I saw that one.  I think it was called God Bless America and directed by Bobcat Goldthwaite. Sounds like a good movie, get Liam on board and I would probably watch it.  Really? At this point Liam Neeson is almost a deal breaker for me. Coming Soon ... Liam Neeson in *Movie Whose Billboard Features Liam Neeson with a Gun Drawn in High-Contrast Tones ...* The only thing i can think of is [Assault on Wall Street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y-NqShTj5w) Kinda satisfying i must say. I don't remember seeing that dream, but there's one where Jodie Foster takes matters into her own hands.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476964/ Nor will the Kings and lords, nor will the master stay the whip. Women will never vote, and blacks will never be equal citizens. Personal computers will never be in every household. We will never make it to the moon. The earth is the center of the universe.

If you simply say that it won't happen, what action have you taken to change what will happen? It's a sinkhole, a trap, to assume that nothing will happen. DEMAND SOMETHING, instead of waiting. Long before personal computers, women voting, and blacks being citizens, the rich were fucking over the poor That would require a real investigation and the politicians don't want that. And even if they did, someone would just fill their place and continue fucking everyone  And? They'll pay a fine equal to a fraction of that. The fines are a cost of doing business, and as long as they make more profit from illegal activity than they pay in fines they're going to keep doing it  Would that not be a bribe? I laundered 100 billion I pay u off 1billion and the charges go away. The lesson here is, if you're super rich, money protects you. If you're going to steal, don't steal a million dollars, steal a billion. How though? Give a man a gun and he can rob a bank. Give a man a bank and he can rob the world. From the Swedish song "Balaclavaboogie": 

A bankrobber is not a man who robs a bank, a bankrobber is a bank who robs a country.

Sounds better in Swedish though. I haven't thought of that song in a few years. [Here's a link](http://youtu.be/sGgtgkHPP4w) for anyone else who wants to listen. En bankrnare r inte en som rnar en bank, en bankrnare r en bank som rnar ett land  "In Soviet Russia you rob bank. In Capitalist America bank robs you!" I really like this sentiment
 Start your own bank. /r/bitcoin is calling you... No, because it's official. It's a plea bargain without having to publicly disclose wrongdoing.

I've said it before and I'll say it again: if i could steal $100,000 and pay a $10,000 fine to make it go away I'd do it every day. Wouldn't that be an incentive to keep stealing though? Exactly. It's not a real punishment. It's what's called a "slap on the wrist". It hurts a bit for a small amount of time but doesn't really do anything to fix the reason for your slap or prevent you from doing it in the future. So wtf?  Why is this even allowed to happen? Money. Obviously. Too Big To Fail is a good start. Also, [Regulatory Capture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture) is involved as the government agencies that should be regulating and punishing this illegal behavior ends up sheltering them to the detriment of justice. So the guys supposed to punish the thieves are enabling them? Too big to fail is such a pack of BS. Send them to jail, teach them a lesson, or hey, how about using that stolen money for good? Are they even breaking the law?  I mean, it *sounds* like it... But often these international banks operate in a grey area where they simply *circumvent* the intent of local laws through complex scheming... Which, strictly speaking, isn't the same thing as breaking them.

For example, it's illegal in the US to stockpile physical delivery of certain metal futures (like aluminum), to prevent orchestrated market manipulation (to prevent banks from buying up everything and sitting on them, to create an artificial scarcity driving the price up).  So they make it the law that it can only be stored for X days in the brokerage warehouse.  So naturally, Goldman Sachs created a complex array of shell companies which constantly ship aluminum rolls from warehouse to warehouse, so they could game aluminum futures while never technically sitting on a stockpile beyond the legally limited days.

This is what these companies do.  All day.  Every day.  It's their job to game the system and circumvent laws, essentially. The charges won't go away, they'll be convicted, but since a corporation can't go to jail and all the bosses will say they "didn't know about it" it means absolutely nothing for them. If only the politicians remembered a time when widespread corporate wrongdoing led to complete corporate dissolution. Standard Oil was dissolved when it grew too malicious. IG Farben and Bell Telephone were broken up. Why is it now verboten to punish corporate entities by revoking their charter? They're not people; they shouldn't have the same right to existence that people do. Hence the whole incentive to keep stealing &gt; The lesson here is, if you're super rich, money protects you.

Not from bullets.  Money can't stop physics. So, if you're carrying 10 thousand in cash because you're buying a new car, the police will suspect it's drug money and seize it using civil forfeiture proceedings. But if you admit you launder 100 BILLION in drug money... If I owe you a little bit of money, that's my problem.  
If I owe you a lot of money, that's your problem. Funnily enough, this is actually the current Greek negotiating strategy with the EU. I hadn't thought of it that way. I knew the quote and the situation in EU/Greece, but hadn't put two and two together. The key is to have enough money to buy politicians and judges to ensure the law never reaches you. Then you can probably walk around with all the cash you want. ... you are a job creator. &gt;But if you admit you launder 100 BILLION in drug money...

You might have to pay 10 billion in fines. Which is absolutely nothing and they will be 100% willing to pay. It's almost like a 10% tax instead of the other taxes they should be paying. the laws don't apply to our billionaire rulers, by now that is blatantly obvious.  The law is only is there to punish the peasants if they get out of line. Every week. We get this headline, yet nothing happens. Will someone for once do the right thing or take action that prompts the right thing to happen more frequently?

I can't today I'm snowed in.

Mass civil disobedience works. No one's going to put any of those bankers in jail, but I can guarantee you that the IRS will come knocking if you don't pay your taxes. Educate yourself, then educate your family and friends. 

Until we provide facts and context the mainstream media will run circles around us and blame everything on "terrorists." You can hire a whole lot of hitmen for 100b. [deleted] I demand a second apology! Well they also got caught red handed laundering money for violent Mexican drug cartels, but no one gave a shit about that either.

These pricks are above the law.  There is a big problem with under-prosecution of bank malfeasance.

But there is also a big problem, here on reddit, with people simply repeating whatever bullshit they've heard, perpetuating a cycle of misinformation. [HSBC was fined $1.9 billion](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/11/us-hsbc-probe-idUSBRE8BA05M20121211) for that money laundering case, plus $665 million in civil penalties. They were accused of having laundered $881 million, so they ended up paying more than 3 times the amount of money that they laundered. The $1.9B included the civil penalties.  Do you know if they actually paid the fine? I'm curious to see if it was ever reduced/waived/settled for a lower amount.

The situation reminds of the BP Gulf oil catastrophe, where BP was fined billions of dollars, but has paid only a tiny fraction. If that depresses you, check out the Exxon Valdez - they are still appealing the damages ruling on that case - over 20 years later.  Part of their argument is literally that some of the claimants are dead, so they shouldn't have to pay out for those claims. Why are there claims with dead claimants? Because they filed their claims 20 years ago and died of old age while Exxon was appealing the judgment. I would like some source material on that claim about BP, if you don't mind. It being a big thing a few years ago, I find it compelling to see if they really payed their fines. In fact, the trial [just started](http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2014/12/bps_oil_spill_fines_by_the_num.html). I'm a little busy at work, but this is from December 2014. The trial to see how much, if any, BP will have to pay  apparently started last month. can i add one word? 

"known"

&gt;so they ended up paying more than 3 times the **known** amount of money that they laundered.

that ok? [deleted] Well that is how the law works.  You're charged on what can be proven.


So yes that's completely ok, no one wants governments to start charging based on speculation... If I get caught riding the bus without a ticket, I easily pay a fine 10x the ticket price. Why? Because the fine needs to be high enough to discourage a behaviour of never buying a ticket and just paying the fine when I get caught and still be better off all in all.

If the chance of a bank getting caught for their involvement in criminal behaviour is lower than 33%, it even pays off with a 3x fine. It can and seems to be a business model, considering how many banks seem to have been found in criminal activity. Paid fines on money laundered in this instance. Not collectively, not on the hundreds of billions laundered over decades which is more than reasonable to assume as they have been caught on more than one occasion.

Fool us once, shame on you. 

Fool us twice, you might as well keep it up. You never face the consequences anyway. And yet, if I deposit more than $5,000 at once, I'm suspected of being a drug dealer or something? Actual name of this bank, is HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Just try to find it easily by googling HSBC. Which began its life by laundering monies for the Opium trade. 

So you could say they were just "returned to their core competencies" in MBA speak. They never left that core competence. HSBC is basically a bank for criminals. And that's why I use em'

I want the winners on my side muhahahah  It's in the first few lines of their wiki page. Can't get much easier than that.  first paragraph on it's wiki page. Let me start with the disclaimer that I don't work for any of the companies I'll discuss in this post. I do however work in compliance at  a large US bank that I can promise every US citizen has heard of.

For starters, a little bit about how anti-money laundering regulation (AML) works. AML law in the US is controlled by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and has been updated and changed over the years by various acts such as the US PATRIOT Act. A number of government agencies are involved in the rulemaking process of the BSA including but not limited to the Treasury, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN),  and The Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC). The OCC is the organization that actually conducts examinations of financial institutions and determines the adequacy of the institution's AML policies, controls, and procedures to detect and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. 

Now here's the key to all of this. **Banks are not required to detect and prevent all money laundering and terrorist financing, they are *only required to have reasonable controls* to detect and prevent money laundering.** Initially this might seem shocking to many of you but it's actually the appropriate way to enforce AML law. As much as banks do to prevent money laundering, there are people out there who spend their lives trying to find ways to get around banks' controls. Trust me, I have seen some absolutely crazy stuff. To provide an analogy, even though there are cops crime still occurs and crimes go unsolved because expecting all crimes to be detected and prevented is impossible. 

So to go back to the OCC examining the adequacy of a bank's policies, procedures, and controls to prevent money laundering, if the OCC determines the controls to be inadequate they will issue a "Matters Requiring Attention" or MRA. MRA's are like getting a C on a paper and a chance to re-write it for a better grade. They don't mean the bank intentionally aided in laundering money or funding terrorists, just that they lacked appropriate controls. MRA's are rather commonly issued. Now to go back to the paper analogy the OCC meets with the bank and together they agree on a reasonable date by which the MRA should be addressed by the bank. 99% of the banks out their will accept the MRAs and correct it. I've worked at a number of banks and never once seen an MRA resulting from intentional gaps in AML controls. 

As an aside, this is the point where banks like JP Morgan Chase and Citi have gone wrong. They did not intentionally aid in money laundering or terrorist financing. They did have significant gaps in AML controls and rather than comply with the MRA decided to fight the OCC on it thinking the legal battle would cost less than the cost of implementing the controls. They lost and not only had to implement the controls but spent billions on legal fees and fines too.

So at this point everything I have discussed can not lead to criminal charges and jail time. So at what point then do individuals actually have to face the threat of jail time? Willful violations of the BSA can result in up to $250,000 in fines and or 5 years of jail time. If a pattern of willful violations exists it can result in up to $500,000 in fines and or 10 years of jail time. **A willful violation is not a gap in controls**, like what JP Morgan Chase and Citi had. A willful violation is the structuring of transactions to avoid AML reporting requirements.

Based off of the alleged activities, a pattern of aiding clients in laundering money and funding terrorism, HSBC has committed a willful violation and individuals who knew of the violation would be subject to BSA penalties if the allegations are true (which they seem like they are, but hey innocent until proven guilty in a court of law).

Everything I have said here is irrelevant though. This is because the crime was not committed by a US bank or a US subsidiary of a foreign bank and the BSA only applies to those two groups. However, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an international organization that sets AML standards. Most developed countries have implemented laws to meet those standards and those laws are similar to the BSA. Ultimately this will depend on England and Switzerland's laws which are beyond my area of expertise. Thank you for taking the time to prepare this detailed explanation, I found it very helpful. Execs/anyone with any responsibility, "We had no idea. Some underlings, most of whom have been fired already, so it's not worth checking into it, REALLY let us down. We're REALLY embarrassed. And we're really sorry. Won't happen again! Probably. Is that it? Can we go now?"   HSBC is a series of buildings that acts criminally. The bosses have testified again, that they did nothing wrong. Don't know how his shit keeps happening, but I know leadership knows nothing about it. That is why they make incredible amounts of money. It is way past time to prosecute. Funny how bankers get paid millions in bonuses because success can be atttributed to them personally, but when something goes wrong it's a collective, nebulous, institutional failure. No wait, that's not funny at all. Maddening shysters.   They are hands on super execs when their paychecks are discussed. They know nothing when the crimes their bank commits comes out. They were utterly in the dark. They Knew nothing about what the departments were doing, but they deserve a bigger bonus and salary. Actually the people at the executive level will directly order their employees to keep them in the dark about certain things, for exactly this situation.

"Wilson, here are your financial goals for the next quarter."

"These goals cannot be met legally."

"If you can't get it done, I'll replace you with someone who can."

"Are you saying I should resort to illegal tactics?"

"No I am not saying that. I order you to simultaneously obey all applicable laws while at the same time meeting these goals. If you can't do that, then turn in your resignation."

"Let's not be hasty. I'll find a way to make it happen."

Wilson then goes downstairs and has the exact same conversations with all of his subordinates, ad infinitum, until the actual account executives and traders have been given the contradictory orders. They proceed to commit the crimes while keeping quiet about it. All of management knows perfectly well that crimes are occurring, but they also have deniability.

There may even be a few idealists in the mix who have no idea what's going on. For the sake of those idealists, we can't just sweepingly throw all of the executives in jail. Throw a homeless man in jail for years, for stealing bread.  Steal billions of dollars, no one bats an eye.  F*ck this entire place. To which HSBC responded with: "Sorry" but possess a small amount of drugs for personal use and you're off to prison!

Nothing significant happened because HSBC was deemed "To big to prosecute." These mega-companies are very smart and they structure their organizations so that prosecution is very, very hard.  There are many layers of management, across multiple countries, and it can be hard to pin down exactly who approved what "beyond a reasonable doubt" unless there is a smoking gun type email.

Not that countries shouldn't try but I understand why the US would say "Pay a fine of $XXX million today" vs spending a decade investigating a very complicated bank that is fighting them at every step, only to prosecute some branch manager in Tijuana. More like regulators and bankers are the same people:

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-30/fed-s-revolving-door-spins-faster-as-banks-boost-hiring
 This is such a tough one because the public refuses to pay employees what the private sector will.  So people will work in government for a few years and gain experience and contacts and see how much their peers are making at a private firm and bail.  It can happen in the reverse if a state/federal agency needs someone to run a department, who do you want?  Someone with limited experience or someone who knows the ins and outs and has run a large private firm? I don't need someone capable of getting 5% instead of 3% at their trade to create regulations.

If I'm an honest politician in a democracy then I need someone in line with the will of the electorate and with low chance of being corrupted. 

If you notice the chart you will see that there has been a steady increase in the revolving door and a ramp steady from 2008 up to now. I would argue that this correlates with the increased rate of corruption visible in the legislation itself, such as this bit passed just last December that puts derivative bets under public insurance in the US:

http://time.com/3631398/bank-derivatives-swap-congress/
 
besides slowly eliminating the chance that Dodd-Frank will ever see the light of day.

Franky I think the nature of the system will always lead to total corruption (plus generation minus generation) and that is why I like decentralised currency systems such as the one named at the bottom of the comment section (with a million downvotes).

Edit: and if the link I posted interested you, I do invite you to google it further. You will learn that this example of amazing new legislation was written and put verbatim into law by Citi bank. There is your first order of magnitude justification for the size of the revolving door.
 &gt; Nothing happened because HSBC was deemed "To big to prosecute."

There is a big problem with under-prosecution of bank malfeasance.

But there is also a big problem, here on reddit, with people simply repeating whatever bullshit they've heard, perpetuating a cycle of misinformation. [HSBC was fined $1.9 billion](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/11/us-hsbc-probe-idUSBRE8BA05M20121211) for that money laundering case, plus $665 million in civil penalties. They were accused of having laundered $881 million, so they ended up paying more than 3 times the amount of money that they laundered. Nobody made a 'too big to prosecute' argument. Those fines made up a small fraction of HSBC's profit and revenue because it's a monstrously huge bank. They also didn't actually stop laundering the money.

And the Department of Justice did in fact argue that HSBC was too big to indict, which is actually even worse than being too big to prosecute. Source: http://www.npr.org/2012/12/11/167000599/hsbc-officials-knowingly-dealt-with-iranian-banks You have a license to drive those goalposts?  Because they aren't where they were just a moment ago... It is shit like this that created Robin Hood. We need a V for Vendetta Robin Hood as operations like this are Robin Hood in reverse, steal from the poor and middle and give to the already fat cats. The Robin Hood you are seeking exists:

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2954705/Hackers-steal-1-billion-banks.html

Whether they are giving it to the poor is questionable, but I would say its more likely they are more so than the bankers. Hah giving it to poor people... they are taking from the rich and making themselves rich. The poor ideologues are just script kiddies who wouldn't know where to even begin. Many of these people are stealing from those who obtained their money in a completely legitimate way - they're the thieves and nobody benefits but themselves. Let's just call this like it is for once:  HSBC is a global crime syndicate operating as a bank.  I mean fucking c'mon already.  here we are dicking around with arresting people for marijuana and public intoxication and these assholes are destroying the planet and the global economy.   No doubt they will be 'punished' by having to pay some comparatively tiny fine. Too big to fail.
Too rich to jail. Here are some handy rules of life to live by:

1. One class of people on Earth makes the rules
2. Another class of people is obliged to follow those rules
3. Members of the class #1 are not also members of class #2

As proof I give you the fact that no actual people will be prosecuted for these HSBC (alleged) crimes. Why? Because they are in class #1 which makes all of us #2. [Where HSBC is the on the right and the European Union on the left](http://i.imgur.com/l9oQabQ.gif) The Church used to do such fraud in the medieval era. Now it's the bankers. The Vatican Bank is owned by the Catholic church. They have had recent issues with illicit behavior too.  the church only wanted 10% not EVERYTHING That is a very incomplete view of the power of the medieval church, they held vast swaths of land and maintained a lot of capital - which they loaned out very selectively.  Rulers quickly became heavily indebted to the church both for popular support of the populace and financially. So the players changed but the game remained the same.  The game has *always* been the same. Might as well just fucking rob the crooks and declare you where gathering taxes for the state. That is more than enough money to provide: 

* Health care for many uninsured people
* Create infrastructure which would aid the economy
* Provide quality education
* Reduce the debt burden of many working poor

Fuck this is a **crime against humanity** and all those who enabled it and benefited from it should be held to account. By evading that much tax they are literally fucking over society. Seriously, this should have already been a zero tolerance situation, back when they were caught laundering money for drug cartels.

"Oh, you laundered money? Well... we're going to have to break up the company! What? No, you don't get a second chance, what, did you think that was legal? You did? Well, tough shit, as of now the alphabet only has 22 letters, because HSBC is no more!" I know we're not supposed to promote violence, but can someone please just go shoot these fuckers? im glad to see that "to the tune of" is a phrase that is coming back Hear, hear. A little flat. It really sweetens up anything you attach it to...

News: "Mass grave to the tune of 1000 bodies found in Peoria"

This is what we can't have nice things. I don't know, I'd rather have a space station that smells nice and doesn't have space grass stains They can have lots of nice things though due to millions in terrorist/drug money. Ins't it enough that they are "Shamed and humbled" c'mon people, what else do you want?/s Banks don't commit crimes.  Bankers do. This! Boy, when my cool, creative concept gets bundled with a bunch of other products so that some larger company can make an IPO and money starts pouring in from diversified sources based on all kinds of investments I don't understand, let me tell you, I'm going to spend all my free time trying to change this system! Business as usual with HSBC. Hey....mind giving a student on hard times just 0.0001% of that?
Thanks.  100,000?    Darn rich students.. :p I promise I won't spend a single penny outside my studies....maybe 100 for food....at least 1,000?
 One rule for us, another for them. this news comes out, yet their stock rises? After I watched Inside Job, my only conclusion was that big banks are great places to work. Looks like some HSBC execs are about to get a nice raise, now that everyone knows about their hard work! Most likely they will blame it on a lower-level employee or two and promise not to do it again. As for the management, they will pretend to be incompetent. Lol, they stole 100 billion euros and and convinced everybody they are too important to jail or the economy will fall apart. No shit. That bank is sketchy as hell...  Every time ISIS kills people from a different country they'll just bring more bombs down on their heads. Against all odds getting strong enough to actually hold your own territory, must have made them delusional. Just because they have succeeded taking over a significant swath of land, I'd suspect, has made them feel like they've entered the end-game,that god's on their side, and no one can stop them now. I wish there could be some census on their makeup, like where most of them are from, how politically informed are they, and also how many of them are actually practicing Muslims, like praying five times a day, reading the Quran, etc.

I read an almost tragic article on a group of Muslims that were executed by ISIS.  Apparently they saw propaganda, thought it was a Caliphate State where they could study Islam, debate with other Muslims and live in peace with God.  They were very excited to enjoy the peaceful religious studies.

They got to a city, carrying scrolls, multiple copies of the Koran and other religious items of value and of significant age.  At that point, they were robbed of these items in a setting that was clearly robbery.  When they went to the leadership of the town to resolve the theft, they were told that those items were taken from them to go to Mecca and when they protested the theft, their faith was questioned.  When they continued to protest the theft, they were executed.
 almost tragic? "We have guided missiles and misguided men." - Martin Luther King, Jr. 'Holy shit, a quote on Reddit that I actually said for once' - Martin Luther King, Jr.
 Only because it was in a Civ game. "Nuke the cunts and bring me more wenches." - [Ghandi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSlk2DiGkXw). That made me feel bad.  source? Seconding this. 

"Do you want to know more?" Do you have a source for this?
 They seem to be expanding what countries they take from/execute from too. What are the chances we mange to get as close to world peace as we've been in decades, just as a result of ISIS beheaded someone from every major country within reach? They attract recruits by doing that. Aspiring Jihadis want to become martyrs and joining ISIS seems to be a sure way of achieving that sooner or later. Actually it is a win/win situation for ISIS and the forces bombing ISIS. Ah yes the ole "get yourself bombed and outnumbered" strategy.  It's so crazy it just might work! Countries hate them! Can you explain this? 
How does:

 "Hey guys, we pissed off Egypt and they just killed 64 of our fellow crazies, Jordan and the US are still bombing most of our sites and the Kurds now control Kobani"  

result in more people wanting to join ISIS? Is dying as a 'martyr' better than actually achieving their goal? To combat ISIS with bombs, you *will* create collateral damage, usually in the form of inadvertent civilian deaths. 

Relative killed in an air strike? You're pissed. You join ISIS to get back at the government who killed them. [edit: typo fix]

That's merely one side effect of air strikes and we saw it thousands of times in Iraq and Afghanistan already.

On top of that, ISIS is recruiting dozens a day just through indoctrination of children and taking advantage of poor people who want somewhere to fit in. ISIS pays their fighters quite well. This works a lot better when you have westerners dropping the bombs.  &gt;the decapitation of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians that had been abducted in Libya.

These Copts were most likely in Libya as migrant workers in order to send money back to their families in Egypt. The ISIS scumbags in Libya decided to pick on someone who can't fight back.

Maybe they didn't include the Egyptian Air Force in their plans though. Libyan here. Yes they were migrant workers who were probably poor, trying to make a decent wage for their families. We condemn these vicious attacks on our Egyptian brothers. We love and respect our Egyptian neighbors (of all religions) and deeply condemn these barbaric actions.

Due to many requests, I've started an AMA 
http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2w7frw/iama_libyan_currently_living_in_usa_ama/ My father used to head the GMR project in Libya before hell broke loose. 

I've been there quite a number of times as a teenager and I remember this one time when my father's car broke down somewhere in the outskirts of Tripoli at night. None of us knew exactly where we were, My father spoke very little Arabic, it was a nightmare.

Then people came - talking amongst themselves and trying to talk to us with no success. I guess I was a little scared, but they were only there, concerned. Father figured out it was a radiator leak, he and some people from the crowd tried some things which didn't work as far as I remember.

My father pulled out a map and they pointed to where we were, which enabled us to call the company for help.

I still fondly remember the country - maybe a little quirky or strange, but the people there were almost all very hospitable. The beautiful weather by the Mediterranean - although in winter... oh no those thunderstorms - and the badasses living right in the middle of Sahara.

I'm very sorry about the situation your people are facing. I guess if I do visit the country again in the future, it will be a whole lot different country. But I do hope their spirit would be the same. 

Sorry for the wall of text, got a bit carried away there, I guess. Thank you for the kind words:)
Libyans are generally hospitable and love foreigners. 
And I don't think Libya will ever be the same. My father was a political activist back in the late '70s/early '80s and I spent my life not knowing my grandparents or family in Libya. After the revolution I thought that would change, boy was I wrong. All I can think is RIP Libya.   Don't give up yet. The kind of power vacuum that opened up after Gaddafi fell is common in that kind of situation. I know there's a lot of militias and various groups who want power, but I do believe that Libya can come together and build a functioning government. I am Egyptian, and all due respect to you my Brother. I love Egypt and Egyptians! I grew up with many and I have family (through marriage) that are Egyptian. I've spent many days in Egypt as well. Love and respect to Om Eldunya!  Being Libyan, what do you think about a possible Italian intervention in your country? I have mixed feelings about any foreign intervention.  Has your country bettered since the last one? Honest question. We did at first. Then it all went to shit.  Like ?  
  
As an Italian , i'm pro-intervention.  
  
We cant let your country fall , be it due to the fact we are close neighbours , and to the horrors that could happen , if ISIS were to win.  
  
Not that we get much to say , as italian's , latest reports say that the army is preparing for an eventual intervention , and a carrier have been sent on the southern part of italy.  
  
I've also received a letter saying that i might be re-called in permanent service , so theres that too. The whole world knows that you just want to recapture Carthage you dirty Romans. 

e: They'll use Libya as a staging ground to invade Tunisia, duh. Damn Romans. 149 BC...Never Forget. Cato was right Except Carthage is in Tunisia. Foreign intervention is a slippery slope that can go either way.  French doing great work in Mali, saved the entire nation. And Canada almost joined them but decided logistical aid was a better route.  But all in all france has a pretty poor track record in foreign lands. Algeria, Vietnam, Syria and Lebanon, etc.  All Europeans have a pretty poor track record in foreign lands if you go back far enough. If you go back far enough homo sapiens are a bunch of insufferable cunts to each other Leopold was such a dick. Depends how close the job was to completion by the time they leave, and how willing the country is to uphold peace and security after the fact, which is always the problem in the first place. Sorry I'm outta the loop here but what's Italy gotta do with isis? Did something happen recently with  the two countries? Italy is the main avenue's for refugee boats towards europe , as an example , the island of lampedusa have 5000 inhabitants , and over 10.000 refugee's.  
  
Due to that , terrorist organizations can easily use those boats to send agent's inside our territory (and susbsequently , Europe) , on top of that , recently one of our boats , adept to rescue eventual refugees , have ben held at gunpoint by unidentifiedpeople.
  
Also , ISIS is attacking libya , and we,  italy have a pretty big population there , togheter whit many economical interest's. I don't understand, why in the world are people sending you racist/hate comments? Your post is very non confrontational.

EDIT: Have some gold to offset some of the idiots sending you pvt messages. Thank you!  If they're anything like the people I grew up with, seeing the words "Libyan here" automatically makes the person Muammar Gaddafi, (regardless of his status of "deceased" or the fact that not all Libyans are/were like him.)

Some people can't help but be bigots and knee-jerk their bigoted nonsense all over those around them. Are these people allowed out on their own? There are entire states peopled with large percentages of them. You are the better person.  Thank you. If you don't mind me asking, how is the situation over there? Horrible. &gt; Yes they were migrant workers who were probably poor, trying to make a decent wage for their families. 

That is absolutely heartbreaking.  I assume they did this with the intent of getting bombed by the Egyptian army. They are probably hoping for a backlash from the hardcore islamists inside Egypt, which are not too fond of the current government, seeing the not so distant past. Do they really have a plan for all of this, though? I hear people theorize about what strategic motives they have, but I don't understand what they think they will accomplish by turning every military in the entire world against them. 

It seems to me like they are so twisted by their ideology that they just want to make "beheading porn" videos to their hearts' desire - and f*&amp;^ the consequences because we are on the side of Allah and are destined to prevail. ISIS might think that the silent majority throughout the Middle East is actually on their side, they're just too complacent or afraid of their own government to openly support ISIS. ISIS might be trying to bait these governments into attacking them in the hopes that the common people will see this and get angry enough to rise up and overthrow their west-friendly governments. Then ISIS can sweep in to fill the void and establish their own religious rule in the chaos.

But I think you're also right, in that plenty of them are just twisted, violent fanatics who think they are invincible because god is on their side. Makes sense. How long until disgruntled Islamic brotherhood fans say "the enemy of my enemy..."?

Based on other countries, I'm betting under a year. That has already happened, last year actually. ISIS declared war on the Muslim Brotherhood because it does not recognize ISIS as a caliphate.  ISIS keeps making more enemys. I wonder what kind of strategy that is? My exact thoughts. I get (but I don't agree with) provoking Europe and the US but why antagonize all your regional neighbors who were okay ignoring you? What if Islam really is a religion of peace and Isis is trying to unite the world by giving it one big unlikable dickhead of a terrorist group? this isnt naruto Nah I think he meant Code Geass Nah I think he meant Gundam 00 Wasn't that Watchmen?  It's a bold move Cotton... the zero requiem I believe in the newest Empire game there is an achievement for declaring war on every civilization in the world on the first move and winning to then win the game.  So maybe they are going for achievements? Are we all just a part of someone's Civ game? Remind me of a Stargate Atlantis episode: The Game. People on board think they're playing some kind of Civlike game, but are in fact actually controlling two civilizations on a planet. S03E15, right after Tao of Rodney. Two amazing episodes back to back. I can't identify that episode by its title but the title itself mentions Rodney so it *has* to be good Rodney trying to ascend. I miss that franchise You guys have almost as little life as me. Reminds me of that Animorphs book where a race plays a civ like warfare game using fake people but then get obliterated by other races who mistake the games as real. Ender's Game? ISIS player's trolling; declaring war on everyone before he quits. Wouldn't ISIS be barbarians? This is Total War!


Win the game having declared war on every faction the turn you encountered them, as well as never negotiating a peace treaty. It probably wouldn't be too hard to accomplish if you were Rome. That shit is easy mode. The hardest part about playing as Rome, was remembering where I put all of my fucking armies half the time. The strategy that is outlined in [this book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_Savagery), which is sort of used as a playbook by these types of groups.

&gt;Management of Savagery discusses the need to create and manage nationalist and religious resentment and violence in order to create long-term propaganda opportunities for jihadist groups. Notably, Naji discusses the value of provoking military responses from superpowers in order to recruit and train guerilla fighters and to create martyrs. Naji suggests that a long-lasting strategy of attrition will reveal fundamental weaknesses in the ability of superpowers to defeat committed jihadists.[6]

&gt;Management of Savagery argues that carrying out a campaign of constant violent attacks in Muslim states will eventually exhaust their ability and will to enforce their authority, and that as the writ of the state withers away, chaosor "savagery"will ensue. Jihadists can take advantage of this savagery to win popular support, or at least acquiescence, by implementing security, providing social services, and imposing Sharia. As these territories increase, they can become the nucleus of a new caliphate.[2][6] Naji nominated Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, North Africa, Nigeria and Pakistan as potential targets, due to their geography, weak military presence in remote areas, existing jihadist presence, and easy accessibility of weapons.[7]

EDIT: Since this comment is climbing, I want to take the opportunity to let everyone know that Karl Malone got a 13 year old pregnant when he was 20. I just thought you should know. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetress_Bell This needs more exposure. Their goal is to essentially draw the powerful countries into an endless conflict.  Yep, and it's so see-through that it makes me crazy.

When you walk out of the grocery store and you find some guy keying your car and pissing in your gas tank, you will want very much to punch him in the face.  Hell, in this scenario, he is even calling out your name loudly, and describing naked photos of your SO and where to find them.  We all understand how we would exalt in the joy of hammering justice into this guy's face, but of course the right and civilized answer here is to call the police, take photos and video, and allow the criminal system to work.  Easier said than done in this exercise.

I say all of this because I spent many years in combat in Iraq, and will probably spend some more time there soon.  And people in my circles are excited to go kill ISIS, and I admit I would feel good erasing some of the hooded faces I have seen on these videos...but making ourselves feel good is not good, civilized foreign policy. We have to be better than our baser instincts at the national foreign policy level especially if we want to continue to push the human race into a brighter, more civilized future.  What we don't need to do is get down into the gutter with someone that is obvioulsy seeking our response for their own validation.  We should aspire to be better than that.

Sorry for the rambling, but I get pretty upset at how excited everyone is to *send ME back* to the Middle East, to once again attempt to fix a problem over there that no amount of my brother's blood can fix.   wait... what the fuck does your edit have to do with anything?

I assumed that was the author of the book you mention, but no:

 &gt; ... is a book by the Islamist strategist Abu Bakr Naji Just saw this off /r/truereddit

http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/ Provoke countries to hate Muslims so that their Muslim population becomes more radicalized.

It works. Provoke Syria, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, and Jordan to hate Muslims? 

 Yeah, except Egypt is a Muslim country. So is Jordan.  Get foreigners to kill innocent Muslims, and then recruit the willing and vengeful people left alive. It's like this: "I have God on my side, you fight me, I get stronger, you mind your business, I will spread." They are just arrogant.  Seriously. They've managed to piss off almost every country in the world. Hell, they even piss themselves off given the amount of executions they carry out on their own members. More exposure, more news time, more "fuck ISIS". I'm pretty sure their plan is to piss everyone off that much that Islamophobia becomes super common. This in turn will help with their recruitment and spread I think they believe.  So, everyone should go out and hug a Muslim today? ISIS has spoiled the fame for the cool Egyptian mythical goddess Isis. 
Bring 'em fuckers down!  I have friends who named their daughter after this Goddess. Quite unfortunate due to current events My friend has a hair salon named Isis. The infamy of the name has brought her salon more attention, she was even on the news!

Edit: a word Yeah my favorite sushi place Osama sushi had to rename after 9/11 Tell me about it. Years ago, I had to change the name of my bed and breakfast place, The Hezbollah Inn. Ugh, tell me about it.  My restaurant, Al Qaeda Rocks and Also Bin Laden and Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein Are Awesome began losing business in the 80's.

Now it's just "Hitler Did Nothing Wrong" We have a food company here in Denmark named isis. They produce sugarfree products. http://bestiloghent.dk/images/media/Products/339-7253.jpg their logo is so funny ISIS should adopt that logo as their own Just name the next daughter Nepthys and the son Osiris. No questions about if it is Egyptian diety or the Daesh.  Isis Isis Isis, Ra Ra Ra!  Bad romance! my girlfriends name is Isis. I hear a "hhehehe you are in love with terrorists"-joke almost daily. Does isis have big boobs ISIS has big bombs.  Just huge tracts of land Not to mention the band ISIS, who had to rename their fan page to [Isis the band](http://abcnews.go.com/US/isis-rock-band-mistaken-reviled-terrorist-group/story?id=25088363). A damn good band, too. Panopticon is fantastic ISIS Wallet has now become Softcard... "ISIS HEAR MY PLEA" AGE OF MYTHOLOGY. that campaign was unbelievable
 You just opened PANDORAS BOX ATM OF EREBUS X 500

Also, let's get an army of Canadian laser bears with pet monkeys to fight ISIS.

EDIT: O CANADA The reference I was looking for. Thanks mate.  Not to mention the cute doggy on Downton Abbey... Who I wanted to name my future pet after. Maybe I'll call him Lord Grantham I can't even watch Archer the same way anymore either! 

Those monsters ruined everything! Serious question, I wonder sometimes how they can get such an accurate body count, I don't think Egypt has any boots and every time I see FLIR footage against ISIS its always the same grainy footage of some bunker or building complex.

I understand that the original footage is probably better quality but still I think it would be hard to determine an accurate number. My guess is surveillance of where they bomb, for a period of time beforehand.  Knowing how many go in and out of the buildings, etc.  I'm pretty sure this is exactly what they do. 

Drone pilots are developing a kind of PTSD because of it, even though they might be a thousand miles away from who they kill. They study people's interactions and routines until they know the general social order and can guess at ranks, and when to strike to cause the most damage and reduce collateral damage, then you blow them up. It can be very personal sometimes.

In the article I'm citing a pilot selected a certain day to strike a location because the low chance of a certain child being there, only for the kid to turn a corner in the last few seconds before impact. He mentioned this to the drone CO who according to the article basically said "nah that's a dog"

Theres a built in safety in the missiles that allow the ordnance to be diverted or detonated before hitting a target if civilians or friendly targets are around, so someone has to watch that feed,  with their hands on a button that could stop it. 

I'm going to go look for the source article.

Edit: Added some stuff / took back what I said about PTSD. I'm sure it's terrible whatever causes it. Yea please find that source. That's incredibly interesting. [Here is a BBC article on the story](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30483010) [I think this is the article he's referring to.](http://www.gq.com/news-politics/big-issues/201311/drone-uav-pilot-assassination) I'm having trouble. It was a tie in with a friendly fire apache strike featuring stories  about  nightmares in FLIR vision, and at one point a drone operator kills a child and is told to report it was a dog because at the time his unit had zero civilian kills. I'd assume they would have someone scout the place first, either that or they just count then have them as unconfirmed kills This is exactly the kind of response that is needed. First the Kurds started a serious retaliation, then Jordan, now Egypt. A regional united response from Muslim countries against extremists not only shows the world that ISIS do not represent Islam but also that they are unified against groups like them and want a peaceful Middle East. Also saves Western nations having to go in and do it and come out looking like they were just sticking their nose where it didn't belong. 

All in all, keep at it Egypt, wipe these fuckers out. Good for Egypt. Thank you for taking a firm stance against ISIS. They just need to unleash all those curses and shit on ISIS.  I've seen enough Mummy movies to know what power Egypt secretly has. "The Mummy vs. ISIS" would be a pretty decent film premise. Imhotep would be the hero! FUCK YEA, AMERI- 

Oh.. Way to go Egypt!
