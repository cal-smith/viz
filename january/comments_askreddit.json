Luckily I was living a fairly cheap flat in East London with 3 others despite my income prior to getting laid off being sufficient that I could've been living somewhere much nicer. I had a little bit saved up so wasn't too worried initially but after the first 2 months of having no prospects whatsoever I realised that if I wanted to stay in London (which I really did) I'd have to seriously tighten my belt and broaden my job search from the field I was working in to basically anything.\n\nI worked out I probably had a month and a half worth of money left, I was paying \u00a3100 a week in rent all inclusive and was usually spending about \u00a350 a week on food which I knew I would have to reduce drastically, and cut out all luxuries like alcohol. Unfortunately my expanded job search wasn't going anywhere as shops, pubs, and restaurants were inundated with 10+ people like me per day looking for work and when they were hiring tended towards those who actually worked those sort of jobs already rather than down on their luck office workers who would leave the second they found something better.\n\nI had a boon when I remembered there was a huge bag of frozen sausages in the freezer that had been there since before I had moved in 6 months earlier. As a result I was able to cut my food bill to less than \u00a315 per week living off a sausage and half a sweet potato and parsnip (between them great nutritional content) for dinner, and unflavoured noodles for lunch - years of running late for work had taught me to live without breakfast already. My one treat was tea, I used to have it with milk and sugar but I reverted to plain with neither until one of my housemates said I could help myself to her milk and sugar.\n\nI managed to hang on for two months living like that (when my sausages ran out it got harder) but go the point where I had enough money left for 2 more weeks or a flight home so I packed my bags and reluctantly left. The thing was despite being the poorest I'd ever been  was actually having a good time, my housemates were 3 of the most wonderful people I've ever known. When I was working  we'd all go out together or just drink at home on the weekends, they were a French girl, a Spanish girl, and an American guy so always had friends from back home coming to visit that we would take to do touristy things. When I stopped being able to do all that they realised I was struggling financially they'd buy me drinks or shout me to the pub knowing full well I might run out of money and have to leave without having the chance to return the favour. It was also summer and amazingly for London actually hot and sunny so we would often just go to the park, the American  guy even offered to shout me to a day at Wimbledon but I just couldn't accept it. The French girl worked in cafe and would bring home unsold pastries for me when she could as well, I knew why she was doing it but she was too nice to mention she knew I was struggling and would say it was for everyone but the other two would always leave them for me.\n\nOne thing that will stay with me forever is I played soccer once a week with a bunch of guys I'd met and we'd always go to the pub afterwards and then I'd get the tub home with a guy who lived nearby. When I realised I had to tighten my belt I'd walk an hour and a half to get there as it meant it was a free activity which was obviously great, then I would make my excuses why I couldn't go the pub and walk home. One day the lad who lived nearby had to get home straight afterwards so said he'd get the tube back with me to my horror. We got to the tube station and I made up a story about losing my wallet and needing to go back to look for it so he should just go on without me, unfortunately it was a visible bulge in shorts pocket and he pointed it out. \n\nI painfully paid my fare (wondering what I would have to sacrifice for the \u00a33 trip) and got on the tube with him but he knew I had been out of work for a while and started putting it all together. He asked how bad I was struggling and I told him some of it but he must've known it was far worse than I was letting on. Next week after the game he dragged me along to the pub saying he'd cover me which I was grateful for but dreading what would happen when it was my turn to buy a round even if he was going to cover it. To my surprise when got there he slipped me a tenner so I could buy my round without public embarrassment. He shouted me home on the tube and basically said that was how it was going to be until I found a job ad he didn't mind at all because he'd been similarly poor myself. Despite not finding a job and having to leave he visited me in New Zealand a few years later and I was able to repay his kindness. \n\nTiny gesture but it still makes me feel warm inside when I think about it, I've been poor in the past or had times where I've made sacrifices when I need to save money urgently for something, but at least had an income so had a point every week/fortnight/month where everything would be relieved even if just for a day or two.

I have been lucky enough to have fallen in love with music at a early age and made instrumentals for all the  rapper dope dealers. and I'm pretty good with what I do. and for doing it for so long, its lead me to places I never thought I would have been. like production credit on a small segment show on MTVJams called \"HoodFab\". I don't make much. just above the average 175 every 2 weeks from working part time at fast food joints. Its hell to middle class and its looked down upon in upper class. but to me. this is the only life I know. income tax comes around and that money goes on house expenses. Please go easy on me. I know it's hard to really speak to truth without everyone thinking there's trolling going on or whatever tomfoolery that's accused. Truth is, I really wanted to make throwaway but it wouldn't be as genuine as I possibly could because all in all, it may be the life I know and love because I'm so used to it, doesn't make it any less embarrassing. thank you for reading.

Few employers will hire a woman who's been on welfare for 12 years, with a heart condition. \n- We got there because my father went to prison, for stealing from his employer and dealing methamphetamines. He left my mother in the lurch with three boys, and a bun in the oven. As well as the aforementioned heart condition. \n- I am the eldest of four. Although we all grew up in a shitfest of poverty, *none* of us have been less than middle class earners. I currently live in Dallas, TX, with a wonderful wife and a pool in my backyard. I have a good house, a good car, and a good job. \n- Yes, that kind of upbringing leaves scars. I don't buy my clothes new - thrift stores are fine. I buy generic brand groceries, and feel guilty as shit anytime I buy something above and beyond that. My wife and her family do not understand this. So be it.\n- None of my siblings have ever been poor or on welfare in our adult lives.\n- I volunteer at shelters for battered women and the homeless. And even if you didn't grow up poor, I urge you to feel sympathy and charity to those who need it most. Donate to food banks. Fuck it, give the money in your pocket to a panhandler. I'm not a hippie or straight up socialist - rather, I'm a hedonistic, atheist, aging punk rocker. But give to your fellow man. Because you might be in that situation yourself someday. We're all in this together. I choose to show kindness to those who need it, rather than turning a blind eye. We're all in this together. \n- Fuck Ronald Reagan.

Also, thanks to /u/GettingBetter, if an airline cancelation does cause rippling effects, remember:\n\n&gt;While I don't know your specific situation, a lot of credit cards have built in traveler's insurance. Next time, not only book your flight directly with the airline, but use a credit card. Terms and conditions apply, but as long as you paid for the tickets with the card, then you're covered. As always, keep the receipts.\n\n\n**3.** Note that if you do elect to cancel your flight within 24 hours and rebook (presumably with a cheaper fare), the interval between the cancelation and rebooking leaves you without a reservation for a seat that anyone else in the world could take. Therefore, it is always better to make changes with an airline agent who can make the flight changes more or less instantaneously, as opposed to doing all this online on your own. That said, some airlines charge a fee for any bookings that involve one of their agents.\n\n\n**4.** Some online booking agencies honor this policy. Examples given in this thread are [Expedia](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2s5g55/what_one_weird_trick_does_a_profession_actually/cnmqjrp) and [Travelocity](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2s5g55/what_one_weird_trick_does_a_profession_actually/cnmoev1).\n\n\n**5.** According to /u/omgswftw:\n\n&gt;and before someone continuously effs themself for years, fly Southwest.

You are welcome to ask what that suspicion is but you'll likely just get \"We're conducting an investigation\". Courts have given a timeframe for detention, being approximately 20 minutes (if you're ever pulled over, for example, they aren't allowed to make you wait two hours until the K9 finishes his bath and trim before they bring him to sniff your car).\n\nDuring a detention, the situation must be that a reasonable person would feel as though they would be allowed to leave shortly.\n\nAn arrest occurs after they have found probable cause to suspect you of criminal activity. Think of it as the next step above detention. In an arrest situation, usually they will have what they need to issue charges. Your freedom of movement is restricted quite severely at this point, and they are now free to search areas pertinent to the crime, i.e. your butt (or, more realistically, your stylish fanny pack). This is also the point where Miranda comes into play. HOWEVER, Miranda rights DO NOT need to be read to you IF THERE IS NO QUESTIONING PERTAINING TO THE INVESTIGATION AT THAT POINT.

By the point that handcuffs go on you're probably under arrest.  If you ask \"am I under arrest?\" and the answer is \"yes\" then you are under arrest, but a police officer does not have to explicitly state that you are under arrest for you to be under arrest.  \n\nAs to when you can be asked what questions, that gets complicated.  If you are not being detained then the officer can ask you whatever you want.  When it comes to trying to throw this evidence out you are going to have to convince the judge that a reasonable person would have not felt free to leave in the circumstances.  In this case you can still refuse to answer, though, but you have to explicitly invoke your right to silence and then shut up.  If you simply do not answer the questions then your silence may be used against you.\n\nIf you *are* being detained then you get the Miranda warning (right to silence, warning that anything you say may be used against you, offer for a Lawyer to be present).  If they don't give you the Miranda warning then they can still question you and they can use any evidence that your answers lead them to, but they can't use the answers themselves as evidence against you.  However, if you testify contrary to your answers here then they can use your answers against you.\n\nIf they do properly give the Miranda warning then anything you say may be used against you.  However, at that point you may invoke your right to a lawyer and your right to remain silent (explicitly invoke your right to remain silent; don't just stop talking, as that can be used as evidence against you).  At this point once again your answers may not be directly submitted as evidence, but they can still lead the police to other evidence and may still be used to contradict your testimony in court.  \n\nThe flow chart for when police can ask what questions and what they can use your answers for may be found [here](http://lawcomic.net/guide/?p=2897).

In fact, it may very well make you more likely to be arrested since may officers will see it as evidence of guilt.  Legally they can't use it as probable cause for arrest, but it's easy enough for them to come up with something that a judge will agree was probable cause.\n\nThe advice is only about how to keep evidence out of court.  It's better advice when you have done something illegal (and more than a traffic violation) or when you think the officer suspects you of some significant crime.  I suppose it's really just a description of what rights you have that you *can* use. \n\nFor a simple traffic stop it's reasonable to be aware of your rights but to carefully invoke them.  For example, you could *technically* invoke your rights to not show a cop your driver's license, but you're not keeping any information out of the officer's hands\u2014they could look the information up on their own\u2014and you're just going to piss the officer off and give him a legitimate reason to arrest you.  So in that case you comply.  If they're asking relatively unimportant questions then it's also good to go along with it, to keep the officer in a good mood (sad but true that this is a part of the legal system)\u2014where are you coming from, where are you headed?\n\nIf it's a truly incriminating question, though, you should *respectfully* assert your rights:  \"Do you know how fast you were going?\" \"I respectfully decline to comment.\"  If you had answered that question then it could be used against you (not as direct evidence, but to impeach your testimony in court if you claimed a different speed) and the officer knows this.  The officer should know the rules of the game and *shouldn't* be upset if you do too, so long as you're not an ass about them.\n\nBy the time you get to actually asserting your right to a lawyer you don't really care about the officer's mood.  It wouldn't be wise to open up a traffic stop with \"I decline to answer your questions and want a lawyer present,\" but if you're suspected of committing a crime and are being taken back to the station then you should request a lawyer at any and every opportunity when questioned and should *absolutely not* try to talk your way out of it. \n\nThe number one *wrong* way to assert your rights is to continuously chant \"Am I being detained?
