From this axiom, when you construct a wave-function for a system of, say, two electrons, you must construct it in such a way that you could exchange the two particles in the wave function without changing the wave function. There are two natural ways to do this by combining wave-functions that would describe each individual particle. \n\nSay A(x_1) is the (time-independent) wave-function that describes 'electron 1'. And B(x_2) is the wave-function that describes 'electron 2', and x_1, x_2 are the variables that used to reference electron 1 and 2. I put those terms in quotes, because as you'll see there really isn't any 'electron 1' or 'electron 2', there are just two electrons.\n\nYou can take the total wave-function to be = A(x_1)B(x_2) - A(x_2)B(x_1). This is (anti)symmetric under switching variables x_1 and x_2.(This is equivalent to swapping 'electron 1' with 'electron 2'), and a solution to the multi-particle Schrodinger equation. By anti-symmetric, I just mean that swapping x_1 and x_2 creates the same wave-function with a minus sign. The minus sign leads to some interesting properties, but for the purposes of distinguishing 'electron 1' and electron 2', the minus sign is useless. So the indistinguishability of electrons is preserved by this wave-function. i.e. if you measure the location or momentum or any property of an electron in this system, it is impossible to say whether you measured 'electron 1' or 'electron 2'.\n\n   Now you might notice that if A(x) = B(x), we have a major problem: The total wave-function is zero, which in QM means that the state doesn't exist. Therefore you can't have two electrons existing in the same state in any system. This is the 'source' of the Pauli exclusion principle, or at least the mathematical framework that predicts it.\n\nI'm not completely sure why, but particles with half-integer spin(they have intrinsic angular momentum of 1/2, 3/2, etc. h-bar) are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. These particles are called fermions and include most of the things that we ordinarily think of as matter, like electrons, protons, etc. \n\nBosons, particles with integer spin, use a different formula to form composite wave-functions, a plus sign instead of a minus sign. Phi(x_1, x_2) = A(x_1)B(x_2) + A(x_2)B(x_1), and there is no problem if A(x) = B(x). Bosons are mostly force carrying particles like photons. \n\nAs to why bosons add, and fermions subtract, I can't answer, but it obviously appears to be related to the spin of the particles, or may be an axiom itself.

For some reason, [a small percentage of folks who are vaccinated do not develop immunity](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/6mishome.htm).  This hasn't traditionally been much of an issue because with the vast majority of the population vaccinated for a particular disease, we develop \"[herd immunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity).\" The more folks are vaccinated, the harder it is for a disease to spread, and so epidemics become less likely. \n\nAnother issue (though not strictly what you asked) is that some children cannot receive the vaccine. Often this is because they have a compromised immune system thanks to a genetic disorder, or active cancer treatment. While these children cannot receive the protection of the vaccine, they *can* indeed receive the protection afforded by herd immunity. Unfortunately, as more people choose not to vaccinate their children, immunocompromised are put in particularly bad risk. In the case of measles, these children[ have up to a 50% mortality rate](http://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/conditions-and-treatments/diseases-and-illnesses/measles/protecting-children-who-cant-be-immunised-against-measles). \n\n**EDIT: Thank you everyone for the extensive and productive discussion, but please remember that personal medical anecdotes are not allowed in /r/askscience.**", "gilded": 1, "score": 3890, "created": 1422146949.0},{"body": "Also, even healthy babies don't usualy get their MMR until 12-15 months of age, so they're vulnerable.

(Ie. each infected person infects 1.05 more people).\n\nWe might have a group of 1000 people that have not had it yet.\n\nWe start with 1 person infected,  \nThen it goes around 14 people or so (on average), now there are 2 infected,  \nThen after 22 more cycles, there are 3 infected,  \nAfter 28 more cycles, there are 4,  \nAfter 38 cycles there are 10, 52 cycles is 20 and so on.  \nAs time goes on the disease spreads and flourishes\n\nEventually the disease starts to die off in the local population because it encounters more people who have had it than people who haven't. Some of these people will move around though, and the disease will spread from area to area, and it will eventually mutate to the point where a new strain can come back to the original population.\n\n\nNow let's say 10 of these people move to a vaccinated area with 1000 more people (who are vaccinated but have never had the disease).

This starts off a chain reaction where B-cells in your lymph system begin getting trained to hunt and kill anything with that antigen.

Basically, the overarching factor for fish in the deep seas is scarcity of food. As a result, there's a selective pressure towards extreme efficiency in swimming mode. As you go deeper, the fish community changes composition towards longer and more eel-like species - we proved this with data, and you can see the same trend within families. As active \"hunting\" predation becomes difficult if the ability to accelerate quickly to capture prey is impaired by this morphology, other adaptations to improve success in ambush encounters like the \"snaggle-toothed\" mouths or voluminous stomachs, or improve odds of escape like being very spiny or being armored, start to make sense. We proposed that this explains some of the macro patterns in fish diversity, such as the absense of sharks from abyssal waters due to the inherent \"sharkiness\" of their body plan, while their cousins the chimeras, with their whippy tails and spiny fins but similar biochemsitry, are found deeper. If you look at data from seamounts, you do see more characteristically \"fishy\" shaped fish, like roughies and alfonsinos, at depth, but the greater trophic flux from the surface to the deep which the mount provides probably explains this.\n\nEdit: Ok, by popular demand I've uploaded a pre-print [here](https://pdf.yt/d/p07zU9T1tpyOLiio).

I believe they used a high frame rate as the reference, and varied they lower one to higher and higher rates.\n\nI believe that there were responses better than guessing of statistical significance somewhere up to the 60 FPS range, but that most people fell off around the 30 FPS range, meaning beyond that most people can't see any difference of the higher rate.

We already know that particles that interact only through the weak nuclear force and through gravity exist - they are neutrinos. Adding another member to our family of fundamental particles is a much smaller jump than arbitrarily changing the equations of gravity to fit what you want!\n\nThis is a really weird situation where the general public has exactly the opposite opinion to the majority of scientists. But just because modifying gravity worked last time doesn't mean it's the correct solution for every single time a similar problem comes up! Yes, modifying gravity worked for the problem of the orbit of Mercury, but missing mass (Neptune) was the correct answer for the problem of the orbit of Uranus.\n\nSo we now have General Relativity for gravity. But it's very hard to justify any modifications to General Relativity. The issue is that GR is basically the simplest possible solution to the constraints we have. And if we make things more complex, we really need to justify them very well, because otherwise we're just adding epicycles. Simply changing the parameters and adding extra terms to make gravity \"fit\" the orbits - which is what many alternate gravity theories have done - isn't very convincing or satisfying. It's also really hard to test, because it's so flexible. There's only one simplest solution, but if you're making it more complex, you can change it however you want. This makes it really hard to disprove modified gravity, because you can always just modify it again to make it fit again. Being so difficult to disprove makes it a less useful theory, and one with less predictive power.\n\nBut dark matter is on much more solid ground. We have some good theories about particles and their interactions, and so we can constrain things pretty well. We don't get to invent any type of particle we like, because we know the kinds of physical laws that particles follow. This is how we are able to say that the majority of dark matter is not made of neutrinos. Neutrinos are too small and thus move too quickly to collapse into galaxy-sized haloes. That's the level of precision we're dealing with in dark matter: we're not just looking for some mysterious invisible particle, we've already found plenty of invisible particles and we've ruled them out for not being quite right.\n\nAdding an extra particle also isn't nearly as arbitrary as modifying gravity. There are a number of sensible extensions to the standard model of particle physics that add in whole new families of particles. The neutralino of supersymmetry was popular for a while, but more recent experiments are making supersymmetry seem less likely. The most popular candidate right now is the stale neutrino.\n\nAnd that illustrates the difference between the two approaches. Modified gravity is saying \"well, who knows?\" and changing the equations to fit observations. But with dark matter we're on solid ground - we have known things to work with, and we have specific things to test for. These things aren't mysterious or arbitrary, but are concrete things we know where to look for if we build the right equipment and do the right experiments.\n\nPlus there's the Bullet Cluster, which gives pretty good evidence that the mass is not always where the light is - a pretty good argument for dark matter.", "gilded": 0, "score": 85, "created": 1421878326.0},{"body": "Physics isn't my \"thing,\" so to speak, so if this is really silly I apologize.

The bell curve 'pinches' into the center, for example. If you have one particle of gas in a box, it could be anywhere. If you have a quintillion particles and count how many are in a given small cube, it'll be roughly the same as any other cube.\n\nThis logic doesn't imply there should be any other level of emergent behavior.

There are many physical limits on the height of mountain ranges, which include:\n\n**Work Required to Continue Building Topography** This is probably the one that gets closest to what is being described in that top comment ([\"whereby they cause the earth's crust to compress from sheer mass\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2salhs/is_it_possible_that_a_mountain_taller_than_the/cnnr3cs)), but has less to do with isostasy and more to do with work (in the energy sense) involved in building topography. For mountain ranges like the Himalaya that are built through the collision of continents, this collision represents the energy input. At a certain point, the amount of work required to continuing to increase elevations exceeds the input and it is \"easier\" to simply expand the mountain range laterally. For those interested in a technical treatment of this, check out [this paper](http://www.colorado.edu/geolsci/faculty/molnarpdf/1988GSASpecPaper.M&amp;LyonCaen.pdf). \n\n**Isostasy** Isostasy is an important factor, but within that, the really important point is the nature of the lithosphere that the mountain range is sitting on. While thinking of topography on the Earth from a purely isostatic standpoint (i.e. blocks floating in water) works to some extent, the better description is in terms of flexure (i.e. blocks sitting on a taut sheet of elastic). The height of a mountain range (the height of your block measured relative to some reference) will depend on the density and size of the block and the strength, essentially the thickness of the elastic sheet. You could imagine the same exact block having very different heights depending on whether the sheet is very thin (sinks down a lot, block is not very high) or very thick (doesn't sink much, block is much higher). In terms of mountain ranges, this basically depends on the type of material in the mountain range, the shape of that mountain range, and the nature of the lithosphere it forms on. This is largely why Olympus Mons on Mars is as high as it is, not the gravity, but rather because the thickness and the rigidity of the Martian lithosphere is much much greater than Earth's and thus can support larger loads. Coupled with the lack of active tectonics and a fixed source for magma from a hotspot leads to a giant volcano.\n\n**Pressure-Temperature Conditions at the Base of a Mountain Range** Probably one of the most important aspects for collisional mountain belts, like the Himalaya are the fact that they have reached the height they are by crustal thickening, basically the crust being deformed and stacked on top of itself. Because of the isostatic/flexural response, as the crust thickens, elevations increase but the depths (and thus the pressures and temperatures) that the bottom, or root, of your mountain range is experiencing also increase. At a certain point, the temperature and pressure conditions reach a point where the material making up the mountain range will change into a very dense rock called [eclogite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclogite). The eclogite will be denser than the mantle rocks against which it is juxtaposed, which is gravitationally unstable, leading to a process called [delamination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delamination_%28geology%29), where this dense elcogitic root detaches and sinks into the mantle. Going back to the isostasy discussion, there is now a reduced thickness of crust which on the long term will lead to a reduction in elevations of the range.\n\n**Climate** Another huge factor is the effect of climate and erosional processes on the height of mountain ranges. There is a relatively popular idea referred to as the \"glacial buzzsaw\" which predicts (and has been largely born out by data in many of the Earth's active mountain ranges) that mountain ranges generally will not exceed a certain height because of the actions of glaciers, check out this [video that describes the \"buzzsaw\" in a simple way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLfM1FB58yA). Glaciers are incredibly efficient erosional agents, so once a mountain range reaches heights sufficient to start forming glaciers, the glaciers in turn buzz down the peaks of that range. The height limit imposed by glaciers would obviously depend on latitude (higher latitudes can support glaciers at lower elevations), general climate, and the precipitation patterns in the mountain range (still need precipitation to form glaciers).

Intuitively it also makes a fair bit of sense. The key issue comes down to the extent to which a glacier moves/flows. Unsurprisingly, for a glacier to erode it needs to move with respect to the rocks it overlies, a completely static glacier won't really erode much. The internal dynamics of a glacier depends on the climate of the region in which it is formed, so basically, if an area is cold enough throughout the year so as to keep the glacier(s) mostly immobile, than a glacier ceases to be an efficient erosion mechanism. The presence of the glacier (and the climate necessary to maintain it) also means you don't really have erosion by rivers, which is the usual workhorse for eroding mountains, so you now have high topography which is essentially being protected by the glaciers. \n\nWhile Thomson et al present a lot of convincing evidence for the Patagonian Andes, I think the big question is how common is this scenario in the geologic record and what are the conditions necessary to develop this situation. Similar high latitude and tectonically active areas still appear to be heavily influenced by glacial activity (a case example is the St. Elias range in Alaska) so there needs to be some combination of latitute, altitude, and local climate dynamics that conspire to make glaciers a constructive force in terms of topography. \n\nTL;DR - Convincing argument for this particular region, but likely the exception rather than the rule.

Say we're only interested in planets which actually *have* an atmosphere (or the answer is too easy!) The atmosphere's height is relatively insensitive to how much it weighs -- it only depends *logarithmically* on the surface pressure (since the mass is exponentially distributed in altitude). There's a characteristic scale to the atmospheric height: it's the balance between the pressure of the gas, trying to inflate itself, and the weight of the gas, trying to collapse itself. The pressure scales with the absolute temperature (1); and the weight scales with the (molar) gas density (2), and with the planet's surface gravity (3).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_height    \n(^ has a table of planet's atmospheres)\n\nSo those are the three main parameters we could twiddle. (I don't know about the isostatic limit; maybe a geology person will address that)\n\nThere's no point looking at the surface gravity, since the mountain-height limit depends on it in the same way (it'd just cancel out).\n\nYou'd get the shallowest atmosphere with a dense gas (high molecular weight), at a low temperature. Take the earth's atmosphere for example: it's mostly N2 (weight 28 amu), at ~300 K, with a scale height of 8 km. You go up 8 km, the density goes down to 1/e ~ 36% of sea level. At 16 km, 1/e^2 ~ 14%. Everest is about 9 km from sea level (~1 scale height).\n\nIf you moved the Earth as from the sun as Jupiter, the temperature would be roughly halved. So the atmospheric scale would shrink to ~4 km; Everest's summit would be above two scale heights -- above ~90% of the atmosphere.\n\nAt the distance of Neptune, the temperature would be ~40 K and the scale height ~1.5 km. But then, earth's atmospheric components would all be frozen cryogenic solids, like the nitrogen ice that covers the surface of [Triton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(moon%29). So we wouldn't have a [meaningful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_%28moon%29#Atmosphere) atmosphere.\n\nHydrogen and helium would remain gases at very low temperature.

Someone even did the math: http://talkingphysics.wordpress.com/2011/09/08/how-high-can-mountains-be/\n\nBasing his calculations on the mountains load on the crust underneath, and the failure point of granite, he worked out that the maximum height for a granite mountain on Earth is roughly 10km.

The goal of Fischerandom Chess was to ensure that a game between two players is a contest between their understandings of chess, rather than their abilities to memorize opening lines or prepare opening strategies.\nIn a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer explained his reasons for advocating Fischerandom Chess:\n\n\n\n\"In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not know as much as I do and other players do about opening theory.

The lower bound has been put at 10^111 to 10^123.\n\nLike you already alluded to these numbers don't mean much since we as humans tend to just kind of suck at even grasping numbers this big. So let's go smaller. If grains of sand is what you want then grains of sand is what you get! How many atoms are in a grain of sand? A whole lot, around 10^19 or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000. Now for one major leap. If there are that many atoms in a grain of sand then how many are there in the observable universe? Around 10^80. Full stop. Go back to Shannon's number. It's bigger, way way bigger than the number of atoms in the observable universe. To put this another way if you could create a machine where each atom the machine stored a single node in the game tree of chess - that machine would be larger than the known universe. Specifically about 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000  or 10^31 times larger.\n\nThat number is still way too big to work with. Let's go crazy. There are about 10^6 grains of sand in a standard coffee cup. Let's squish our universe down to the size of an atom. Get enough of these universe-in-an-atom guys and put enough of them together to make a single grain of sand and then enough of these sand made of universe-atoms to fill a coffee cup. So how many of these coffee cups of sand of universe-atoms would it take to fill the size of this chess machine we made where each atom is a single node? The size of one of our rather dense cups is 10^80 * 10^19 * 10^6 = 10^105. The game tree complexity of chess has a lower bound at 10^111. So now we can finally start approaching this. It'd take a million (or 10^6) of these cups of sand of universe-in-an-atoms to finally fill up our chess machine.

The absolute basic, highest possible estimate of the total number of permutations says that the board is an 8x8 grid and each piece can occupy any of those 64 spots on the board.  There are 32 pieces, occupying 64 candidate spots, so the answer'd be:\n\n* 64^32 = 6.3 * 10^57 possible game states.\n\nNow, this is wrong, for a great many reasons, not the least of which is that it treats every piece as distinct, so pawn A occupying e4 and pawn B occupying f4 is treated differently from A &amp; B occupying f4 and e4, respectively.  It also allows for pieces to occupy positions that is impossible, like a pawn on the first rank or a \"black\" bishop on a white square.  It also fails to account for squares being occupied: You can't have two pieces at the same location.\n\nIf we *only* eliminate the taking-up-the-same-square error we get:\n\n* 64! / 32! = 4.8 * 10^53 possible game states.\n\nBut we can do better.  The total number of game states for one side can be modeled this way:\n\n* T = A^K * A^Q * A^N * A^R * A^B * A^P\n\n...where A^K is the total number of candidate positions for the King, A^Q for the Queen, etc...\n\n* A^K = 64\n* A^Q = 63\n* A^N = ( 62*61 )/2\n* A^R = ( 60*59 )/2\n* A^B = ( 29 * 29 )\n* A^P = ( 56 * 55 * 54 * 53 * 52 * 51 * 50 * 49 )/8!\n\nNote, it really doesn't matter whether I allocate the King's spot or the Queen's spot first.  There'll be a 64 term in there for the first piece you allocate.  There'll be a 63 in there for the second.  That's the total number of states for one side of the board.  We can calculate the other side, roughly the same way, just starting at 48 available spots instead of 64.\n\n* T^w = 1.612 * 10^22\n* T^b = 7.491 * 10^19\n\n* T^0 = 1.20 * 10^42\n\nBut we can still do better, because we are only considering the states where all 32 pieces are still on the board!  What happens when there are 31 pieces on the board, and one is missing?  Well, we can do the calculation 31 more times, but that's a daunting task, and we can probably make a simplification.  We can note that taking a single piece away reduces the number of permutations by a factor of 32 (the last piece we place adds 32 permutations).  We can also note that there are 32 differerent pieces we can take away at that point.  That means the number of states with 31 pieces on the board is roughly equal to the number of states with 32 pieces on the board.\n\nIt does get more complicated, though.  For 30 pieces we reduce the number of permutations by 33 * 32, while we multiply that by the number of pieces that could be removed by 32 * 31.  So for 30 pieces it's the original estimate times 31/33.  For subsequent combinations, it's 31*30/33*34, 31*30*29/33*34*35, etc...\n\nSo the new total would be given by:\n\n\n* T^' = T^0 * ( 1 + 32/32 + (31 * 32)/(32 * 33) + (30 * 31 * 32)/(32 * 33 * 34) + (29 * 30 * 31 * 32)/(32 * 33 * 34 * 35)... )\n\nI plugged this into a computer program, because I can't think of a quick and easy way to calculate it, and I got 6.03, so now our new (and final) estimate is:\n\n* T^' = T^0 * 6.03 = 7.24 * 10^42\n\nVery, very close to the Shannon estimate.", "gilded": 0, "score": 19, "created": 1421948046.0},{"body": "Your estimate doesn't take into account that any of the pieces (except the kings) can be off the board.", "gilded": 0, "score": 2, "created": 1421949395.0},{"body": "You could include that possibility by increasing the number of possible locations by 1 for every piece except the king.

Instead, it might be more helpful to think of the expansion as a *description* of what's happening. On large scales, galaxies, and other things, are moving away from each other.

Dark energy does indeed (or at least should) have an effect on very small scales, and that effect is miniscule and dwarfed by other forces.

But, because there are very significant forces between particles, the space between them does not expand.\n\nPart of the problem of the intuition here is thinking that the space is expanding, but the particles are just sticking together. In fact, space and particles affect each other. The forces that act on the particles also act on the space and keep it from expanding, essentially.\n\nIt's much like mass doesn't just exist *in* space, but it warps the space it is in. That's what the force of gravity is -- a warping of space due to mass.\n\nTry this for an analogy. Imaging a large funnel/cone-shaped container where the large end is facing up and pointy end down. Water is being pumped in from the pointy end. A bunch of toothpicks are floating on the top of the water. Now as the water comes in, the surface area of the water at the top of the funnel is getting larger as the water fills up the funnel. Those water molecules are being pushed up from below. But the toothpicks are not getting longer, being stretched, or pulled apart. However, the distance between the toothpicks is generally increasing. Unless, of course, two toothpicks are, say, touching and there is a some small cohesion. Then they stay together as a group.\n\nPerhaps toothpicks are too simple. Try a small, thin piece of wood or paper floating on top. They don't expand either. (Ignore the water dissolving the paper, of course.)\n\nSimilarly, our particles, atoms, molecules, planets, starts, and galaxies all stay together as a hole, more or less oblivious to the expansion. Even our local super-cluster of galaxies will stay together in the long run (this is the cohesion analogy).
