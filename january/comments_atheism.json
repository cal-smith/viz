We are doomed.\n\n\u201cWho overcomes\nBy force, hath overcome but half his foe.\u201d \nAgain on that point, that God has only 'defeated' Lucifer to the extent of his banishment. His mind and spirit are indomitable and he'll never accept tyranny.\n\nQuestioning the circumstances of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden:\n\u201cKnowledge forbidden?\nSuspicious, reasonless. Why should their Lord\nEnvy them that? Can it be a sin to know?\nCan it be death?\u201d \nHe detests the principle that we creatures (humans) should be mindless - the exact thing religion asks us to be. It insists we should surrender our minds, discard what we already know, give up the one thing that elevates us above animals, the best thing we have, in order to be unquestioning and faithful to God. \n\nThe Paradise Lost Lucifer is an amazing literary figure and is so sympathetic.

I've learned not to let myself define by a piece of paper on which some letters are supposed to tell me what my identity is.\nMy parents, though always loving, supportive and caring towards me, are religiously pretty fundamentalist, I have come to realize in these past years. We were watching the news and my mother was sad because some radicals bombed a place and people died. The moment I told her why they allegedly bombed Charlie Hebdo, her facial expression changed immediately. She didn't say it out loud but I could tell. She was saying 'well they had it coming'.\n\nAs a child I was really into god. I didn't pray very often but I didn't even question his existence. Then I got into high school. Not only came I to realize that good and bad people are everywhere, independent on religion, I also got tolerant towards everyone, no matter which race, gender, sexuality or religion .. a few teachers I had had huge influences on me and I'm so glad that they did, because otherwise I would've turned out just like my parents.\n\nMy parents are not against christians or other religions but what they do, is extremely look down upon anyone who isnt muslim. They don't respect others beliefs ... which was one the first things that contradicted with what I learned from school, friends, life in general. Be kind and respect other people. The more years passed the more I distanced myself from Islam, eventually not believing in god entirely. My parents never knew though and knowing what kind of importance religion has in their lives, I never would've dared to tell them.\n\nAnyway one day, it came out though and I basically confessed. I don't believe in god. And the thing happened which I knew would happen in this scenario: They said that I'm just confused and called the guy who is running the mosque in the area. My dad had a heart attack, because of what I just said. So I agreed to go to the mosque and talk with the guy and he was supposed to help me 'find my way back', no one cared what I wanted. So I went to him a few times and we were talking about stuff, but all he kept saying was the same old stuff I was hearing my all life so I just stopped.
