I use to play back June-August. I stopped since I didn't feel the sub fee was worth it. The game in terms of using weapons and wearing armor is very unique for a MMO. You can do whatever you want. Want to be a sword welding mage wearing leather go right ahead. It has the Skyrim combat basically swing at shit until its dead some abilities have cooldowns but they range from boring MMO moves to some pretty useful ones. It also has the Oblvion/skyrim level up system the more you use something the more you level it and make it better. \n\n The quests are pretty cool I will give it that. One quest line had a town under siege from werewolves. I did a decently long quest line and broke the siege and drove them back. Well everytime I go there now no more werewolves and people thanking me and etc. Hell even then the game makes you at times feel like a hero. You walk past someone they whisper oh wow thats the guy who killed that demon (another questline I did) and so thats pretty cool. \n\nIt is also one of the only MMO's to make me get into crafting. You harvest mats to make shit and some days I only logged on to farm mats to make armor or potions or whatever. I can't explain why but I was really into it when in other MMO's I couldn't be bothered.  \n\nYET on the other hand though locales are boring, lack of exploration, its just a themepark MMO trying to say its a sandbox,the HUD is bare as hell you NEED add-ons its the basic Skyrim HUD. Sure its easy to see but it tells you literally nothing. You will be walking on foot for a long time the amount of grind for a mount is crazy or you can just buy it for real money or upgrade to the imperial edition for a basic mount and the imperial race. Armor and weapons are painfully dull looking. You won't be linking gear back and forth between friends except maybe to show off stats nothing looks epic or cool. Trying to get into a dungeon was a pain I only experienced them because a much higher level guy offered to run me, my friend and some random through the first 3. \n\nMy biggest issue though was grouping. When I played they apparently already patched this issue out but it was STILL a issue for me and my friend. Every time we grouped together and shared quests we still had to do things separately. Hit a switch well we both had to do it, heal 12 guards well we had to heal 12 separate guards it doesn't matter if he did 8 and I did 4 we still had to do 12 individually why bother sharing quests then?\n\n\n&gt; What has been added or improved since the launch, has there been many new important content patches?\n\nNo more bots, no more loot dupe bug. They added a dye system change the color of your armor. Apparently a upcoming patch will make you kill NPC's and some new justice system is has ESO fans really hyped for it. \n\n&gt; How is the current end-game content for the game\n\nOkayish I never got there but I heard it improved from what it initially was but still meh. I do know you can quest in other faction's areas when you hit late game. Yet you only see your faction players in those areas so thats really kind of lame. \n\n&gt; Is PVP fun and engaging\n\nSadly I never really like MMO PVP so I don't have much to say on the matter. \n\nAll in all its a very underwhelming experience I might go back because its now free but I definitely wouldn't spend $60 on the game.

Let me address some of your points individually:\n\n\"What state is the game currently in\":\n\nThe game has most definitely rebounded from its initial down months and release. Bots are and have been gone for 7 months. The community is still active and thriving, with zone chat being filled with people looking for groups for pledges (new undaunted daily quest), players are very much willing to help others learn the ropes. There are two pvp servers (in contrast to 1, wabbajack) that are pretty much  full of action. These servers are Thornblade and Haderus, with all the alliances battling it out on high pop servers so pvp is alive and well. Not to mention the new vet zones and update and expanded dungeons. ZOS has gone back and expanded pretty much all of the 1-50 dungeons to make them feel unique and large, adding to the player experience. Other updates include:\n\n* Improved facial mechanics of AI (realistic speaking)\n* Chat bubbles\n* Less campaigns with more options (Non vet, Vet only, 30 day, etc)\n* Crafting tutorial that teaches players the ropes and allows for crafters to fulfill daily crafting quests for more xp\n* Updated werewolf quest and skill line\nNow , to your other questions\n\n\"What has been added or improved...\"\n\n* More dungeons, more zones, more quests\n* Undaunted pledges, allowing for players to receive high rewards for completing dungeons a certain way (EX. Complete fungal grotto without the aid of X or without killing adds\n* New FOV slider that makes first person feel more natural, like skyrim\n* You can now pick up more items in the world similar to Skyrim (Ex. If there is a sword on a rack, you can now pick that up)\n* Armor Dyes allow for a unique and customization look\n* Guild tabards allow for guilds to identify each other in game and give a sense of player unity\n* Improved and expanded 1-50 dungeons, expanded werewolf skill line, Vet dungeons (that contain new and tougher content) \n\nI know im kinda answering all of your questions, but I want to be concise.\n\n\"How is the current end-game content\"\n\n* They added Craglorn and Upper Craglorn, which includes around 10-20 four man dungeons (similar to the ones in 1-50 zones EX: Banished Cells), also includes two trials (12 man dungeons, Hel Ra Citadel and Aetherian Archives) that are very very hard to complete (and repeatable)\n* Quests in Craglorn are also all repeatable and they are in abundance\n* They have added Dragonstar Arena, a PVE arena in Craglorn where you and your friends (up to 4) fight against waves of tough opponents in order to compete for high rewards. \n* Vet pledges allow for constant daily quests and high rewards, such as Dwemer armor sets (which ill explain) and other high armor loot\n* There are also speed runs for achievements if you complete them at a certain time\n\n\"Is PvP fun.....\"\n\nAs a regular pvper, pvp in ESO is simply amazing. It offers many unique ways to play with cool objectives. Do you want to play with large groups of players to take keeps or defend scrolls? Simply type \"LFG\" and you will find people wiling to take you right away. Do you prefer playing small group, assassin type ganking warfare? There are plenty of ganking groups and guilds out there that would accept you. You could also form a group with your friends and help the fight that way. The awesome thing about ESO PvP is that no matter what the level or style of play or class, everyone can contribute to the fight. PvP is alive and well in ESO with two main servers available with others as well. Nothing beats the thrill of an alliance storming a keep, or capturing a scroll, or crowning and Emperor for their alliance. PvP will only get better with the release of the Imperial City soon, which will a PvP and PvE zone.\n\nPS:: They added Dwemer motif pages that you can find in Dwemer ruins to craft the Dwemer style. They are rare and finding them is really cool and offers good reward. \n\nI hope I answered all of your questions.\n\n**TL;DR:** ESO's community is alive and well with players. ZOS constantly makes updates and listens to feedback of its community and will continue to do so. The game has a ton of new content updates since beta and still has potential for so much more.

I still agree, this is a positive change, and might make me purchase the game now.\n\nFrom a business model perspective, it is very difficult for a paid MMO game to survive and profit on light cosmetics/boosts as the only cashshop items.\n\nThe cost of running and maintaining MMOs (or any persistent online game mmo or not) is very high. It is not just servers, but all the support, monitoring, system adminstration, IT, networking have to work literally around the clock to keep an online game up and running 24/7. On top of that, developers have to keep putting new content into the game to keep players around. Hacks and exploits have to be fixed. etc. etc. \n\nHowever, these costs don't really scale with the total number of players. Actually, as the number of players go up linearly, the costs associated with hosting all those players scales logarithmically. For example, a team of 10 engineers can maintain 1000 servers, but it may only take 20 engineers to maintain 10000 servers, and 30 engineers to maintain 100,000 servers.\n\nThis is why many persistent online games go free-to-play. The game becomes like a market place but with very expensive rent. To keep the game afloat, they will have to be VERY aggressive with converting players into making repeated purchases, either through the premium subs or with micro-transactions. The benefit of having more players playing the game exceeds the cost it is to have that player in the game, paying or not.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 9, "created": 1421865025.0},{"body": "It will be F2P in months.

And if it isn't better and does not offer something new, then you have to beat the competition with a lower price(no more subscriptions).\n\nSo I see the real problem as \"why don't we see any MMOs that are not wow clones\". And the problem with that is building an MMO cost more then probably any other type of game. Every MMO is a huge risk with massive up front costs and long term costs. So they understandably make a wow clone because they want to model their game after what works. The only problem is, WOW clones don't work. I see it as basically a fact now.\n\nYou can look at WOWs success, but how can you ignore the countless failures.\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1421870406.0},{"body": "WoW is a pinnacle of what a theme park mmo is, because of the fact they capitalized on a growing market. Not only did that have the success of warcraft 3 to ride on but blizzard saw potential in the market and refined the mmo formula.\n\nWhen an mmo is developed there are two simple but specific guidelines to be achieved here. Firstly they need a game that can engage a player. Secondly they need to keep that player engaged in order to maintain subscription numbers.  Failing to do either will result in a flop.\n\nThats why theme park MMO game development has become so formulaic  and that's why it's difficult to innovate with this category. Because the formula itself caters to our human nature, do something then get bored of it and move on. Challenge; engage an audience, keep them engaged for three months.\n\nThat's why we see arbitrary lockouts, dailies, weekly gear lockouts, RNG. Without these kinds of mechanics, a player is likely going to quickly over gear and quit once they run out of things to do. Put this in a major single player game element and it's a death wish. I'm curious as to why myself, I want to learn more why this works in an mmo but not a single player game.\n\nIf you strip an average theme park mmo into the actual meat of the game itself, it's actually pretty lean.\n\nThe average consumer of video games is very much like a child. Play with toys, quit after X amount of hours because they are bored of it. Same logic can be applied to games.  How many games do you own? After beating them how many did you revisit?  Chances are you won't revisit most of them because you've seen it all already. \n", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1421873148.0},{"body": "This is great news for me.

The last Wolfenstein game was a completely let down in my opinion, and I expected another one to be more of the same.  I also though it was a bad sign that they wanted to attach a 'someday' you'll have access to the Doom beta as a pre-order incentive, because to me, it seemed like desperation.  No Doom beta access was actually planned at that time... but they had to throw something good in there.\n\nWell, after all the positive buzz after the launch of Wolfenstein, I picked it up and... my oh my, was it good.  Probably a TAD too long, but it didn't really matter.  There wasn't really any stage that made me say, \"Come onnnn, pick it up a little.\"  The characters were surprisingly likeable, and I can't wait to see a sequel.  \n\nHow did it do in sales?  I'm not sure of any exact numbers, but it did well enough that Machine Games said they were likely to do a sequel mere weeks after the game had launched.  \n\nI wholeheartedly disagree that multiplayer = sale.  If the single player was 'meh' and the multi was good, it still wasn't going to sell like hotcakes... at this point, Wolfenstein isn't guaranteed to sell like Call of Duty.  \n\nThe only semi-legit criticism this game could receive prior to launch was the fact that it didn't have multiplayer.  After all, Return to Castle Wolfenstein had a pretty stellar multiplayer mode for its time, and it's hard to imagine a 'to be taken seriously' installment in this franchise to launch without multi... but Machine Games stuck to their guns and said, \"Nope, we don't want to take away from the core experience.  We're working hard to deliver.\"  People said, \"Yeah, right, they just need to finish the game and get it out the door on time, and won't have time to fix their game AND do multiplayer.  Lame!\"  \n\nAnd yet, the game released... and it was received well enough by both critics AND consumers.  The game sold well enough to warrant a sequel, apparently... so the lesson here, is that no, publishers/studios don't have to throw everything including the kitchen sink at gamers.  Positive word of mouth is something that's going to sell games... Machine Games actually delivered.  They talked the talk, but then actually walked the walk.  People gobbled it up as a result.  \n\nPart of the problem with studios/publishers today is that there's far too many who think they need to provide us EVERYTHING... yet certain personalities from the industry will blame US, the gamers, as if we're FORCING them to give us everything.  This is likely why we're getting multiplayer modes in games that don't need them... like God of War and Tomb Raider.  Or even The Last of Us (the fact that the multiplayer here is quite good is irrelevant) or Uncharted.  Nobody ASKED for multiplayer in most, if not all of these games.  These games would have sold well enough for the single player experience... yet the publishers/developers have made a conscious decision to give us that content anyway.  \n\nHow much money are they spending for a bunch of game modes and multiplayer we don't really need?  They're not being wise with their money, either.  My point?  It costs a lot of money to have a team work on great multiplayer... money and valuable resources which could otherwise be used on the single player campaign.

This name table is slightly bigger than the size of 4 times what is displayed on the TV screen (though often only 2 times unless the game manufacturer added extra ram to the carts). For example, here is the nametable for Super Mario 3 (you can view this yourself in most emulators):\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/VBT7YwL.png\n\nI've outlined roughly where the screen is in red. Notice how the left half and right half of the name table are identical, because of the mirroring I mentioned earlier. On a side note, the fact that this is mirrored, and the fact that name table palette ram affects 4 titles instead of 1 due once again to memory prices, causes the discoloration of tiles around the borders of the screen when playing Mario 3, because palette information 'leaks' over from one side of the screen to the other. This is usually hidden by overscan but on newer TVs it is very visible. Cool stuff.\n\nSo basically as you move the game loads 1 tile or so of memory at a time before the screen scrolls over it, every time the player moves beyond the boundary of 1 tile.

Crates can not give weapons or ammo. Airdrops can, and this was announced [MONTHS AGO](http://www.vg247.com/2014/08/16/h1z1-pc-ps4-gamescom-soe-live/)! \n&gt; \n&gt; And the airdrops are broke, they are suppose to drop randomly, within a certain radius of the player who calls it in to give them a chance to get it, but also to give others a chance to contest them. The crates also draw zombies towards it. This is very similar to the way Air drops in the game Rust used to work before they restarted the game. The outrage started when a bunch of people were watching on of the streamers on twitch encounter a bug that cause the crate to fall at his feet and inside was a shit ton of military grade gear. The gear is admittedly over powered, but they have already said that will be patched TODAY. To lessen the likelihood of high powered weapons and ammo being in airdrops. \n&gt; \n&gt; Reddit, you know better than to just believe everything you see posted ...\n\n[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2sn2du/please_do_not_get_h1z1_due_to_manipulative_lies/cnr9qsb)", "gilded": 0, "score": 22, "created": 1421441810.0},{"body": "They also said the only way to get weapons and supplies is to find them in the world or craft them, and that purchasing guns would make the game suck.
