In the English pattern, the image had become so blurred and indefinite that eventually it was taken to be the hilt of a sword.

He faces left and wears a plain red hat. He is armed with a halberd. Originally his right hand rested on the hilt of a sword, but this disappeared from the English pattern long before double ends were introduced. Nowadays the Jack of Hearts holds a small leaf in the fingers of his right hand. \n\n&gt;The Jack of Spades is seen in profile and faces right. The strange motif above his left hand is without explanation but it does offer us a clue. We are actually looking at him from behind as he glances over his shoulder.

No one else is there.\n\nStarting around 5:30, people start to trickle in pairs and threes. General banter and some show and tell happens. Several people commence burning discs or preparing shared folders to share cracked copies of popular games. At least three assholes fire up their Napster/Kazaa/Morpheus/torrent programs and start downloading things on the host's internet, dragging it to a crawl. Ten years later, at least one of their faces are plastered on social media after they were arrested molesting a goat or downloading a car.\n\nOne guy with the hookup brings two or three cases of Bawls/Surge/Jolt, he's the hero of the night. Also, he had his first heart attack at age 22 after snorting two lines and slamming a 12-pack of RedBull.\n\nSetup commences, and with it the usual realization of \"I forgot.....\". The host manages to cannibalize a few cables, mice, and spare parts laying around. Someone realizes there's only 9/12 available ports on the switch and an argument ensues over taking turns until the guy who's always tripping on acid suddenly remembers he has his pocket-hub with him. Bam, 6 extra ports are available, everyone can play. Somewhere in his late 20's, he finds God, becomes an Evangelical Christian, and eventually becomes a well-known televangelist. In his late 50's it's exposed he was sleeping with cheap hookers in shotgun motels, and he goes on national TV crying and apologizing for having \"sinned against You, my Lord.\"\n\nSome jackass needs to borrow a cracked copy of Win98 to install since his \"legit\" copy stopped working \"mysteriously.\" Someone doesn't have a video card capable of playing anything more than minesweeper because they're using an ancient Pentium II Dell tower, which is already worth more in scrap metals, gold, and recyclable plastics than it is as a computer. He sits on the couch alone and attempts to beat speed records for Goldeneye to unlock cheat modes. Every so often people get bored or knocked out and they play a few games of multiplayer with him. He eventually drops out of college to start a video game company that's hugely successful and nets him a fortune.\n\nAt least 3 computers are now a sickening brown color from cigarette smoke discoloring the cases. One computer is a hideous contraption in a \"modded\" case that barely works and occasionally starts to smoke for an inexplicable reason. It makes a decent pot of coffee though, which is important!\n\nA fight breaks out over what game is first, the host quickly shuts it down by proclaiming that he gets first pick as host. He picks an FPS, and another argument breaks out when the party demands the kid with the best computer run the \"server\", tanking his performance all night. \n\nSomeone keeps complaining that their sucking is because their keyboard sucks. One look confirms that it is, in fact, an ancient one from home is full of the nasty.\n\nSomewhere during his first sleep break, everyone quietly \"borrows\" the nicer keyboard/mouse/screen from the kid with the best computer that's running the server. They leave a pile of stained, grimy, and dysfunctional parts where he was sitting. When he wakes up, he throws a fit and leaves in his BMW. Years later, he's elected as Governor.\n\nOver the course of around 48 hours, the now-group of 10 people consumes close to 12 cases of soda (mostly offbrand), 8 pizzas (cheese and pepperoni), unverifiable amounts of candy, 4-5 bags of chips (the host's pantry go raided), 6 pots of coffee, two or three cases of energy drinks (thank you Heart Attack Guy), 3 pounds of chicken wings (for the lactose intolerant guy who couldn't eat pizza), two Sams/Costco wholesale size cases of hot pockets (assorted flavors; no one ate the Chicken, Cheddar, &amp; Broccoli ones though), and mysteriously one carrot that no one knows where or why it disappeared.\n\nAnd that my friends, is the LAN party at work.\n\n\nTL;DR - They all got the beetus!\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 393, "created": 1420745770.0},{"body": "I call it \"[LAN By Me](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092005/)\"\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 24, "created": 1420748943.0},{"body": "See, I started out loving LAN parties but I ended up hating them.

The box contained a ton of classic games. Some even rare. Megaman x2, 3 and a few other megaman games.  Some old school memory cards and controllers.  Mario 64, banjo tooie, and a bunch of other crap.  The owners pretty much told him the most they could do was $20.  Mind you, this was a rather large box that contained a ton of games that would most likely sell for $100+ \n\nPretty much one of the owners told the guy \"Sorry, not a lot of good stuff in here..most we can do is $20 for all of this. Honestly, half this stuff might just end up getting thrown out\"\n\nOf course, the guy agreed. After he got paid, and left. The owner was bragging about the big purchase he got from the guy at a low price. \n\nOverall this place has a lot of nice things.  Old retro stuff and a ton of merchandise.

I've got about 15 of these machines, almost all from eBay.  Most of them work.\n\nThe ones that weren't working fall into these categories:\n\n* Disk access stops working because of a [backwards installed capacitor](http://www.vintage-computer.com/vcforum/showthread.php?30903-Flaw-identified-in-Sanyo-MBC-55x-motherboard) that takes over a decade to go bad.  Fixing this problem is as simple as breaking the capacitor off the board.  All boards have the problem but not all experience symptoms.  It is the most common cause of issues, and was a simple screwup by whoever did the circuitry layout.\n\n* One machine was stored in a garage or something and had water leaking onto it and high humidity.  The galvanized steel case was in pretty bad shape.  Some motherboard traces were corroded, but appear intact.  An unknown problem affects the motherboard, but surprisingly shows some signs of life and it is evident that the processor is executing some code from the ROM, and video display circuitry is running.  Maybe an IC went bad from moisture infiltration.\n* A loose motherboard (purchased without the rest of the machine) is nonfunctional.  Cause not yet determined.\n* One machine had all the wires in the system cut.  Haven't tested the motherboard or disk drives yet, but my guess is they are working.\n* The infrared track 0 sensor in one floppy drive failed.  The rest of the drive probably works.\n* One floppy drive is starting to experience problems in the rotation speed regulation circuit.  I may swap its IR sensor to the drive that had that problem, if it's the same style drive.\n* One cooling fan is loud, because it had never been run.  Maybe the lubricant is screwy because of that.\n\nAll of the tested power supplies work (they are dead simple and way overbuilt).  It's somewhat rare to find the keyboards still with the system but they don't fare quite as well.  Definitely the weakest component.  If they're well taken care of they tend to survive though.\n\nI guess my point is, 1 difficult to diagnose motherboard problem, 2 floppy drive problems, issues caused by inconsiderate owners, and crappy keyboards are pretty much all that's wrong with 15 of these machines after roughly 30 years.
