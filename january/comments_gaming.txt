I figured I wasn't the only one who wanted to know that.

EDIT: So this is the BDSM edition? "Ah crap, I thought hound tethers was trump!" Ill raise you my Queen of whisks everyone mocks the King of Whisks...until he *beats* you nah, he's *whipped* by the Queen of Whisks.

You win some, lose some, it's all the same to me.

The pleasure is to play, makes no difference what you say.

I don't share your greed, the only card I need is

The ace of dog tethers! the ace of dog tethers! Well now I wanna play Tony Hawk today. Thanks I always loved the perfect rail balance cheat. I would just let Darth Maul loop on the pools for hours. Could you imagine watching that at the X-games?
"Tony Hawk has been holding that nose stall for eight hours!! It's unbelievable!! The crowd has left three hours ago!" "Mr.Hawk, how does it feel to hold a trick like this for so long?"

But that's the way I like it baby  
I don't wanna live for ever........  
And don't forget the game noose Knave of whisks looks like he's seen some shit. There's a game up north called whisk.  Could it be? How do you raise a card...? It takes a village.... You nurture it until it's 18 with your hand Upvote exclusively for euchre ref! 'Trump' can refer to a lot of games, not just euchre. My family plays a game called trump... With trump. So... That game is actually called The Apprentice. YOU'RE FIRED With Donald? Could've been bridge too [Or all of these](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trick-taking_games) How could I forget Schafkopf!  Man, we played Euchre constantly in high school.  I've since moved away and cannot for the life of me ever find three other people who know how to play.  I've tried to teach people but either its an incredibly hard game to teach, or I'm a terrible teacher, so I've given up.  :/ I totally understand this. Usually it's all good until you start talking about bauers. It's such a great game, but by the time everyone wants to play cards at a party, the alcohol has made it impossible to teach this wonderful game. The whole world's against us. "The jack of the trump suit is the highest card in the game"

"Wait, why is a jack higher than an ace?"

"Because it is.  But only this one.  The other jacks stay jacks.  Now, also, the jack of the same color as the trump suit *becomes* the trump suit and is the second highest card in the game."

*Blank stares* im not even drunk yet and i still watted Somewhere in ontario or the upper Midwest originally? I've only ever found people who knew the game from ontario, western new york, michigan, wisconsin, minnesota, and one guy who said they were from ohio. Yes I am in Columbus, OH and you can pretty much ask any group of random people if they play euchre and at least half will say yes.

Edit: My terrible math skills have come to light.  [deleted] No that's me next question: how did we get from these to hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades? [The French!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suit_%28cards%29) Ah the french, their innovation brought us Mille Bornes, a game that runs rampant in our family. &gt; Mille Bornes

Oh wow. That's a game I haven't played in a looooong time. Thanks for the memories! The history goes back to when my grandparents were still married, I've been playing it for about 25 years (im 33 now), and at one point sold roughly 1,000 decks on ebay. I have 3 complete sets from the 1970's along with a few made recently. There's one picture in my collection of my grandmother and I playing during a cross-country trip we made in an RV in the early 90's. Dad and I still play whenever I visit, and there's a free android version called "Safe Trip Or Not" with online functionality if you have a relative who lives elsewhere. I'm always up for an online game, inbox me if you have the desire and the means. Same here, played it all the time as a kid.  Maybe I'll get a deck so I can show my wife COUP-FOURR!!!! Unfortunately, my family loves to hold grudges even after the game is done. Just because I gave my mother a flat tire-- and dad didn't have a spare, only a bunch of green lights-- I wasn't allowed to have dessert :(  Woah, TIL that Mille Bornes is a known game outside of France. I play that game with my kids to this day.   But don't play it exactly to the rules.   It's so hard to get going again if you use a green after every repair. *Mille Bornes*
Oh my *yes*- I had forgotten about this game. Up all night playing against the computer when I was a kid.
...aaand there's only *two* Mille Bornes games in the app store? Surely we can do better than *that*.  Okay, so why do we call it both clovers and clubs? I mean, it looks like a clover, not a club. [The Italians!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_playing_cards)

(Also why it's spade/sword instead of pike) So a they're named for a completely different suit then. Got it. My ex's dad called them puppy tracks Your ex's dad was adorable. Probably because the ace of dog collars doesn't sound as good.  True, and the 'Queen of Dog Collars' sounds like the proprietor of a BDSM shop. Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?

Oh, you're a hard one

THE ACE OF DOG COLLARS

THE ACE OF DOG COLLARS [mm](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/010/566/060.png) &gt;ace of dog collars

That would be the Pope, right? http://i.imgur.com/V0FzGC0.jpg The ancestors of hearts/diamonds/clubs/spades were cups/coins/sticks/swords. Which actually have history that go back further than these, so it's likely that this was just some kind of themed deck rather than these suits ever actually being the "standard" ones. Also worth noting that cups/coins/sticks/swords is still the current Spanish Deck, which (outside of casinos) is played more than the French Deck over here. The newest German invention is [this one](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Skatblatt_Turnierbild.jpg), done after unification. The west was playing Skat with French suits, the East was using [German suits](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Complete_Saxonian_deck.jpg/1024px-Complete_Saxonian_deck.jpg). 

[Hybrids](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Schnapskarten_dt-fr.jpg/1024px-Schnapskarten_dt-fr.jpg) so that players used to either can play together exist, but frankly the "French suits, German colours" version is the one that doesn't look like a mishappen mongrel. Also, you can't *talk* about those suits if people keep using different names.

Oh, and it's "squares", "hearts", "pike", "cross". I'd imagine as some point someone wanted to mass produce them, and it's easier to stamp simple shapes.

Annnd yup.

Late 1400s, french wanted to make them with stencils. Simple designs. more like salad tongs, dog collars, onions, and seahorses The onions even look like they're tied to a belt... Which was the style at the time.. As was the fashion at the time I was thinking: sextants, ginger wigs, whisks, and tribbles with legs. I was thinking sextants as well. I was thinking hunting horns, egg beaters, weird hats, and tiny double-execution nooses. Which one is the game noose and which one is the hound tether and what the hell is a game noose anyway- all I found was a hangman's noose (doesn't sound like a very fun game) It's a noose for hanging game.  Game = hunted animals. I believe it's hound tethers, dog collars, game noose, and hunting horn from top to bottom. I thought they were bondage themed. ... Y'know, dog collars really haven't evolved much, have they? They'd be worth so much more if the owner kept them sealed in the packaging...

Thank you, random citizen. [Old Maid is a Victorian-era card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_maid_\(card_game\)).

wikibot, what is Old Maid? Wikibot has forsaken thee. Wikibot, why hast thou forsaken me? Because it likes clean carpet for when guests are over you damn hippy. Buy some shoes.

Bottom of second paragraph. *The backs of the cards are plain paper, unpainted.*


 No one-eyed jacks or suicide kings.  I wonder where that design came from anyway.  http://whiteknucklecards.com/history/frenchsuits.html

Lots of good info on this site.

Hearts, clubs, spades &amp; diamonds are known as 'French Suits'

http://whiteknucklecards.com/nsp/englishpattern.html
&gt;Originally, the Rouen King of Hearts wielded an axe in his left hand. In the English pattern, the image had become so blurred and indefinite that eventually it was taken to be the hilt of a sword. In the English standard the King of Diamonds is nicknamed, The Suicide King, as the blade he weilds cuts back behind his head. 

http://i.imgur.com/XdytaBz.jpg

&gt;The Jack of Hearts is one of two One-Eyed Jacks in the deck, the other being the Spade. He faces left and wears a plain red hat. He is armed with a halberd. Originally his right hand rested on the hilt of a sword, but this disappeared from the English pattern long before double ends were introduced. Nowadays the Jack of Hearts holds a small leaf in the fingers of his right hand. 

&gt;The Jack of Spades is seen in profile and faces right. The strange motif above his left hand is without explanation but it does offer us a clue. We are actually looking at him from behind as he glances over his shoulder. In the original, he stands like this holding a halberd or pike.  You have to buy the DLC to view it.  Elizabeth II Still worth less than a Black Lotus Still worth less than red LTD deck ahh, the classic suits of Horns, whisks, magnets and tongs.  They're hunting tools :) serious question: How do you hunt with a magnet and tongs? Very carefully The question isn't how you hunt, but *what* you hunt. 

[Stymphalian birds] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stymphalian_birds), thats what.

You use the magnets to catch them, and the tongs to pick them up safely (due to their poisonous dung and sharp metal feathers). I'm not sure which surprises me more, the fact that this is a serious-ish response, or the fact that you actually found a goddamn metal bird.
 They were one of the trials of Heracles. In Italy we still play traditional games with a deck that looks almost like that. 40 cards, 4 suits. 8, 9 and 10 are respectively a jack, a knight and a King. There are also graphical variations based on regional differences.

[These are the Neapolitan version](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Carte_napoletane_al_completo.jpg), [these the ones from Piacenza, "Piacentine"](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Carte_piacentine_al_completo.jpg). France, Spain and Italy all have huge tradition of cards game. I guess that's a latin thing. And they all have their own version. Italy play with 7 cards, Spain 9 and France 10. And we basically all play the same games, but with slight difference.


When i saw your cards, i thought it was for the "Aluette" . Which is a french game, played with spanish cards. Then i counted them, and realise that was italian cards. 

Are they used to play scopa ? Yup. What games do you recommend? A couple months ago I got a deck of what I believe are Spanish cards, same suites as what you show but 12 per suite. I got them as a novelty, but have since been interested in finding games that use decks with less than 52. With the deck I posted, my favorite games are ["Briscola"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briscola), which is extremely fun when played with 4 people; ["Scopa"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopa), which I think is the most popular one and also has a number of fun variations; ["Tressette"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tressette) (three sevens) is also pretty popular, especially in southern Italy. I used to play brisc with my grandpa. Very fun game. I always thought taking out the 8s,9s, and 10s was just part of the game. Didn't know Italians had 40 card decks.  "Truco" is my favourite game to play with those cards.  In Argentina we play [Truco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truco). It's so much fun playing it on two teams of 2 or 3 people each! This is the only game I know how to play with spanish cards.  http://www.pagat.com/put/truco_ar.html  
People play this game all over my campus. Scopa and Briscola are very popular card games using 40-card deck. I love them! Shameless plug- check out my [dark themed Neopoletane deck on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1760907460/scopa-scuro-dark-themed-italian-playing-cards). I'm also working on another themed deck based on the Piacentine deck. Well they look cool! Good luck with your Kickstarter, it's a very small niche you're targeting.  For a minute I wondered why there aren't localized versions of computer card games like Solitaire, but then I realized the red/black pairing (which only exists in the French suits) is actually pretty important to the most common solitaire games (Klondike and FreeCell).

Do you have any games that treat cups/coins (hearts/diamonds = red) and swords/batons (spades/clubs = black) as a single unit or as being strongly paired in some way? What is the suit that looks like the disk? I recognize the cups, swords, and clubs but not the first one.  In italian they are called "denari", from an ancient roman coin called [Denarius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius). Coins I got to study there this summer and was sure to take a deck back to the US to teach everyone Scopa Beautiful, but it fills me with questions.

It strikes me as odd that the top jack looks like a joker.  Was he used differently from the other jacks?

Also, the pips are completely different from what we use today.  I wonder if they called the suits the same things? Jack/Joker was interchangeable back then, until the Germans developed Whist and Euchre - which used two extra Jacks as "Bauers". Fast forward, and we just started adding two more "Jacks" (Knights) in there - but, ohtehnoes, what do we do to differentiate them? I know! Make them *Jesters* instead! Brilliant!

Source: There are two types of wide-use playing cards in the modern era; Spanish (Cups, Coins, Cudgels/Clubs (weaponized), Swords) and French - Diamonds, Clubs (Symbolized), Spades, Hearts. You use these two decks to play the real-life fictional game in Discworld "Cripple Mr. Onion" (Blackjack with high strategy and "Screw! Everyone!" mentality). &gt;which used two extra Jacks as "Bauers"

And terrorists everywhere would forever rue that day. It means farmer in case anyone cares.

(in any other case, it still means farmer. no homo nyms) I got to "Bauer" and skipped to the end because I thought you were bullshitting Never play Euchre? You're missing out. That and 5 man euchre are the only reasons my housemates and I  didn't die of boredom when we were snowed in last year. When I moved to Ohio, everyone played that game. It's totally ubiquitous in the midwest. At what point did you realize he wasn't bullshitting? Because... he wasn't bullshitting.

English-speaking Euchre players apparently call them "bowers" based off a phonetic translation. My dad loves euchre and I always wondered why he called the jacks bauers. Thanks for that little bit of trivia! &gt; There are two types of wide-use playing cards in the modern era

The German suits (32 cards, Bells/Spheres, Acorns, Leaves and hearts) are also used a lot, as far as I know. Not only are they used in Germany, but throughout the Central Europe (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary etc.). 
 "jack bauer"... Are you kidding me? I caught that the first time I saw the show. I gave a slow clap.  Oh yeah, had those in the junk drawer in the castle for 500 years. i would so buy a replica set of these me too! I think I will print them. the image seems to have high enough resolution.. any idea how large they were? [Museum page](http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/475513?=&amp;imgno=1&amp;tabname=object-information) linked elsewhere in this thread says:

&gt;Each approx.: 5 3/8 x 2 3/4 in. (13.7 x 7 cm) Follow the link. Read the page. I'm pretty sure there were measurements in there.

Edit: Dimensions: Each approx.: 5 3/8 x 2 3/4 in. (13.7 x 7 cm)

 [deleted] "Is that an 8?"

"No, sorry, that's a 9."

Repeat this conversation every single hand. Just look at the 8, if you diagonally cut it in half in your mind you see right away 4 and 4. If you do the same with the 9 you see 4 and 5. Its actually really well made in my opinion. Where the fuck is my blue eyes white dragon? http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/475513 How did you get from "only known complete deck of **illuminated ordinary*** playing cards from the fifteenth century" to "oldest full deck of playing cards known"? Are you a journalist? There is a pack a full 1000 years older which is well known, however it is missing the IX of  so it doesn't count. Can you imagine being the owner. "I know that fucking card is around here somewhere." as you tear the house apart.  I see your three of christmas tree horn ornaments, and double churn you a  five of yarn garlic bulbs.

"Why a five of yarn garlic bulbs!? Well... try my nine of double noose headphones on for size!" Does anyone know why this style of curved edge cards fell out of style? Also, can you get cards shaped like this anywhere? Probably a combination of being harder to automate cutting (you could do it _now_, but in the 19th/20th century?) and more waste material (could be recycled now, but again). I have no idea of the actual reason, but shuffling these would not be fun.  Also, packaging in rectangles is much more efficient and leads to more organization. "verily, doth thou havest of thrice?"

"nay good sir, partake in mongery!" 52 cards in a deck, same as the weeks in a year. 4 suits, 4 seasons, and if you add up all of the dots on a suit and multiply it by four (for each suit) it adds up to 364. EDIT: A word. Ugh..no numbers...you mean I have to count...pass. no legendaries... We still use cards like these in Italy, except there are 40 cards per deck. Check out /u/escaday's comment in this thread. I wonder if card sleights would be significantly harder with a rounded shape like that. When did jokers get introduced? The ace of Garlic.   Looks like the Italian cards I grew up playing with.  Nooses Wild THE ACE OF WHISKS THE ACE OF WHISKS! 

\m/ I just saw this the other day! You can see them on display at [The Cloisters](http://www.metmuseum.org/visit/visit-the-cloisters) in NYC, along with other cool stuff like reliquaries, tapestries, thrones, fireplaces, stained glass and even a narwhal tooth from medieval times. Super cool, and only costs a "suggested" donation! 

 stating how old the cards are actually might be useful..... [Dear god why](http://i.imgur.com/Nn3AzoI.png) I guess they threw out the jokers too.  Before the introduction of suicide kings and one-eyed jacks.

That blockbuster video box propping up the monitor. Wonderful timestamp. That poor guy installing Windows 98 in the background, he has several hours until he can join the party. :( There is always that one guy who has to format at the lan party. This is so true it hurts.  Seriously, I used to email the list of games and stuff, "please come prepared so we can start right away". NOPE, 8 hours of installing shit, and yea, some random guy with the hobbling along box that needs to be fixed, some dude reinstalling for the 7th time that week. I do miss those days though. twenty six foppy disks...and disk 22 was demagnetized.

FML But the Z. Cavaricci sweatshirt throws everything off. That shouldn't have seen the light of day past 1990. These are LAN-party attendees.  While good at reducing lag in their gaming sessions, they suffer huge lag in their fashion sensibilities.  Often as much as a decade.
 These are the people who won at life, to be honest.

Let me explain. You don't fit in, you're teased in school.. rather than try to be someone you're not, you just say FUCK IT and be yourself. You find those who are like you, and have SHITLOADS OF FUN blowing each other away in Quake.

The losers are the ones who kept trying to be something they're not to fit society's twisted ideals, never really succeeding because it never really works.

Be yourself. Find friends who will love you for being you. That's winning. Is it just me or am I the only person in the country that doesn't even know someone that was beat up in high school or that did the beating *raises hand* I always thought bullying was an over exaggerated myth when I was in school. You don't have to tell me.  I would have been *literally* just like those guys, at almost exactly that time.  In college in mid-to-late 90s, with a salvaged 13" monitor and a computer I built in a cardboard box to save the cost of the case.  Regular LAN-party attendee.  Computer Engineering degree.  Fashion sense exactly as described above.   

Edit: and in case I'm still not being clear, not only was I just like that, I'm still like that, and I very definitely think I won at life in terms of happiness with my choice of activities.  I'm right in the middle of rescheduling this week's D&amp;D game, while I do my software job from home and ponder what video game I'll spend the evening obsessed with on my gloriously overpowered gaming rig.  And before you ask, ladies, I'm happily married.   Also is it just me or wasn't it more fun playing multiplayer games like that back in the day, everyone shouting at each other over their monitors and stuff. Nowadays it's always online.  Half the fun of LAN parties in the 90s was getting a mountain dew from the fridge after a round, and before you know it everyone is just hanging out in the kitchen for an hour talking about how awesome the last round was instead of actually playing.  Agreed, but I would have accepted a Hypercolor shirt.   or a pair of Skids or a Champion sweatshirt (in either purple or teal)/ [A VHS tape no less](http://i.imgur.com/3937yJl.jpg) Never saw that till now...

This is quite a spectacular snapshot of the nerd in his natural habitat.  stereotypical jackass shows up to a lan party to install windows. happens every time lawl. Absolutely. He blamed it on something that seemed legit. But, yes, fresh install of windows occurred. Every single lan party I went to back in the day had SOMEONE with catastrophic hardware or software failure.  Once we even built a replacement PC from everybody's spare parts with the case as a cardboard box. Holy crap - I can remember doing the same with everyone's spare parts during a Doom II party - we built the replacement machine into an empty beer carton, because we were too lazy to strip out the tower that Andy insisted on lugging with him to every gaming night we had.

Fucking Andy kept that machine running for nearly 12 months - it was an ongoing joke that eventually became the most robust, un-killable machine in our entire group.

When it finally gave up the ghost (I believe someone knocked a can of coke into the top of it), it spat sparks all over the room. We salvaged what we could, and gave that horrible Frankenstein of a machine a valkyrie farewell in the backyard.

(I was grounded for a week for scorching an ugly black patch into the grass in my parents' backyard...)

**edit**: Gold! I should get my parents to ground me more often... but that would be weird, considering I'm 41 years old...

But we still had someone do a re-install of windows. That was me. My main harddrive decided to selfdestruct after I dropped the case. Self destruct? I'm pretty sure it was the part where you dropped it on the floor that broke it... By "self" destruct he's referring to himself "self" destruct after dropping the case lolz For the young people, pc parts weren't as plug-and-play back then either. You had to configure a fair bit more stuff manually to get self-built computers to work right  Seriously, does it say something about people or something about windows that no matter where you lived and who you knew, if you organized a LAN party, one jackass showed up needing to install windows. Captured here for posterity. There's always one.  Or the guy who did not have any games installed, or patched to the correct version, or NIC drivers, or anything else for that matter. You get everybody set up, and then break for lunch because buddy hasn't patched his game in six months. Windows 98, installed that shit so many times. Installing Windows is so much easier these days. Just stick the disk in, go get a coffee and it's practically done. You're forgetting the 5+ hours of Windows Updates, at least for Windows 7 SP1 refreshed ISO image.

Whelp, put in my 8 hours for the day.  I'll come back and work on this tommorow... This.  Windows updates are so bad.  There's always a couple that fail too for no apparent reason other than to make you restart once more so they can install successfully on the 2nd or 3rd try.  I wish MS would take a clue from Linux.

    sudo pacman -Syu

Does **all** the updates in one go no matter how out of date you are.  Restart only needed if the kernel is updated (and there are methods to avoid a restart even there.) FYI if you use the windows media creation tool (I've always done it to USB) then it downloads a recent version from Microsoft. I believe it only works for 8.1 though.

Thanks for the Gold!
Heres a link to the microsoft page since I'm now on my desktop:

 Slipstream those patches, brah.
 Yup, and almost all your drivers will work when Windows boots up. And any that don't can be auto installed. It's such a pleasant experience.

I had to do an install a few weeks ago, and I was done within the hour. No messing around with changing disks, or trying to find a boot floppy and Partition Magic. There was also that guy that would always show up to download porn on eDonkey because he didn't have sweet sweet ISDN at home. &gt; ISDN

Now there's an acronym I haven't heard in a long time.

 It's an older acronym, but it checks out.  I heard them mention it on the Howard Stern show from time to time.  Apparently that's what they use when someone on air works from home. Yeah, if I remember right, it was originally used in radio just for voice and not data as it had better quality than typical phone connections.  I think it's still pretty widely used in radio, especially for syndicated shows. It's used because it's a fixed, guaranteed connection. Edonkey?  Dude, if there wasn't half an hour of swapping porn over the LAN beforehand then it wasn't worth doing it. Heh, I remember QuakeCon way back when being a massive porn swap. Everyone, and I mean everyone, would browse the network for porn before any gaming would happen.

Ah, the good old days of downloaded porn. Never LAN without your windows CDs! or even worse, 30 or so disk :/ ugh, the "Descent over null modem IPX" days Or worse, Descent over 10base2 strung down the residence hall hallways. Never any fucking terminators. Why do we have to buy more terminators every time we do this? WHY? 

 Worth it though -- Descent was awesome!  One of the first games you could enter and leave without crashing it for everyone! Same guy who transfers your whole porn collection to his PC Was that not like half the point of these things?  So much file sharing. Yeah we had a folder with music that was passed around every lan. Pretty much half my school knew that playlist by heart. The other half the school were girls. Now That's What I Call BURN: Volume 29 Came here to comment that.

There's always that one fucking guy who has to reinstall Windows. We had that one guy who would show up with his PC, put it up at a good spot but then "had to leave for a while". Second day in we decided to change his color scheme a little.
Pink in pink. Eventually resulted in a reinstallation, two weeks later when he came to pick up his PC again. That's some intense wood paneling. The wood paneling pairs nicely with the jean shorts.

 Wait a minute... I still wear jean shorts. Well stop it. Dooooon't stop, blue jeannning ohohohoooooooohoho Hold on to that deeeeeniiiiimmm!  That hurts even to just read Are you a dad? *jorts Buddy... Any chance you're a University of Florida Grad?

Just asking. Tight jean shorts with rolled cuffs are kinda in with hipsters I kinda like that wood paneling... It'd be great for a warm color room.  [deleted] Please don't let me be in this. Please don't let me be in this.

Whew. Richard? Is that you?  Mr. Z Cavaricci  - his name wouldn't happen to be Mike would it? My god does he look a co-worker of mine. Not Mike... But would LOVE IT if they see this and send me a PM. Good times, unfortunately, don't keep up much with these dudes.  Jeff? Cramulon 5? Michael? Bluesnews, Captured, and Planetquake... oh the memories.

What clan were you in? We were founding members of the 0 Positive clan... We played CS, Quake and Unreal Tournament. The memories.  Unreal!!!  Best LAN game ever IMO.  [Unreal Tournament](http://www.unrealtournament.com/blog/)

Its back in development, and its going to be free! /r/unrealtournament

UT lan parties were the best.

I played that game for years. Low-gravity Instagib CTF 135/35 speed with zeroping mutator. CS in the Half-Life mod days was awesome. I managed to win a CS tournament for Western Canada with some guys I knew at a giant lan party in an airplane hangar in Edmonton. Fragapalooza 2000! I won a Voodoo 3! [deleted] Shacknews too.  .finger updates from the ID software guys as they invent 3D gaming... so many memories. 

Not to mention them tinkering with their cars.  setup time: 4 hours You mean you actually finished the setup and played games before it was time to pack up? You mean you didnt set up friday and then pack up sunday night? And after only 5hrs sleep curled up under the table? Exactly. For me, half the fun was setting up. Configuring the network, setting up a game servers, making file shares... ahh the nostalgia.  Stahp. You're making me pastsick. Word gets out during lunch on Wednesday, a guy is hosting a LAN party at his place this Friday: straight gaming party all weekend, nonstop, tons of fun, etc etc. Gaming starts Friday, 4PM SHARP!

5PM Friday rolls around, crickets are chirping, and the host is watching The Simpsons and drinking a Coke with his best friend and co-organizer. No one else is there.

Starting around 5:30, people start to trickle in pairs and threes. General banter and some show and tell happens. Several people commence burning discs or preparing shared folders to share cracked copies of popular games. At least three assholes fire up their Napster/Kazaa/Morpheus/torrent programs and start downloading things on the host's internet, dragging it to a crawl. Ten years later, at least one of their faces are plastered on social media after they were arrested molesting a goat or downloading a car.

One guy with the hookup brings two or three cases of Bawls/Surge/Jolt, he's the hero of the night. Also, he had his first heart attack at age 22 after snorting two lines and slamming a 12-pack of RedBull.

Setup commences, and with it the usual realization of "I forgot.....". The host manages to cannibalize a few cables, mice, and spare parts laying around. Someone realizes there's only 9/12 available ports on the switch and an argument ensues over taking turns until the guy who's always tripping on acid suddenly remembers he has his pocket-hub with him. Bam, 6 extra ports are available, everyone can play. Somewhere in his late 20's, he finds God, becomes an Evangelical Christian, and eventually becomes a well-known televangelist. In his late 50's it's exposed he was sleeping with cheap hookers in shotgun motels, and he goes on national TV crying and apologizing for having "sinned against You, my Lord."

Some jackass needs to borrow a cracked copy of Win98 to install since his "legit" copy stopped working "mysteriously." Someone doesn't have a video card capable of playing anything more than minesweeper because they're using an ancient Pentium II Dell tower, which is already worth more in scrap metals, gold, and recyclable plastics than it is as a computer. He sits on the couch alone and attempts to beat speed records for Goldeneye to unlock cheat modes. Every so often people get bored or knocked out and they play a few games of multiplayer with him. He eventually drops out of college to start a video game company that's hugely successful and nets him a fortune.

At least 3 computers are now a sickening brown color from cigarette smoke discoloring the cases. One computer is a hideous contraption in a "modded" case that barely works and occasionally starts to smoke for an inexplicable reason. It makes a decent pot of coffee though, which is important!

A fight breaks out over what game is first, the host quickly shuts it down by proclaiming that he gets first pick as host. He picks an FPS, and another argument breaks out when the party demands the kid with the best computer run the "server", tanking his performance all night. 

Someone keeps complaining that their sucking is because their keyboard sucks. One look confirms that it is, in fact, an ancient one from home is full of the nasty.

Somewhere during his first sleep break, everyone quietly "borrows" the nicer keyboard/mouse/screen from the kid with the best computer that's running the server. They leave a pile of stained, grimy, and dysfunctional parts where he was sitting. When he wakes up, he throws a fit and leaves in his BMW. Years later, he's elected as Governor.

Over the course of around 48 hours, the now-group of 10 people consumes close to 12 cases of soda (mostly offbrand), 8 pizzas (cheese and pepperoni), unverifiable amounts of candy, 4-5 bags of chips (the host's pantry go raided), 6 pots of coffee, two or three cases of energy drinks (thank you Heart Attack Guy), 3 pounds of chicken wings (for the lactose intolerant guy who couldn't eat pizza), two Sams/Costco wholesale size cases of hot pockets (assorted flavors; no one ate the Chicken, Cheddar, &amp; Broccoli ones though), and mysteriously one carrot that no one knows where or why it disappeared.

And that my friends, is the LAN party at work.


TL;DR - They all got the beetus!


 I call it "[LAN By Me](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092005/)"
 See, I started out loving LAN parties but I ended up hating them. I was the only computer fixey expert.... so it was my networking gear and there was always 1-2 guys who would show up with their non-networked computers, so I'd spend the first 2-3 hours slapping in a spare NIC, installing drivers, no wait, he doesn't have service pack 3 installed, downloading drivers, crap host doesn't have internet, run home, get driver, go back.  Everyone had drank themselves asleep by the time I got to play anything because I spent the whole night doing goddamned tech support. &gt;  mysteriously one carrot that no one knows where or why it disappeared

If I learned anything from Dave Chapel you put it in the passed out kid's ass right after you stole his keyboard. Pretty accurate I must say, but why did you leave out weed smoking? Also, back in the day, lactose intolerance wasn't even a word yet. I still remember having to deal with a friends Packard Bell and trying to get Windows 95 to play nice with the ISA 10Base2 network card (eventually found out the ISA daughtercard wasn't seated fully) . That took at least 1.5 hours. I bought a pack of 10 for $5 each so we could LAN in style. Getting the cables laid out nice and terminated took at least an hour each time until we all sprung for 10Base-T. 

Being from southern Arizona sucked with multiple screaming teenagers, computers, and CRT monitors in a single room with inadequate AC.  Used to run some good old Duke Nukem lan parties.

Lugging around CRT monitors...yep I did the full LAN party thing a few times with a 17" monitor.  We figured out that it was much easier to go to the computer lab of a local college and use their computers and LAN.   [deleted] I love how the late 90s feels like the 80s for some reason. Well it is almost 2 decades ago. Time seems to have stopped ever since we crossed the millenium. People in their early 20s think that way, but just wait, everything form the 00's is about to become incredibly dorky. I just watched the pilot of Always Sunny in Philadelphia the other day (2005) and was surprised at how dated it looked. Some things looked like they would fit right now, some things looked closer to 90s style. You can definitely see it with tech and media. if you search for Amazon wishlists/listmanias you can see certain items of tech becoming obsolete and some things that look hilariously dated. In fact most things on these lists that aren't media are very outdated e.g. minidisc players, 64mb mp3 players, small 4mpx cameras etc... that were all the rage back in the early to mid 2000s. The later 2000s look relevant to today.

It's weirdly fascinating. I forgot most of this shit existed to be honest.
 This is truth. For whatever reason 2002-03 still feels like today. The cars had the beginnings of the new "style" that most cars today have. Average hair and clothes are extremely similar as well. The baggy style was still in but quite a bit of "hipster" style clothing could be seen as well. Music is awfully similar, with some added genres like dubstep and other elctronic-based music. Finally, movies... there's a massive amount of movies that look the same as well. I feel there's far less of a disconnect between the last 15 years than in all the decades of the last century, where times were obviously changing, styles were radically different and "pop" music was nearly unrecognizable from one decade to the next. 

It also feels like big time famous celebrities are living out their fame for way longer periods of time. Eminem for example, still feels pretty relevant and he was massive 15 years ago. Just fees like time is slowing down a bit in terms of how fast "culture" is changing.

If you look at the difference between 1985 and 2000 and compare that to 2000-2015... it's crazy. 85-2000 feels like time traveling to another world. Culture was vastly different.  I wasn't sure I agreed with you until I got to the bottom. 1985-2000 compared to 2000-2015 is pretty damn fascinating  You have to take the pictures in context though.  For instance, one of those guys is wearing a Cavaricci shirt (which went out of style about 6-7 years before this pictures).  There is tons of wood paneling, something that was also more prevalent in the 70s and 80s.

In other words, the people in this picture weren't exactly living in the now when it came to presentation, which is why you feel like it's the 80s. People in the future always forget how much leftover shit from the past there is lying around.

Look around your place. See how much stuff you have still that you bought in 2005.  Unfortunately you can see that the wood paneling is warped from the water damage that occurred whilst these gentlemen drowned in pussy. These guys created a 'Quake' of their own from all the pussy pounding.     Just LANding in all that poon. National LANpoon's Quake Party https://i.imgur.com/SVtqhXS.gif The weight on that poor ping pong table.  Hey that's nothing...ping pong tables are heavy so they're usually reinforced in the center. 

I personally watched a 500+ dollar sony trinitron CRT bust through the center of a particleboard topper on a folding card table. I love how computers got small enough to use at LAN parties and not be a huge chore; just in time for the internet to become good enough to eliminate the need. Meeting up with people doesn't really get replaced by online gaming. At least not for all of us! Pizza together after 1000000 frags ist part of the game! we used to do this at the office with Mechwarrior 2.  Jump Jets FTW! Someone made an easy to use netmech client.  http://www.mech2.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=512

It's pretty much install and play.

*edit* if anyone is looking to play shoot me a pm, but i'll be lurking in the client for a little bit so you can just install and hop in.

I also made /r/netmech for organizing future games.

*edit again* **2:07 pm eastern** we got a few people in the lobby, waiting to see if anyone else pops in to play

**edit again sigh**  next planned game time I guess will be 1pm Eastern, 7pm CET tomorrow.  I'm down and I know another will be, let's do it.  All you reallly need is two people loaded in the client and you can get some games going, let your friend know. I still think that is my favorite multiplayer game of all time. I can't adequately express how much I miss those days. Nerds were much stronger back then from carrying 200 pound monitors around.  Try I miss them a whole lot. [Z. Cavaricci?](http://i.lvme.me/f4bmn5t.jpg) Came here to make sure this was mentioned. Tucked in? Yep. 90's status confirmed.  tucked into blue jean shorts.  that's key. By 1998, Z. Cavaricci had been out of style for a long time.  I think it was actually cool in like 1988.   1991, TOPS! Well that's appropriate for this group of guys. Lol I laughed at that too. Reminded me of when my sister was 13 and thought it was the end of the world because our folks wouldn't pony up the dough for her to have those jeans.  MMMmmmm CRTs RIP degauss button :( I just heard the sound in my head and my vision went all wobbly for a few seconds... Best to stay away from MRI machines. &gt; CRT

1600x1200@75hz on an Iiyama in '98.

Only this year was I able to go past 75hz on an LCD and I still can't afford more than x1080.

Quality might have weighed a bit, but it was worth it. *DEGAUSS* Aah I miss the days when grown men got together and daisy-chained power strips to 20 CRT monitors in a small room producing enough radiation to cat-scan Moby Dick

M-e-m-o-r-i-e-s This is the most 90's thing I've seen all week. Most 90s thing I've seen *all year!*

Hahahahahahah! Image 3 is of your guys' girlfriends.
 http://i.imgur.com/TaTdV.gif?news Quake II Rail Gun is perhaps my favorite FPS weapon of all time. Those were amazing days. Thanks for the post; it brought back many fond memories.  Maybe I'm just old, but it feels like the magic of those days is gone somewhat. LAN parties used to be a mind-blowing gaming experience because the connection was *so much better*. Every game became a completely different experience compared to playing online with the kind of lag we used to have back then. Add to that the fun of hanging out with a bunch of other gaming nerds at a time when gaming was so much less mainstream and they were truly a special occasion.  Absolutely. It's a shame...my friends and I will still stay up until 3 or 4 AM in the morning on a Friday night to play some LoL...but they never want to get together to LAN anymore. There was a definite element of camaraderie that being in the same room provided. One of the things I loved most about LAN parties was the humor. When you type something clever in party chat you might get a couple of "lol"s, but that's a pretty hollow replacement for cracking up a whole room full of people and getting to share in the laughter.

Ventrilo/Teamspeak have brought that back to a degree, but still, its not quite the same. This fills me with such nostalgia.  I need to try to do this again.

**Warning:  Nerd flashback follows**

I built my first PC when I was 16.  I mean, I Frankenstein'd one out of older family stuff (16 MB RAM whoop whoop), but the first one I built for myself from scratch had to wait until I had a job because my dad would be damned if he shelled out $400 for a CPU.

I built this green monstrosity, using the Soyo Dragon server tower as a case because clearly bigger is better and airflow and something something more fans.  Which it had.  I couldn't ever discreetly game at night (Doom 3 had just come out and I refused to play it unless it was pitch black) because it sounded like a fucking F-16 was taking off in my room.

I don't remember what the hot shit was at the time, but I had an nVidia GeForce something, AMD Athlon (don't think it even had dual core yet) and some stick of fucking RAM I paid $400 for because it was that new. My old man was shitting his pants because I had 80 GB of storage, compared to the 1GB family Piece of Shit(TM).  I had a 24" CRT from ViewSonic to behold my magestic games (RIP in peace UT2k3 and Total Annihilation).

I had a few buddies that were hardcore Diablo 2 players and I would lug this massive fucking monitor and case around town, excited to stay up all night gaming while we chugged Bawls and listened to Rammstein while farming cow levels.

What it always amounted to, of course, was some fucker running 9374 updates because he hadn't powered up his PC since the bicentennial.  Then you spent half an hour looking for another power strip because Rob said there'd be 4 people gaming but another four showed up and you left your extras at home because fuck Rob. By the time you got going, the dudes there that weren't part of the "inner circle" complained about not playing games with anyone because they don't play DotA or D2 and there's too many people. Pizza arrives and distracts everyone for a moment, and finally as all the sugar and grease kicks in everyone becomes best friends and we all realize we can totally play some epic Red Alert 2 games with the whole crew.  About 1 AM this devolves into CounterStrike epeen flexing which carries on until, one by one, the fierce warriors succumb to the Bawls crashes and you stand alone, leeching as many movies as you can from Morpheus because your friend's internet is WAY fucking better than your dad will ever pay for.

Fuck I miss LAN parties. I remember when "3d Accelerators" first came out and us not knowing what the big deal was and why we would want a second card in out computer that we had to plug our video cards into. Until we saw our first 3d accelerated game...

The good ol days of 3dfx vs TNT. Not a single morbidly obese among 'em.  Lifting CRT's and mega Towers was geek crossfit. I loved Q2 Lan parties. Though it never failed spending 2 hours getting 1-2 people the updates and figuring out why they can't get into the game or something.  Great times though...Still some Q2 servers around if you check for em. When someone says "get out of your mom's basement and do something", this is the basement they're talking about.  a.k.a. where Basshunter filmed his 'DOTA' music video These guys are elite. 1337 Wasd not invented yet. Much cursor play Edit: im actually surprised seeing that in the pics, I was hugely in qwtf around this time and WASD was the norm. Maybe not as big a deal for casual q2 dm needing less keybinds but arrow keys were still kinda newbie even back then... Ya... That's me with the arrow key thing... WASD was cutting edge. Haha I fought against WASD for so damned long.  I'd spend hours rebinding important stuff to pgup pgdown, numpad, whatever i could reach just to avoid having to convert.

by the time mice with more than two buttons became common i had given in though. I remember the first time I converted to WASD was at a Q2 Lan party. Wads came about w duke nukem, and went mainstream w quake1.  Wads was the default q2 config.  Interestingly, I got accused of cheating because I "moved wierd " compared to other players.  They watched me play and realized I played with my strafe fingers on sx. And my jump/crouch on az .  This config was the duke nukem default. The one with the black monitor must have thought he was the shit. Lan parties. I remember.

There was always the one that nobody liked, who had to be invited because his dining room was bigger than everyone elses.

Inevitably his machine was not netbus patched, or his HDD happened to be setup with r/w network permissions for much fun.

Edit: Lan not Ian. Predictive text! &gt; Ian

??? ian? The memories.
I can still remember doing this about 15-16 years ago. But it was usually Action Quake II. So much fun.  Holy shit.  [This monitor](http://i.imgur.com/XrnS88L.jpg) is from an Acer Aspire -- first computer I ever owned.  Drug that thing around to a lot of LAN parties. Compaq Presario lol I attended a LAN party in Manhattan, in 1997.  It was at the offices of Pseudo.com.  I got badge #69, which pissed off the guy behind me during registration.

I brought my laptop, which ended up being a pretty good idea, considering the offices were at the top of 3 flights of stairs.  I still remember watching guys lug up huge monitors.  The party ran two days, with news-website luminaries taking part.  I'd circulate with that crowd for a few years after that, taking part in all manner of LAN parties, but that was probably the best.

I think the highlight of the party was when we caused the entire building to blackout from the strain on the ancient electrical infrastructure. Who was the bleeding edge gamer with the black CRT? The good old days. Where you played with your friends, instead of paying to get stomped by strangers.  and together we would watch videos [about how big LAN parties dealt with cheaters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbl4rQaAraQ), and together we would make leetspeak comments in actual real-life speech https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag1bXylX00 q2dm2 and q2dm8 .. still remember all of the routes.
 In 10 out of 10 Lans someone had to reinstall Windows! This is awesome but somehow you guys took 1998 and made it look like 1988. awesome :) by far my fave pc game of all time Miss those days!
I remember biking over to my cousin's house with my desktop in a backpack and the CRT over the handle bars.

 My God, have we really changed that much? Best years of my life. Now im 31 =( 97/98 through September 11th, 2001 was a magical time period. 

 Imagine all those guys running around looking for the bazooka ammo. When i was a kid, we called these guys "rich people". Dat wood paneling....mmmmmmm. Haha seriously! Is that a monitor being propped up by a VHS from Blockbuster? Holy blast from the past, Batman! Dat Z. Cavaricci. Baller LAN party Reminds me of my old local PC Bang, People chain smoking and playing CS 1.5 till 4 in the morning.  CS wasn't even a thing yet when this photo was taken...or if it was it was like Beta 1 or something. 1.1 - 1.3 had bunny hopping right. Shit took skillz Some say the heat generated from all those monitors advanced global warming by half a century. Oh I feel sorry for the kids today who won't get to experience stuff like this. I was lucky enough to be burn just at the end of LAN parties so I got to experience some of it before it was all over.  Why sorry?  I'm sure your kids will like VRMMORPGs better.  *[cue SAO theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP5Jm9eWrhw)* LAN parties still happen, it's just that it's unusual for the game servers to be hosted on the LAN anymore (unless it's a game like Civ 5, which isn't a very good party game anyway). Front Page?! Whaaaaaattt?!!! For all those like me who miss the LAN parties, this one is for you. Love Ya, game on my friends. /r/quakecon  gogogo Man, Quake II was SO amazing. So many memories of Mplayer, Heat.net, and Gamespy 3D. Ah, the nostalgia is surreal. Holy fuck, Heat.net. I fucking loved be some 10Six. I listened to that CD so much I thought it was going to melt. I wish I still had my shirt. There was a period where they had special clan games and you could win prizes. The clan I was in was fortunate enough to participate and we won a t-shirt and dog tags; I wish I still had them! Good old game spy. Winamp for tunes It really whips the llama's ass! quakelive! come back to us my friend. It's close! But I was always one of the few that thought Q3 &lt; Q2. I miss those rails! Dude, /r/quake on.  Good times...For me it was the original Diablo, Starcraft, and Red Alert...I miss the glory days of RTS. Don't forget Warcraft II! Ah yes...So much time wasted clicking on sheep until they exploded... Age of empires. :) UT99!! Bauldurs gate..myth of might and magic..even total anahilation and civ was so so fun Angry birds :-) That poor ping pong table straining under the weight of all those ray spewing CRTs. There is probably the ghostly image of that party burnt into the wood panelling.  I hate that this isn't a thing anymore.  I have been trying to play Far Cry 3 with my roommate for months and rather than just connecting through a LAN we have to use UPlay which just sucks.  I miss these times. I know, it's such a bummer. There was a level of camaraderie that came from sitting around a ping-pong table, drinking dew and or beer, and heading out for a diner at 5:00AM in the morning. Nowadays everyone just wants to stay home and game. Meh. White t-shirt tucked into Jorts?

Yes this is definitely a 90's lan party. Internet gaming has nothing on lan parties!  And never will. Nothing beats the atmosphere of a LAN party.

I hosted a 15 person LAN a few months ago and everyone had a blast.

Sadly most of them thought it was too much work to pack up their PCs or Laptops to play at someone else's place. 

Summer of 2003 my LAN group in Barnegat NJ hosted at least one a week. Sometimes two. 

People got lazy. There was *always* one guy with a bitchin' black monitor. Aw, yeah. Please, please, PLEASE accept my upvote.  I cannot upvote this hard enough!

Quake 1 and Quake 2 LAN parties are some of my fondest of fond memories.  I made many good friends and some good rivalries from going to some where I didn't know everyone there.

Best memories:

1.  Walking in with my gear, all the players seeing me holding a Logitech Trackman Marble (trackball) and snickering thinking I was going to be an easy kill.   Later on, after dominating most of them, people waiting in line to try gaming with the trackball to see if they liked it better (it's different...  more of a learning curve to get very good at it, but your wrist will never hurt from a 12 hour session).

2.  Meeting some of the people for the first time and when one person asked what my alias was his reaction:  "Ron Jomero?!  I hate you!!!  I HATE YOU!!!!"  But not seriously.  He had met me and my rocket launcher several times on a local CTF server previously.

Good times.  

I've done a few LAN parties since then, mostly TF2.  It's very hard to get people to show up, especially at my age.  The best we can hope for is creating a "game night" and everyone playing at home but using my Mumble server.

There's just something special about being in the same room with people though, and seeing their reaction when you get a really crazy kill on them.  :-) Jon romero? Muddafaka got a ferrari Heh.  Yeah, "Ron Jomero" was definitely a play off of his name.  This was before Daikatana.  Before the dark times.

There was a time when I saw a story (on planetquake I think) that said John used the name "Ron Jomero."  Which concerned me, as I didn't want to actually try to trick people into thinking I was him.

So I mailed him, wondering if I'd get a response back.  I did.  He only used "Romero" and gave me his blessing to use the name that I had been. Hehe. Thats actually pretty cool. You werent just trolling. Heh.  Nah.  I was pretty nice.  I preferred to help newbie players rather than "pwn them hard."  If I could teach a player to get better so I could have a challenge in the future, then I was set.  I'd also be the first to switch teams if I was at the top of the charts and my team was dominating too hard (and many times some players would follow me over... so I'd switch back and forth until I ditched them).

I was only an asshole to the other assholes.  The types of players who thought they were top shit and loved to smack talk and tear down the others.  I'd single those guys out and continue to give them a handy beating (while only saying "=]" after every kill to infuriate them further).  They'd eventually ragequit and leave us back to having a good time.

I remember one time after I sort of retired from online quaking, where I came back and my skills had atrophied a bit.  Two guys on the opposing team were very good and beating me extremely hard.  They kept saying in chat "That's Ron Jomero!  He's awesome!" or "Ron Jomero is so good!"

I thought they were mocking me, because they certainly had the skills I didn't quite possess anymore.  

It turned out, those two guys were some of the newbies I took aside and showed them some ropes to help their game.  They weren't being sarcastic at all. In their minds, I was still that player who helped them out.  It completely turned my emotions from pissed to proud.  I was happy to be a part of their "training" and that they didn't turn out to be assholes. Dude, I used to trackball all the time. It's actually really easy. I enjoy it.  I wouldn't say learning to master very tight circle-strafing was easy (compared to a mouser) but it certainly was fun and rewarding. Does anyone remember the Voodoo graphics cards that came out during the time of Quake 2? Here's a funny commercial to go with the funny pictures. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o66twmBEMs0 What's funny is that video cards are now used to do what was mentioned in the video. Yep, had a VooDoo II in our 1st family computer. Made Need For Speed III Hot Pursuit look amazing. Those jorts are the sickest. The word 'jort' is far dorkier than actual jean shorts. :P Spoken like a true jort fanatic! I *did* wear them well into the 21st century... I'm not proud. Getting the feels. Reminds me of me and my friends 15 years ago.  We actually use this technique at work, although the other side of the window is also indoors.  To get workstations that are approved for our cleanroom is very expensive, so we just get cleanroom approved wireless mice and keyboards and just put the computer in another room facing through a window. This has to be the best comment in the thread. What a cost efficient method to get shit done. I can't think of any reason not to do it this way.  some clean rooms don't have a window to use in the right spot. In which case you have to determine if it is cheaper to create a window in the right spot, or pay for the computers to be in the clean room. That would definitely end up coming down to how much it costs to add a computer to the clean room, how many computers are needed, and how much it costs to add the window. By the way /u/cmiller1 described it, it can be quite expensive to add a computer to the clean room. Of course the clean room would probably need some sort of inspection after adding the window, which could make that process more expensive. 

I don't know. I guess you got me you classy gorilla, you. Ha ha. Yes I suppose putting in a window might work if you can find the space behind the new window for a ledge or whatever. Not sure about how it might shut down production though while the carpentry is going on. 


I have sold quite a few hazardous location motors and holy balls, sometimes 2x more expensive then their 'regular' counterpart.  Hazardous location holy balls? Sounds like an anime. Only gorilla could understand him. and the cost of maintaining those systems, as if they are removed to be fixed etc. you would need to re-certify them clean. Wouldn't it be cheaper to just put the computer in a clean room approved glass box? Or use projectors. I'm from London... Don't know if that even matters... What da hell is a cleanroom? You mean literally? Or some kinda no dirty language room... I digress It is a room that is free of dust and contaminants. There are different levels of clean rooms, depending on what is being done in them. Some are just meant to keep dust out during production of electrical components. Some are meant to be air tight and keep anything at all from contaminating the room or getting out of the room, such as bio labs for extinction level viruses.

Ninja edit: I doubt dirty language is kept out of clean rooms, which I guess could be potentially dangerous. There are even less critical uses of clean room. I worked in a QA facility for a game company that had several clean rooms. One was a room where most all of what they did was performance test games on different hardware. This was a physically clean room, free of contaminants.

There was also a clean room that was disconnected from the facility network completely. This was so we could play online matches with the real world (to test components like stat tracking, etc.) Without risking the security of the company intranet. And the Russians just use pencils! I understand the reference! Upvote!  Did not know what a cleanroom is

Cleanroom  
A cleanroom is a manufacturing environment that has a low level of environmental pollutants such as dust, airborne microbes, aerosol particles and chemical vapors. More accurately, a cleanroom has a controlled level of contamination that is specified by the number of particles per meter-cubed and by maximum particle size. Yea you want to see an anal retentive engineer at their most extreme?  Visit an *electronic* clean room.  That's a situation where one stray particle can ruin a couple grand worth of product. The only place where not buying the extra pricey dandruff shampoo may actually cost you the job of your dreams like the commercials claim.

note: before anyone pours molten lead up my peehole, I know those situations call for advanced, tactical hairnets; I'm just being a drunk asshole I bought a car today and I've never rspent so much fucking money in my life Jesus Christ WHAT DID I DO?! Congratulations, you're now in (more) debt. Ironically, clean rooms are used in manufacturing said laptop's hardware. Isn't it ironic? Don'tcha think? Yeah, that stuff can be pretty serious. In a lot of Pharma companies one needs to be tested for how much they "shed." And by that I mean if someone scratches themselves how much dead skin comes off. If one "sheds" too much than they can't get clearance for a clean room.  I remember when I visited a clean room in my university (used for nano technology research), a person who was showing me the pace at one point (outside of the clean room) showed me an open computer and told me that it has been there for 10 years and was finally replaced. It looked like it was brand new :-)  Similar stuff is done with lights/junction boxes/other electrical stuff that otherwise be required to be listed as "explosion-proof" in paint rooms, battery storage rooms or whatever.  Shit is expensive so they mount it behind glass that can diffuse the light. I don't understand. Why is the neccisary? Clean rooms have extremely strict policies on anything that can move or attract dust. Computers and monitors (being basically giant dust magnets with fans in them) are pretty much the antithesis of clean room work.

Even the tiniest amount of dust can ruin an entire ~~silicone~~ silicon wafer. This and the airflow from the fans can disrupt the airflow in the cleanroom. Fanless PC.  I actually saw a video where a guy built a computer in a pseudo fish tank then filled it completely with mineral oil. Pretty neat

E: [This is it](http://www.pugetsystems.com/submerged.php). The exact opposite of fanless but still pretty cool He could put robot fish in the tank and robot turtles that dive under oil. Most of the PC I used in cleanrooms were usual PC with fans. That said, I mainly worked in research so regulations were less strict... Silicon* wafer, silicone is a polymer.  Mmmmm, wafers equipment in cleanrooms/labs/hazardous locations have to be certified for their use. This bumps the price tag up for an already expensive item about 2x over. Say you needed 5 computers, they already cost 2k each, and now they need to be certified, they cost 3.5-4k. Pretty damn big jump in expenses when the company is already trying to run leaner.


If you got a window and can set up a ledge, they found a good way around this price tag and saved their company thousands of dollars. It's a clean room so everything that goes in must be approved for such an environment. Since computers are so expensive to approve for clean room use they put it in another room where they can still see it, meaning they just have to approve the mouse and keyboard.  That's bizarre, what class clean room is it? We have a class 10,000 that that has laptops, as well as touch-screen desktops with wired mice and plastic-covered keyboards, and we are by no means a large organization. Class 1000 with special sterilization requirements for medical products.

Edit: To add to this, the specific requirement that makes computers difficult for us is in building products approved for biocompatibility (implantable) most of the equipment has to be autoclavable, that is, batch sterilized with high pressure steam. Is that more or less strict a class?  More strict.  The classifications are based on the maximum number of particles above half a micrometer in size per cubic foot allowed in the air.  A class 10000 cleanroom can have no more than 10000 particles per cubic foot, a class 1000 can have no more than 1000, etc.  There are a few more requirements associated with these classifications, especially when you get into the lower classes, but that's the basic idea. &gt; To give perspective, the ambient air outside in a typical urban environment contains 35,000,000 particles per cubic meter in the size range 0.5 m and larger in diameter

[Cleanroom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanroom) I indignantly refuse to compare per cubic foot number to per cubic meter one or to do necessary calculations. something about this photo screams "being a student in turkey" its dota2, he is russian Playing with his server-filters set on west Europe and English speaking servers only.. This is the reason I stopped playing Dota 2. I can't believe they keep coming back after all the hate they get. I guess even russians don't want to play with russians. It's a routing issue, the 'russian' server is located in stockholm so most russian speaking people actually have better ping to EU west.

Also, Russians are actually quite nice, if you look past the cyrillic language barrier. In Dota2 the chat wheel fixes some of these problems. On average, I'd say you have to work a little harder for Russian friendships but once you get over that barrier they're extremely generous and friendly.  So would you say you can't rush-in to these friendships, because Russians balk-in certain situations? It takes them a while before they come to the conclusion that ural right. That one was Risky.  Have an upvote for effort. And loyal Well Played!  Anyone wonder why? Shit like this is what happens if you try to build a local presence in bandit Russia:

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/12/business/global/12ikea.html?pagewanted=all We can counter throw in the nike case were german inventors lost their patent thanks to a court held in a US town mostly employed by nike. I sometimes get matched with 4 Russians, even though I selected "English" as a language I still realize that I'm the "foreigner" in that situation. So I just shout stuff like "DAVAI SVEN"(I learned that "davai" means "go"), they seem to appreciate stuff like that and it really helps with the team spirit. Oh hey it's almost like they're actual people  Well Played!  Same here.  I queued only on US/English servers and it fucking sucked when Brazilians or Russians joined.  It's not a jingoistic thing, it's about the reality of the game.  DotA2 is, first and foremost, a **team game**.  If you can't communicate with your teammates, you're done.  If you're getting repeatedly shut down, you've ruined the game for your four teammates and arguably for your 5 opponents.  Unless you're a really fucking dope player, and I mean like head and shoulders above the other 9 players, you will ruin the game playing on your own and ignoring everyone else, and if you are that elite, you aren't solo queuing on pubs.

Not to mention that milliseconds matter.  If you're playing from Vladivostok against a team on the US east coast, it's going to be noticeable. from what ive hard and my small experience with it the russian server is actually a decent place if you can speak a little russian/use chat wheel shame a lot of russians can't get connections to it.  Well Played! [deleted] Wherever olive people wear sweaters.  Exactly what it is. Am student in Turkey. Can confirm. This guy looks like exactly a guy from my department.Yes, i live in Turkey. Shit, I studied abroad in Istanbul for a semester and this looks exactly like a Turkish dorm room. Actually, I don't see a pack of cigarettes, so only *nearly* Turkish.  The window is what gives it away for me. The drapes and the beard? the jar, the couch, street lights, the building across, the windows... an overall "it's good enough until I graduate and million times better than the dorms" vibe. Can confirm, he looks Turkish.

EDIT: Can actually confirm. He's Turkish.

His brother posted this:
http://i.imgur.com/esY2gaj.jpg Apartment looks Turkish  He does look pretty Turkish. I found a strange bug with my work laptop while doing an outdoor installation in Wrigley, NT recently. Apparently if the temp of the computer drops below -10C the computer will think it has overheated and shut down.  [deleted] maybe its something with the battery, it gets cold, can no longer provide the appropriate voltage due to extreme temperature, shuts down.  Maybe a heat pipe freezing. The heat pipes in laptops are just solid copper, no?  No

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Laptop_CPU_Heat_Pipe_Cross_Section.jpg TIL, thanks! That could be what was going on then. -10C really isn't that cold so I was surprised it stopped working.  Reminds me of when I played SOCOM: Fireteam Bravo 2 back in the PSP days in ~2007. Our clan leader's PSP would overheat for some reason, so he'd be like "one sec everyone", go to his kitchen, and hold it in his freezer for a while during matches.  I do that for my GS4 mini while playing clash of clans. 

It's really uncomfortable  &lt;*_*&gt; My gs3 always overheats when playing any games. I decided to buy a tablet eventually so I wouldn't kill my phone. Wait, really? With an S3?

I had an LG Optimus G (LG's flagship before they released the more prominent LG G 2) which was older than the S3 and it could play games without any problems. Well, it did get hot but it never overheated. I'm just a bit surprised. My Xperia Z1 got very hot playing PixelGun so I ran it under cold water to cool it off (being a waterproof phone I thought I was being smart getting the most our of this feature)

Everything worked fine for ~15 minutes but the rapid change in temp caused condensation inside and I almost bricked it. Few days in rice and a blowdryer periodically got it back to normal, but a bit ironic that water vapour almost killed my waterproof phone :-) For future reference a blowdryer will fry your phone's electronics What? I can't imagine how psp can overheat. I don't remember even getting warm during playing. The fat 1st generation ones would get very toasty, especially around the WiFi antenna.  Getting external monitor would be good idea. he doesnt have the money for a new laptop or even a fan; I dont think he's got the funds for a new monitor either.   I don't know, you can get some pretty ghetto monitors on the cheap.


 depends on what country you're talking about, and how much disposable income this guy has.  
Its easy to find a cheap monitor *for some people in some places*; but the majority of people on the planet cant afford to buy a monitor just for gaming  
  
Think about the *relative* cost for people in poorer countries - they dont have the same access to 'discount electronic', because *any* electronics are a luxury item Photo is from Turkey, monitors are fucking expensive here. Average wage is much less than the US, but monitors are roughly double the price. thank you.  
*(it's weird trying to explain to people that other countries are different from theirs.  I assumed people already knew info like this, but I guess that's where I'm being dumb lol)* In fact I'll go a bit more into detail.

[Median household income in the USA: $30,932.  
Median household income in Turkey: $7,958.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_household_income)

Some select monitors I've been looking into:

* ASUS VG248QE:

    [In the US: $279.99](http://www.amazon.com/VG248QE-24-inch-LED-lit-Monitor-response/dp/B00B2HH7G0)  
   [ In Turkey: $520.53 (1.208 TRY)](http://www.vatanbilgisayar.com/asus-24-vg248qe-genis-ekran-led-monitor.html)
* Philips 242G5DJEB:

    [In the US: $278.99](http://www.amazon.com/Philips-242G5DJEB-Extreme-Performance-Professional/dp/B00G6IWEE0)  
    [In Turkey: $467.96 (1.086 TRY)](http://www.vatanbilgisayar.com/philips-24-242g5djeb00-genis-ekran-monitor.html)

**Edit:** Yes, these are relatively expensive 144 Hz monitors, but it's the same with shittier monitors.
              My laptop has this problem. It turns out it doesn't turn the fan up when the laptop gets hot and instead just throttles the CPU. I had to download a program that let me manually turn the fan up to max and that solved the problem what program did you use? have the same problem and this would be really helpful Depends on what board you have.

[Speedfan](http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php) is fantastic, but it can be a little confusing if you've never used it.  [Here](http://www.silentpcreview.com/SpeedFan)'s a great guide to configure it. Msi afterburner also works. You can also use it to overclock or underclock your hardware to meet your current needs. I use it to underclock my Gpu and max my fan whenever I'm in a hot room and don't want to overheat.  God, this explains my teammates in Dota jajaja puta mrda CTM  This is the guy feeding in my pubs.  If it looks stupid but it works then it isn't stupid. It's cool and that's all that really matters.  The humidity.. [I just do this](http://imgur.com/a/LGPxK) I have the same laptop, it really does overheat too easily even when it's relatively new. Most HP laptops are badly designed on the inside, too many layers also, dust is likely to just stay in And then someone runs past and steals it in the middle of your raid.  Could be worse, could be the robber plays better and now the raid kicked you out to replace you with the robber. Dear god I hope that happens to someone Open up your laptop and clean the god damn fan. Have you ever done this on many different laptops? Most don't allow easy access to the fan, you have to disassemble the whole fucking thing just to clean the damn fan. 

Extremely relevant video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpCJzdWxEbQ Then there are two screws leftover no matter how careful you are. This happened after I did a little auto repair on my car, my mindset was "What are the chances that one missing screw kills my car."

It's been a few months and I'm still waiting, one day it will catch up with me, I'm certain. This same exact shit happened to me! I think it's been around 4-5 months and it's still doing good. We should see who's dies first :P It took me years of practice, but now I can take apart and put back together a laptop with no missing screws. liar yeah after you ran out of screws to lose and still have it work, ffs That just means you are more efficient than the engineers that designed it! Awesome video! For my ~~IBM~~ Lenovo Thinkpad it's surprisingly easy. You still have to remove the kb, though. Oh man I love my Thinkpad! T410 made by Lenovo, but it's still the best damn laptop I've ever owned. I originally had a T410 and I got it to break 100C before it turned off from over heating. The T410, while a great computer, had a design flaw where thermal paste from the processor would get into the fan and keep the fan from turning. We students would tap the underside of the laptop while booting so the fan would unstick. Now I have T430 and love it Oops, meant to write Lenovo, ty for reminding me! Thinkpads are awesome, but I don't like the sucky keyboards on the newest ones. No purple enter, weird layout... what's become of one of the staples of the Thinkpad line? Yeah the chiclet style keyboards on the newer models suck, and I can't believe they removed the Trackpoint buttons on the X1 Carbon! But apparently they've "fixed" that part for the newer revision of the X1, so that's something at least. +1
Thinkpad is super easy to clean. My ASUS Rog is the easiest.  Bought it two years ago and it is still awesome.

Take the bottom panel off, and the fans and fan filters are right there.  And due to its fan structure (fucking huge), it can stay cool even doing full HD at 60fps in elite dangerous on my lap, without cooking my genitals.  Also handles my Occulus like a champ without sounding like a hair dryer like other laptops I have found.

I will probably get another one in another 2 years though when 4K VR becomes a thing. I'm impressed that it's not awful, and surprisingly good work. But what the fuck man? What is your wtf directed at? That was really really impressive.  I was all ready to laugh at him and say, "he clearly just doesn't know how to remove the keyboard to get at the fan."

Then he removed the keyboard along with everything else. Holy crap.  I have an HP also. That is literally how you have to do it. I had to download the service tech manual and follow a 14pg tutorial to get at the fan. You have to follow the Screw Identification Guide really carefully too because there are a lot of screws of same diam and threading, but different lengths (by like 1mm) and if you put them in the wrong places you're fucked at the end. This needs to be posted on /r/techsupportgore  I "USED" to do this for clients (when I was starting out). I would always send them pictures of their entire laptop laid out on my work bench. "I forgot how it all goes back together."  
  
I'd get a chuckle sometimes, but occasionally people thought I was serious... That's hilarious! I remember seeing a picture somewhere, probably on Reddit, of a tech that assembled a Macbook's screen backwards. I wish I could find it. Everytime I open a laptop, I am surprised to see how clean they are inside. Just tiny traces of dust, far from what you get inside any desktop computer. That guy throws me right off. His voice says "I'm British", his iTunes says "I'm in the US", and his Twitter says "I live in Spain". compressed air wins. Canned air! Knock knock open up the door it's real with the non stop pump pump and stainless steel. Go hard getting busy with it  But I got such a good heart, I'll make a motha fucka wonder if he did it.   Damn right, and I'll do it again.  Cause i am right so i gots to win BREAK BREAD WIT DA ENEMY.  But no matter how many cats I break bread with
 I'll break who you sending me Laptops can just have terrible ventilation and cooling in general. My laptop was overheating to the point it would reach thermal shutdown when gaming sometimes, so I though it must be dusty as fuck. Opened it up to clean stuff and it was still pretty spotless. But the bits that get super hot (aka everything under where I would rest my left palm) have absolutely no air holes near them so the fan probably can't do much there. A cooling pad helps a bit but there's only so much it can do. Try reapplying thermal paste to it. My Lenovo ThinkPad T520 was thermal throttling so hard (115 degrees C during light gaming) but after applying some arctic silver 5 to the CPU and GPU it idles at about 40 degrees C and the hottest it gets is 88 degrees C or so under full load.  No need to open the laptop. Just use compressed air and blow it in one side of the air vent. All of the dust will come flying out.

If you keep the pressure low, you don't have to worry about breaking the fan.

Source: Former computer repair tech. Have done this on hundreds of laptops. Never once broke a fan. As someone who used to service Dell, Lenovo, HP, and Mac laptops. 1/3 of overheat issues were a dirty fan, 1/3 was reseating or replacing the heatsink, and the final 1/3 were a mix of BIOS errors that we had to wait for patching... Or shared heatsink with another device that needed a BIOS patch.  

Except Dell Latitudes... those motherfuckers normal state is overheating.. When it is not overheating is when you need to be worried. I did this and it broke my laptop. Shit's fragile. My first laptop was so cheap it was a steal. Nothing seemed wrong with it, so we took it on our way. Turns out it had heat issues. We cleaned out the fan and it has worked like new ever since. Idiot probably thought he was scamming us into buying a broken laptop. I used to use a wet towel, frozen in a plastic bag to keep my thinkpad cool during Diablo II marathons.  Two in fact; I would swap them every couple hours.
 [And this is what his heatsink looks like](https://augustapcrepair.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/img_0517.jpg) Starts watching porn. Forgets volume is on high.  LOL i've done this before with an xbox 360.  

I was at my sisters place during winter and I really wanted to play my xbox 360, but it kept overheating.  So what me and my other friend did was take the TV in her living room, go to her balcony door (we were on the 2nd floor of an apartment), put a chair outside, put a box (on its side) outside to avoid the xbox from getting snow on it, as it was snowing, put a towel over the front of the box and put a rock on top of it.  

All this and we also used some extension cables to get it to work correctly without being a fire hazard.  We ended up being able to play GTA 4 all night without a hitch, where the system would normally overheat after 5 minutes of gameplay in a 70 degrees Fahrenheit room.  

I honestly wouldn't think that others have done similar things xD  He just needs to open the laptop case and clean the dust off the fans and heat sync AND STAY OUT UNTIL YOU'VE LEARNED YOUR LESSON I used to use the frozen magazines technique on my old gaming laptop. I would always have frozen magazines in the freezer and I would just put my laptop on top of 1 of the magazines while I played. Easy, effective, and cheap. If it looks stupid and it works, than it's not stupid. Because buying a cooling pad is too mainstream Ahhh yes, I remember once thinking that a cooling pad would bring new life to my oldass highschool pornhub infested laptop. Pornhub is clean. Don't blame your bullshit on Pornhub.

Edit:Thanks /u/katie_pornhub  I'm sure your're right CurlingPornAddict, but the hot and willing ladies in my neighborhood might tell you otherwise! He's right. PornHub is a clean website. Ads are not viruses.  This is actually a bad idea imo. The humidity from outside can damage the laptop. depends on your climate... Humidity is probably really low if it's freezing outside. Florida checking in, can not confirm Can I just say, fuck Florida? I'm in the panhandle and this is ridiculous. 30 degrees in October, 70 in December, and now it's 30 again.  It's not just Florida, that's the entire south.   Fuck I wish it was 30 again. &gt; This is actually a bad idea imo. The humidity from outside can damage the laptop.

I've left my laptop in the refrigerator for an entire hour once. The condensation didn't kill it. Once I took it out, it ran so fast! 
 &gt; I've left my laptop in the refrigerator for an entire hour once. 

I want the story behind this.  Not him but I sleep walked mine into the fridge once. Woke up freaking out thinking someone stole my laptop. 2 hours looking and panicking, I give up and go to grab eggs for breakfast, there's my laptop under the eggs. I have done this too. multiple times even. My laptop overheats really badly to where it will turn itself off. Fridge cools it down faster.  Shhhh....Let him learn by himself young padawan. So that he may tell his children, and his children, their children. It's more humid inside than outside. When my wife had an overheating problem with her laptop. We put a cookie rack under the PC. Worked well because it allowed airflow under the laptop. Reminds me of my roommate putting his laptop in the freezer for 5-10 minutes every few turns of Civilization. Or clean the fan port and slightly elevate it for air flow.   This is why I don't recommend laptop gaming. No one in their right mind would recommend laptop gaming. There are no upsides in gaming on a laptop, only downsides. THIS IS THAT GUY THAT ALWAYS DC'S IN LOADING SCREEN.  I'm certain there's a "how to install *windows*" or "playing on *windows*" joke there somewhere. Or better yet... "yo I heard you like windows so we put windows on your windows". Clean that shit out, my laptop overheated all the time because of dust op who is "this guy". its OK op if its you. He also moved to Canada so he can do this year-round I remember before I built my PC and used to have to game on my iMac, it would get SO hot and overheat when playing Battlefield 3. I'd have two fans on it to play.  I'm pretty sure that is the universal sign that you need a new laptop.  I did something similar, but it wasn't gaming related. I had a 7 inch EeePC I used as a primary machine for a while because I had been travelling for some months. Had a nice Linux install I put on it, used Fluxbox as a window manager to save screen space (800x480 laptop screen and all that).

When I finally settled back down in San Francisco again, I still used it as a primary machine for quite a while, only plugged into a full monitor. I was mooching my neighbors wifi, and quickly discovered if I hung it out the window by the VGA cord it got much better reception. So that's just how I rolled for a few months. When i was super into diablo 2 in college i used this huge fan on my computer to keep it cool enough to not overheat and shut off.  Or you could just fix the fucking thing :-/ This is a cool idea.  May his frame rates be high and his temperature be low. /r/shittybattlestations I... I want to call this man an idiot... but I can't help but think he might be the smartest one of all of us... Then Eagle out of nowhere...... Is his name niko? I know a guy on skype who used to stick his computer out his window The guy is the definition the struggle. Man he is gonna be so pissed when it crashes and he's playing mid with QoP! One word: condensation. If your laptop is over a year old and overheating like this, then [this is why](http://www.aaronspcsupport.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/heatsink_before_and_after.jpg) grab a screw driver, open that thing up and pull that furball out of there. I know this may seem obvious to someone who's been all up in those things, but that would be located right by where the vent blows out, yes? it's located inside the laptop unfortunately. there are intake vents, and outlets, but the fur collects in-between, in the fins of the mini radiator and the fans inside your laptop. I've pulled solid squares of fur out of &gt;4 year old laptops like the lint filter in your dryer. you often need to disassemble the laptop, and sometimes remove/re-seat the heatsync to clean them out. there's video tutorials on youtube for doing this. I meant inside, by the vents. :) I'll look on YouTube.. I've got a laptop that's 3-4 years old and has a problem with overheating. Thanks for the info! This explains so much about my teammates in DOTA 2. Theyre probably all using this method. He needs to clean the fans asap  what if it rains  Umbrella That's... just.. fucking brilliant. cyka My old room mate dealt with this problem in a [similar fashion](http://i.imgur.com/oIclp1u.jpg). He also tried to [cool his desktop in the fridge](http://imgur.com/a/XVyJo) and when that failed, he resorted to opening all the windows and cooling our house to 13C. Only to pick Pudge and leave after 0-5 mid. Great until it rains Hana. I kid you not I had a similar problem with my laptop. So I as a young 15 year old back in the day grabbed a bag of ice and placed my laptop on it so I could plays the Sims. Problem solved and somehow it never overheated again even with out the ice . Haha a pair of floating eyes and white teeth in the distant...


And his laptop is gone I guess I went down the casual route and just have mine propped up strategically on various crap from my desk That's how you get condensation inside of your pc. Not really. If it is running while inside and is placed outside, there will be no condensation as colder air contains less moisture and does not condense on warm objects.. The moist warm air already inside it will be blown out of it before it has a chance to lose its moisture content. It is only when it would be brought back inside that you would see condensation as the now colder laptop makes contact with the warm moist air inside. what a "cool" idea! next level troubleshooting skills right here. That's some mothers love there. Right after this scene you get to watch her get her legs crushed. Not if you are a good child and know how to spell her name. When I learned that you could save her I felt so bad... :( Your comment, today, is how I learned this. I have played through this game 6 times. Only 6??? How many times did you play it before you found out you could save her?

Seven? A bunch and then my copy on SNES wouldn't always take the code grrrr Save who? It's been a long time since I have played this, but, I remember all the characters Lucca's mom.  Remember her legs are paralyzed when you first meet her in the present? Lara Screw feeling bad! You miss dat Green Dream accessory, that's the real tragedy. Likewise, I let Cid die in FFVI :( I let Shadow die and Cid.  Never saved Cid on any of my playthroughs. A little wonky in later versions. :P How does the phone version deal with LARA? You get an upvote just for having the user name frozen_esper. I'll take it!


...wait... You're just trying to get a +2 magic power /level bonus from me, aren't you? This part was so awkward in the Japanese version. Kept doing L-A-R-A, but in Japanese it was spelled , which can be transcribed as Lara, Rara, Lala, or Rala. Turns out "LALA" was the answer and they changed it to match the translation of the name when they brought it to English. RIP japanese Lucca's mum. Nobody could save you. Considering I played it on SNES with shuffled keys I had to keep reloading and just go on gut instinct. Only later did I realize that was actually a name. I knew her name.  I played through that game four times and the only reason I ever got it right was that I played via an emulator with save states the fourth time. Unreal! CHrono Trigger is one of, if not my favourite game ever made. If I saw this in real life I'd probably squeal. 
 I'm not afraid to admit as a 33 year old man that I broke down a little bit. It's something I will absolutely treasure forever.   I am pretty sure I've played this game on every platform. I can't get enough of it. Same here!  its not even mine and I broke down a little bit after seeing this. Holy shit dude.. This game impacted my life is so many ways playing it at a young age.  As another 33 year old, I feel the same.  This game was undoubtedly my first love.  So much that I am trying to plan out costumes from it for the next Dragon Con.

Also, hail Magus. Magus? Whatever. Praise Lavos. Cross-stitching is an incredibly time consuming hobby. I cross-stitch simpler patterns that I haven't finished. I commend your mother. She must have the patience and persistence of a saint. I'm playing it through for my first time (on my phone during lunch breaks). Totally diggin' it, so far. I envy you. There are so many games I wish I could play again for the first time.  god, if only I could play CT/FF6/FFT for the first time again... I know the feeling. I got my gf to start playing Final Fantasy 7, and I wish I could go back and re-live it with her. Replaying those great games brings forth a lot of nostalgia for me, though. Just revisited and beat Illusion of Gaia, and it was a whirlwind of memories.

Edit : wording You lucky fuck. I played it fourteen years ago and it's still stuck with me. Not many games have been able to do that since. Make sure you're using headphones. The music is a big part of what makes the game so great. I squealed seeing it here  Here's the pattern for anyone interested:

http://www.spritestitch.com/forum/download/file.php?id=13462 Sweeeet. Thank you! As a 31 year old man, I'm going to try and convince my mother to make one for me too. Did she (or you) use some software to convert a screen shot to the pattern? As a 31 year old man, you could probably teach yourself .-. Can confirm.  Am 30-year old man.  Just decided to teach myself. Suggestions for beginner resources? I hear moms are pretty good at teaching this sort of thing [**Here**](http://www.dmc-usa.com/Education/Technique-Overviews/Cross-Stitch.aspx) is a good place to start. DMC is the most widely available brand for floss (thread), their website has some beginners tutorials. You should come and check out /r/CrossStitch too :) breaking away from the pattern but -- 18-year old kid. just *gave up* on teaching myself (and i'm out of school + jobless (until recently)). it gets tedious, man, but don't give up easy like i did! The actual process of cross-stitching is really, really easy. It's the effort of actually doing each stitch that's the hard part. I just found it on this cross stitch forum. I'm not sure if it is still active, but I'm sure there are resources online to get patterns from screen shots.

Even when heroes are gone, we have [their words of wisdom.](http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=343) VG Cats! I wish there were more updates. I believe I read a while back that the artist is an obsessive perfectionist so she/he only releases content they are perfectly satisfied with. Marle here. I can tell he absolutely LOVED it with all his heart, but still no words. I'm starting to worry...  He talks in 1 ending  LARA XABY That game gets points for trying to incorporate the names of the buttons into its puzzles, back when they had fuck all else to work with. Like the XABY thing, and... well I think that's it actually [deleted] DO A BARRAL ROLL! BAXY, AXBY? Stupid Playstation fucking with the buttons [just saw this and just brought so many good memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HllRJW6_R-o) Best video game music ever in my mind. There's a channel called verdegrand and he does a phenomenal rendition of zohar's corridors of time [This one gets me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtKCt8Afk9s) I clicked this link and 45 minutes of my life disappeared Smooth McGroove!

[This is a little different but I really liked it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4DjC0BdKt4) Thank you for posting this.  The Kingdom of Zeal was always my favorite time/place in Chrono Trigger. So much video to watch with only 7% battery left. Saving this for later. Thanks! This soundtrack is in my regular play mix on my phone [Here's one of my favorites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1pgSY48mgE) from a very excellent and talented piano player.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsd5mJzKyuc For me, it's this rendition of the battle with Magus that brings back the memories:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6zSuZPEGoo This game continues to be my favorite after 20 years since it's release. Mine too. I still replay it around once a year! I just picked this game up for DS! I am really excited to check it out!


Would you recommend this game to someone who has little RPG experience? Absolutely. It's very intuitive and a blast to play! Oh wow.  That's gorgeous.  Please x post to /r/CrossStitch they would love to see this.  Done!  :) I'd also recommend /r/ChronoTrigger. That is one of the most remarkable scenes in the game.  The talk about the Entity, Lucca's memories.  Damn. Agreed. Before this, the only games I played were based off of tv and movies, so I didn't know much about a video game story. 

One day, mom asks me what game to get for my birthday. I had no idea, so we found a game at Walmart for 70 bucks. I figured I'd have to be the best as it was the most expensive on the rack. Mom finally agreed and thus, I got to play my first deep and emotional video game.  After that, it was FF2, FF3, SMRPG, etc I really, really like this. That game brings back really great memories.

I played it while being away from home for quite sometime, and there's nothing like playing a game for a few hours with headphones and completely forgetting where you're at. Where are you Squaresoft?  Please come back... That's great! Your mom is awesome. Yeh, she's the best. I cross stitch, and I can say with a high level of certainty that your mother loves you a lot. If you have sibling, I'm pretty sure you are the favorite. I just started...after finishing a 500 stitch project, reading 53000 gave me anxiety Your mom is a keeper.

Oh wai... That's super awesome.  Recently got all 13 endings (DS version) and started chrono cross. So far I'm satisfied even though chrono trigger blew my mind. I really love Chrono Cross too, but Trigger has a special place in my heart. Cross is a really great game. There is a bit of a plot dump on disc 2, so make sure you read everything (there will be one part with quite a bit of reading). If you can get over that, the story itself is on par with Trigger. Cross is so underrated. I feel like not many people that played Trigger actually ended up playing Cross and it got a back seat to some other amazing games. Cross is a masterpiece. But its story is veeery complex (pay attention, seach and read everything!) and waaay darker and edgier than trigger. (Cross is where you deal with the consequences of time travelling of crono and his friends, kinda...) I like how Frog apparently sleeps on his chest, with his ass sticking in the air.  I was a bit confused which subreddit this came from, I'm subscribed to /r/chronotrigger /r/crosstitch and /r/gaming Holy smokes That's amazing.  This scene brought back some feels Wait, did your mother stitch the scene right before Lucca goes back in time to watch her own mother get destroyed by the thresher machine? Unless you catch on how to input the code and save the mom, otherwise then yes ... the mother gets mangled after you helplessly watch the mother slowly approach the machine over the sound of creepy music accompanied by the text of the mom's pleas and screams for help.

I wonder if this stitching is secretly some diabolically passive aggressive way to tell her kid not to forget about her and to come visit her more often. It's an interesting choice to be sure.

I always remember the scene as her getting mangled because the first time I played I didn't know what was gonna happen and I didn't find the code... You mean the scene right before you allowed Lucca's mother to get destroyed, you monster? lol ;) Great... Now I have to make this for my husband. 

It is amazing though! Up-motherfucking-vote! I loved that game so, growing up My god. I am jealous. Love it! So did you just realize your mom was amazing or did you always know? I always knew. I'm lucky that my parents are both amazing people! Simply amazing! This is awesome. Yeah right, like OP actually has a mom [Immediately searched this song when I nostalgia'd all over my new jeans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUWK7stOkeE) LOVE THIS. I remember calling a company (Shopify) last year and this was the music that would play when you would wait for an agent. Absolutely amazing. I'd buy stocks! Marry that woman My dad beat me to it. He's a lucky man. I'll just have to settle with being her son. It's not so bad! Your mom is an amazing person that you should cherish forever.

Wake up strifeprime.

Wake up strifeprime. As much as I love my mom....that deserves  a mom of the year award right there... Magnificent. BEST GAME EVER  A future family heirloom. Wow. That's fantastic actually. WANT I love this!*  If/when I have children, I hope to be a cool mom too and make cute stuff for my children! I'll give ya 50 bucks for it LOL no no, he meant 50 bucks PER DAY. Your mom really loves you.

Now go tell her its gay. Hearing this paired with Royksopp's new album gave me the most chills I've ever had from looking at a picture of a game that I haven't thought hard or listened to the music for in ages.  That gift shall endure longer than a Moonstone in the Sun Keep. Holy shit I should really finish this game. SO JEALOUS This truly warmed my heart. What a beautiful, meaningful gift. Your mom must be a wonderful person.  Your mom did an awesome job.   Better be a good son.  
 I am SO damn jealous. That's amazing. Give your mom a hug from a random dude on the Internet. 

Better go start my yearly playthrough!  This is probably the coolest thing I have ever seen!!!! Your mom rocks! This is a masterpiece that I have to have That is awesome. I do lots of needle craft! Do you know if your mom charted it herself, did she use a program, or did she find the pattern you linked That's amazing. Love it! That's love. I played Chrono Trigger before I was paid to do it. 

"Sometimes to go backwards, first you have to go forward"
 your mother fucking rules. That is pretty pimp, Crono Trigger is a great game Magus FTW!!! You realize you can never put her in a home now right?  

Make sure you have a tidy guestroom... I bet in a few years (or now) We could do this with a 3D printer! Yeah... but it's the meaning/value behind this. If his mom died next year (pray she doesn't), he'd have this valuable piece of his mom.. forever. Thanks for putting the game in the title! I wish more did that. That is so fucking impressive.. Wow, I just beat this on a re-play about an hour ago haha One of the best games ever made.  What's the size? I want your mom. 

Wait, that came out completely wrong. 
... to be my mom! 

There. Fixed it.  That is a remarkable work of art! Marle looks like she's dancing. That's got to be some kind of modern day Silmaril there. That is absolutely beautiful. Great needle work. She really loves you, to put in that much time and effort. Op, I hope you treasure your mother forever. Beautiful. Tell her to make a bunch more CT iconic moments and sell them to us please :) ...but you're still hungry. I am more envious than words can explain. Beautiful, mate. Holy fuck that's awesome I mean.  I love my mom and all; and I know she loves me.  But DAAAAAAMMMMNNNN The Green Dream That is seriously badass.  I see a lot of Link/Zelda and Mario stuff like this, but nothing I would really WANT want.  THAT though... do want. I love this!! Wonderful stuff :] your mom is a pretty swood dude Feels. Your moms awesome. Wow, your mom really likes Chrono Trigger! That is amazing! This is amazing! I might actually attempt this in my spare time. 

How long did it take your mother? Any chance of some closeups?  This is amazing! My mom is actually in the process herself of cross stitching me the light world map from A Link To The Past! Here's an in progress shot from a while ago. Will probably update the next time I can get an updated picture. http://imgur.com/WdTQQHc Tell your mom it's amazing! I would pay many FRN  to your mom for one of those. Chrono Trigger is my favorite video game of all time. So good! Best Mom ever award goes to her! This has to be one of the most awesome things I've seen in a while
 holy fuck this is well done I do a lot of cross stitch and quilting. When my son was about 6 he asked why I never made anything for him. I told him to pick out any cross stitch pattern he wanted and I would make it for him. He picked out the most difficult one I had, a castle with a dragon wrapping a wing around the back and his tail wrapped around the front, about 14X18. I made it, then I made 6 little animals that matched stories the dad would make up on the spot and tell them before bed. I then took those cross stitched items and made a quilt for him. He picked out the fabric too. It's a work of art, and at 27 years old, he still has it and cares for it. That is one of the most iconic video  game scenes in my book. fantastic work! Fuck me. Can I borrow your mom... for like... a year?

I love that its this scene. The best scene possible. I assume you had to have picked it? No way your mom randomly picked the scene related to someones love for their mother.

But seriously, shit that is amazing. I'm really jealous. Op don't take this the wrong but your mother is a total badass. So sweet I've only played through Chrono Trigger once and I love this work of art. It's awesome Best mom ever Two things that are awesome in this world: CT and moms. Brings back such memories... This is right before Lucca goes back and saves her Mother, right in the feels man... awww that's so sweet and so well done  Holy schit, if that wasn't your mum, I would say marry that lady Can someone say what is happening at this moment in the game ? I'm currently trying to go as long as possible without playing CT so I can play it again and *kinda* not remember it.  the tears are real You had better love her with every fiber of you body OP, because she sure as hell loves you. When I was a kid in a small town, I would make my parents rent Chrono Trigger for SNES from the local gas station/video rental store(!?!?) every other week. I've played it as an adult several times as well, most recently on iPad.  The game, like that cross-stitch, is a work of art. You're mom is awesome! This was one of the coolest side missions! You leave Robo behind to replant the forest in a barren desert and then you come back thousands of years later to find Robo completely decrepit but a massive forest in place of the desert. Plus the trippy time sequence after that... I think I'll play through this game for the 30th time now I've played through Chrono Trigger more than any other game ever. I don't know why, but I just can't get enough.  Your mom is fucking awesome. Your mom loves you OP.  I would like to have this as a poster or something like that. Does anyone know of a place where you can have images made into prints? Give her a hug and tell her you love her. NOW Downloading an SNES emulator right now! I haven't played this game in at least 10 years. so old it turned yellow Omfg I love this so much and miss that game SO BAD Give your mom a hug. EVERYDAY. What a beautiful labor of love. 

Make sure you mom knows that a creepy hawaiian respects her and is in awe of her love for ya.

 And thats shes awesome.

right on.  I missed this scene the first couple of times I played through it.
 This is genuinely one of the neatest things I've seen on here. Extremely cool! Kudos to your mom. She was a snitch.

Snitches get cross-stitches. So much work.. that's an up-vote. Ps. possibly still the best game ever made. yes. Yes. YES!! Robo, Ayla and Chrono. The only party choice as far as I'm concerned. caution! oil has washed over my sight sensors. sight diminished... [Next play-through starting now...](http://i.imgur.com/U4zKHqg.jpg?3) Your mom is a G You beter fucking hug the shit out of her.  I did! I always do. I would run back into my burning house for this. If there ever is a fire, this is the only thing I will grab before escaping! Fuck. Your mom is awesome.  So cross-stitching is basically old-school pixel art. holy fuck your mother is good.  Poor drowning little sister... Yeah, but, the ADAM! (   ) ( o  o) http://imgur.com/JvMxrB4 TOO FAR! http://i.imgur.com/0dB3Vhe.jpg Ahh, I miss back when ctl alt del was funny It got a lot less funny when Tim got outed as a pedophile and all around jackass.  I knew he was a dick, but a pedo? Holy shit... Where can I read about that? I'm a bit busy and can't dig it up, but it's around. [It's mentioned here on Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tim+Buckley) but he deleted an entire section of his forums to cover it up. 

What I remember from the scandal is that he used to talk to this girl, knowing she was underaged, and he sent her nudes and tried to solicit sex from her. She got creeped out and backed off, disappeared into obscurity. Years later when another scandal was going on with CAD she came out and told the communtiy about what happened. It was a big deal back in... what 2009? But it's ancient history now. 

Still a scumbag, still refuse to give his website any clicks.  Underage like 11 or underage like 17?  Some of you may downvote, but this is an important question. It changes the legality and frankly how disturbing the story is. Yeah labeling the guy as a pedophile seems a little extreme if it was a 17 year old Pedophiles are specifically attracted to pre-pubescent children, so not everyone who messes around with someone that is "legally" underage is necessarily a pedophile.  Still considered a sex crime in most cases though. Even if it was 16 or 15 it would still be extreme. 15 is starting to push it though.  According to Urban Dictionary she was 14. Thankfully Urban Dictionary is an accurate reliable source. It's the only source I've seen. Woah... Time to remove that comic from my favorites list. This is a ridiculous reason to stop watching/reading/listening to something. You think I stopped thrusting to Michael Jackson when he got outed as a potential beast? 

Fuck no.
 It's never been a funny comic, it's a comic about gamers that happens to be funny or some other miscarriage of an explanation.  &gt; miscarriage of an explanation.


Not sure if reference to comic. Yeah it was the explanation Buckley gave about why the miscarriage was appropriate and not at all insanely out of place.  Seems like it's branching out into different things besides just humor. Not too sure on the new space opera-style arc, but the one about game-themed superheroes was interesting Oh they moved away from humour a while ago. Made my balls itch.  I have a few little sister figurines still in packaging. How would I make it safe to put them in water that fish are in?  Find any kind of fish safe polyurethane sealant. They usually sell them at pet store for that very purpose. brush it all over one and let it dry. Wash it well after and it should be good to go. May want to glue a small weight to the bottom if they aren't a heavy plastic.  Basically you have to seal it Steal it? Seal club it? &gt; "fish safe" polyurethane sealer

 Sounds legit. Cheers  Any polyurethane would be safe after fully drying That's a good question, I was wondering if you'd have to worry about toxic paint or type of plastic. This is a really cool idea.  That and you don't really want the toys to corrode. Apparently to make them safe for fish you can use fish safe polyurethane sealant. Not sure about preventing mold. * preventing algae.  Assuming you mean algae (you won't get mold in a fishtank) - thats really more a matter of keeping your tank parameters in check. If you let your nitrate levels get too high, you'll have algae. Generally, you can keep it at bay by putting natural, fast-growing plants in your tank to eat up the excess nitrates, having a good water change schedule, avoiding overfeeding and overstocking your tank, and not leaving the tank lights on for too long each day or having a light too strong for the plants in your aquarium.  &gt; you won't get mold in a fishtank

Not technically true, you can get a fungal infection, and those do suck. yea, but that isnt going to be visible on decor. I thought they were basically immortal Would you kindly tell me where you got the big daddy and little sister figurine? eBay  I want one SO BAD but they're trending at over $100. :( Regular non LED bouncers sell from around 50-70 bucks.  and LED one can cost anywhere from 60-120.  Just have to keep checking daily.  Thats what ive been doing and ive managed toget a rosie for around 60.  Just waiting to get an LED bouncer for around $80 and my collection will pretty  much be complete.  Also check craiglist.  They usually pop up every couple of weeks for like 45ish.  Honestly i wouldn't pay more than 100 for any of em.   I have the Big Sister/Little Sister NECA set unopened. It was a free bonus with Bioshock 2 at Toys R Us. Can't believe it's also trending for that much. Shouldn't it be Rosie that's outside? &gt; Would you kindly

I see what you did there What did they do??

Edit: Not trolling, thanks for the answers.  Without spoiling anything for the first Bioshock, "would you kindly" ends up being an important phrase. Not sure if you're just kidding but it's a main line from the game. I can't say much more without giving away spoilers. Well.... Guess I'm going to go play through bioshock again. Lol, I'm replaying them right now, that's where I got the idea.  I stopped playing the first one after 20 minutes because it was 2spooky4me, should I continue it and trudge through? Yes. Honestly one of the best storylines of any game, ever. The creepiness factor declines as the game goes on too. Just make sure you save all the little sisters. Harvesting them is where it gets really fucked up I don't know if it declines so much as you just get used to it as you progress through the game. There were still parts that made me jump even on the second play through but that's part of the charm of playing survival horror anyway :) There's less (lights turn off) jump scares as you progress........but more dead body jump scares.  First time I played it I quit soon too. At first in the game you're helpless and a single splicer is enough to waste you. As you progress you upgrade into a splicer slaughter machine and the fun comes from choosing what weapon and plasmid you want to waste your enemies with. As someone who is not a fan of horror games/movies I sacked up and played through Bioshock and do not regret it all all. It's on my top 10 games for sure. Yes, the spookiness is kind of the same throughout the game so it gets less spooky as you become familiar with the environment. You get used to the sounds of splicers around the corner, and it stops being scary.

And if you don't play through, you're missing out on what is (IMO) the best video game series ever made. The entire series is so damn beautiful. Yes, yes, yes! I was just as spooked as well, but that's what makes the game amazing. Chilling atmosphere, best story of all time. Fort Frolic is my favorite level of any game. Just brace yourself for when you get the shotgun.  After that, you'll be fine.  And save your electric buck for Big Daddy encounters! Definitely. I hate scary games/movies and there were a few times I thought I was gonna keep going but it's worth it. Really incredible game. I still haven't completed the first game, but I do know I've had feelings playing through the first hour of BioShock that I haven't had in any game since then. Such amazing design and subtle storytelling. One day, when I find the time, I'll finish it. So yes, I would definitely recommend you trudge through. Yea its great even tho its also 2spooky4me, but later on i cant go further becuz i dont know where to go D: I stopped once because of that.  Use the arrows.  Well worth the journey.  Still my favorite game (even beating out Last of Us). I know this feel. Started and stopped playing the game after an hour on two separate occasions. So happy I continued and finished it on my third try. So glad I did as it turned out to be in my top 5 games of all time. Try to play in the day with bright lights if it helps, that's what I did. ^^^^I ^^^^am ^^^^a ^^^^pussy, ^^^^don't ^^^^judge ^^^^me. Little Sister needs some kind of underwater breathing apparatus! She's drowning! I am playing then right now for the first time.  Played burial at sea 1 and thoguht i should play the first  Did you play Infinite first?  Yep, that was my misstake  I played all the way through infinite and I'd only put an hour or so into the first when I borrowed it. I'm pretty sure I need to go back and play the first.  The first one has the best story. The second has the best gameplay, but a less original story. The third has the best characters (and still a great story), but the weakest gameplay IMO I think I might be the only one who liked Infinite the best. The ending, the subplots, secret messages and, being a big fan of 60s, 70s and 80s rock, I was enamored with the folksy renditions of classic songs hidden in the game. Also the scene where you first see Columbia and monument tower was breathtaking. Not to discredit the first two games, however. Those are both masterpieces in their own right. I like Infinite more than 1 and 2 too.

Atmosphere, color, impressions was just perfect. Hallelujah scene still can give me goosebumps just by memory of it, one of my favourite scenes overall in gaming. Gameplay wasnt the best, but I liked it, especially on highest difficulty, except damn Lady part. And sky-lines was great to play with.

Plot and characters was great too, especially if you are sensitive person and\or can "grow into" protagonist(not sure about right words here, english is not my first language).

And "God only knows" cover was really nice. Exactly how I see it, the storyline and atmosphere were second to none with the first one. The gameplay in Bioshock 2 was better imo however due to playing as a big daddy and being such a boss, you sort of lost the sense of vulnerability that made the first one so tense, and the storyline wasn't as compelling. Lost the sense of vulnerability? I disagree. The enemies were much tougher in 2, I thought they balanced your increased strength and the enemies' strength pretty well. Those big sisters were *tough*. And they learned a lot of improved the fighting mechanics a lot. Since they were pretty similar mechanics, 2's fighting basically felt like 1's but better. Definitely beat the first before playing BAS. Just played them all for the first time and I'd have been very confused/disappointed if I hadn't played 1 first. So next a bird cage in Colombia right? ^(please I want to see this) Holy crap that would be great.  When growing up, my friend had a floor-to-ceiling bird cage.  I can only imagine what amazing BS-Inf things you could put in there for the birds to play on! Lots of cool things to get completely covered in bird poop Great tank, but please make sure those plastics are safe to be in the tank with the fish. Most normal plastics/paint give off chemicals that make the fish sick. Yep, I sealed everything with a "fish safe" polyurethane sealer.   Can I use that stuff to seal my genitals and prevent unwanted pregnancy?  Try it and get back to us I bathe in it. I am totally fish-safe. What if you eat the fish?  Maybe you should drink some of that.

Just in case. http://img.pandawhale.com/post-30842-Well-Were-waiting-gif-Caddysha-Vc4C.gif Probably but it might block you up.  only if you're a fish I wouldn't worry too much as your dna is incompatible with marine dna for the combination and reproduction. Fish fucker.  Make sure to leave a little hole to pee through and you'll be fine FYI some people pee and cum out of the same hole. TIL some people have a cloaca Or a penis.  Do I even want to know? Brave souls are the ones who dont need answers told to them, they find out on their own! I imagine if you drink enough of it you wont need to worry about unwanted pregnancies. [What you want is some Vasalgel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance) It's OK everyone, OP used a sealer. Where'd you get that bioshock figurine? I'm not OP but this is a bit within my wheelhouse: the figure is made by NECA (as is the Little Sister) and goooooooood luck getting one these days for under $60. They are long out of production and very sought after. I finally obtained one after quite a lot of waiting because the eBay listings are few and far between, but it's still possible to acquire one for the very diligent. I got mine when I bought it, left over from pre-orders. I remember it being quality stuff, can't remember what exactly it was made from but it was heavy and reminded me of cast iron.  Nice! Where do you get something like that? Why no gif with swimming fish?! Post to /r/aquariums This makes me wanna make a Fallout fish tank... With the bomber at the bottom of Lake Mead? And lakelurks swimming about?

I need a fish tank. You better deliver.. Pick-ups only. I don't deliver. All you have to do is not clean it I've had this same thought many times... imagine using glofish in a fallout tank :D [Glofish for the lazy]( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/SA9PEBPnhWU/maxresdefault.jpg)  So you took the Malaysian Airlines plane! Shhhhh. I appreciated the ship/"fire". I love the main display, looks incredible!  Zing! Pretty cool. Did you get the inspiration [from the incredibly similar Bioshock fish tank made by Super-Fan Builds?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEZtnKv8oL0) It looks almost identical... something fishy is going on here  THAT is BEAUTIFUL..! Thanks! How could you pass up an excellent pun opportunity like that? A man chooses, a slave obeys, and a fish glubs.  Not only do I love your creativity, but I absolutely admire you giving the betta that much space. I've owned Betta's before and its absolutely disgusting when people REALLY think they can fit them in unfiltered vase-size tank's. Thanks for the share :) That was my first thought as well. What a lucky fish! [Your plane crashed into the ocean their is not much you can recall so come stay with us in rapture  UNDER THE SEA!  UNDER THE SEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQYUXFLY728)
 Just a "little" one. You make it sound like such a modest feat! I couldn't craft that if I tried. Ha, I meant as in it's only a "little" ten gallon tank.  Glad to see that you think a 10 gallon is a small tank. It always makes me upset when I see people over stock their child's 5-10 gallon (we won't mention any smaller than that) because they think they have a huge tank. 

On a side note, are you planning on any other fish or you just going to let Mr. Betta live it up solo style? What are the things in the second image? It's killing me. Adam slugs. They're harvested from the ocean floor and put inside the little sisters (the things you pull out when you harvest them). Adam slugs from Bioshock 2.  Pretty cool, and props for giving a Betta a proper sized tank! Good work man, I really like it.  I don't see a heater, though - betta splendens do best at 78-80 - room temp can make them lethargic and ill.

Also consider some time of taller decoration or possibly a plastic betta leaf, hidden off to the side.  Male bettas get lazy and don't like hauling all their finnage up to the surface to breathe.  They will happily lay on a tall plant or similar decoration. Will do!  While you do need a heater, I am so glad to see a betta in a proper tank. It being Bioshock just makes it insanely more awesome. I've seen a couple tanks with the figures, but the extra pieces and your slugs really put it over the top! My only suggestion would be to get an Amazon Sword plant or two. Not only will it give a place for your betta to rest, but it'll look like the plants in Bioshock too.

I guess I'll have to do a bioshock tank next - right now my bettas are EDI and Captain America. Now you just need the fish. There's a Betta in pic 1. This is incredible. I want to has so bad.  http://i.imgur.com/IeRQA6a.gif%20imageanchor= I see that you are just betta testing it right now.  When will it be finished? Excellent - post this to /r/aquariums (but be sure to cite their non-toxicity)

edit - yup, Reddit again shows that I have no original thought :D The BioShock series is my absolute favorite! Now I'm about to go through and replay them! Thank you!  Now make a Bioshock Infinite bird cage. /r/bettafish and /r/aquarium might really love this  That's incredibly cool...I'd buy that fishtank and I don't even have fish. Shut up and take my money. Amazing. Mr. Bubbles! I love this! That is AMAZING! That is awesome thats awesome as fuck The background on the last picture fits soooo well! I may just have to steal your idea. Actually, a good idea would be to take the city of Columbia background and make it the background of a bird cage! Great stuff! I want one of those Did you make everything in this tank,  including the backdrop? That's fucking amazing, good on you for making that man. Long live the aquariums subreddit!  Just me that was really hoping for a curve ball and have it be bioshock infinite with alot of dead fish out of water This is neat  Bad. Ass. Alright alright alright I have never played the game but have seen the cover and this tank is still impressive and fucking awesome, congrats  Gorgeous ! Even has the city-scape. Now i want a Bioshock tank. What an amazing job, OP!!!

Next project - Rapture. How safe is all that paint for your fish? That is one lucky Beta fish. Usually owners do not give them that kind of "luxury". I bet that is a VERY happy little betta all alone in that great big tank!  Good job, OP. Would you kindly add more pictures? This is amazing. Awesome. Where did you get the big daddy from? Always wanted a figure. Now I'm trying to think up creative ways to use all those collector's edition special figures that I have amassed and are now gathering dust Such a cool idea!! this is the single MOST FUCKIN COOL FISH TANK I EVER SAW AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA man if u ever think of selling it contact me! Good to see a betta in a nice big tank! Awesome! He is truly Mr. bubbles now.
 SOOOO. FREAKING. COOOOOOL! That is wonderful! You went above and beyond here. The colors turned out so striking. Not one part of me wants to own fish because (my subjective opinion) I think they're pointless... Until now. Now I want fish! I want you to know I saved this. And I'm jealous. And proud of you, among a slew of other emotions I don't want to discuss.  Wow, incredible!!
Love the top! Wow!!!!! So kool!!!! Nice tank for a beta fish. I'm sure he appreciates it over a bowl.   Love it, nicely done! "Little"
You sir/madam are amazingly talented Damn that's awesome.  A miniature Rapture.  Very well done! Good job man. I want this badly.  pretty sure i watched a tv segment with an fx crew that built this setup https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEZtnKv8oL0

Theirs is obviously way better lol. 
 Yours has this nice murky look to it though like in the artwork, and it looks more fish friendly. that just took me on a rabbit hole so deep.... that is awesome! and makes perfect sense. good on you. i may steal the idea.
 Thanks! The background is an image I got off google and went to Staples and had it printed and laminated. I made the lighthouse of of balsa wood. The plane parts are off of a model plane I got at a hobby shop. The fire is actually miniature autumn foliage trees used for tabletop gaming scenery, found those at the hobby shop too. Suitcases are dollhouse luggage of ebay. I made the slugs out of clay and paint. Big daddy and Little sister off Ebay.  I've never gone to staples for printing.  Do you just print it on regular paper and have them scan it or can you show them a direct link to print it from online?  I'd assume the latter would have better quality.
 I bring a disk with the file on it and tell the person exactly what I want.  Wow for some reason I didn't even think of that lol.  Makes the most sense to just being a usb or something. i always wondered, do different colored lights affect the fish an a certain way? I was thinking if that were a black-light, wouldnt that damage the fish?   No gods or kings.

Only fish.  I wish I could upvote more than once! 10/10- Would Swim again How long that take you build? Not to long, couple days plus waiting for stuff to ship.  That's the coolest thing! Anybody else do a double-take and see a Squeez-It cap in \#3? This is amazing!!!  All Nintendo games.

Nick Derington can be rearranged into Nintendo (with a few letters leftover).

Coincidence?

Probably. The leftover letters are ckrig... What can we do with that?

ckrig, ck rig, gr ick... grick. A Grick is a monster in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a four-armed serpent-like creature with tentacles and a beak. Beaks... Birds have beaks. Birds can also fly. Flying... is what you do when you get in an airplane. Airplanes were the primary weapon used on 9/11 to take down the World Trade Center. WTC was in New York, where the Statue of Liberty is. The Statue of Liberty was made in France, a country that invented the croissant, a type of pastry. Pastries are typically eaten with a hot drink like coffee, which is made from beans. Beans contain high amounts of iron and protein, the former of which being a chemical element whose material has been used throughout the ages to forge weapons. Weapons are products of war. And war... War never changes.

I haven't been able to play either series (just didn't game much when they came out and haven't had time since), and I mistook Fallout for Half Life.  I was like "ah shit did three actually come out?" Haha, jokes on you, Half-Life 3 has no official plans announced yet! ... :( &gt; "ah shit did three actually come out?"

It was *okay.*

FTFY Half Life 3? MY NAMES....NOT.....GRIIICCCCKKKKK Ocarina of Time 3 confirmed. Can I purchase this anywhere? http://store.nakatomiinc.com/search.aspx?find=BOSS+FIGHT

EDIT: I would have bought one myself, but I'm a purist and Link wasn't right handed against Ganon in that form until the Wii years (when it was deemed that most people are right-handed and thus - with the Wiimote sword controls - Link should be too, as to not confuse players.)  This is an illustration of Link against Ganon from the original NES, and he was left handed.

...And also, for the record, I now feel like Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons for being so anal-retentive.  These illustrations are still epic and awesome. Beat me to it, but yep its for sale. Spare me the downvotes for my ignorance.  But I see Mario, Link, but who is the third? 1. Marios Brother vs Godzila  
2. Zelda vs Pig Man  
3. Mertroid vs Big Brainbug Um, excuse me? It's Godzilla in that photo. Not to mention you also spelled Pac man wrong. Jeez *Gojira* No! It looks like gojira, but due to international copyright laws, it is not.  Toxic Garbage Island. YouTube search for metal band My friends uncle is gay and knows these guys personally, said they'd give me a free ticket if they ever came to my country. &gt; [Mertroid](http://i.imgur.com/cVeMcDl.png) I remember this classic Sega crossover. It's Metroid Echoes. Heavens to Mertroid! It's the fight against Mother Brain from Metroid. So Samus. You haven't played Super Metroid!!! That's like the best SNES game ever! It is the most perfect game known to man It's Samus Aran and Mother Brain, from either Metroid (for NES), or Super Metroid (for SNES).

Download "Super Metroid" from the WiiU Virtual Console store, you won't be disappointed. Easily one of the best video games ever made. How exactly is it legal to sell stuff like that with copyrighted material and trademarked characters? Fan art in Japan works differently from here, namely that it's copyrighted of sorts on its own right, that's why dojinshi (fan comics) exist.

But don't quote me on that. Why isn't the Mario picture red, the Zelda picture green, and Metroid picture blue? the color scheme is based off the bosses colors You know what I was gonna gree with u/bread_nbutter but if you think about it, the color matching the enemy makes the picture more serious and intimidating, if it were of the hero I'd just be like go mario. Oh my god you're right! I feel so intimidated!

 I might have a new fetish.  This is the second comment of yours I've seen on a front page post in a span of about 3 minutes. You had me wondering what the hell I had missed earlier today on Reddit.

So just a new novelty account?

Carry on. Im so startled!  This exactly. The hero does not have the home court advantage in any of these. The colors represent the utter power of each boss within its domain, and emphasizes the overwhelming odds against each protagonist. This isn't a "whoooo, go link" sort of thing, it's more of a "oh shit, the boss is tough." why isn't link lefty? Because Link is left handed for a majority of the games.  I think the first time he was officially right handed was in the Wii game since most people are right handed and they would be using the controller for the sword in that hand. Being a lefty, it made me so mad that they did not give you the option of playing with the controller on your left hand. One of the reasons that I love Link is because he is a lefty. I mean a lot of the Wii games gave you the option of choosing left or right, why not Twilight Princess???
 They actually flipped the entire game horizontally to make Link a righty, if I remember correctly. What was East in the Gamecube version is West on the Wii, and vice versa.  Yup, made finding secrets on the official strategy guide a pain to follow because I played the Wii version and the guide was written with all the unflipped gamecube maps. Still think that they should have given you an option. Overall fun game though! Because it's the original Legend of Zelda. When playing the game, you can't tell which hand Link is using. I just checked the original manuals online, because I was curious. Looks like link was pictured as both[ left handed](http://legendsoflocalization.com/media/the-legend-of-zelda/manuals/covers.jpg) and [right handed](http://legendsoflocalization.com/media/the-legend-of-zelda/manuals/screens.jpg) Ambidextrous. No, he switched depending on what direction you were facing due to sprite mirroring  Because the bosses are the opposite force to the hero.  The colors represent the bosses.  Personally I think it gives each picture an eerier look as appose to having used the regular colors. **Boss** Fight [Here you go.](http://i.imgur.com/7y8TgDO.jpg) If anyone wants specific dimensions, feel free to ask. It just looks so wrong now! Can anyone edit it back to green/blue/red again? It looks pretty tense now, like it's based on the setting instead, red lava, green fireballs, blue tech shit. now can you make Link left-handed like he's supposed to be? Anyway to up the contrast in the samus picture?  [Done.](http://i.imgur.com/joLHqnc.jpg) Now make just the villains their original color scheme and see if they pop out more [Nevermind i got this](http://imgur.com/wYpqDSw) Now take the original one and make the heroes their color.  Now make them kiss! Now make everything the villains color scheme and have the heroes have their own! OK but can you make it pop? If you have the time could you make this in 2880x1800 or 1440x900 ? and put it on my desktop, that would be great could you kick up the uh, 4d3d3d3 Now *Tayne* I can get into! Now I'm wondering how you did that. Photoshop -&gt; Image -&gt; Adjustment -&gt; Hue/Saturation adjustment layers == prostyle Why would Metroid be blue? Because red and green are taken Why does Metroid always get last picks? ;( Us Metroid fans are the red-headed stepchild of the nintendo family. Sad people don't wink! Unless they're completely fruit loops of course Or have suffered a stroke There's always yellow And magenta. Never forget magenta. Yellow is just red and green bro, gotta rep that B. Ha! You got downvoted because people don't understand the difference between additive primaries and subtractive primaries! Sucka! Gravity suit maybe? 

http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/metroid/images/0/0e/Gravity_Suit_Trophy.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101021050343 I think it highlights how the characters are out of their element. I have [this](http://imgur.com/BmlCeMd ). Can't remember the artist right now. But he has a cool simplistic style, and he got the color scheme right. You need to swap Mario &amp; Link so you have the R-G-B scheme right. Looks like it's Adam Sidwell aka theSKID. Article about this specific set [here](http://digitalart.io/minimal-boss-battle-artwork/). Artist's tumblr (looks like their only site) [here](http://theskid.tumblr.com/).

Edit: Shop is supposed to be [here](http://theskidshop.bigcartel.com/) but it's down right now. Why should they be? Switch it up! :) That was bothering me, too. Looks like someone just beat me to posting this fix, but [here's my edit.](http://i.imgur.com/zdiuRAJ.jpg) Used the highest resolution I could find and took some liberties with adjusting the colors, so they might not be 1:1 with what they were pre-edit. I think imgur might have compressed this a bit since it was HUGE 2 MB jpg, but if anyone wants that let me know and I can throw it on my DropBox. Nice, higher rez version, thanks! Liked the slightly muted colours you went with when adjusting those colours, like a bit less emerald green and a bit lower saturation on the green myself http://i.imgur.com/T4FTeJz.jpg.      Now I may need to use this image as a wallpaper. Because the Legend of Zelda [should be gold](http://i.imgur.com/ZCJAcOR.jpg). Bread and better, perfect match with my rough bread Why would Metroid be blue? Contrast is the best friend of all art.

Contrast, both in the art itself, and in the expectations of the viewer. Here's the highest resolution Google can find: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AcdsKMISmFU/VLOThJShwbI/AAAAAAABNGU/7qt-wBKZN5A/s1600/Nick-Derington-NES-Boss-Fight-Prints-Mario-Zelda-Metoroid.jpg Hello new background. Am I the only one that see's [Bebop Rocksteady and Krang?](http://www.moviesnet.nl/images/filmnieuws/2014/1413302857/krang1.png) That's actually really interesting... If only rockstead were a lizard. Still he has pointy shit on him so he gets a pass. Link isn't right handed. [This a good enough fix?](http://i.imgur.com/8NVcsJR.png) but now ganon is also left-handed. that's just as bad as nintendo flipping twilight princess for the wii and literally every single villain and character in the game was left-handed EXCEPT for Link (and the stalfos spirit who was a past Link). I like it! Thanks! "Save link As..." Except for the times where he is, i guess. He's right-handed in all of the Wii Zelda games, because of motion controls.

As a left-handed person, I felt betrayed. It was my time to shine. As if binders and notebooks aren't already a pain in the ass for us And scissors, and the electronic signing pads where the pens are always attached to the right side. and whiteboards, and sitting to the right of right handed people when eating, and can openers(probably) GAH! They just couldn't give us Link could they? And nuns.  With all their slappin my wrist.  I'M NOT A DEVIL CHILD, OKAY? and people not trusting you cause you're left handed?

Also we're gonna die sooner than right-handed people. Probably from all the pen and pencil smudges on our hands. And whenever you need to sign a receipt the person at the register always puts the pen closer to your right hand. Don't even get me started on fucking dry erase boards. On the bright side, he's back to a leftie in Hyrule Warriors! Isn't there an option to switch it? No, but the Gamecube version of Twilight Princess had Link as left-handed- the whole game was flipped horizontally for the Wii release. He can masturbate with either hand. Switch hitter good thing link is multiple people. all linked together  Yeah but in Zelda 1 he is left handed. You're right but : Skyward Sword  Also the Wii version of Twilight Princess.  Shoulda been Ridley for Metroid, but I guess he was **too big** to fit in the picture You're gonna die, motherfucker, I take up five screens. Well that's Kraid but I'll upvote a StarBomb lyric. I agree ridley is the more prominent boss, but these are all final bosses. tbh i just wanted to make the "too big" joke one last time :'( As someone who was in love with Metroid from the old NES days I really don't like Nintendo's more recent push to make Ridley the more famous boss.

Ridley is a henchman.  Ridley and Kraid are the two main lords of Zebes and work for Mother Brain.  They don't belong in any game that doesn't take place on Zebes or with Mother Brain.

The fact that I now have to kill Ridley in every-fucking-metroid is just insulting at this point. http://imgur.com/ZjFL9Sy Did a quick colour altered version just in case anyone else was curious what it might have looked like.


Edit: Higher rez, nicer version http://i.imgur.com/T4FTeJz.jpg tweaked version of the one by /u/phubans in this thread.
 The colors are the way they originally are because in each frame the focus point is the boss, not the hero. That's what I thought too. Like TSxClouds said, it makes the boss more intimidating.  It was nice to see it reflected in the opposite light though, even if just to abate my own curiosity. But yes I agree it works much better in its original colors RGB Those colors are much, much more appropriate given the theme of the game and the temperature of the room.

But that image is low res and has artifacts. [Enhance!](http://i.imgur.com/m50GBFE.jpg) This is really pleasing to look at. I like it a lot more than the original These are great. I'd love to see what this guy can do with some Dark Souls bosses. I love how the camera angles match their respective games. Bowser fight is viewed from the right, Ganon head on, Mother Brain from the left The placement of the green blue and red colors made me think it was pokemon related. That conditioning is real  Gorgeous! Thanks for sharing. The most iconic in history. Yea I like Lonk the best!  i love lonk. Meta meta meta.  10/10 Would hang. Who is the monster that zelda is fighting in the middle? You bastard. hyrule Anyone else think Gannon was flipping then off for a second?  Yep.  Super Metroid was the shiznit [For those interested in buying these prints.](http://store.nakatomiinc.com/search.aspx?find=BOSS+FIGHT) These are sick. so....which mass effect ending did you choose? Now I really want to fight the bosses. Don't want to play the game, just the last few minutes. Maybe they'll make NES Remix 3: Boss Rush next. Best koopa illustration ive ever seen. If you unfocus, it seems like Ganon is giving the camera the finger Lizards and pigs and brains, oh my! This reminds me of The Cornetto Trilogy. Otherwise known as Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and At World's End.  Can someone good with photoshop color swap Mario to red, link to green and Samus to gold/ochre? I love this piece but dislike the color choices. As a late-thirty-something man... god damn the feels.  That's a wonderful triptych. This graphic made me realize that a lot of video games are about overcoming an evil "boss". Maybe we all want to take down our bosses?  Its such a disappointment that Bowser is a playable character now. He used to be the bad of the bad, now he is just another character it seems. This picture illustrates how scary he actually his!
 You're like 20 years behind on the rage there, bud. Why the hell isn't this on a shirt already? Easily mistaken for bebop rocksteady and krang.  The way Link is standing really adds to the overwhelming task ahead of him. I forget that in most of these games he is just a boy set with the task to save the world. The immensity of this task is really highlighted in this picture. Some of the greatest video game art I've ever seen.  Amazing work. These remind me of old [TMNT covers.](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15317/346571-21094-126659-1-raphael-teenage-muta.jpg)  Looking at this just makes me remember how ridiculous Mario is when you think about it.

Link: Hero on a quest to assemble the sacred Triforce of Courage and defeat Ganon so that he can rescue Princess Zelda.

Samus Aran: Bounty Hunter on a mission to eradicate every metroid she can find. And destroy mother brain while she's at it.

Mario: A plumber who has to save Princess Peach from some kind of Dragon Turtle. Link is left handed Nintendark Souls Daaamn! I would love to have this hanging above my couch. God fucking damn it, Link is *left-handed*. Very cool! 
3/3 - have pwn3d each like a biatch. :)
Now I just need a self portrait of me with a controller in one hand, and thousands of tetrads cowering in fear, or fleeing altogether. Bear fight??? Pretty sweet This is beautiful thank you for sharing. Besides this being a wired article... Fuck it .. Upvote for coolness I really want to hang thins on my wall.  If Mario and link were switched it would match the same order as the Princess one that was posted. Having them both like that would be sweet. Is there a HD version to use as a wallpaper? Why isn't the Zelda green? WHY?! Cuss he's in the water temple...eh...duh what if they did like a dragon ball z fusion and made A spiky brain turtle pig. "Fu! Sion!

 That's like the intro to Bob's burgers where the store on the right always goes out of business. And the Subway in the plaza next door has outlasted them all..

$5 footlongs FTW! i wanna say it, its a martial arts place now. can't remember, but i do remember it constantly changing. might wanna post to mildlyinteresting I've been to this establishment a few times. 

Honestly, my experience has been rather poor with them.
A majority of their items are really over priced.  

Tried to buy a dreamcast memory card and their asking price was $20.  A ds lite charger? $15.  You see a ton of games in there. A lot of old retro stuff too. The problem is, a lot of their older stuff is way too over priced.  I recall wanting to purchase Star Fox 64.  They were asking $30 for just cartridge.  

If you think gamestop rips you off, don't ever trade your games to this establishment.
One time, I was browsing the store when a guy came in with a ton of old stuff in a rather big box.  The box contained a ton of classic games. Some even rare. Megaman x2, 3 and a few other megaman games.  Some old school memory cards and controllers.  Mario 64, banjo tooie, and a bunch of other crap.  The owners pretty much told him the most they could do was $20.  Mind you, this was a rather large box that contained a ton of games that would most likely sell for $100+ 

Pretty much one of the owners told the guy "Sorry, not a lot of good stuff in here..most we can do is $20 for all of this. Honestly, half this stuff might just end up getting thrown out"

Of course, the guy agreed. After he got paid, and left. The owner was bragging about the big purchase he got from the guy at a low price. 

Overall this place has a lot of nice things.  Old retro stuff and a ton of merchandise. If you have the money to spend on older games than by all means. Go for it.  If you are looking for a good price on old games? Just check ebay or amazon, even your local swap meets.  Don't trade your old games there either. Just sell em online.  

If I dislike the place why do I visit it often? Because they use to hold 'random game tournaments' It can be something like Plants vs zombies, or Mario kart.  

After they went all 'wannabe pro gaming" they went really down hill.  
It stopped being about having fun and became too competitive. It honestly scared a few of the regulars there.

tldr; place is overpriced. Terrible community, at least last time I went.  (Decemberish of last year.) Worse deals than gamestop for your trade ins. Thank you for this information. I see this way too often with these kinds of game stores. You go in and they have EVERYTHING! Shelves are packed full and everything. Then you start to look at the prices and you soon find out why. One in buena park ca was exactly like this. Every game was at least 2 times the prices you could get it for on eBay.  
  
  Edit:I would like to mention that I live pretty close to an amazing game store called eStarland who are very fair on their buying and selling price.  
  
  Edit 2:I also want to mention that very close to the game store I mentioned is another game store with fair prices that even sells amiibos and new retail games under their normal retail price It's because they don't sell in much volume. If they made $5 per game they'd be out of business, so instead they make $15 per game and stay in business slightly longer. Retro gaming isn't big enough in most markets for a dedicated store, especially considering they compete with eBay.

They need to stock at least half their store with new games and consoles and keep their prices about $5 less than GameStop, then expand their retro sales onto eBay, where people are actually looking for those items. Speaking of; what ever happened to Funcolands? They got subsumed into GameStop by way of Babbages/Barnes &amp; Noble, apparently. Not before I snagged a number of cheap NES and SNES favorites, though! Funco was the only place I could find Phantasy Star 4, and it cost almost a hundred bucks back then. I still love the shit out of that game, and if my Genesis worked (and I knew where it was) I would replay it more often. Instead I try to replay it and Shining Force 2 every so often with emulators. Check out the Genesis collections they have for PS1/PS3.  I have one that has all 4 Phantasy Star games, along with Sonic, Vectorman and such.  

Cost me about $20 new.   Hahah, nerrrrrrd! :D heyyy buddy Hey, it's just what WIKIPEDIA says, YA dingus. But it was in the same shopping center as my first job at that movie theater, you better believe I was spending my minimum wage on those games I used to rent but never owned.  LOL, FYI I was downvoted to hell for ribbing ya. :D Let's just have a conversation between friends on reddit for fun. How's it going? Haha, that's what you get for calling people harmless names! Not bad, though I'm running on zero sleep since the baby was up all night with a double ear infection. Gotta film some stuff for a training video soon...if their new system starts actually working. You? You know, saving the president and whatnot. Oh, so you are a bad enough dude after all. Good to know. And thanks, Alien Blue (or reddit), for taking 4 hours to send me that reply.  Maybe it's your phone.   Maybe, because I didn't see this until I intentionally looked in my "inbox" just now. I blame AT&amp;T throttling.  Haha you're throttled. Stop being a mobile pirate! How dare you? I haven't bittorrented anything over my mobile connection in years! Not since I got rid of the jailbreak on my old 3GS anyway. 

"With lightning fast LTE speeds you can fill your red Solo cup with this fire hose! What?! You have a second cup?! What a greedy little pig. Use this eye dropper instead for two weeks as punishment. UNLIMITED EYE DROPPERS, THOUGH!" It's reddit, actually. This one didn't shoe a red envelope for me until just now. I got this one pretty fast. Maybe it's getting better? Hey, you want a good dose of incoherent conspiracy?

http://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/2rf8kd/luke_skywalkers_got_a_dirty_secret/ Oh man... [the memories](http://imgur.com/a/5NXuE)... I loved Funcoland back in the day. Got so many rare (at the time, much more so as time went on) games from there in great shape. Lot of RPG releases I missed on PSX I picked up there. I remember my last purchases ever included Ogre Battle PSX and some other games. It wasn't a steal but was totally worth it. Gamestop bought them. When I was a kid and Funcoland was getting bought out, I was a regular enough customer and disappointed about the fall of Funcoland that the employees actually ripped down the sign and gave it to me. I forgot about this until just now. It's in my attic somewhere I think also that selling retro stuff should be secondary. Have gaming competitions. Have trading days that have a $5-10 entrance fee where people can come and look at other people's merch and trade with them. Have discussion groups about gaming (retro or current). Find ways to build up a community that isn't just reliant on buying old games. That's just my two cents.

edit: a word Even then it's tough to keep the doors open unless your in a good location. In NE Cleveland there used to be a TON of card/game shops. Now there's not nearly as many, even though the places were often packed. The only ones really still in business are typically comic shops first and game shops second. 

Although there's a games workshop store right around the corner from me that's been there for a few years now. Considering the way games workshop has gone in the past 5-ish years I'm surprised it's doing so well.   There's a similar shop in my city,  walls lined with games, I never see anyone inside. Last Christmas I bought Aladdin for the SNES because that was the one game she ever played in her childhood. I picked up what looked like their only copy for $20 and checked there again the next day for a controller. They had another copy of Aladdin up on the shelf for $40. Demand had risen 100% since the day before To be honest, in the UK I don't see any retro game shops, but I see retro/american sweet shops everywhere, selling all the stuff you can't get in other stores at stupid prices. It's got to be because they wouldn't be in business if they sold at reasonable prices, people will buy this stuff because they want them. If people are going to buy a tiny box of jelly beans that have Harry Potter on them for like 4 and they're still in business after a long time then they have a working business model. I know of a fair few retro game shops near where I live in the UK; not huge ones by any means and quite difficult to find if you dont know exactly what you're looking for, but they are there and the ones near me have been going for quite a while.

As for the US candy stores, all the ones I've seen seem to be flash in the pan shops that have a ton of people in there when they open but are then empty and gone a couple of months later. i like video game stores that have a small section for retro games.  I lived in a shithole little town in the middle of nowhere, an hour and a half to the closest thing that could be called a city. Two used game stores. One just sold, the other did tournaments and pay to play. 

I'd say if two of them can compete in that little buttfuck town and still have cheap as hell prices, there's not reason to count it as something niche that only stays in business under certain conditions.  &gt; You go in and they have EVERYTHING! Shelves are packed full and everything. Then you start to look at the prices and you soon find out why

Well, yes.  There's the old Soviet joke about the guy selling bread at twice the allowed price.  "So go buy it across the street at the allowed price." "BUT THEY ARE OUT OF STOCK!"
 Seems like 30 bucks for a popular n64 game is the norm.  I don't think the prices are too far out of line.

The local game store had one copy of Mario 64 behind the counter, it was discolored and the label was in bad shape and they still wanted 30 bucks for it.  Hell I paid that for it used in 1997 So a business that has to buy from somebody and then resell for a profit charges more then a person who is selling directly and has no over head? Is that legal? I'm calling shenanigans on capitalism! &gt;Every game was at least 2 times the prices you could get it for on eBay. 

Are you able to walk into an ebay store? No. Ebay is an internet auction site. Sellers have very little overhead. You're complaining about the business structure of a brick and mortar store solely on the basis of price. They're not doing anything unfair - if you don't want to pay, you can go on ebay. No one is forcing you to pay a price that you don't think is "fair," but you think they should have prices that match a different business structure, which is really just a poor attitude on your part.  I've been to many of these types of video game stores and I don't see this too often which is the point of mentioning a specific store. There is another store within 15 minutes from the one I mentioned with very fair prices. They even had amiibos and brand new retail games under the normal retail price You know the thing about prices? Every price is fair, because you don't have to buy it if you don't want to. It's fair for you to not want to spend over *x* amount of money on an item, but it is not fair for you to make a judgement on someone else's business based on an asking price for a given item. Just go somewhere else and keep your griping to yourself. They also are NEVER open to haggling either.  I remember trying to get a half way OK NES game I had as a kid to play and they wanted $23 for it.  They had 13 games on the shelf and I asked if they would take anything other than $23 for it.

The guy looked at me and said no, prices are what they are on the sticker.  I then told him I'd give them $12 for it since it was the current price on eBay and I wouldn't have to wait for shipping...... Nope!

I went all the way up to $20 and they wouldn't budge.  I wouldn't have paid the $20 but I told the guy thanks for the nice browsing shop.  It's cool to see all this old stuff in one location and soon online for sale when you go out of business.

edit:  When I say 13, I mean 13 of the same NES cartridge. 

edit 2 from the comments:  I do NOT consider these types of businesses Mom and Pop.  They are the equivalent of flea markets and NOT Mom and Pop stores.  Mom and Pop stores purchase items from vendors and then sell them at above the cost.  These types of businesses purchase items off customers and flip them for 1,000% profit. You think a niche retro new market is the same thing as a Mexican fruit stand you doofus? I haggle with the local gypsies at the market over their prices for pears all the time. Can't let those bozos try to get one over on you. How do I eat a pear? Do I just bite into it? Have to ask Rick Ross. He's calling people bozos now, it's like his new thing.  They aren't a franchise store where their prices are set in stone.  They are a niche store operated by someone who I assume likes gaming.  I can guarantee you that they didn't pay half of the $23 for all 13 of the same game on the shelf.

I looked around and everything was just over eBay prices.  Gamers are not always idiots, *cough MCC, Destiny cough* but we know better than to impulse buy something for 4x the price. Would you haggle over bread at a mom and pop shop because walmart has it $1 cheaper?

Unless it's their policy to price match then the price is the price. It's one thing to try and haggle over something you sell them, but otherwise they were in the right.

Edit: People need to calm down. I stand by my point. A store has the right to not accept your shitty offer just as much as you have the right to not accept their's for your stuff. Deal with it. We aren't talking about food here, these are luxury items that most of us can live without for a while, waiting for them to ship from an ebay seller. It's common practice to haggle in a place like this. The games don't have a standard price, they fluctuate and are dictated by what people are willing to pay for them.

These stores, unless terribly run, are paying less than eBay prices. If they can sell at eBay prices that would make them incredibly competitive but most put on some markup.

The owner of a store is free to reject haggling of course, but in places like this it's the price of doing business since they deal almost entirely in second-hand goods. If they were selling wonderbread for $3 mark up then I would probably say something Ma and Pa seem to be dick store owners. You cannot compare food items with video games.  Now, if you were talking about something non food that I do NOT have to have right this second, yes.... yes I would.

This is not a franchise store or anything near a mom and pop store.  They don't have vendors come in and dictate prices on items.  They buy their items from people selling them and then flip them for insanely high prices hoping some sucker will come in and impulse by the item for that high price.

They are doing what my hobby is and that's buying and flipping items only they have a store and overhead expenses.  Since they have these extra expenses, you would think they would find a little above break even point to where the items would sell.  If I can get the item for $13 off eBay, price it at $15.  

Someone will buy it not to mess with the shipping and the item will sell.  I will not pay $10 more than what I can get it off eBay for. If bread was marked up 100%, yes, I would haggle for bread. Oh a store has a right to refuse selling for less but it was not a smart business decision. A 10% discount could have meant a return customer for them.  eStarland!  I didn't know that was still around. Unless there's another one that isn't in VA I don't know about. [Probably nothing, but let us see... oh! A handwritten script for Star Wars by George Lucas? Princess Leia's anti-jiggle breast tape? Film reel labelled, "Alternate ending - Luke's father is Chewbacca"?! Oh! Oh! ...I'll give you five dollars for the box.](http://images.wikia.com/simpsons/images/0/09/Comic_Book_Guy_-_Star_Wars.jpg) This reminds me of a game shop in Raleigh.  The owner is a total prick, and he basically runs the place just to cater to him and his inner circle of buddies.  Worst place to play MTG in the Raleigh area.  I think he might have gone out of business, which I can't say I feel sorry about.

Yep, just went and looked, they closed 3 months ago.  Alienate all new visitors because you and your circle of buddies talk down to everyone and act elitist, guess what, you're business is gonna fail. What was the place called? I used to live around there and I think I do remember a friend of mine talking about how he got some of his N64 carts from a retro gaming place with a total ass running it. I'm sure you know already but try [Gamedude](http://www.gamedude.com/) next time all the prices are listed on the site and what they'll pay for trade-ins.  What's funny. I went to a gamestop over in Glendale a while back and they recommended me to go to Gamedude as well.  

I've been lazy to check it out since it's all the way up in North Hollywood. But I should try and take some time to go check it out.  

From what I've heard. It's been praised everytime it get brought up. It's not that far from Glendale, it's right off the Sherman Way exit on the 170. I love Gamedude so much.  They are very cautious about what they buy back and will test everything to make sure they aren't reselling junk.  To that end they give a fair price for both buying and selling.  They also have an absolutely massive collection of stuff to buy and will try to special order something if they don't have it in stock.   I mean, you could go on ebay and get all that stuff for a bit cheaper (Starfox 64 ~$15). But if it's a Friday night, you get paid and suddenly have the urge to play some retro game, you can't just go anywhere to pick it up. You are paying for the convenience I suppose. ***COUGH*** ^^^^^^emus ***COUGH*** Emus are great, but it's not the same. I don't know, maybe if you don't have a controller lookalike, but those are cheap. Even if you have a controller, there's still a huge difference between playing Megaman 2 on your PC through an emulator or playing it on your couch with an actual copy you found in a retro games store that has probably been enjoyed by a few people since it was made.

I guess it's the same sort of thing as having an old edition of a great book vs having it on your Kindle. Some people don't care and are happy just having the text of the book to read, some people like the authenticity and collectible side of it too. In theory you're getting the same experience but IMO having the actual version of it just enhances it. There was a time when I went into a GAME store (the UK equivalent to Gamestop I guess) with a bag full of old PS2 games to trade in. Most were worth about 50p each, but when the guy behind the counter got to Marvel vs Capcom 2 he let me know this is probably worth a fair bit more than what the store is offering, so keep it and put it up on Ebay, cause there's a big community around older fighting games.

Lo and behold I ended up selling it for 30 online.  That is the type of guy you should become friends with. my experience here was the same as my experience with Golden Apple comics in LA. the guys think they are cool as shit, and if you don't hold their opinion on something you're an asshole. this is if you can get them to acknowledge you in the first place. they'll rip anyone off if they can. 

they think they're hot shit because they work at an independent game store. its like Amoeba music or something. judgemental hipsters except its games instead of music. You didnt save that fellow customer from being scammed out of a shitload of games? You bastard. social anxiety is a helluva drug To be fair, if you don't know the market you are in. You shouldn't be trying to sell. If they're willing to sell the games to the shop at that price then who cares?  

Things are only worth as much as people are willing to buy/sell them for.  If the shop isn't willing to pay more, the seller is more than willing to take their stuff elsewhere.  It's not immoral or dishonest.  "Honestly we're probably going to throw half of this stuff out"
later...
"check out these hidden gems!"

how is that not dishonest/immoral cause xopher owns a business and is taking that POV. 30$ is pretty cheap for Star Fox 64 ya know. I personnally sell a lot of N64 games around 50$ on ebay. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Starfox-64-N64-RaRe-Nintendo-64-game-/281552617027 Guy on ebay doesn't have to pay wages or for the mortar store. Same reason why boardgame/hobby stores's merch costs more than an online retailer. I don't see why that matters, the point is 30 bucks is not cheap for starfox. 

Edit: Oh no I guess I'm wrong because someone downvoted me. Nevermind that there's a link right there where you can buy it for 16.99. The price isn't just for the game, but also for him to keep his store up. If every place sold everything at what the product would be worth, no one would be in business. The person /u/Veggiemon was giving the link to had just said that he sells games on ebay for $50, neither are talking about brick and mortar stores Doesn't matter 
, it's the same general market and the store isn't competing.  My local game store sells stuff for at (or slightly under) Ebay prices and also gives fair trade value and they have been in business for years.  A small used games store typically can't keep up with online sale pricing. There's a few things that gets tacked on to the price, such as quality assurance, and the fact that you don't have to pay for shipping and handling, etc.

I'm not defending the store mentioned above, but 30 dollars for Star Fox 64 isn't too outrageous. Theres three retro games store around my area and they all charge 50~60 dollars for big title games. Nice try, World-8 employee. If you had clicked the link you'd see it's way cheaper than 30 bucks.  I did click the link. My joke was in reference to the original comment. I guess I didn't make that obvious enough. Just because someone sells it cheaper doesn't mean $30 isn't cheap. Don't even need to say anything... Not true at all, do your homework. http://videogames.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-64/star-fox-64

Not cheap at all... No it is not, you could find it for almost half that online. Just because *some* N64 games are worth $50 doesn't mean they all are.  Don't visit this business, it's acting too much like a business. There's more to a business than a balance sheet. Whether it's service, atmosphere/experience, brand, etc. It's not always simply the exchange of legal tender for goods or services. That may be the core transaction, but so is a guy selling oranges on an off ramp. Some people would still rather go to a grocer. 

Yes the point is profit via revenue but if you think theres only one way then you've been hanging around Comcast or Rogers too much. 

Edit: typos Right, because being fair to customers isn't at all part of a business. Has it really ever? I've recently gone through the pain of The fellow you witnessed, but of course, I knew what the games were worth some still even had price tag on them. Star Fox, Megamans 2-3, ghouls and goblins, Zelda 1-Majora's mask, its sickening what they offer. my trick was bringing in like 3 games and then they'd offer me like 15, and I'd just say how tight of a jam I'm in or I'm having a baby or some shit and boom I'd get 20. Still not a good deal but hey it's something. Online is so much better to use nowadays, you can get something at a universally low price and not have to worry about being jipped. I'm surprised stores lime this can thrive, but they sure do make me nostalgia hard, there will always be a soft spot in my heart for retro gaming &lt;3 From what ive learned, sell games at a yard sale. You can name the price, and people looking to relive some memories with an older game sometimes are willing to pay the price for it.  Go to game play on Venice blvd that place is great That's a shame. There is a really cool used video game in the neighborhood I used to live in that sold mostly cartridge based games and they always sold stuff for a reasonable price. I got Pokemon Yellow &amp; Emerald, and two Gameboy SPs for maybe $70 total. Do not go to Retrofix gaming because it is 100% just the same as your own store. In fact, they have gotten so lousy that they are going from video games to magic the gathering and they are still terrible.

 That's a shame. I live nearby and was thinking of stopping in to support local business, but now I'm thinking not. [deleted] Yes Those all seem like good prices to me. Seriously, fuck these guys. My brother wanted a Gameboy so fucking bad he took my PS2, Game Cube, and our Wii including games and a bunch of controllers and the best they said they could do was about $40 or a trade in for the Game Boy. He took the fucking Game Boy. This was a few years ago. It's really hard to make a profit selling retro games in a physical store. Still if you want it to work, have good tournaments and events to get people in store, as it sounded like they had They had.
Tournaments only bring in the wannabe pro gamers.  

If you lose, they'll taught you for sucking. If you win? You're just mashing or being a noob.  

Honestly, a majority of their tournaments have people who just come in win the money and leave without actually ever buying anything.

The problem comes when the regulars get scared into even entering the tournament because those 'pro players' scare em off. 

The regulars stay and potentially buy games. The 'pro players' will just stay there until they win or lose.  

Its terrible that they try to cater to 'wanna be pro players' It scared off a ton of their regulars for going during the weekends. Aw man, I feel bad for that guy with the box full of games. :\ Downtown LA. I live a few streets from there. Please tell... Its on 11th and Vermont Avenue in Korea Town, by downtown Los Angeles

I live one street over and they seem to cater mostly for Nintendo games. I bought my 3ds there. They are pretty nice, just a bunch of gamers, and they even host smash tournaments occasionally.  They carry games for multiple systems. The Nintendo thing is just their store design. These people are dangerous! Increase surveillance I tought he was asking if they would have battletoads I bought my Nintendo 64 there, Mario64 and Mario Kart.
Yes, people said its a bit more then ebay.  But it was fair.  Its a physical store you can walk in and look and test items.

I also had my PS3 fixed there for a decent price.

If you cant afford in store prives,  then go to ebay people.   Thats fine.   I dont mind paying a few extra dollars to support something I like and to keep the lights on there. Are the tournaments for the newer smash bros games or do you know if they do n64 tourneys? With stores like this they are generally willing to set one up so long as you can show if will have a good turnout.  Judging by the Korean sign nearby, it's probably in K-Town. [Vermont &amp; 11th](https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0509074,-118.2915986,3a,75y,327.85h,88.7t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sflaKvVYap_nY2AzIppM4YQ!2e0), so yep. not downtown That isn't downtown. Seriously, they're in the south end of Ktown, with Westlake and Pico-Union before you get to downtown. I've been there a few times. The people that run it are very cool people. You should support them if you can.  Hah. Used to live right nearby, too. Never stopped in there, though.  Came here to say the same thing. Been wanting to check this place out. Didn't realize I've been driving by front page potential. Their Craigslist ads are always labeled as "owner" rather than "dealer/business" which is an annoyance. Passed by it a few times, myself. Vermont is a weird area.  Mark them as spam.  I do. It's annoying when trying to search for a game or console. I managed a weed shop about a mile from here, near Pico and Vermont. I would pass this everyday on my way there from my apartment in East Hollywood. I basically never saw anyone in there for the 3 years I managed the dispensary, 6 days a week. If you're in Los Angeles or surrounding areas, Game Dude has a WAY better selection and price. And trade-in/sell value is better.  Do you know /u/ESeeDoubleU?

http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2rhc3k/this_video_game_store_converted_the_old_auto_shop/cnfwybp /u/ESeeDoubleU Was it on the top floor of a strip mall, underneath a restaurant? Used to have a former MadTV cast member as an employee? 

Ya'll had some good shit, but then one day I drove there and it was just closed :( I prefer Game Play on Venice Los Angeles redditors unite.  Los Angeles dyslexics untie! Procrastinators of LA, unite... tomorrow. Hell Yeah!! I wonder what the next business will turn that sign in to, when this video game store inevitability closes within the next two years.  I've been there more than once, and I just want to point out that the staff has been nothing but ridiculously rude to me.  They also overcharge a preposterous amount for NES / SNES games. Oh man! And I even went through the extra effort of finding it on google maps when I posted it more than a year ago :(

http://reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/1gwq9l/a_new_gaming_store_which_was_on_the_front_page/ Awwww yeah Vermont, my old medical marijuana dispensary used to be two blocks south of here. Do you know /u/Shkmster?

http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2rhc3k/this_video_game_store_converted_the_old_auto_shop/cng32kw Are you trying to ship these two? Maybe.

^^^...yes. Shhh! You'll ruin it! Dispensary dude said it was a mile away. This dude said 2 blocks, not the same place. Dispensaries are pretty common over there. How are these kind of stores still in business? This has got to be one of the worst game stores I've ever been to. Everything is so over priced. I KNOW WHERE THIS IS. Cool! I have also been to this establishment and was disappointed. It is cramped, hot and smells like old cheese. Sales stuff was lazy and just watched me pace around with a glazed look in their eyes. Looks cool from outside which made me stop and have a look. Don't be fooled!

Overpriced and unwelcoming atmosphere.  This is on vermont and 11th I have passed through the area a couple times that store is always empty no customers ever yet somehow they're still open.. I've been through a few times and it's not been empty. I'd imagine they get a ton of traffic on tourney days, though. They also cater to the community for gaming tournaments, as that's usually when I'm there, it can be quite crowded. There also the only official provider of tournaments in the LA city (official as opposed to someone's personal housing set up) I've passed by this place so many times in my commutes to LA.  It's interesting to see it on Reddit to be honest, haha. Was thinking the same thing. I drive past this every single day on my commute home. I went there! It's in LA right? Yeah I got a sharty N64 controller, Quake II, and Mario Paint from there. Where is this place? Los Angeles, CA on Vermont and 11th. Holy crap yo, I teach down the street from there  You teach at Berendo? West Adams  Mike and Frank would be so pissed I live in the wrong city. :/ wow that seems like the kinda place id go every friday lol
 Hey it's world 8!!! I didn't think I would see this on reddit But then they stretched all of the pixel type! Why would you stretch the pixel type?! The name of this store resonates powerfully with me. I used to live within a couple blocks from there! 

They would have vidya game tournaments pretty often, and I used to support them over places like GameStop; it wasn't the most PC-friendly shop but console gaming was their central focus with a lot of some old school games and systems that made me terribly nostalgic. Their prices were fairly reasonable too last I checked.

If you're in Los Angeles, it couldn't hurt to stop by there (no I don't work for them, but it's good to support local businesses that like games, right?). I bought a replacement AC adapter for my top-loading NES there! That is all. Ive seens this place last week, it was pretty busy when I passed by it. love that place... my bro lives around the corner K-town ftw!  Yeah, I went there before everyone knew about it, so you could say I'm pretty cool. I have to agree with some of the negative comments here. Next-Gen Games a couple miles west has better retro game selection, better prices, is *clean* and well designed, also does board games and MtG, and has a better staff. hola koreatown, los angeles, ca! Logical explanation: wife is inside shopping and smoking isn't allowed indoors. He tells his wife he still works so he can leave a couple hours a day. Goes down the street smokes cigars and plays till the battery dies. What a devious bastard My dream retirement right there. Imagine how great your retirement would be if you avoided getting married. Then how would your wife pay bills while you sit in the parking lot smokin stogies playin vids? What bills? Dudes single. Well, thanks to Obama's new "Single Dudes Get Free Electricity, Gas, and Water" bill, at least. Wait....when did that get through congress? &gt; get through congress

if oxymorons could be statements, this would be an oxymoron.

Nothing gets through congress. I got a good one for ya. If the opposite of "pro" is "con," what's the opposite of progress?

Get it?

*Get it?* Can confirm. Source: am single Yeah, rent doesn't even exist if you're single. But you don't have a maxed out credit card to Macy's  You don't do much marriage do you?  &gt;wife

&gt;pay

All my wat My mom pays the bills in our family. My dad makes a little over half of the money, but my mom is the one that actually makes sure everything is paid on time and does the budget for.  My friends wife handles all of their money and budget. They both work at a school so I think they get paid around the same. He has told me they have a crazy amount of money saved up just because she's really good at sticking to a budget. They also have very little debt if any.

I'm single and have a really good job but I'm terrible with money and the only reason I want a wife is for sex and a free accountant. I'm not sure what's your stance on it, but I highly recommend sex workers and hiring an accountant rather than marriage if what you described is the case. 
You'll get awesome sex, accounting done and no woman will be harmed. Who said she's into bondage. Some women like working with numbers. I think that's the only reason anyone wants a wife, period. 

I'm speaking from a female's perspective, as a single girl dating men in their thirties and forties. Trust me, everyone just wants a few easy things: simply a dishwasher, sex partner, warm body to fondle while they're half awake/half asleep, someone that remembers to feed the cat, can do basic math, doesn't spend too much money, is horny, doesn't complain much, won't gain weight/likes to exercise, and listens to him rant about gun laws.. 

I may have a type though. I may *be* a type.   &gt; the only reason I want a wife is for sex and a free accountant.

Keyword wife. You get ONE of those, guess which one. The wife. That's how my life will be soon. My husband and I are out of debt so my husband is quitting his job after 25 years at it and we'll live off my income. Luckily I have a great job with awesome pay so it'll be easy and I only work 3 days a week/12hr shifts. My husband is going to buy beater homes and fix them up and sell them. We've already bought the first one so he and his contractor friends are getting started already.  My dream is to do that without having to lie to get out of the house. I heard my uncle used to do this apparently. Not so much to smoke + play 3ds but he'd have a "work debrief meeting" every friday and he'd just do something for himself apparently.

He got caught at the movies once and he owned up to doing it the entire time. He'd go to a bar with a buddy or go see a movie or have a dinner of some kid with his work friends.

I only met the wife briefly but she seemed pretty fucking annoying so I got it. Uncle is a cool guy though, gets along with everyone and is "the fun uncle" Wait.. "have a dinner of some kid"? 

O_o Baby: The other other white meat. Don't be racist. I fucking love dark meat.  with his work friends as well, those damn cannibals. Long pig. Mmm-mm. My friend, i have a modest proposal for you. Even a cannibal has gots to take a break yo Hey no judgement here, we've all wanted to try kid

(   ) Saving this for screenplay idea Or waiting for the parade to start.  Or he has a dope life and he does dope shit Are you implying that parades aren't dope? I think he is *slowly reaches for pitchfork*....

---E Get 'im! [I feel like people missed your reference](http://youtu.be/R4SYIfhzMmU).  Dope shit begins at 5:30 Seriously, my favorite story about Kanye ever. Kanye, living the dream.

Edit: The reference that /u/ballinlikewat made, that I am playing off of seems to have missed some folks.  I thought he was holding the stylus in his mouth like the pros do. PECK LIKE A BIRD AND TAP LIKE A BEE Black &amp; Mild wood-tip I think.  He's been sitting there for years and they built the lot around him. Way to think out of the lot. "wife is shopping inside." enough said.  Whether or not smoking is allowed inside, sitting in a lawnchair with a cold pepsi and playing video games is way better than following *her* around In the background. [Rugged Warehouse](http://www.ruggedwearhouse.com/). If he IS with his wife then I bet she is clothes shopping. Best bet is to turn her loose inside the store and tell her where to find you when she is done. 

(SOURCE: personal experience, ANY clothes store) If I didn't have Coke, I'd say fuck it and follow my wife around. colombian bam bam This is exactly how my grandparents stayed married for more than 60 years. Tales of my grandfather's lawn chair and folding card table at the local shopping center parking lot have been passed down through generations. We don't know what's really in that bottle... real explanation: he just finished rescuing the planet from devastation without anyone knowing anything about it. He is just fine with the idea that no one will know but also feels a sense of ownership over the planet. This man goes where he wants and sits where he wants and relaxes as if he has just retired from his purpose.  R/writingprompts That's his smoking chair. No electronics allowed inside. OR: Tired of getting shit for playing that damned game all the time.  Went to "go run some errands" to get away from the pointless bitching.  Can confirm. I do this while my wife is in shopping. Altho, I had not thought of the lawn chair. I might have to add that to the list along with the ipod, smokes, and Kindle Fire that are already on it. Or it could be someone like [this anon](http://i.imgur.com/ou3ho.png) all grown up. Oh, he's smoking! Ironically enough, I'm relieved. I thought it was a tube to an oxygen tank. His wife is just shopping, this man is a pro at shopping with the wife, "I'll be out in a hour sweetie... Take your time dear, I'm still trying to capture Lucario..." Alternatively... "Take your time dear.. my other wife Olivia and our children are battling Risen." Alternatively..."Take your time dear..my king Erik, Olivia and I are trying to slay the Ancient Napdragon." Alternatively... "Go and shop a bit longer honey, I'll be here grinding for a Deviljho gem." Alternatively...*WHEN'S THE LAST TIME WE HAD SEX, WOMAN?* king erik can follow you?  He has a DSi. Which game is this? Fantasy Life Heh, I tried fighting the regular napdragon. I got my two strongest companions and loaded up on potions. I didn't last very long. What game are we talking about? Fire Emblem: Awakening. Except he somehow misspelled Tharja. Nah he definitely misspelled Cordelia Why is psychotic so fucking hot?  That game opened my eyes.  I like crazy chicks.  Gotta be extra careful. Mirai Nikki opened mine. If you haven't had to call the police, it isn't true love.
 O trust me.. she is definitely next on my 2nd playthrough (she was almost my wife on this playthrough): http://www.amazon.com/Good-Smile-Fire-Emblem-Awakening/dp/B00DLTQH54

FFS! "I want a divorce." "IM TRYING TO CAPTURE LUCARIO!" ^^^You ^^^can't ^^^capture ^^^Lucario ^^^in ^^^any ^^^of ^^^the ^^^games ^^^though. pal park Huh, TIL. I didn't play any of the DP era games so I didn't realize that. What if this old dude went that hard with Pokemon that he was transferring some Pokemon from his Gen 3 games all the way up to current haha This guy looks like he loves it when a plan comes together. Why was this comment just so funny to me? Ever watch the A-Team? Me too. Why The joke is that he looks like Hannibal from the A team, who regularly says "I love it when a plan comes together". The world is this man's front porch. And he probably wants us off his lawn. Or, come on my lawn and get ready to throw down.  This is how I'm retiring but instead of a parking lot it'll be a lake.  Don't get the DS wet!  I guess hes gotta hope they make a watter proof case so he can have his underwatter bbq and play his ds. watch out for them sea bears  its so he can play bioshock on the ds right?  So you made the same mistake twice I'm gonna tell you straight up I believe it is water not watter &gt; Don't get the Newest 4DS XXL Special Mario Edition wet!

FTFY \&gt;Special Mario Edition  
\&gt;Not imported Platinum-plated N4DS LLL Monster Hunter Portable Frontier 4 G Edition I don't think I'd like a vibrating handheld console... That's the XXXL one.  He probably thought it would be a lake too then the economy cratered and now he's happy to have a cheap camp chair, a used DS from the pawn shop, and a city bus that will drop him off in a parking lot with a tree. It could just be me but that actually doesn't sound all that bad to me.  How long can you tread water? Yeah, that's probably what this guy said 15 years ago. You won't get many streetpasses at a lake Hope you like mosquitoes  how do you know a lake isn't directly behind the picture taker(was going to say photographer but not enough flowers or food) What's the point of being at a lake if your head is buried in a DS the whole time. Might as well stay on the couch. It's *quiet* the breeze and the ability to take a break when that boss kick your ass for the 5th time Looks like Hannibal is enjoying retirement.  Did you ask what he was playing? (seriously) This was my dad every day earlier this summer after moving across the country and staying in an extended-stay hotel. He'd sit in the parking lot in one of his camping chairs, smoke a cigar and fiddle with his phone. What's with all these creepy ass pictures Redditors take of people? I had to scroll all the way to the bottom to find this comment it's becoming worse. Fuck. This makes me sad beyond belief.  My grandpa (8 years deceased) used to played Pokemon with me when I visited him. This guy looks just like him. Fuck, I miss him. What kind old man. My nan plays crash bandicoot on her ps1 all the time and swears like a motherfucker at the game. She also throws the controller up every time she jumps its so great to watch. She's completed the game like twice. &gt; *Not now.*  Grandpa's in the tall grass. Probably just wants to get away from his dementia riddled wife. I could see myself doing this. well that got dark I don't know why but I found his comment hilarious. lol I worked at a pizza shop with an old delivery driver who resembled a walrus a la Jamie from Mythbusters, he had an extremely mentally disturbed wife. On one occasion his neighbors called in to the shop to inform him that his wife had removed her shirt and was going door to door saying, "Help me with all these bees! There's so many bees!". He came to work 2, 3, sometimes 4 hours early and he'd just sit and read the paper or talk sports to the guys at the bar, likely to escape the insanity that is his wife. He could go to a park or a coffee shop. The location is the only thing that's puzzling. Maybe he just literally wants to get away from everyone and there are no large parks nearby. Many parks don't allow smoking. Wat I would really like to know the back story to this situation. He's obviously waiting for someone, right? He's at a minimall....so probably his wife is shopping and she likely doesn't want him to make their truck smell like the cheap ass cigarillos he's smoking. Those wine flavored doe Every gas station I worked at I would sell those things and their single version like crazy.  shit a loosey of them blacks is where its at tho!! People by you be smokin dank bluntz yo That isn't a cigarillo. That's a fine cigar. Looks a lot like a Phillies Cheroot - so more of an ok cigar. Exactly the kind of cigar you smoke in a parking lot while concentrating on something else. This guy knows his shit.

Source: I do that. He's waiting for his plan to come together.  Guy sitting outside in the back of the lot killing time.

Black &amp; Mild looks like a standard plastic tip, and its probably any other flavor other than cookies and cream (it has a darker wrap).

Blue 3DS, non-xl version.

He drives a 2014 Chevy 1500, probably did okay in his life.

Worked with his hands most his life. Most likely suffers from high blood pressure.

You want anything else? The grey truck in the parking lot is the most likely to have a gun in it.  The man at the counter weighs 215 and knows how to handle himself.  Black n' Mild. This guy knows whats up I think this is why retirement homes in the future will be badass. 

It'll be full of old men playing video games talking about the old console wars. Plus they give you food and you're allowed to shit your pants!  All the granny pussy I could handle and Smash tournaments all day, erry day. That's me!!!! ... in 40 years! I was actually doing this today.  I just didn't have the chair.  I was using my dad's truck and I don't smoke in it.  So I sat outside of it while I smoked a black and mild and played OoT I work construction and wanted a chair to take breaks in, so got one of these. I have wanted Bravely Default for a while nkw, so I gifted myself a 3DS (first handheld in a decade) this last xmas.

Now I do this at work... More than I should. In 40 years you'll have laserbeam brain internet and never have to leave the house for anything. This man is sick of the wifes bullshit. I just wanna know what he's playing. I see pictures of old folks with handhelds and I always wanna know what they're playing. Tetris? Pokemon? FUCKING SMASH BROTHERS?! WHAT!?!?! Ha i do this every saturday in my back yard. 1 cigar, 1 2ds, and usually pokemon x, ruby or fanatsy life. i thought i was the only one. haha Probably getting away from his nagging wife. Take notes gentleman. Why are people even questioning what this dudes doing . He looks so goddamn happy . That's where I want to be in life .  he smoking a black and mild if he was in detroit he'd be me Columbia, SC none the less.  http://m.imgur.com/TO8F7Yf saw the same guy! Wife at home. Can't smoke inside. I will retire to the parking lot...   Actually, that looks like fun. I'm now confident in what my retirement will one day look like.  I'll be working in that shopping center behind him.   I want this to be me in 50 years.. I like to think I could walk up to this gentleman and we could trade Pokemon.  It'd be like a gamers version of Tuesdays With Morrie. Damn son where'd you find this glimpse into the future? Well, this'll get you away from the wife. That will be me. Except that old man has more hair then i do now.

...Fuck you old man :( This makes me miss playing my DS outside in the summer.

Just sitting in my lawnchair with a glass of whiskey and a cigar, grinding away in pokemon while the sun slowly sets through the trees. It makes for a great night off. And suddenly you look up to realize that the sun is close to coming up and you're covered in a thin layer of dew.  ...Am I the only person who thinks he may have set himself up like that to attempt to capture at least a smidgen of the outdoors in an area where such a thing is likely hard to find?

I mean hell, I've set up my hammock in the trees beside a road on multiple occasions, because the trees were well spaced, and if you're looking up, it was quite pleasant.

Nice day out, gentle breeze?  Shit, why not?  You guys can enjoy your lunch breaks sitting in the cold office lunch room, I'm spent it with the sun on my face, headphones in my ears, and half-dozing until a soothing alarm lets me know when to pack up.  20 minute nap in the middle of the day?  Hell yes. Yes. Smoking black and playing some Pokemon! When you lose your job and can't face telling the wife Some "SouthPark" is written all over this. What a g /r/ShittyBattlestations Living the life.... waiting for the wife. I take mine into the bathroom, 30 minutes =5 minutes doody+20 minutes playing+ remainder wiping then walking with zombie legs to wash up He's just running out the clock on the rest of that day.  Thuggest dude ever... truck, lawn char, 5 pack of black and milds, bottle of pepsi and a gameboy. could not be any more set then that. Hey, I'm lazy. Someone else put this on photoshopbattles  pa lease I want to be like this man. &gt;Dsi Either everyone parked in that lot is parked like a jerk, or there is something weird happening with those yellow lines (or my eyesight - that's a bit of a gamble).  This man should run for 2016 elections. Make him President! definitely playing pokemon Absolutely L'ing the D. Like a G. for when the wife is shopping, and you just can't stand looking at 20 tops that all look the same.  That black and mild tho This just looks like he crashed into the tree. And then thought fuck it! This shit is too stressful I need to play myself some Mario.  "Stop taking pictures of me, you meathead."  This guy is having a better day than a lot of people. Small business owner Jim wants to battle! I have a little place at a parking lot where I like to drive to and chill out. It's a little grassy knoll, covered by a big oak tree. It's half walled in by hedges, so the road's a little quieter, out of the way. It's got an awesome view of the pine forested hillside, you can see the sun set on its most radiant days... It's a quiet place. But not completely secluded from everyone. Bill parcels really hit rock bottom Mum: Go play outside! HE IS OBVIOUSLY WAITING FOR HIS PPL TO FINISH SHOPPING DUH This guy is an OG dank gramps My grandpa does stuff like this to stay out of the house.  Once kids are old enough and maybe outta the house this is what my retirement will look like. Minus the parkin lot and stogie. 

I am putting gaming on pause for a few years but I'll be back. I can't appreciate the picture because the terrible parking bothers me too much Gamer grandpa has no fucks to give Gotta catch 'em all! Holy shit man I'm on my phone and just looked at that tree and inside the truck for the longest time before I noticed the dude in the chair when I zoomed out Since when does Archie Bunker play Nintendo?  Ron Swanson's Dad!! What am I supposed to feel while looking at this picture I feel like he should be playing smash bros
 I hope retirement is like this for me, assuming I make it that far. As long as I have gaming and chocolate, growing old will be just fine.  He looks remarkably content.  The Great Outdoors~ 
What game is he playing?

Any guesses? Pokemon White 2, Nuzlocke. 
Has a room that the wife never goes in that is 40% pokemon cards, all the games, original red &amp; green (framed), and all of the manga and anime and plushies.  Makes me wonder if that parking lot was built over an old hangout.
 Some G shit right here Omg, the glare... He's gonna be the very best Like no one ever was Quite possibly my future. For a second, I thought that was my grandfather, back from the dead and into Pokmon  What game? Prehistoric and most Titus games. &gt;Prehistoric

C'mon man, 1992 isn't *that* old My hairline's receding and I'm younger than that game.  We should start a club. I have slept with girls younger than that game. I have been drunk  under the table by people younger than that game. In my home town there are members on the city council younger than that game. There are 22 year olds on your city council? My town has an early-20s woman on the town board, when the rest of the board was 60+. It was a pretty big deal, since it's the beginning of the end of the "old guard". I now have a feeling /u/kris0stby put the same person in all three categories I'm really sorry, but no. She is pretty cute looking, but would't have me on account of being the sister of my ex. And I wouldnt have her on account of being annoying. And waaaaay to right-oriented in her policies. 

Oh, and I really can't drink like the bearded man I'm supposed to be... We have a youngin' or two on my city's council as well. One is 23 and the other 24. Out of college early and went straight for politics, looks like. Dang whippersnappers! The woman Leslie Knope wished she was. i live near you. Our last mayor was 25... The mayor of my town is 23 years old, hope he doesn't pull a Ben Wyatt Ice Town I'm 22. What am u doing with my life... Well, you're not fucking cats. Well then he's lost my vote. I'm doing anything I want with it.
 This typo is beautiful. And hardly anyone will ever get to appreciate it.  Ice Town? What a failure that was, Mr. Wyatt. Woops, old person checking in here. I figured a girl who was born in 1992 must only be 16 by now. Fuck. It's always 2008 in my minds point of reference too, don't worry about it. 1997.

Jesus.

People born in 1997 are of legal consent age.

Thats.

I'm *old?* Actually, people born on January 15th or earlier in 1997, are 18 as of now. No, just twenty 2-year olds. Or 22, year olds. http://i.imgur.com/xuGOIJf.gif What's the worst thing about twenty two year olds?

 

There's only twenty of them

 21 actually. More of a token member than anything, to show that the youngins are represented. Doesn't have much sway, but is still there in an official role. A notable member of Congress got his start as a precocious college freshman who organized a student voting block and got himself seated on the municipal school board.  It is still unclear if he understood how little this had to do with the university at the time of his victory.  However, he became a media darling, he took a seat in the House of Representatives immediately after the sitting Representative left that job. &gt; I have slept with girls younger than that game.

At first I worked out that 1992 was 13 years ago and was really creeped out.

I am not a smart man. That's ok. Whenever someone says "ten years ago", I think of the 90s too. 2000 - 10 = 1990, baby! Maybe you're a time traveler, but you slipped up. I'm on to you, haddock420. God, I've fucked girls younger than Chrono Trigger. I feel so old. My penis feels like a pimp though. Is your dick nicknamed Epoch? It should be. Magus I hope you're not talking about the DS version. *wut* &gt; I have slept with girls younger than that game.

He^sleeps^with^little^girls... He could be 18 &gt; He could be 18

Ah parklife, great album. Also 21 years old. SOMEBODY TOLD ME! All the people, so many people Always should be someone you really love. Girls, who are boys, that do boys, like they're girls, who do girls, like they're boys? He sleeps with girls who are boys who sleep with boys who are girls.  He sleeps with girls who sleep with little boys who sleep with little girls Born in 1990... I currently am sleeping with a girl younger than that game. My life isn't too bad... How can you type with your eyes closed? I typed this comment with my eyes closed. It's not that hard, once you've got your fingers on the home row.

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X_Ot0k4XJc That is the year I was born! Yeah it's like... 8 years ago 22 years is pretty old considering the technology advances.
 Great, I bet Superman 64 is all proud of itself for "working" 16 years later. What an asshole. Prehistorik, I just played it on that Archive yesterday. Grew up with this game, saw this yesterday and was so confused. Superman 64 was published by Titus. Titus the Fox. So awesome. Why doesn't this subreddit STILL doesn't have a rule where you're supposed to put the game name on the title?  One of my computer engineering profs said "If you want your code to be used for as long as possible, make games. People will emulate hardware just to play games that they liked." He may have stolen it from someone though.

Now that I've been in the field for 6 whole months, I know that you get a similar effect from enterprise software. Once it's out there, no one will touch it unless it breaks. I am currently in the process of replacing some mainframe programs put into production back in 1983. We also have the original source code and its fun to read the comments. But outside of the comments and some of the financial formulas its pretty much useless since we just did a deep dive redesign of what the original program did.


Edit:

The best comment I found was dated 1982 and its "B35-W23-H33" which we think is the measurements of the playmate of the month. I also found one Star Wars reference and one Star Trek reference.


Comments aside its cool think that someone my age was writing this code before I was even born. That's pretty fascinating mate, any random cultural throwbacks you can share from the comments? Any " // just checking this in then I gotta go get my mullet trimmed and Dallas is on tonight" or the like? Jeez man, a comment that long would take up half your disk space. You can't go wasting money like that. I got a pretty big disk. (   )  Too bad it's floppy :( I feel a solid state coming on...

Edit: Nope, it crashed. I got bits everywhere. Better format it with a FAT32, if you know what I mean (   )  I, too, would like to know. Or any humor. I have [some](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/184618/what-is-the-best-comment-in-source-code-you-have-ever-encountered) to share. 

Full of gems. This has inspired me to start writing comments for fun. It never really occurred to me until now. Everyone looking for a laugh, I just want fractions of a penny on every transaction.   Which in itself is a callback to the 80s. Nice one. More like bank software. That stuff never dies. Saw a job listing today for a bank. Need to know Cobol. I didn't apply. Learn Cobol. It pays a lot. See Bloomberg terminals.I remember years ago going on a field trip of a trade floor and the broker proudly showing us some 8 bit green screen software... They probably still have the damn thing. I worked at Bank of America 3 years ago and they still used an MBNA legacy system that is pretty much a DOS-like environment. 

It's insanely fast and reliable though, the program reps use to handle customer service is pretty much a Windows shell that sends commands to the MBNA program.  Can confirm.

Work for a bank most our systems for everyday banking are still using a mainframe system, that is basically circa 1980. Can't see it changing any time soon. You add up the cost to build new system and the risk of bugs, not worth it.  There's a phrase in the business, "Software is sticky."

 Ew Where did you learn to program?? Japan?? [Very sticky](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m738mbHuza1qzo3zwo1_1280.png) Industrial tech is similar.  Half the plants are running ancient shit.  The other half upgrade every 10 years...  I am getting good with DOS, and I am the same age as that game!  I have worked on hardware that if it could laugh, would laugh at this "young wippersnapper".  Also, the first " multi-core" "computers" were probably PLC's.  I have a customer who refuses to replace a PLC from the 80's, that can have multiple CPU's that basically run threaded... The 80's were a good time for making high reliability, high lifetime computing equipment.  A lot of companies were designing for stuff they figured would still be in use 10, 15 years later (not yet thinking that the performance explosion wouldn't slow down for decades), and when you had people dropping a thousand dollars minimum on a PC (and often much more with peripherals and accessories and software, all that in 1980's money), there was a lot at stake in not having design flaws. There are still PDP-11s and VAXen running around the place. The fans and PSU capacitors are beginning to fail in some situations, but most the other stuff is good for at least a couple more decades. 

Considering how tightly integrated they can be into larger industrial systems with very little ROI on a replacement, they probably will run for that long. Industrial systems is a common use, but systems in contexts like air travel or nuclear power where regulatory requirements necessarily are stringent, cost a lot to recertify. I collect a particular 80's computer - the Sanyo MBC-55x series.  I've got about 15 of these machines, almost all from eBay.  Most of them work.

The ones that weren't working fall into these categories:

* Disk access stops working because of a [backwards installed capacitor](http://www.vintage-computer.com/vcforum/showthread.php?30903-Flaw-identified-in-Sanyo-MBC-55x-motherboard) that takes over a decade to go bad.  Fixing this problem is as simple as breaking the capacitor off the board.  All boards have the problem but not all experience symptoms.  It is the most common cause of issues, and was a simple screwup by whoever did the circuitry layout.

* One machine was stored in a garage or something and had water leaking onto it and high humidity.  The galvanized steel case was in pretty bad shape.  Some motherboard traces were corroded, but appear intact.  An unknown problem affects the motherboard, but surprisingly shows some signs of life and it is evident that the processor is executing some code from the ROM, and video display circuitry is running.  Maybe an IC went bad from moisture infiltration.
* A loose motherboard (purchased without the rest of the machine) is nonfunctional.  Cause not yet determined.
* One machine had all the wires in the system cut.  Haven't tested the motherboard or disk drives yet, but my guess is they are working.
* The infrared track 0 sensor in one floppy drive failed.  The rest of the drive probably works.
* One floppy drive is starting to experience problems in the rotation speed regulation circuit.  I may swap its IR sensor to the drive that had that problem, if it's the same style drive.
* One cooling fan is loud, because it had never been run.  Maybe the lubricant is screwy because of that.

All of the tested power supplies work (they are dead simple and way overbuilt).  It's somewhat rare to find the keyboards still with the system but they don't fare quite as well.  Definitely the weakest component.  If they're well taken care of they tend to survive though.

I guess my point is, 1 difficult to diagnose motherboard problem, 2 floppy drive problems, issues caused by inconsiderate owners, and crappy keyboards are pretty much all that's wrong with 15 of these machines after roughly 30 years.  It's impressive, really, compared to today's standards. &gt; One cooling fan is loud, because it had never been run. Maybe the lubricant is screwy because of that.

"Why do my eyes hurt?"

"Because you've never used them before." During the summer i went out to a site where the client needed to replace their PLC that ran the entire plant. It was an old modicon from the mid 80s. They ran out of I/O. They had space for 4 Inputs and 2 out. 

Meanwhile they needed to add a whole bunch of new equipment. This plant is by no means small either, id rather not say who but to give you an idea, thier products are bought all around the world and this plant prepares many tons of it per day and ships all around the world.

the PLC room was a mess. wires everywhere, tons of sensors on the equipment either didnt work or had been rigged to never show error. 

I was there for 4 weeks for what had originally been planned as a 2 week trip.

they literally pushed back $2+ million in expansion projects by at least a year and a half because they had absolutely no way to control any of the new equipment. 

Getting them to admit they need to upgrade thier PLC was like pulling teeth. We originally asked for 4 weeks of downtime because we knew it was a mess (it turned out being worse), and they gave us 2.

And the best part. No one had any drawings for 90% of any thing electrical. 

And now i know why no one wants to replace Old PLCs.  My internship as a lab tech:

"Go run this test on that computer."

"Why does this computer run windows 3.1?"

"Because it's old."

"Why hasnt it been upgraded?"

"Because the software requires a hard key that is wired into that computers motherboard."

"Why not get new software??"

"Because all our data is on that computer, taken by that program, which was designed for that apparatus, which is more accurate than present day equivalents."

"I dont beleive you."

"Your right.  It would just be expensive as fuck to replace all of this stuff so were running it till it dies."

"But none of that data is backed up, and you cant put that machine on the network, because it was made before the internet was invented..  You've got all the electrical curves for like, every product we make here on that thing.  What happens when it does die?"

O.O

And that was how I learned that even people with Ph.D's can sometimes be really, really, really dumb. I work IT in a fortune 500 company, and the number of legacy applications that we have to deal with is insane. Because it works and nobody wants to drop the cash for new software. Or it doesn't work since it's so old, and they don't want to buy anything new, so they expect our second level support team to fix it for them. For example, we still run a virtualized version of Lotus Notes. Which doesn't play nice with the most recent version of MS Office. I work at a Fortune 500 company, we also still use Lotus Notes. Some of our departments are just starting to migrate away from it. It might just be my company, but a lot of our software migrations move at a glacial pace. I had a project once to create a network of Windows 3.11 machines... in 2003!

It was a medical research company who used fancy centrifugal scanners and some other gear. However they needed to be able to upload scans and things to their central server.

The IT policy would prohibit the connection of anything not running Windows XP. So each machine had to have an XP machine with two network cards. One for the network, one for the beige 3.11 machine.

It made sense though. Cost of a windows 3.11 machine was about 40 off eBay. Price to replace each scanner, approx 10,000. I think every game programmer... hell, every creator of any media,  hopes their work will still be consumed and somehow relevant culturally twenty+ years after release.  If my software is still relevant in 20 years, it means the hardware team all quit. As a maintenance tech that worked on early 80's DEC equipment still in fully-functional (sometimes) service as of when I left that place a few years ago.....I've seen the dark side of this moon. these days I think we're just happy that our work is consumed at all! Instructions unclear, ate Life &amp; Death II: The Brain. Get the shotgun, we got a brain eating zombie! Whilst reading this, I was reminded of a guy that posted his "still functional" [1985 home automation system on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/26tlex/my_house_has_a_working_total_home_automation/) Titus the Fox. Fuck that game. Annoyingly addictive, annoyingly difficult. [Holy shit that music...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_VPhDnRwdk)
 Theres a problem with that one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8zM1v0piSs Good lord, that is a loud game I can see some kid playing that game back then and driving his parents insane with that music The sound effects are like someone yelling in your face. I didn't know my phone was capable of being that loud  Why? I've never played it. Very very "old school" platformer - extremely unforgiving, fast reflexes required, no explanations of any kind of game mechanic before it is introduced.

Some people love that kind of stuff, though. Speaking of no explanations of game mechanics, anyone remember boy and his blob? 

Sure, it tells you about the jelly beans. But after that, you're on your own, and I have no idea what the point even is. 

I haven't played it in 18 years, probably, but I remember not being able to get past the first "level", if you can call it that, because I had no idea what was going on.  2015: Our game is not working yet, but we have plenty of DLC lined up for you to purchase in the mean time. Ah yes, 1992, the year when computer games didn't have bugs... Well, they did, but often the bugs weren't game breaking as they shipped **after** bug testing, not selling the users a beta and fixing it as they go. There were bugs but they weren't that common.    Patches were incredibly difficult to distribute back then so the way the game worked and played the day it was released was the way it would usually stay forever.

I remember talking to Sierra tech support about a bug in Police Quest 4 some time around 1995 and them explaining that I would need to have a modem to log into their BBS to download a patch to finish the game.    A lot of people didn't have modems and it wasn't even a toll free number.  I had to make a LD call to another country to finish the game.  

Things like this didn't happen often, now you expect several patches to come out after any new game. I remember PC gaming magazines would often pack the attached floppy (later CD) with patches for popular games. Was a godsend before I got myself hooked up to that newfangled Internet thing. 2035: our game still works is 2035!... you need to renew your licenses please pay us if we still exist!  Hm, the same pattern of green pixels over all of the 1's... interesting. Yup, just a problem with the font that was used I'd think. Probably just accidentally drew within the boundaries of the "1" texture. I was programmed in 1992! There are games from 2014 that haven't even made it to 2015. There are games from 2015 that haven't made it to 2015. This programmer's code was Y2K compliant before it was cool. Doom, Descent, Hexen, Duke Nukem, Eye of the Beholder, Commander Keen, Stygian Abyss, Xcom, all working great here 20 years later thanks to no DRM. This is a great find  Wow, I even know what game it's from! Prehistorik 2, right?      
Now I want to find it and run again. Just for the sake of the guy who did it. I started on a 286, albeit 16mhz, and eventually bumped with a math co and from 640 to 1024k and EGA to VGA.

We had all kinds of Sierra games, Ultima thru #7, Wizardry, Might and Magic, Arena, all the Gold Box D&amp;D games.  It was a fucking beautiful time for CRPGs, not so much for action games, except Wing Commander which was AMAZING.

We need a fucking Wing Commander reboot.  What happened to that franchise? /r/starcitizen Made by the same guy as WC bah! past, that was the FUTURE. 

Adventure - Colossal Cave  on my Kaypro 2 CP/M (Control program for microproccessors sporting a Zilog Z80 processor with 64K of RAM and 2 191K floppies. 

 I think we were using 386 25mhz machines at work in 1992 and they weren't the top of the line PC.  Top of the line was 486 DX2 66 Mhz. Look at you with your fancy $4000 computer, probably got a 40 meg harddrive...that you will NEVER fill up. My first was a Packard Bell 486 DX 66 Mhz with a 420 MB HD. It took a year to pay off. Plus that 4 MB memory upgrade that set me back $250 to play Doom II. Then the CD-ROM and Soundblaster upgrade to play Myst.  
I'm old.  At one point I had a 100MB drive with Stacker 2. what game is that? Looks like I'm a hipster. I did this/ found it out before it was cool; in the early 90's because I used to change the date/year on my computer just for kicks (or to play with the special Halloween or Christmas objects in the incredible machine) &gt; the special Halloween or Christmas objects in the incredible machine

WUT

And I'm only learning about this now. An AT in '92.............?

Seriously... a 286 in '92? I bought a P5-60 in 1993 (it was $3500 w/o monitor, I was making $4.25 an hour so it was a lot of hours) and was using a 486 in '92.  A 286 12Mhz was a pretty old computer in 1992. Due to WinXP end of life, I had to migrate to Windows 7 a bunch of programs that reads data from a bar code scanner through the serial port. The programs were 16-bit, probably originally built for Windows 3.11, and does not work on x64 Windows 7. Luckily, there is DosBox to the rescue. I was able to map a physical COM port to DosBox, once I force it to run at a pretty high update rate (so that more CPU cycles were dedicated to it) the program works flawlessly. With this in place, I think my client will be using this piece of software until the end.

A 64-bit OS running a program built for a 16-bit OS. Kudos to the DosBox team!

Edit: I also built a pretty simple program in C++ that pretends it is the original program, but invokes DosBox (and autoexec.bat), so that other software that reads data from the scanner ignorantly calls it and the data just magically returns having without a clue all the layers and stuff that happens under the hood ;-)

I was ready to start reverse engineering the serial port communication, but this hack saved quite a bit of effort for me! Some games are running after 23 years and for some freaking reason I can't play Fallout 3. I'm happy if my code still runs in 6 months. 2015 could be a var which takes the year indicated by your computer, he didn't necessary wrote "2015" in its code.  What. **Of course** it's the year from system date. It's been displaying that screen for at least ten years now, with current year. How am I supposed to know it's been displaying that screen for at least ten years now, with current year, with one image? Shit, if I programmed it I would have that screen from day 1. "This still works? I coded it &lt;1 day&gt; ago!"      #include &lt;ctime&gt;

          } Let's see if it breaks...

 Oh my god. You are the most awesome bot ever. Somebody unleashed this thing over in /r/programmerhumor and we all started trying to break it.  There's a dozen or so languages that it will interpret. Awwwww, yeah! Securing this bot must be a nightmare... Probably runs in a sandboxed VM just to be safe. For some reason, compileBot has been very sporadic recently. I screwed up formatting it a couple of times.  Hopefully it will work in a minute or two. That function doesn't return an int.       10 PRINT "Boobs "
     20 GOTO 10 In C++, main implicitly returns 0 as control flow reaches the end of the function. This is distinct from C where an explicit return value is needed. Main doesn't actually need to return anything. depends on the compiler. sometimes you do need to return an int (0 is standard for success, for example) Some days I really want to try to learn how to code. Then I read exchanges like this and realize I'm far too stupid.  +/u/compilebot  C --recompile --include-errors

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    int main()
    {

        printf("It's really not so bad!  Come join the dark side!\n");  //Fucking hell.  I messed up on the first try.
        return 0;
    } They're fuckin' wizards mate, I have no idea what's going on.

If we hide over here they probably won't get us. It's less that the designs are too clever to understand and more that EVERYTHING EVER IS A COMPLETE AND UTTER MESS I've been trying to learn code for the past 4 years, and I still don't get it. You basically have to toss everything you've ever known about the human language, and rewire your brain from the ground up for a computer language. Definitely a STEEP learning curve, and it's frustrating! But you certainly don't want to do

    void main();

That has a chance of fucking shit up (and/or not compiling). (Example of fucking shit up is if such program is used in a batch script, where it expects programs to have a return code of zero. The above would have a more or less random return code, and probably cause the script to terminate early.) Yeah don't pretend Main owes you something Go write some C, old man! Before I got out of the industry, I mostly worked on low level stuff. We used C, asm, and occasionally Fortran (shudder). We didn't need any of this newfangled OOP. We did our own memory management like real men, and our functions returned values dammit! Related, http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html

Ain't nobody more legit than Mel. I bet you just loooove writing functions that operate on pointers to structs don't you You know ***it ;) Days!?


Minutes! What else would make sense? common sense. 1992 would be just on the borderline of the Windows 3.1 release, so more likely programmed for earlier DOS systems...I wonder then if modern Windows still responds to those old calls for dates from such old programs, in the same way DOS or 3.1 did. Hmm.  to run an old program on a new system, api calls like requests for dates have to be emulated or the program will crash and have lots of bugs This is actually the reason Fallout 3 has problems with Windows 7. A game doesn't have to be old, it just has to rely on a system call that has changed. Really? I play fallout 3 on Win 8.1 with no problems at all.  On 7 I crash any time I use console input. I bought it on steam. Works perfect on my win7 x64 box. http://www.dosbox.com/ No, many games from that era will attempt to start DOS Protected Mode and fail.  Though, with DOSBox, this is not much of an issue.  I am happily playing games from my youth on an infrequent basis. 286th comment I wish I had thought to do this with some of my games.  Shipping is hard.
 Ah, I have seen that screen popping up many years back when playing the Titus games :). 8000 fps! Well, I just installed Resident Evil (1996) on my Windows 10 test box with no problem. I haven't completed the entire game yet, but, it's working flawlessly so far. Ultima Online, an online-only game (by fucking EA, of all people), has been operating for about 17ish years now. I really hope that it makes it to 20. Time to go add some code for 2045 in my current game project's codebase! I'll be curious to see if anyone tries to emulate the current digital game stores (iOS,Android,etc.) in the future. Playing today's games might not be possible like this anymore. Heh, i played this last year for kicks. terrible game, but i love it. I will always upvote Prehistoric 1 &amp; 2. Moktar!! Nearly... What game? Total Annihilation works flawlessly it even runs on any resolution your desktop is running in. I heard there's the same easter egg in AC unity, but I think the date is 2016 NO! DON'T FORD THE RIVER!! JUST CAULK THE WAGON AND SAVE YOUR OXEN! It was always just a menu option for us. I wonder how long it actually took wagon folk to do that.

I think I'd just build my wagon onto the bottom of a boat. The wheels on the boat go round and round, round and round, round and round. All the poor oxen go glub glub glub, glub glub glub, glub glub glub. All through the west! Fuck yeah, duckboats rule  You can't use just any kind of caulk for that hole. White caulk won't fill it. I would get a nice black caulk, but that's not really waterproof. If you want a medium waterproof caulk go grab yourself two brown caulks. Brown caulk is good for crossing rivers. God I love to help people understand caulk. you know i'm all about the caulk

 That takes me back. My school had the 1985 and 1990 versions. Good times. If you want the exact one that OP is playing, you can go [here](http://macintoshgarden.org/games/the-oregon-trail) and emulate the rom on a macintosh SE emulator. I've done it for quite a few games, but it takes a while to get set up. There's directions for doing it though on the Mac Garden website. Not the Mac version. But the internet archive just made a bunch of old games playable in a browser, including this. Yeah, but I don't remember it. Just Google "Apple IIgs emulator" and it should be the first thing. I played this game when I was a kid too. I loved it. 

It's a weird coincidence that today I was looking up games on wikipedia and came across Oregon Trail again (before seeing this post). Hard to believe that this game sold 65 million copies across multiple platforms. 3rd biggest selling video game ever!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games not to sounds stupid but, where in that link do you see Oregon Trail at all? zero mention when I search for it and definitely not in the list of all platforms so... what gives?
