My first show was at a dead karaoke where my friend and I (17 years old at the time) asked if we could just get on the mic and do comedy. He regretted it. It was bad. It wasn't until my second year in college (2010) where I started taking comedy seriously, and made up my mind that I wanted to do it full time.\n\n\n2.- I kinda touched on my first time on stage, but my first time where I actually decided to make it a career was at the Laughing Skull Lounge in Atlanta, GA. Great club. Love every chance I get to get on that stage, but this night the headliner (Margaret Cho) for the weekend popped in to the open mic and did a set. Right before I went on. Luckily, I brought a lot of people (the first three rows) that would laugh at me no matter what. They helped drown out the silence coming from the rest of the crowd. Even though my material wasn't great (which I developed through a step by step how to book by Sandy Shore) and that I could tell it was only the people I brought laughing, I still had a lot of fun, and I wanted to get up and do better next time. Which I did and still want to do.\n\n\n3.- I had a good support group with my parents and brothers. I think my second oldest brother is funnier than me, but he is into cars that go fast or something like that. Never got into it. I have a saying about friends. \"It's nice to have friends outside of comedy, they remind you of how unfunny you are.\" I took a lot of shit from my friends, but just today actually one of them said, \"You got it right. Even though I'm making more money than you right now, I fucking hate my job, and you're doing what you love. You got it right, man.\" That was probably the nicest thing a friend ever said to me about my career choice.\n\n\n4.- Rehearse my set. Listen to some up beat music. Get the blood flowing. I like to have energy in my set because the audience feeds off the energy you bring. If I can chug a Redbull before each show I do that. I always try to have at least one brand new joke or tag or bit or something that I'm trying out because it reminds me to grow every time I'm on stage.\n\n\n5.- That depends on how well I do. Short answer, Yes if it's a good show. Nothing beats the feeling of leaving the stage on a huge applause break. It is honestly better than sex. And I always get a rush of adrenaline that I love during the show. Long answer, No. I always know there was something more I could have done either prior to getting on stage, or during the performance. Even if there really wasn't, I still think this way in order to force me to work harder. I always record (at least the audio) of my set and listen to it. It sounds so lonely on playback because it's a bad quality recording where it barely picks up my voice, and even less picks up the laughs.

There really aren't unwritten codes that most comedians follow because the path to success is different for each comedian. I'll try my best to think of 5 codes I go by that I think the average person wouldn't think of, but they will probably end up being 5 bits of advice I got or heard someone else get.\n\n\n1. **It's never the audiences fault, although, sometimes there are bad audiences.** Laughter is a group sport, and if the consensus of the group is that we don't want to laugh, why are you at a comedy show? I've been on a few shows were the audience didn't want to laugh, and not just for me, but for everyone on the show. We didn't do anything wrong as performers and they didn't do anything wrong as an audience. It was just a bad audience, and it was our fault we didn't make them good. A lot of audience members will dismiss comedians that are not making them laugh because they think they aren't funny because they aren't a \"big name\" comic. (at open mics this may be, but on weekend shows, it's probably not true. I say probably because I've seen some people on weekend shows that should not have been there). On the flip side of that, I've seen \"big name\" comics get laughs just because they are a big name. Their material was just bad, and not well written, and they delivered it poorly, but yet they still got laughs just because they were them. \n\n\n2. **Comedy is not a competitive sport.** Comics stick together. Yes, there is always going to be feuds, but generally we stick together. We are a special kind of people that usually don't fit in outside of comedy. If we get offered a show, but we can't make it, we recommend other comics we like and want to help out to take out spot.\n\n\n3. **We hate when people ask us to tell them a joke, and we always talk shit about that person.** This is going to sound stuck up, but comics are not joke tellers. We work on an act, and then perform that. When someone says, \u201cOh , tell me a joke.\u201d It doesn\u2019t bother me that much, but I know it is annoying for someone to think we just tell jokes on stage. It\u2019s an insulting question that probably doesn\u2019t mean to be.\n\n\n4. **Comedy is a business.** There are hobbyists out there, but the comedians that are trying to make a living are working hard to do so. We are just salesman when it comes down to it. We are trying to sell ourselves to the audience as well as the bookers. We are trying to be artists but give the people what they want. It\u2019s a fine line to walk because the job security is almost non-existent. We could be on top of the world one year, and the next year we are half of that. Dane Cook is a great example of this even though I think he is hilarious and his new special Troublemaker was amazing.\n\n\n5. **Never Pay for Sprite.** It looks too much like water, and it's an easy way to save a few dollars on a drink.\n\n\n\nI'm sure there are a few old school comedy traditions we still follow, but I can't think of that many. They vary from club to club, too. I know the Punchline in Atlanta, it's a tradition to sign your name on the greenroom wall. The tradition of helping bring up the ones below you. If there are any big traditions I don't know about them, I'm still young in comedy, so I'm sure I'm going to learn some.\n\n\n\nSorry this took so long.

Those shots aren't going anywhere. We have them available at any time and they stately only take a couple weeks to build an immune response. I don't belive this will ever happen again though, whether or not more or less people choose to vaccinate. Because if you look at the actual people infected by polio it was on an already massive decline before vaccines were introduced in the 60's.\n\nIt won't happen again because people vaccinate. Every time someone decides not to vaccinate it puts others at risk, as well as the global effort to eradicate it at risk. It is not eliminated and vaccination needs to continue until it is. Despite this, you are probably correct that it won't ever spread again, but that doesn't absolve you from the responsibility to everyone to stop it spreading again.\n\n It wasn't in 'massive decline', it was at the end of a pretty horrific epidemic. 1955 - 58000 cases. 1957 (post-vaccination) - 5600 cases. \n\n&gt;\"Of the 3,969 medical compensation claims relating to vaccines in the last 30 years, a quarter had been made by those badly affected by the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, they say. The triple jab was banned in Japan in 1993 after 1.8 million children had been given two types of MMR and a record number developed non-viral meningitis and other adverse reactions. Official figures show there were three deaths while eight children were left with permanent handicaps ranging from damaged hearing and blindness to loss of control of limbs\". Sorry, a quarter of those were from the shot. so it was more around 1k.\n\nFirstly, this is from the daily mail, pretty weak.\n\nSecondly, look at what the article is actually saying:\n\nVaccines; So not 1000 at all; they had 3 deaths and 8 disabilities in 1.3 million doses (the extent of which is due to the MMR is probably of interest. The article itself states that Japan had been using a particularly bad batch of vaccine). \n\nMeasles: 94 dead in a similar time frame to the 4 years of MMR dosing. No mention of those with disabilities.\n\nNot even comparable are they?\n\n&gt;This argument is incredibly dangerous, and could be extended to almost anything. What you are essentially saying is this: \"please put your child at risk for the possible benefit of mine.\" My response is \"no thank you\". It is not my responsibility to keep your child safe, it is your responsibility. Herd immunity is not proven, never has been, and there are multiple point in logic where it completely falls apart. Even if herd immunity was a proven science (which it's not) your individual freedoms will always outweigh your \"responsibility\" to your neighbors. If we go down your road, when do we force people to give up kidneys to save their neighbor? Logically that's not far off from what you're saying.\n\n\nFirstly, herd immunity exists. [this took about 4 seconds to find.](http://www.bmj.com/content/326/7385/365.1?variant=full) - key quote to save you reading it: \"control of meningococcal infection by indirect protection, by reducing the attack rate in the unvaccinated population by 67%.\"\n\nSecond: [Here is a suitably timed onion article to mock this position.](http://www.theonion.com/articles/i-dont-vaccinate-my-child-because-its-my-right-to,37839/)\n\n&gt;\"please put your child at risk for the possible benefit of mine.\" \n\nYou're kidding right? You're comparing the non-existent risk of vaccination vs an actual disease? \n\n&gt;\"your individual freedoms will always outweigh your \"responsibility\" to your neighbors.\" \n\nUntil those freedoms infringe upon those of your neighbour, which non-vaccination does.\n\n&gt;If we go down your road, when do we force people to give up kidneys to save their neighbor? Logically that's not far off from what you're saying.\n\nI wasn't aware that vaccination came with an extra dose of kidney removal. Forced harvesting of organs is pretty far from what I'm saying. Though in organ donation terms it should be opt-out rather than opt-in. \n\n&gt;On top of that, this argument poses an even bigger problem. You owning a pool in your backyard is statistically thousands of times more likely to kill my child than an unvaccinated neighbor kid. Is it your \"responsibility\" to not own home pools? After all, in the US, they are far more deadly to kids than disease. \n\nNo, it's your responsibility to make sure they're supervised. Accidents happen, everyone accepts that. They also require others to make sure that risk of accidents is reduced. The difference to infectious diseases is that those diseases don't have to happen if you are a responsible individual living in a society.\n", "score": 1},{"body": "I found an old wheelchair in the creek behind my house when I was about 14 with my friends while playing air soft.

Also, he went through a lot of personal issues with both of his parents passing away to cancer within a year of each other. Isolated Incident (his least reveared special) reflected that, too. It was more \"grown up\" style of stand-up. Less whimsical stories with lots of theatre aspects and more set-up/punchline jokes. I thought it was a great special, but that's because I really respected him for going down a road different from his previous successes. His new special, Troublemaker, just aired last night on Comedy Central I think it was. It initially aired on Showtime, but it was good. He kinda got back to his old self, but you can tell he matured a bit. He came up in  a time where it was still not common place to have entertainment at the tip of our fingers, so his hard-work offstage with Myspace and early days of Twitter were new and exciting. Now it's, like I said, common place. I still respect him, and enjoy watching him. I never met him though. I'd like to some day.

Some people like him, some people hate him. It kinda boils down to writers and performers. Ritch Shydner (who is such a awesome, insightful, generous guy. I grew leaps and bounds when I worked with him) explained this to me and it made a lot of sense that in stand-up there are two types of comedians: Writers (Woody Allen, Mitch Hedberg) and Performers (Robin Williams, Dane Cook). The Writers sit down at a desk or computer or pad of paper and pen and they write out a joke. They craft it with every single word, every syllable, and then they take it on stage when it's ready, then they revise it, they take it back on stage, then they revise it again, and so on until they are happy with how it is. The Performers think of a funny topic, and go on stage and riff on it, then they riff a little more, then they cut some stuff, then they riff some more, then they cut some stuff, and they never sit down and write it out. Both ways are great, and honestly you need a little of both to be a great comic. Writers have scripts. Performers have outlines. However, Writers have more of a problem with joke thieves because it's part of the integrity of writing. This is my joke, I created it, I wrote it. It's mine unless I sell it. Just like anything else you originally create. Performers on the other hand get on stage with an outline in mind and they perform. Most of the time, when a performer steals a joke it's on accident. It happened to me. I'm on stage performing, and a funny thought popped into my head so I said it. Later on it occurred to me that what I had said was not an epiphany of thought, but it was a joke I had heard once before and forgotten where I had heard it. Luckily, the comic whose joke it was was there and was nice about it because I apologized profusely. This was less than a year in for me. One of the most commonly known thieves was Robin Williams, he was just so in the moment on stage that anything that popped into his head was already out there. He made up for it with monetary compensation, and apologies, but eventually he had to stop going to comedy clubs (on his own accord) because he would subconsciously steal jokes. That's what happened with Mencia. He's a performer, thought it was his joke, he caught some backlash, but now he's still working and still funny. He's coming to the Improv in Atlanta soon.

Due to the severity of his illness, they started chemo almost immediately. As his best friend, I wanted to be by his side throughout. So I would go with him to his treatments and try and keep him in good spirits...which got progressively harder as time went on. (I feel like this isn\u2019t something they show in the movies that often...he grew increasingly lethargic after every treatment. It was only during the off weeks that he really started to gain his energy back.)\n\nNow, this all happened around the time when *A Feast For Crows* was released. So, in an attempt to bring some excitement to this dreadful situation, I decided to bring a book and read to him during his treatments. Over the course of a few months, we read all four Game of Thrones books, and we'd discuss so much about the story when we were done. \n\nAdam's absolute favorite character was Arya. Maybe my memories have become sensationalized in the past 10 years, but every time we got to an Arya chapter he seemed to gain a bunch of energy and perk up. Our discussions always seemed to come back around to Arya and how complex the character is and how hard everything she's going through must be (I think he kind of identified with her on some levels there.) \n\nAdam passed away 14 months later. He never got to see the show. He'll never get to know how the story ends. But I think the biggest injustice of all is that he won't get to see you bring his favorite character to life. He won't get to appreciate the nuiance that you bring to the character.\n\nWatching the show has been really hard for me, but it's also helped me relive those days at the hospital spending time with Adam and bonding over a beautiful series. \n\nThank you for doing justice to such a great literary character.

Due to the severity of his illness, they started chemo almost immediately. As his best friend, I wanted to be by his side throughout. So I would go with him to his treatments and try and keep him in good spirits...which got progressively harder as time went on. (I feel like this isn\u2019t something they show in the movies that often...he grew increasingly lethargic after every treatment. It was only during the off weeks that he really started to gain his energy back.)\n\nNow, this all happened around the time when **A Feast For Crows** was released. So, in an attempt to bring some excitement to this dreadful situation, I decided to bring a book and read to him during his treatments. Over the course of a few months, we read all four Game of Thrones books, and we'd discuss so much about the story when we were done. \n\nAdam's absolute favorite character was Arya. Maybe my memories have become sensationalized in the past 10 years, but every time we got to an Arya chapter he seemed to gain a bunch of energy and perk up. Our discussions always seemed to come back around to Arya and how complex the character is and how hard everything she's going through must be (I think he kind of identified with her on some levels there.) \n\nAdam passed away 14 months later. He never got to see the show. He'll never get to know how the story ends. But I think the biggest injustice of all is that he won't get to see you bring his favorite character to life. He won't get to appreciate the nuiance that you bring to the character.\n\nWatching the show has been really hard for me, but it's also helped me relive those days at the hospital spending time with Adam and bonding over a beautiful series. \n\nThank you for doing justice to such a great literary character. Wherever he is, I'm sure Adam would say the same thing.\n\n-----------\n\nI guess if I had to ask one question it would be: what is your favorite memory from your past that has most influenced the person you are today?", "score": 1},{"body": "Hey Maisie!
