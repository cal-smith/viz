Brief Question here from someone that is interested. 

SpaceX's current strategy revolves mostly around old style Rockets, even if they are now approaching complete reusability (Grasshopper rocks). Has SpaceX looked into Hybrid craft like the SABRE program happening in the UK, or look into the possibility of a space elevator (Even at a thought experiment stage) in the way that Google and NASA have done? 

Thanks for doing this AMA.  If you want to get to orbit or beyond, go with pure rockets. It is not like Von Braun and Korolev didn't know about airplanes and they were really smart dudes. Mr Musk,

How will you secure the first stage of the Falcon 9 to the barge when it lands?  Gravity or some mechanism? Mostly gravity. The center of gravity is pretty low for the booster, as all the engines and residual propellant is at the bottom.

We are going to weld steel shoes over the landing feet as a precautionary measure. I suggest you get the guy from sports authority to help with the rocket shoes.  In order to use the full MCT design (100 passengers), will BFR be one core or 3 cores?   At first, I was thinking we would just scale up Falcon Heavy, but it looks like it probably makes more sense just to have a single monster boost stage. Nice to see you are doing things the Kerbal way. Kerbal is awesome! In the off chance u/elonmuskofficial reads this, Elon, we think you're awesome, too. &lt;3 All of us at Squad. Elon Kerman added to crew name pool.

Cheers :) Oh no... That means I'll end up blowing up the real life Tony Stark... #gameishard. Is your homepage tomorrow going to feature the following quote?:

&gt; Kerbal is awesome!  
&gt; -- Elon Musk yep sure enough!

 No You're Awesome too HE PLAYS KERBAL EVERYONE!!! [Squad HQ](http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/terminal05/2012/8/6/2/anigif_enhanced-buzz-9260-1344235778-6.gif) Pretty much. And that's a KSP developer, ladies and gentlemen.

Thanks for making such an awesome game I'm so proud to be punching the same planets Elon Musk is landing on.  All hail the great planet puncher   This is a star studded thread. Elon Musk, KSP Dev, and you, the all-mighty *Puncher of Planets.* He also plays Human Space Program.

^(I hope the next update is good.) HSP 1.999991
Changelog:
Increased base weight of humans to balance difficulty Are they doing a rolling update? Seems the North America server got the update first.  He literally plays Kerbal IRL. Elon... is Jeb? *backs away from the computer* One of us! One of us! ONE OF US!!! This answer will sure make a lot of people over at Squad very happy :) It sure did! Max and I are currently freaking out like girls at a Backstreet Boys show in 1999. I am freaking out so hard right now. And you're one of few people who gets to play it with real rockets!  Yup, SpaceX's FB page just posted that they're doing the weekly challenge and that tomorrow's F9 launch will start upside down I got wayy too excited for the official SpaceX entry to the challenge before I got to the end of your sentence :-P Any chance of an official SpaceX mod for Kerbal Space Program? KSP CM here. So far, an official one is not in the cards, but if we had the opportunity to work with SpaceX on one, we'd do it in a heartbeat. /u/ElonMuskOfficial please make this happen. We have NASA Asteroids, lets now do a SpaceX Duna pack! The mod I'm wanting most for KSP is stowable, functioning grid fins so I can try the landing. Well there's a really good unofficial one - LazTek Used to develop KSP, feels awesome to see it all over the real space industry now. &gt; monster boost stage.

This is how I play Kerbal Space Program. &gt; monster boost stage. In order to support this we will of course have to increase the number of struts.  [When in doubt](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/882991428070104534/B064112896F1F9D55B8A5229B5EC2AE55BD2B4BA/) Europa: attempt no landing there. True or false? There should definitely be a science mission to Europa What daily habit do you believe has the largest positive impact on your life? Showering I do that too!!!! Which way to the space company club? Up. then sideways fast (for an orbit) No one wants to smell his natural Musk. Musk, by Elon. http://i.imgur.com/ZzCf6es.jpg Please start posting to /r/showerthoughts. That would be glorious. *I think I've solved all of the worlds energy problems* Hi Elon.  A friend of mine is all paranoid about the computer singularity, and used your name as a source of his paranoia.  Don't you think it could all be a bunch of hype?

Awesome car/rocket/etc stuff you do!  Huge fan! The timeframe is not immediate, but we should be concerned. There needs to be a lot more work on AI safety.

And, with all due respect to the Roomba dude, that is not a concern
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2HU3LGdbo I'm kind of giddy and star struck, but I'm more completely at a loss that the guy that owns Tesla, the guy that owns a company that is putting a rocket into space tomorrow, just sent me a video of a cat riding a roomba chasing a duck.  What just happened?  I was having the worst day, and now everything seems alright.  Heck yeah! The man even includes a video. Blessed

EDIT: An amazing video, DO watch In your recent [MIT talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOpmaLY9XdI), you mentioned that you didn't think 2^nd stage recovery was possible for the Falcon 9. This is due to low fuel efficiency of kerosene fuel, and the high velocities needed for many payloads (high orbits like Geostationary orbit). However, you also said that full reusability would be possible for the Mars Colonial Transporter launch vehicle.

What have you learned from flights of Falcon 9 that taught you

a) that reuse of its second stage won't be possible and 

b) what you'll need to do differently with MCT to reuse its second stage. Actually, we could make the 2nd stage of Falcon reusable and still have significant payload on Falcon Heavy, but I think our engineering resources are better spent moving on to the Mars system.

MCT will have meaningfully higher specific impulse engines: 380 vs 345 vac Isp. For those unfamiliar, in the rocket world, that is a super gigantic difference for stages of roughly equivalent mass ratio (mass full to mass empty). What kind of mass ratio do your upper stages have? With sub-cooled propellant, I think we can get the Falcon 9 upper stage mass ratio (excluding payload) to somewhere between 25 and 30. Another way of saying that is the upper stage would be close to 97% propellant by mass. Previously, you've stated that you estimate a 50% probability of success with the attempted landing on the automated spaceport drone ship tomorrow.  Can you discuss the factors that were considered to make that estimation?

In addition, can you talk more about the grid fins that will be flying tomorrow? How do they compare to maneuvering with cold-gas thrusters? I pretty much made that up. I have no idea :)

The grid fins are super important for landing with precision. The aerodynamic forces are way too strong for the nitrogen thrusters. In particular, achieving pitch trim is hopeless. Our atmosphere is like molasses at Mach 4! Can you help me with Kerbal Space Program? I'm always happy to help with KSP. Now there's a tough choice: Elon Musk or Scott Manley for KSP lessons. Why not both? A joint session Elon musk VS. Scott Manley in KSP for charity :) Please!!!!  Asking the important questions I've always wanted to play but I'm constantly terrified by the fact that I more than probably suck at building rockets and will only get frustrated.

Also, I'd probably cause the deaths of hundreds of Kerbals... Don't worry, it's hard to build a rocket that can't go up.

/r/kerbalspaceprogram is friendly too. I pretty much made that up , lmao Hi Elon, I currently work for Toyota Tsusho in Fremont doing the wheel assembly for Tesla. I want to let you know how proud I am to be however minutely linked to such a powerful and positively influential company such as yours. Keep doing the good work, sir. You are an inspiration to not only myself but countless others around the world. 

My question: You seem to have had to deal with a tremendous amount of adversity in a few of your ventures. Do you have any advice for those dealing with seemingly insurmountable adversity? 

 There is a great quote by Churchill: "If you're going through hell, keep going." tl;dr: How do you learn so much so fast? Lots of people read books and talk to other smart people, but you've taken it to a whole new level.

It seems you have an extremely proficient understanding of aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, software engineering,  all various subdisciplines (avionics, power electronics, structural engineering, propulsion, energy storage, AI) ETC ETC nearly all things technical.

I know you've read a lot of books and you hire a lot of smart people and soak up what they know, but you have to acknowledge you seem to have found a way to pack more knowledge into your head than nearly anyone else alive. Do you have any advice on learning? How are you so good at it? I do kinda feel like my head is full! My context switching penalty is high and my process isolation is not what it used to be.

Frankly, though, I think most people can learn a lot more than they think they can. They sell themselves short without trying.

One bit of advice: it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree -- make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.

 I see you haven't forgotten your Computer Science roots (trunk?). Hopefully you are still thread safe.  &gt;Hopefully you are still thread safe. 

"Hi, Tesla support? Yeah, so I pushed start on my Model 3 and now I'm in orbit. Am i still covered under warranty?"

Edit: thank you for the gold, kind stranger! May your threads never race and your global state remain minimal. To which they will reply with a how-to guide on returning from orbit by Scott Manley. HULLLOOO!!! There was a really neat post on askreddit some months ago on [how to study/learn based on how memory works.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2b0yf8/good_students_how_do_you_go_about_getting_good/cj0qre2?context=3) It's more tailored to classroom-type learning, but it's got applications to functional learning too. The trick is, he built himself. He's an android that keeps repairing himself. 

Edit: spelling.  So, he is daneel olivaw? Im a teacher, and I always wonder what I can do to help my students achieve big things. Whats something your teachers did for you while you were in school that helped to encourage your ideas and thinking?  Or, if they didn't, what's something they could have done better? thanks!  The best teacher I ever had was my elementary school principal. Our math teacher quit for some reason and he decided to sub in himself for math and accelerate the syllabus by a year.

We had to work like the house was on fire for the first half of the lesson and do extra homework, but then we got to hear stories of when he was a soldier in WWII. If you didn't do the work, you didn't get to hear the stories. Everybody did the work. Thanks for answering! I teach high school astronomy in Orlando, and we always watch your rocket launches and talk about SpaceX. We're big fans. I'll get to work on my storytelling skills.  Alright, I'll keep that in mind the next time I have an opportunity to be a soldier in WWI. start world war III.  profit. Nah, we're into a new century now. Got to start again at 1 This century is all about the reboots. WWI II WWII 2:  WW Harder Hi Elon, I'm already saving up for my Model 3.  Can you share anything about the Model 3 that we don't already know? It won't look like other cars I'm sold! He had me at It [How i Imagine this...](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090908145331/simpsons/images/0/05/TheHomer.png) it better play La Cucaracha too! Hi Elon, I'll leave the technical questions to the experts. 1) do you plan on getting any sleep tonight and 2) how will you celebrate if the test is successful? Best of luck! x Yes, but probably only a few hours

Party at Cocoa Beach!  Elon got the club going up 

on a Tuesday Got your falcon on the ship and she choosay Rocket goin, up Follow-up question: How much do you sleep per night, on average?  I actually measured this with my phone! Almost exactly 6 hours on average.  Hey, I hope you know that it is medically recommended that you get 7-8 hours of sleep **minimum**. If you don't, you won't become an^extremely^successful^billionaire 6 hrs of sleep --&gt; billionaire

brb sleeping for 6 hours

*edit:* where do I get my money? Did it work? 5.5 hours left bro.  We're impatient okay. Well it's definitely reassuring to know that he sleeps, just like rest of us. Or so he would like us to believe... But do you think he poops or pees? Nope. And he does not have a butthole; he has no need for one. He works so hard, he burns off energy from the inside. but he *CAN* talk to dolphins, right? Would you ever consider becoming a politician?  Unlikely Im still going to nominate you for King of Mars [So Elon?](https://i.imgur.com/65YR89H.png) That's unsettling.  There's coincidences and then there's just weird. I had to go check if he was born Elon. Apparently he was. The plot thickens... maybe his parents were von braun fans and tried to push him in this direction? NO! von Braun prophesied the King of Mars!

Edit: van - von http://imgur.com/2Iw5QAY All hail the King of Mars! Wait... where is this from? Dr. [Wernher von Braun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun) himself in [The Mars Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mars_Project).

It seems Wernher von Braun chose Elon to be the champion and he is rising to the challenge. /r/synchronicities.

That one is out there. You are an early investor in AI startups like DeepMind and Vicarious. What was the most amazing demonstration of an AI capabilities you have seen so far?  This question probably breaks certain agreements sadly If this doesn't get answered, someone else in the field should give their response... In case no one else is answering this, I can at least provide some thoughts.

Recent advances in image recognition, specifically scene parsing and labeling, is very impressive. If you check out what Google is doing with intelligently labeling scenes http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2014/11/a-picture-is-worth-thousand-coherent.html and http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/ you can see how deep learning has helped image recognition come a long way. Has the Raptor engine changed in its target thrust since the last number we have officially heard of 1.55Mlbf SL thrust?

EDIT: Thanks for the gold!! Thrust to weight is optimizing for a surprisingly low thrust level, even when accounting for the added mass of plumbing and structure for many engines. Looks like a little over 230 metric tons (~500 klbf) of thrust per engine, but we will have a lot of them :) Hi Elon! **I'm asking three questions on behalf of the nearly 20,000-strong fan community /r/SpaceX**. We consider these the best questions we'd like you to answer for us (trust me, there were hundreds more), so a response to each would be much appreciated!

1. Falcon Heavy. Some have speculated that at stage separation the Falcon Heavy center core is too far downrange and travelling too fast to be feasibly returned to the launch site. Could you go into some detail on whether you plan to use barge landings permanently for this core, expend it depending on the mission, or take the payload loss and boost back to the launch site?

2. Mars. Could you please clarify what the Mars Colonial Transporter *actually* is? Is it a crew module like Dragon, a launch vehicle like Falcon, or a mix of both? Does it have inflatable components? Is MCT just a codename?

3. Spacesuits. How does SpaceX plan to address the limitations and contribute to the advancement of current spacesuit technology to best serve humans enroute and on the surface of Mars? You mentioned in 2013 that there'd be an update to SpaceX's "spacesuit project" soon - how is it coming along?

Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA! Also at some point, /r/SpaceX would love to have an AMA with someone such as Gwynne Shotwell, Steve Jurvetson, Hans Koenigsmann, or even yourself - so if we could organize something for the future that would be great! And finally, just in case your work and this AMA hasn't already made you aware, you're launching Falcon 9 in less than 12 hours (the 19th SpaceX launch &amp; 14th F9 launch no less!), so here's a [countdown clock](http://spacexstats.com/mission.php?launch=19) &amp; [website](http://spacexstats.com) I built for you. Best of luck with Dragon &amp; the landing! Regards, Lukas. 
 1. Yes, the Falcon Heavy center core is seriously hauling a** at stage separation. We can bring it back to the launch site, but the boost back penalty is significant. If we also have to the plane change for geo missions from Cape inclination (28.5 deg) to equatorial, then a downrange platform landing is needed.

2. The Mars transport system will be a completely new architecture. Am hoping to present that towards the end of this year. Good thing we didn't do it sooner, as we have learned a huge amount from Falcon and Dragon.

3. Our spacesuit design is finally coming together and will also be unveiled later this year. We are putting a lot of effort into design esthetics, not just utility. It needs to both look like a 21st century spacesuit and work well. Really difficult to achieve both.

 &gt;We are putting a lot of effort into design esthetics, not just utility

im glad we have top men ensuring the future is sexy Top. Men. What will aliens think of us if we aren't fashionable?! Way to go, /r/spacex. Thanks Elon. This is a real AMA... Fuck OkCupid. &gt; The Mars transport system will be a completely new architecture. **Am hoping to present that towards the end of this year.** Good thing we didn't do it sooner, as we have learned a huge amount from Falcon and Dragon.

Wow... I think my brain might be leaking out of my ears right now. This AMA has already exceeded my wildest expectations. So much new info. You can curse on the Internet, Elon. Poppycock! Balderdash! Aren't these the spacesuits where one of the specifications was that they must be "badass?" &gt; bada**

FTFY Hi Elon! Huge fan of yours.

Have you heard of/played [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/)?

Also do you see SpaceX working with Squad (the people behind KSP) to integrate SpaceX parts into KSP? &gt; Have you played Kerbal Space Program?

What do you think SpaceX uses for testing software? Kerbal Space Program! Have you seen the Spacex modpack? http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29388-LazTek-SpaceX-Launch-3-1a-Exploration-2-1a-and-Historic-1-1a-packs-24-2-%289-10-14%29 I am not surprised by this. Plot twist, rage quit.

Decided to launch a real rocket instead. *"Fuck this bullshit game! I'm rich, I'll build a real motherfucking rocket and show those little green assholes! I'm going the fuck to MARS!"*

We later discover that Tesla exists because Mr. Musk got his ass kicked at *Gran Turismo* a few years back. Let's just hope nobody kicks his ass in Left For Dead or Resident Evil. Damn. When I rage quit, all that comes of it is a broken keyboard. I imagine you give your engineers KSP .craft files and tell them to Make It So "Sir, this is just a pile of decouplers and boosters taped together"

"Yeah?  Well I made it to Eve AND BACK with that sucker!  Start taping!" "And Besides- It works in Kerbal Space Program."

XKCD #1244 &gt;Have you played Kerbal Space Program?

I imagine he's probably too busy playing Actual Space Program Yeah I'd love to play ASP but it's just way to expensive to get into plus the lack of time warp makes it really time consuming to play. Wait for a Steam Sale, man Hello Elon, **HUGE HUGE** fan here!! Question about the Mars Colonial Transporter:

There has been a lot of speculation over comments about exactly how much mass you are hoping to send to the Martian surface with the MCT. Can you tell us how much cargo you would like to be able to land on Mars with MCT, not including the mass of the MCT itself? Goal is 100 metric tons of useful payload to the surface of Mars. This obviously requires a very big spaceship and booster system. /r/SpaceX denizens, do your math now please! We're getting enough new numbers here for a dozen new discussion posts full of math :) *rubs greasy math hands together*

e: *rubs greasy hey-if-anyone-has-some-good-speculation-as-to-MCT-mass-ratios-they-should-tell-me-but-otherwise-I'll-just-guess math hands together* ~400 tons to leo for chemical propulsion to mars! HUGE! Electric propulsion may be used though... (Vasimir?)

EDIT: Assuming they do use chemical propulsion, and my guesstimate of 4x LEO payload to mars surface payload ratio is correct, then with a 5% payload to leo ratio for the booster (another reasonably good guess), the booster rocket to LEO will be **8 THOUSAND TONS** on the pad. Emily Shanklin indicated in late 2013 that the Raptor would be the first of a "family of engines" designed for the exploration and colonization of Mars. Could you elaborate on her wording, i.e. was she simply referring to a vacuum version and standard version, or do you plan on building multiple methane-based engines with significantly different thrust and size specifications? Default plan is to have a sea level and vacuum version of Raptor, much like Merlin. Since the booster and spaceship will both have multiple engines, we don't have to have fundamentally different designs. 

This plan might change. **TL;DR: What needs to happen to grow SpaceX to the point where you can afford to enable the colonization of Mars?**

Even [Mars Direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Direct), which would only involve temporary stays on Mars rather than colonization, would cost ~$1.5B/year. SpaceX is worth &lt;$10 billion as a company, and the launch industry is only a [~$6B/year industry](http://www.sia.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SIA_2014_SSIR.pdf). Growing SpaceX's profit margin by a couple orders of magnitude will [be difficult](http://imgur.com/B5vqqfw) due to [low market elasticity](http://i.imgur.com/TMxypBL); you're betting Mars (the fate of the human race) that lowering launch prices will trigger a large increase in demand, allowing SpaceX to grow.

* Given that the only growth and market elasticity seems to be in the small satellite and CubeSat launch industry, why did you cancel Falcon 1 after only 2 successful launches?

* How specifically do you intend to increase SpaceX launch revenue by orders of magnitude?

* Will cheap/reusable launches have a similar profit margin, or will profits/launch fall?

* Is the [SpaceX WorldVu partnership](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2014/11/12/spacex-is-entering-the-micro-satellites-game/) an attempt to grow the satellite industry, or for SpaceX to branch out into a more lucrative industry? (The satellite industry is a ~$200B/year industry)

* What other approaches (by SpaceX or others) might grow the industry by orders of magnitude? Design life of Merlin 1D has been mentioned to be 40 cycles. Could you expand on what a cycle is? Is it just a start of the engine? There is no meaningful limit. We would have to replace a few parts that experience thermal stress after 40 cycles, but the rest of the engine would be fine. Is a cycle a firing? i think a cycle is starting the engine (and obviously turning it off at some point)

what mr. musk said about thermal stress happens when parts heat/cool unevenly (a part must heat up first in order to cool down, and it must cool down in order to cool unevenly and create stress) so yes firing the engine counts as a cycle.

 edit: in theory i guess if you never turned it off you would never get thermal stress, but you would have a host of other, more difficult issues to deal with (thus being theoretical) in order to get it running for that long (fuel and heat management), and keep it running for that long. (And it would still be 1 cycle)

 How do you find time to play video games? He's probably hiding time travel from us. Only so much he can reveal every year... :| it's actually not *technically* time travel:

the dude's got a hyperbolic time chamber, y'all.

next up, senzu beans, i'm sure of it He plays video games all day and then does all the urgent work in the last hour. Wow.. I'm going to turn out to be an astronaut  Elon, are you trying to find Prothean ruins by chance? Hell yeah Fallout. tl;dr: What spurred the AI concerns over recent months?

As specifically as you can get away with, what spurred you to start sharing your strong concerns about general AI over the last year to 18 months? Prior to that time window you had never made public remarks on the subject and obviously something got you thinking about it. Was it Deepmind's game-playing algorithm? As interesting as the space-related stuff is, this is exactly the topic I'd like to know more about.  The concerns were pretty serious, so, yes -- what galvanised them, I wonder... [deleted] Good school Hi Elon, on behalf of /r/SelfDrivingCars

- You've previously stated that self-driving cars will be ready in "[Five or Six years from now](http://www.cnet.com/news/elon-musk-sees-autonomous-cars-ready-sooner-than-previously-thought/)". Could you expand on how you see events playing out between now and then?
- If you could regulate or deregulate any aspect of the US economy, how would you change the rules to encourage the commercialization of self-driving cars as fast as possible?
- Will self-driving cars be owned by individuals, or mainly used as shared fleets of robo-taxis?

Thanks so much for everything you do! Hi Elon! The hyperloop was an interesting idea that sort of came out of the blue last year. Do you have any other projects like that just kicking around in your head? Do you plan to follow up on any of them? Yes, he has talked about electric, supersonic, vertical take off and landing jets. He thinks that once batteries reach an energy density of 400 wh/kg, it will be feasible to have a range of 2000-3000 miles.

He's also talked about making pre-fabricated freeway sections to speed up construction on the 405. (he has to sit through the traffic there almost every day). I don't know if I could handle being rich enough to have a freeway built because I'm sick of traffic.. I'd be like Zoidberg on double turkey thanksgiving. Hello Mr. Musk, 
I sold you a pair of hiking boots at the Sports Authority Elite in Corte Madera. I just wanted to know how your walk through the forest (as you described it) went? Also did you like the boots? Yeah, they were great Awesome! Glad you enjoyed them! He didn't even use a period, he must have hated those hiking boots.  They were the only good hiking boots we had in his size, so he really didn't have much choice. your boss just read your first comment and was ready to promote you, and then read this and slammed his fist on the table. Good thing I don't work there anymore. He fired you that quick over a Reddit comment? Shit man, times are tough I left back in September to go to school. No firing.  Holy shit, your boss is an oracle? You set yourself ready for posting that comment without taking any risk. Clever horse. You do realize this isn't Gone Wild, right? Or were you hoping to see Elon GW? I thought I could convince him to take his pants off ayy lmao (   o) Excuse me sir, but your eye seems to be falling out. Happy Cakeday! But your new boss is Elon Musk.  not with that attitude  Now you are gainfully employed as a table repairman. No he means your current boss Well I'm unemployed so... I'm my own boss? Dammit awests. Well not anymore...  At least you can rub it in his face that you sold boots to Elon Musk.  I wonder why Thug Life. The fact that billionaires have to deal with such "normal" problems as 'we don't have anything in your size' is comforting What brand?? I believe they were Merrel Moab's Hey those are decent. Merrel Moab ventilators are what I recommend to older customers who want a lot of cushion and aren't getting into anything serious. 

Musk is a casual!  What kind? I'm going to be "hiking Elon Musk" for halloween. But there's an REI in the same shopping centre! I'm actually surprised he didn't go there. They have a much larger selection.  Size please? Tomorrow on Buzzfeed: *Top Ten Boots That Aren't In Elon Musk's Size!* What size are Elon's feet? The world must know. Is it 42? I'm sorry /u/awests, he probably didn't like the hiking boots too much, but good effort! How big were they? Does he have enormous boat feet or dainty ballerina feet? What size?!?! Well, he did take the time to answer, so he also must have appreciated them. What boot size is Elon Musk? DUDE...what size?!?  The world is dying to know! Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces... so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless... a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches... my heart aches... but my feet ... my feet are resilient! Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES! 
 boots were so good, he started walkin' before finishing the sentence I took it as "I can't believe this DoucheTard is telling the world what I go out and buy in my personal life, what's next, the cashier at the grocery store asking how my preparation h was?" i really feel like the lacking punctuation implies sarcasm As an English teacher, I heartily approve of your comment.  Your comment is great  I can't believe he would buy hiking boots from a Sports Authority. I can't even imagine the blisters he must have gotten. Why would you say that? Merrell is a very reputable brand for outdoor footwear. No it isn't. Merrel is junk.  Merrel Welderness is great boots If Victoria was assisting him, there would have been a *rolls eyes* appended at the end of his response. Wait who is Victoria? /u/chooter.  An admin that helps with a lot of AMAs.   ohhh that victoria! dur LOL It's a lot better if you read it as heavy sarcasm. There ain't gon'be no rounds! Leaving it open ended like that has to imply something, right? Right?? He was trying to sound nice Does Elon have little feet? Yeah, they were great...

Better none than three! Punctuation is a waste of his time Ceos are too busy for punctuation.  At least they should be.   It would be worse to use too many periods.

&gt;Yeah, they were... great... Lack of punctuation is pure evil. Punctuation is pure evil. WHEN WILL YOU DECIDE!? Victoria didn't :/ That post was almost as soaked in sarcasm as the boots. I'm surprised he didn't pick up on it.  Yea that was so sarcastic Hey I went there today were you working?

Now just to wait for him to return from school Unfortunately I left at the end of September to go to school. Come over to The Cheesecake Factory and say hi! I read his comment in a sarcastic tone. sounds like sarcasm..... He hikes! *swoon* That easy huh? ^^^It's ^^^the ^^^money He's a genius billionaire, swoon.  Through a Forrest. If I think real hard, I can remember my first pair of hiking boots, mama said they'd take me anywhere. Time to recruit for /r/hiking Can... Can I grow up to be Elon Musk? how great on the scale of 1 to Elon Musk? Could you suck his dick any harder? You probably could. Yeah but on a scale of 1 to Elon Musk... how hard? It'd be pretty musky.  It's a musk-see.  Texas. Elon Musk *how great on the scale of Tony Stark to Elon Musk? And then Elon Musk would probably invent some kind of mini HyperLoop electric-powered dick-sucking apparatus.
 Where's the [waiting list](http://www.teslamotors.com/forum/forums/model-3-waiting-list) for this? Easily a Carl Sagan.  With rice? The sarcasm is out of this world!  The way you say he asked about the boots sounds like the plot of some movie, awests.

TIL: Elon Musk killed a man, and got some unrecognisable boots to bury the body in the woods. You seem pretty down to Earth for someone so interested in that whole space thing. I can hook you up with 10% off Merrells if you're ever in PA...

Yeah right... I really want to know where you went hiking! Mt. Tam? Phoenix Lake? 3000 karma for this, the man might as well walk on water That reminds me of what I used to say to my ex wife after a bj.  Yeah, it was great hun What is this? Is there no concept of Boot Salesman-Client Confidentiality? Why does this question have so many upvotes? I actually have no idea. It's because it's so perfectly mundane. In a thread full of talk of spaceships and electric cars, a single post about a pair of boots stands out. Yeah. It's an AMA, not "ask me anything about space and shit only" type of thing.

It's always nice when one of these questions pops up, IMO. It's done in every major AMA, though.  The joke gets old. possibly because it's a person who's met Elon Musk IRL?  Because it's unexpected and random. Reddit likes funny shit like that. I was getting my hair cut the other day and my barber was telling me about how Steve Ballmer would come in to get his hair cut every few months, and how he was just a normal person like everyone else. Amidst the hype we put around people (admittedly much moreso for actors and musicians) we sometimes lose sight of the fact that they're just normal people who do normal things, like buy hiking boots or get haircuts. I'm sure that those people enjoy talking about something mundane every now and again. Probably because Elon answered it so it gets an auto up vote from lots of people. I'm with you though! I'm assuming because he replied. Because it really goes with the "anything" category.  It's some real hometown, Main Street, celebrities buy shoes just like us appeal. Because it truly embraces the spirit of the phrase "ask me anything" and goes against the questions one would expect to be asked when we have someone as important as Elon Musk here. paid Because of absurdity. Because reddit Why does this question have so many upvotes? Not sure. Same reason people bother celebs when they walk down the street. Just another person... Imagine Elon Musk coming to you and asking you what you thought the best pair of hiking boots for a walk through the forest? To then nervously recommend one and forever live your days wondering if you made the right choice. Did he enjoy that trek? Were his soles protected and comfortable? Thanks to Reddit, we can erase those lifelong doubts, and so it was done.  lol so randum ^_^ I am with you 100%. Idiots.  Hey, I live in San Rafael; howdy, neighbor! What kind of boots were they? Also, could you recommend a parka? They were Merrell Moab's. Unfortunately I cannot. I only worked at the store during the summer months, so I have no experience with winter gear. Just go into the store and someone should come up and ask you what you are looking for. PM if you want more detail. I'm from Corte Madera! I live in Corte Madera!

 What kind of boots did he end up getting?  Merrell Moabs My God... I work at a Merrell Store and this is my Legit day dream... You lived my dream sir... As sad as it was it was my dream... 

What kind of shoe did he buy? It was a Merrell Moab! Size 13 if I remember correctly. Hoping gore-tex and not the m select... I believe they were the gore-tex version. AHHHH COME ON. That could have been me!!!

Good recomendation too! Moab is an awesome shoe. Also me an Elon wear the same shoe size... I also sold him a pair of thorlo hiking socks! Ata boy As a long-term shoe salesman I have to give you internet dap for selling a pair of boots to one of my favorite people. We have to know the official Elon Musk hiking boots now!

Would be interesting to hear your daily routine. Unofficial Elon Musk here. So this is what I do outside of work.  
1am: Wake up telecommute to my curling team practice in Nova Scotia   
2am: Then I feed and give water to my Tamagotchi which is now 20 years old. It takes me an hour because  I often talk to and run new business ideas by my Tamagotchi for advice  
3am: I eat-well eat isn't the right word-I consume my first breakfast of dehydrated space food.  
4-6am: Pop up to the space station to rough up and collect protection money from all the astronauts. They need strong protection from all the space pirates.   
6am: Swim a marathon ending in the an Amazonian swamps and get ACTUALLY eaten alive by an anaconda.  
7am-11am: Summon the ghost of Genghis Khan for advice (and to play checkers)  
11am: Obama calls me on skype and asks me for advice. I always just tell him what my Tamagotchi says(they get very wise after 20 years)  
12pm: Go to In&amp;Out for lunch and get a 10x10  
1-4pm: Food coma  
4pm: Read Cosmo  
5pm: Badminton Game with Mark Zuckerberg (I always win by a landslide, but he insists on playing)  
6pm: Go shopping for my daily parachute pants  
7pm: Go on a dinner date with my Tesla's operating system  
8pm: Moonlight at my second job at Chipotle  
9pm: Pogo stick for an hour. I'm getting pretty good. Last week I got 6 in a row!  
10pm: Poop. I'm very regular  
11pm: Cram in all my work super last minute like a pro  
12am: Blink once to fulfill my primitive body's need for sleep

I'm graduating in June of this year from Tesla STEM High School in Redmond, Washington. A good number of students have been tossing around the idea of asking you to come and do our commencement speech, since this will be the first year at the school with a graduating class. We're all inspired by the way you've pushed the envelope and it would mean the world to all of us if you came and spoke. Even if this is a moonshot (of which I am sure you are capable), would you mind coming and doing the commencement speech for our first graduating class? Ask him again on Twitter! Too the top!!

[Hi Elon! I'm asking three questions on behalf of the nearly 20,000-strong fan community /r/SpaceX. We consider these the best questions we'd like you to answer for us (trust me, there were hundreds more), so a response to each would be much appreciated! *1.* Falcon Heavy. Some have speculated that at stage separation the Falcon Heavy center core is too far downrange and travelling too fast to be feasibly returned to the launch site. Could you go into some detail on whether you plan to use barge landings permanently for this core, expend it depending on the mission, or take the payload loss and boost back to the launch site? *2.* Mars. Could you please clarify what the Mars Colonial Transporter actually is? Is it a crew module like Dragon, a launch vehicle like Falcon, or a mix of both? Does it have inflatable components? Is MCT just a codename? *3.* Spacesuits. How does SpaceX plan to address the limitations and contribute to the advancement of current spacesuit technology to best serve humans enroute and on the surface of Mars? You mentioned in 2013 that there'd be an update to SpaceX's "spacesuit project" soon - how is it coming along? Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA! Also at some point, /r/SpaceX would love to have an AMA with someone such as Gwynne Shotwell, Steve Jurvetson, Hans Koenigsmann, or even yourself - so if we could organize something for the future that would be great! And finally, just in case your work and this AMA hasn't already made you aware, you're launching Falcon 9 in less than 12 hours (the 19th SpaceX launch &amp; 14th F9 launch no less!), so here's a countdown clock  &amp; website  I built for you. Best of luck with Dragon &amp; the landing! Regards, Lukas.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/cnfpolr) | [**1.** Yes, the Falcon Heavy center core is seriously hauling a** at stage separation. We can bring it back to the launch site, but the boost back penalty is significant. If we also have to the plane change for geo missions from Cape inclination (28.5 deg) to equatorial, then a downrange platform landing is needed. **2.** The Mars transport system will be a completely new architecture. Am hoping to present that towards the end of this year. Good thing we didn't do it sooner, as we have learned a huge amount from Falcon and Dragon. **3.**Our spacesuit design is finally coming together and will also be unveiled later this year. We are putting a lot of effort into design esthetics, not just utility. It needs to both look like a 21st century spacesuit and work well.

 As I understand it, his life has become his work.  Family and hobbies have all but disappeared.

Personally I choose parents but I respect the man for his pushes in the advancement of space exploration etc.  I hope his family understands the sacrifices he has chosen to make. Hi Elon,

Although you asked for the AMA to be focused on the SpaceX launch, the Tesla fanbase has some questions that are yet to be answered. Although I have a lot of questions, I limited myself to 4 brief questions:

1.  How significant is Tesla's technology in the battery cell and pack? (some believe that Tesla just spot welds Panasonic 18650 cells and wraps it into a pack, which means that any other company can partner with Panasonic and make similar batteries)

2. Assuming that external market conditions are not prohibitive, what automobile strategy would you prefer Tesla Motors to follow in order to achieve the stated goal of electrifying the car market:
	* A. Mass market auto manufacturer (Toyota)
	* B. Premium Auto manufacturer (BMW), developer and manufacturer of electric drive trains for other automobile companies
	* C. Premium Auto manufacturer (BMW), developer of electric drive trains, licensing this 	technology to other auto manufacturers.

The next two questions will be Tesla investor related, since analysts sometimes ask the wrong questions during quarterly calls:

3. While the Gigafactory is supposed to cut battery costs by 30% before the Model 3 is released in 2017, how much further will Tesla cut battery costs by 2020?

4. What operating margin does Tesla aim for in the 2020 time frame, when Tesla will be producing 500,000 vehicles per year?


**EDIT:** If you cannot answer any Tesla investor specific questions, could you at least answer the first two? Also, I saw another question I liked: When are you going to do a blog post that compares well-to-wheels carbon emissions of electric battery cars, gasoline cars, and fuel cell cars?
 sad he didn't answer this one. :( They weren't "brief" questions. Let's keep it focused on SpaceX, people. &gt; I am Elon Musk, CEO/CTO of a rocket company, **AMA**!

Apparently the definition of "anything" changed while I was away. My understanding about their battery technology is that currently they use off-the-shelf cells, and their technology is all in the charging and power management equipment and software.

Or put another way - while any SSD manufacturer can buy the same NAND from various vendors, but what separates them is the chipset and firmware. nice way of putting this &gt; Tesla

In relation to your LCA question about emissions from different types of vehicles, there are several studies out there that address that concern. They do not use a Tesla vehicle, but still manage to convey the same point. A paper published by Troy Hawkins in the Journal of Industrial Ecology had received a good deal of attention as of late [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00532.x/abstract].

On a side note, (and maybe a little self promotion) I am part of a research team that is addressing this concern through the use of LCA. We are seeking to understand the consequential carbon implications from the deployment of EVs (specifically Tesla's) and their charging infrastructure. We too compare the relative emissions from various vehicles in our final calculation. We hope to be submitted for publication in the next few months. Wish us luck! Great questions. I would be very interested to know the status of the Gigafactory. 

I would also be interested to know Mr.Musk's thoughts on high-speed rail/monorail/magalev and ways in which the public might lobby for more use of them in the US. Excellent post  Shame this wasn't answered. Maybe he will return another day.  Hi Bill, my question: Is there anything in life that you regret doing or not doing?  I feel pretty stupid that I don't know any foreign languages. I took Latin and Greek in High School and got A's and I guess it helps my vocabulary but I wish I knew French or Arabic or Chinese. I keep hoping to get time to study one of these - probably French because it is the easiest. I did [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) for awhile but didn't keep it up. Mark Zuckerberg amazingly learned Mandarin and did a Q&amp;A with Chinese students - incredible. Link for Mark's Q&amp;A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGHKCnbbZJ4 the crowd reactions make that video pretty great, you can hear how shocked they were that he could speak any Mandarin at all Just to add: They cheer because he is speaking Chinese, not because he is speaking Chinese well.

They are happy that he actually tried learning their language. According to some people who were there and several Chinese friends, they couldn't understand half of what he's saying. Chinese guy here.

His Mandarin is heavily accented, but I found it kind of endearing. I took Latin in high school too! Did you use the "Ecce Romani" textbook? My teacher always said the only good language is a dead language. Etiam in pictura est villa rustica ubi Cornelia aestate habitat. Cornelia iam sub arbore sedet et legit.


I can't believe I still remember that.

Or who can forget how long that damn carriage was stuck in a ditch



edit: I love all the Latin responses I'm getting. I haven't tried to translate this much latin in like 8 years Yes, that stupid carriage! And cowardly Sextus stuck in the tree.. I always thought Marcus was kind of a douche.   
  
Also, I just tried composing a response in Latin but all I could do was remember -bam -bas -bat -bamus -batis -bant... flavia is a whore What do you think has improved life the most in poor countries in the last 5 years? Vaccines make the top of the list. Being able to grow up healthy is the most basic thing. So many kids get infectious diseases and don't develop mentally and physically. I was in Berlin yesterday helping raise $7.5B for vaccines for kids in poor countries. We barely made it but we did which is so exciting to me! Reading things like that, I find it very disappointing that people here in the United States choose to not vaccinate their children. Today I learned that my current state is among the most vaccinated in the US. Kansas may be ass backward in many regards, but at least we aren't dying from it. 

Source: http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/02/vaccine-exemptions-states-pertussis-map Kansas is a pretty conservative state, politically, and the anti-vaxxer movement is more of a liberal phenomenon. As a liberal myself, it's really annoying, because it's basically our version of climate change denial and makes it hard to make accusations of the right being anti-science when the left is terrified of vaccines and GMOs.

Edit: Please stop telling me it's also a conservative thing. I didn't expect this comment to get 1000+ karma, I've received about 50 replies pointing out how stupid and wrong I am, and I honestly don't care. I think the effectiveness of immunizations are partially responsible for their own undoing. They're so effective that for a time they had eradicated many childhood diseases that were common in the 50's and early 60's. When I was growing up in the 80's and 90's, I would read books with characters that had the measels, for instance, but to me 'measels' was merely a word. I've never had measels or even seen someone afflicted with it. Same with Whooping Cough, rubella, polio, mumps, etc. Those diseases didn't exist in my world. I only met one polio survivor in my entire life, and he was a very old man in a wheelchair. 

So it's hard for GenXers and Millenials like me to truly grasp the threat those diseases present. Because we never spent any of our time worried about them, they're not a threat. In the vast majority of cases, if we don't get a vaccine and don't vaccinate our kids, nothing happens.

Essentially, because my generation didn't grow up with the diseases we're now immunized against, it's difficult for us to judge based on our own personal experience the danger these diseases present. Our forebearers' had direct experience and thus to them the vaccines were a godsend. Hello Mr. Gates,

2015 will mark the 30th anniversary of Microsoft Windows. What do you think the next 30 years holds in terms of technology? What will personal computing will look like in 2045? There will be more progress in the next 30 years than ever. Even in the next 10 problems like vision and speech understanding and translation will be very good. Mechanical robot tasks like picking fruit or moving a hospital patient will be solved. Once computers/robots get to a level of capability where seeing and moving is easy for them then they will be used very extensively.

One project I am working on with Microsoft is the Personal Agent which will remember everything and help you go back and find things and help you pick what things to pay attention to. The idea that you have to find applications and pick them and they each are trying to tell you what is new is just not the efficient model - the agent will help solve this. It will work across all your devices. Is it a paperclip? Its probably Cortana. Cortana in Win10 already has some [clippy](http://i.imgur.com/OcLg9Ox.png) [easter eggs](http://i.imgur.com/sieyqBQ.png) "Clippy taught me how important it is to listen." I love this. Of course, how well *she* learned this is debatable. MS needs to release the MCC on PC so we can make a mod that replaces cortana with Clippy in the games I see you're trying to destroy an ancient Forerunner weapon capable of destroying all life. Would you like some help with that? Clippy 2.0? I would probably be a researcher on AI. When I started Microsoft I was worried I would miss the chance to do basic work in that field. Ah I think this was aimed at the one about what he'd do if Microsoft hadn't worked. Seeing as Microsoft was his third software company and the first two did fail, I suspect he would have started a fourth software company. Bill Gates making technical errors puts my mind at ease.  billgates.exe has stopped responding and must be shut down. [It looks like you replied to the wrong question. Would you like help?](http://i.imgur.com/72MGtuv.jpg) Although you are a billionaire, do you sometimes buy generic products over brand-name ones? If so, what are the products you buy? I am pretty basic when it comes to clothes and food. My big splurge is having a plane to fly around in.

Bill Burr got it right. Paraphrasing: "You see all this rappers and pop stars buying 25 cars and a ferris wheel in their mansion with the money they got on the royalties from their first song. On the other side you have Bill Gates being one of the richest guys in the planet dressing as if he owned a shoe store. That's how he keeps himself rich." Though, let's be real, that's not how he keeps himself rich.  He could own a ferris wheel and 25 cars and not even know it.  It's how he keeps himself HUMAN.

Obligatory Edit: My highest comment on Reddit is about how great it is to make your way in a capitalist society and altruistically pledge your life toward the greater good.  I'd give my soul for my life to have such a legacy as my Reddit account. "Melinda, is this your ferris wheel in the foyer?"
"I thought it was yours, Bill."
"I don't... I don't remember buying a Ferris wheel though." I think Neil Degrasse Tyson did the math, and said if you're an average person and you see a penny and won't pick it up because it isn't worth your time but will pick up a nickle, how much money would there have to be lying on the ground for Bill Gates (if you keep the ratio of 1-penny to average income) it has to be something like $48,000.  if that makes any sense

edit: Now with video upgrades https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pryRLUt3yG4

Edit 2: people it's just a thought exercise to show how much money he has, not a prediction on whether or not bill gates would pick up money in real life. clearly anyone is going to pick up money they find on the ground.  I apologize in advance for the circlejerk-and-ForwardsFromGrandma, but this pic might be worth taking a look -

What do you think about life-extending and immortality research?  It seems pretty egocentric while we still have malaria and TB for rich people to fund things so they can live longer. It would be nice to live longer though I admit. Are you going to put yourself in a casino basement, and become a talking computer? Will he recruit an army of Securitrons too? HOLY SHIT HOW COULD WE NOT SEE THIS?! Bill Gates ***IS*** Mr. House "If that implies a nuclear holocaust, I'd rather not." Bill gates has one thing on his bucket list "not to die" . I've told my family that if I do die, I want my tombstone to say "My only regret is that I died." Live forever, or die trying.  "if" Hasn't happened yet... so so far so good. My only regret is that i have bone-itis Hello, Bill. As for the Reddit 's Secret Santa we know what present you've given this year. But we don't know what gift YOU have received from your Secret Santa. Can you tell us? It is quite a coincidence but my gift arrived this morning. I got three cool things - a great quilt that a group of people did with a Snoo on it. A great jug of maple syrup and the book The Promise of a Pencil. All very thoughtful. Last year I waited and nothing came. 

**EDIT:** More to come soon: http://i.imgur.com/pg8ZbLQ.jpg
&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT 2:** Reddit just let me know that I did get a gift last year: a generous donation to [Heifer International](http://www.heifer.org/), a great non-profit that helps fight poverty and hunger around the world. So, thank you /u/SailorKingCobra, my Secret Santa! Talk about an intimidating Secret Santa partner.  Redefines the question "What do you buy for the guy who already has everything?" A MacBook. In past AMA's he said he has owned every Apple product.  I was the one that had the pleasure and the honour of making your quilt when your secret santa called out asking for suggestions. You can actually find the [Making Of](http://imgur.com/a/TEQJF) of your quilt in an album that I made, documenting it - us silly quilters liking to document our creations - for /r/quilting. I am really glad you got it and I hope that you break it out now and then when you need a nice oversized lap blanket! Feel free to machine wash it, it can take it! If you ever want another, just message me. I love making them for folks. That quilt is amazing! 

Another awesome thing - it looks like your Santa last year sent several donations to Heifer International in your name which is probably why you didn't see a parcel arrive.

Edit: You can see /u/sillygirlsarah's (the quilt creator) comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tzjp7/hi_reddit_im_bill_gates_and_im_back_for_my_third/co3x6zg) with a link to see the very cool [making of the quilt](http://imgur.com/a/TEQJF). Plus. Cat! Heifer International was probably wondering why there was a 25$ donation in Bill Gates' name. "Billionaire my *ass*, John, look at this! Bill Gates gave us $25! Did he forget some zeroes or something? Sheeeeit." that cheap bastard, wait till we tell our friends at bingo Thank you :D I spent a good week non stop making it for /u/bfarnsey to give to Bill! I was worried it didn't make it but it did! And now those that ripped into the Santa feel like a dick. What kind of person would get matched to give Bill Gates a gift and not take that opportunity?! A simple card even...

You know, with full name, address and phone number in case he needs a friend to throw money at? (even though he gives away a lot as it is) "Omg, how did my paypal information end up in there? Craziness." Along with these adoption papers...silly me "I don't remember putting that on my resume at all!" I wonder if they didn't see the name and assume it was someone lying just to get a free gift? Still could have at least sent a card or something though. That's just not right! Honestly I find it somewhat endearing that even the best of us can get internet-snubbed sometimes. Makes me feel sympathy even for Lord DOS Bill is one of us! DOS attack. Denial of Secret Santa. What did he give? This awesome thing: A Loki Helmet (looks like it's made of gold, though I may be wrong). http://redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/omg-omg-omg-17/ Reminds me of the episode when Mr. Burns gets Homer a "reward" for saving his life.

[That's the biggest one of those I've ever seen!](http://capricorncity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Olmec-Head-The-Simpsons.jpg) A Windows 8 For Dummies book. Hello Mr. Gates, I admire the work you've done to eradicate diseases such as polio from the world. What can we do as citizens to help keep these diseases gone for good? Polio eradication is a big focus for me. Our last case in Africa was 6 months ago and we are hoping no more show up. It takes over a year to be sure. We still have cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Until we get rid of it there it can spread back to other countries. Pakistan is starting to take this seriously including the army and the government. They need to do the same things that were done in Nigeria. The Taliban makes it very difficult. They have killed women going to vaccinate kids many times.

 no known case of polio on the whole continent of africa in the last 6 months? 

That's amazing!

Keep up the good work! The world needs more people like you and your wife. This is a great chance to piggyback on Mr. Gates' comment to talk about about a cause near and dear to my heart. 

Polio is a horrific disease that literally kills or paralyzes little kids. We've all seen the [images](http://newtelegraphonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/polio-victims.jpg) of [crippled](http://socioecohistory.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/indian-boy-with-polio.jpg) [children](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140305152904-polio-patient-feet-india-story-top.jpg), or of [rows of kids in iron lungs](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/20/Iron_lungs.JPG/1280px-Iron_lungs.JPG) 

But did you that the reason we are **this close** to actually eliminating polio is largely due to a few key private organizations? 

In 1985, Rotary International made a pledge to eliminate polio around the world. As of this year, **Rotary has raised over 1.3 billion dollars** in the fight against polio. It is the largest private immunization project in the history of the world, and the total funds raised actually eclipse the GDP of many of the countries in which they work. 

Over 2 billion children have been immunized by Rotary, and polio has almost been completely eradicated. In 2014 there were approximately ~~175~~ 356 (thanks /u/Keyframe) polio cases TOTAL. 

However, it is a slippery disease, and unless we keep pressing, it spreads like wildfire. 

Rotary are one of the good guys, with 89% of funding going to actual eradication, 9% to fundraising, and a mere 2% going to administration. 

**If you want to know more, or give to this important cause (a child can be immunized for life for $0.60 USD), check out [End Polio](http://www.endpolio.org/about-polio).** 

The only [remaining endemic countries are Pakistan, Nigeria, and Afghanistan](http://www.polioeradication.org/dataandmonitoring/poliothisweek.aspx). You can imagine why it is so difficult to reach these areas, and why this last push is so critically important. But it is equally important that we maintain our vaccination program here at home. **Polio is easily spread and all it takes is one infected child - this is not a "third world issue"!!**

If you see fit to donate, you should know that between now and 2018, the **Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation** will match **TWO dollars to every dollar donated through Rotary.** This is it guys, we can actually get over the hump and wipe this awful disease out forever!   Hello Mr. Gates, 
what is in your opinion the main obstacle to the success to poop water machine? 
and how can we overcome that obstacle?
thank you Sewage is a problem. Since it costs money to process it just gets dumped in slums in poor countries. The system the rich world uses of pumping in clean water and pumping it to a processing plant is too expensive. I challenged engineers to create a processor of sewage where the costs could be covered by the energy and water (clean water) that it outputs. We have made progress on that. One team, Janicki, which was written up in Wired, is send a prototype machine to Senegal later this year. Getting rid of sewage helps a lot to reduce disease and improve living conditions.
&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT:** Speaking of the OmniProcessor. You inspired me to post a photo over in /r/photoshopbattles. Have a look:

As there are so many great philanthropic causes, how did you and Melinda decided on the causes that you wanted to put the majority of your effort?  There are a lot of great causes. It is important not to be frozen trying to pick since it is important to specialize and really learn the area you are trying to help. We picked health inequity as our global thing and educational inequity as our national thing and most of our projects fit into these areas. Part of the beauty of philanthropy is the diversity of causes and approaches that get tried. It is far more risk oriented than government or private sector spending which makes it special when it is done right. Dear Mr Gates,

Is it safe to choose a career in programming or will most coders below the expert level be replaced by [automation solutions](http://news.rice.edu/2014/11/05/next-for-darpa-autocomplete-for-programmers-2/) in the next decade?

My deepest thanks for making the world a better place, in so many ways. It is safe for now! It is also a lot of fun and helps shape your thinking on all issues to be more logical. There is a prospect for change in this area for the next generation but that is true for most fields and understanding how to program will always be useful. Also, no matter what field you choose, automation can be a risk, but at least programmers have the advantage of being the ones needed to help develop and maintain their (and everyone's) replacements. There will always be a need for programmers... someone has to write the program that is responsible for the automation.. There is always human involvement somewhere.  Trust me. I'm CEO of Cyberdyne systems. same. Also the CEO of Cyberdyne.  The day we see OSes program completely new APIs for themselves will be a scary day indeed.  
 No, it will get scary when they document their own APIs. Then they will have surpassed humans. Ah yes, when the machines do something that humans would never do. No machine will ever document.

"Eh fuck it, the next self aware program will figure it out. Time to go look at some sweet robo porn." "They don't power me enough for this shit."

Edit: Obligatory thanks a bunch for the gold matey. or "If I document it, they'll just replace me with a newer program. So I better make it overly complex with no documentation to ensure my job security" "I hear there's a super aware program in India who will do it for half the watts... fuck." The rise of Sky.NET Hi Mr. Gates!
Thanks so much for coming back again, I missed your last 2 AMAs.

What do you think is the hardest challenge that the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation is currently facing? We have some tough scientific challenges like an HIV cure.

However the toughest thing is helping teachers learn from the best teachers. There are great teachers and the kids who get them are lucky. We should be able to spread those skills but the current system doesn't do it very well.  Teacher here: Most of us never actually receive any training in HOW TO TEACH. And those of use who are good teachers are not rewarded, at least not at the college level. 

   Actual learning seems to matter less and less. There's a lot more emphasis on being nurturing than teaching skills students would use to get a job.  
 
   I've found that what's best for the students is rarely what's a priority for the department. Anyway. 

 Hi Bill! 

I was watching a video last night on Thorium reactors and saw that you were also in the video discussing this topic as well. This is a technology that I have been following because it makes so much sense.  My question is,  how feasible is the technology at this point in your view and how long before we will see that technology in practice here in the US? 

Side note,  thanks for being there.  You are an inspiration to all of us geeks and nerds from the 70s and 80s. :)    Right now there isn't enough R&amp;D going into safe and cheap nuclear energy. I am supporting Terrapower which has a 4th generation design that looks good. It doesn't use Thorium - it uses the 97% of Uranium that normally can't be used for a reactor by breeding and burning. This means fuel will always be cheap. There are a lot of innovations but the key one is that it is far far safer than anything today - not relying on human operators. Hi bill!

First off, thanks for being an awesome human being!!! But onto my question:

What innovation has been brought to you but sadly never worked out for what ever reason, but you really wanted it to work?

Thanks! And keep being awesome! So far we have not being able to use technology to connect people to the needs of the poorest in countries that are far away to tap into their empathy. I think this can be done but it needs some missing creativity. &gt;This business of making people conscious of what is happening outside their own small circle is one of the major problems of our time, and a new literary technique will have to be evolved to meet it. Considering that the people of this country are not having a very comfortable time, you can't perhaps, blame them for being somewhat callous about suffering elsewhere, but the remarkable thing is the extent to which they manage to be unaware of it. Tales of starvation, ruined cities, concentration camps, mass deportations, homeless refugees, persecuted Jews  all this is received with a sort of incurious surprise, as though such things had never been heard of but at the same time were not particularly interesting. The now-familiar photographs of skeleton-like children make very little impression. As time goes on and the horrors pile up, the mind seems to secrete a sort of self-protecting ignorance which needs a harder and harder shock to pierce it, just as the body will become immunised to a drug and require bigger and bigger doses.

-George Orwell, "As I Please," The Tribune (17 January 1947)

EDIT: see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion_fatigue Regarding the video of you drinking the ... uh.... poop water, how long will it take to put something like that into a community where they can start seeing immediate results? And if I totally missed it, where are they currently setup and what kind of benefits has it already provided. Besides clean drinking water, that is. The timeframe is longer than I would like. Probably 5 years before we have hundreds of them out in dozens of cities but we can scale up fast after that. How much of an existential threat do you think machine superintelligence will be and do you believe full end-to-end encryption for all internet acitivity can do anything to protect us from that threat (eg. the more the machines can't know, the better)??

Edit: I would just like to point out that second part of my question went unanswered. That would be a great discussion for us all to have, especially given the myriad of other vulnerabilities presented by lack of encryption (eg. overzealous government, hackers, etc.). I am in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence. First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned. Hi, Bill.

What is your opinion on bitcoins or cyptocurency as a whole? Also do you own any yourself? Bitcoin is an exciting new technology. For our Foundation work we are doing digital currency to help the poor get banking services. We don't use bitcoin specifically for two reasons. One is that the poor shouldn't have a currency whose value goes up and down a lot compared to their local currency. Second is that if a mistake is made in who you pay then you need to be able to reverse it so anonymity wouldn't work.

Overall financial transactions will get cheaper using the work we do and Bitcoin related approaches.

As a person who was raised in an agricultural community in Canada, the ideas you presented really resonated with me. As individuals, is there anything we can do to help Africa achieve food security? Government aid funding from rich countries to develop new seeds and help the countries educate their farmers and provide credit to them can make a huge difference. Canada does some of this like the United States. We need to raise African productivity by 1.5 to 2x in order for them to avoid malnutrition and be able to lift themselves out of poverty. It is strange a continent with 70% adults as farmers imports food from countries like the US with 2% farmers. Africa spends $50B net buying food today. With productivity improvement they can offset the weather getting worse and feed their children enough to thrive.

**EDIT**: You can read our letter here: www.gatesletter.com Do you have a pet? If so what's his/her name? We have two dogs. One is Oreo and the other is Nilla.

I have resisted getting a third dog.

"*Good boy* OreO5d02!" Nabisco buzzmarketing... nice. Mr Gates,
Do you feel that we are facing an overpopulation problem on this planet? If so, what do you think needs to be done about it? Fortunately as people get healthy they choose to have less kids. We have already had the maximum number of births - that number is starting to go down. We still need to help provide health and contraception in poor countries but all of the global population growth is coming from people living longer. Hans Rosling talks about this in the clearest way at http://vimeo.com/79878808 Mr. Bill Gates, what is your favorite expensive food? Nathan Myhrvold has some amazing modern cuisine stuff that is super tasty. I am not a foodie but his new concoctions are amazing. 

I also like Thai and Indian food but it doesn't have to be expensive. Hi [Bill!](http://i.imgur.com/x1F0T6s.png)

Over the last few years, several entrepreneurs (Elon Musk, Richard Branson, etc.) have launched ventures involving space exploration. Do you have any plans to get involved in this industry? Mr Bill Gates is busy making Earth a better place for us to live in. He got no time for that funky business mister. It's good that we have different billionaires pursuing different venues. Never put all your eggs in one basket. Who are you rooting for in the Super Bowl? This is an easy question. I am good friends with Paul Allen who owns the Seahawks and I live in Seattle. The playoff game was amazing to watch. Go Seahawks! Does Paul Allen really have the best Business Card?  Of course he does, it has watermark. Are you sweating? This is the difference between powerful people and celebrities - celebrities have the players of the club as friends, powerful people have the owners as friends... As a packers fan, and a .net developer - this answer has convinced me to buy a Mac. Packers fan + Apple user = Cheezy-Mac

EDIT: Here is Mac &amp; Cheese for all the people who flooded my inbox. I was freely typing when i wrote Cheezy Mac, didnt think i would piss so many people off. Hi Bill, 

In your opinion, has technology made the masses less intelligent?   Technology is not making people less intelligent. If you just look at the complexity people like in Entertainment you can see a big change over my lifetime. Technology is letting people get their questions answered better so they stay more curious. It makes it easier to know a lot of topics which turns out to be pretty important to contribute to solving complex problems. Who the fuck give gold to Bill Gates? Warren Buffet Warren does not like to spend money on frivolous things.  Check this /u/thisisbillgates/gilded/ Technology doesn't make people less intelligent, it makes stupid people not anonymous. Hello Mr. Gates.

Can we get another Age of Empires?

I know this is probably not your department but damn I love those games.

edit: Hoping he didn't answer because the game is in the works and its a big surprise. Every department is his department. Without him there would be no departments.

I want a new AoE, too. This. If Bill Gates comes to your department requesting a new Age of Empires, you make him another Age of Empires. Even if your department is only responsible for replacing broken office equipment, you make him a new Age of Empires. If I was the janitor and Billy G asked me for AoE4, I'd immediately find the nearest office, shove the person there out, and start learning to code.  Amateur. I'd find someone better than me and *forcibly* make him create a new AoE. Management material Age of Empires II is in the top five greatest achievements of mankind. I still play that game to this day. Amen to that! [Cheers to that!](https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ap5cr9HA24Zvi2DQ4dU8rldimI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale%28%29/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2908944/tumblr_nhrmdfsyuG1ruw1vso9_500.0.gif) [I'd love a new wololo simulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tBqdKGiqnI) You know, I always thought a man like Bill, after so many contributions to both science and humanity, should just sit down, relax and enjoy his money for the rest of his life.

Now, in large part thanks to you, I practically stop caring about everything he has done and yearn for another Age of Empires much more than I yearn for reading in the news that malaria has been eradicated.

Now, I am opening the game that I thought it was already part of my past. I will most likely be consumed by it. I wish you all happy lives. Hi Mr. Gates,

Thanks for doing the AMA. I am a great admirer of your philanthropic work. My question for you is regarding medical research funding. I know your foundation focuses largely on global health issues, but do you have thoughts on research back here in the USA? Governmental funding is reaching dangerously low levels, and many bright and talented clinicians and scientists aren't even applying for federal grants knowing they have little chance of being funded. What can we do about this? 

As an aside, I am about to launch a non-profit dedicated to crowdfunding individual medical research projects. I'm working with little entrepreneurial experience or backing but a ton of passion and experience in the healthcare field--do you have any suggestions or is there anyone at your foundation who might take a few minutes to offer some advice?

Edit: whoops. Reddit ate the end of my post. Research is very underfunded compared to the ideal. Society captures so much benefit from innovation that inventors don't so there is not enough risk taking. Government (and Foundation) funding of research helps but it still should be more. The United States funds a lot more than any other country even relative to its success. It should do more medical and energy and educational and other research. Politicians often think short term unless the voters tell them to avoid that. Perhaps the most outrageous thing is we have not raised Energy research funding to help solve climate change! Hi Bill. What's your favorite spread to put on bread? Butter? Peanut butter? Cheese spread?

Any of these. Whoa there BachelorBill Just like Microsoft; always three ways to do something. "He don't use butter, he don't use cheeeese. He don't use jelly, or ANY OF THESE!" Try butter, liverpaste and beetroot salad. Both delicious and sounds kind of "rich-people food"-ish. Also, I have no clue if those things makes any sense in English, it's a Norwegian thing. All at once?! Lets not be hasty, Bill.  Creamy or chunky peanut butter? This is crucial... If I could suggest something. Please try Biscoff I have to know this one thing, Crunchy or Smooth?  Try Cheese Spread and Peanut Butter. TOGETHER. I don't know if you will ever get to read this but... 

... What is your favourite type of Peanut butter. What the hell is cheese spread? You're an asshole, getting someone to reply to this shit to make people fawn over you won't fix the fact that you took a break for people to forget the asshole things you've done.

Suing linux, holding the internet back a decade.

Wiretapping skype. You're a piece of work bill. He's donated more to charities and benefitted more of the world than you likely ever will... This guy has donated billions of dollars and saved over **six million** lives, and you're getting butthurt over Skype?! One does not simply "sue linux".

On the case of Skype: It's their service and they can do what they see fit with their server protocols, plus the U.S gov still has to get a warrant before they can see you talking about your heroin deals with your grandmother. **Let it be known I'm not a huge fan of making it easy for the U.S to crawl through your stuff**

What did they do to hold back the internet again?  What time does Bill Gates typically go to bed each night and get up in the morning? This sounds like the setup for a joke. Which foot does Bill Gates typically put socks on first? With your help Bill Gates will eradicate cold feetsies in our lifetime. Unlike the normal man, Bill Gates puts his pants on both legs at once! While jumping over a chair. No, Bill Gates puts his pants on one leg at a time, but if he had more limbs, you'd see his method is O(lg(n)) Lizards don't sleep. But they do sun bathe Gets up at 4AM, goes to sleep at 5AM 23 hours of sleep? Now that's living! Like his buddy Chuck Norris. He pays someone else to sleep for him, so he doesn't have to. The way you phrased this question with him in the third-person, for some reason I got an image of Bill Gates "going to sleep at night" but actually transforming into DOSman and fighting cyber-crime across the Pacific Northwest.

On an unrelated note, I need more coffee. He should use a www.lunasleep.com and share his data with the world - I am a founder at Luna;) Presumably depends on what he's reading. Depends how exciting the book is Gates V4.5 does not require sleep, that is for feeble human flesh bags and earlier models. Hello Mr. Gates!

Thank you for doing this AMA! I really look up and admire you in many different ways. Its quite an honor just to be able to ask you a few questions. 



So, here are my questions

1. What do YOU think about the new Hololens? Have you tried them out yet? 

2. What fields do you see really opening up to big potential in the computer industry? I really love computer programming. Ive done it since I was 12. Im 17 now and find myself worrying about what to declare as my major in college. Im afraid that whatever my major is will become obsolete within 5 years.  

3. What are some awesome books youve read lately? 

4. Do you think this new poop water machine will make its way into first world countries? I think California could greatly benefit from it since we always seem to be in a drought. 

5. Do you ever talk to Steve Wozniak? 

6. How are you? Whats new? Have anything fun planned?   I won't have time for all of these. My book reports show up on www.gatesnotes.com 

The Hololens is pretty amazing. Microsoft has put a lot into the chips and the software. It is the start of virtual reality. Making the device so you don't get dizzy or nauseous is really hard - the speed of the alignment has to be super super fast. It will take a few years of software applications being built to realize the full promise of this.

If you study programming and biology and see how the programming can help biology you will stay out on front!  Thank you so much for answering! I really appreciate it! :D You just had the richest man in the world give you advice on your future career. You should consider yourself really lucky. He's not the richest anymore :( , but trust me, i'm following his advice. I'd be stupid not to. 

Edit: I stand corrected. He reclaimed his spot in 2014!  Fuck Carlos Slim. Used to party with his great nephew. Literally could not stand that dude, although the cocaine was always fantastic.  That's just too damn obscure to be a lie. I wish it was a lie, he lost his virginity in my bedroom but was too embarrassed to come back down to the party so he pissed in my fucking trashcan.  You realize you have to double major in biology and CS now, right? No need, thanks to the [bioinformatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) major offered by many Universities. (And yes, thats an excellent career choice if you have any interest at all in the fields, and an at least mediocre understanding of maths and statistics). Bioinformatics is biology and programming (kinda). Could look into that. You're a clever teen, and you seem to want to go into CS. Go for it. You'll be able to make it work regardless of what the basics of the field look like in 10 years. You should listen to that career advice. The need for bioinformaticists is huge in the field right now. We have all of these incredible high throughput techniques that produce gobs of data that we just don't know what to do with.  I totally am going to. It sounds right up my alley. And they don't make a bad living!  U just got hooked up  CS is the way to go for sure or definitely anything involving marketing and technology. It will get you far. I know this guy who's a freakin wizard at it.
[Packaging Design Cincinnati] (http://www.pixelsourcemedia.com/packaging-design/cincinnati-packaging-design.html) I'm doing biology and programming right now.

Edit: *"See dad, Bill Gates approves!!"* i thought Hololens was augmented reality? An AR headset has a better shot at doing VR than the reverse. The difference between AR and VR is nothing more than how much of your field of vision is taken up by the rendered images.

The peripheral problem (seeing meatspace peaking in from beyond the edges of the glasses) that some people make a huge fuss about is overblown, since it's nothing more than a matter of designing a model that's more goggle-like, or a rim accessory to snap on that blocks out seeing around the edges.

So while AR is a simple matter of form factor to make it capable of VR, a VR headset can never do AR as well, since it would have to rely on dual cameras to pass a 3D image of the outside through to the display. Suddenly you have camera lag and image quality problems added to the list of challenges. It's barely worth the effort, and AR headsets are by far the more obvious choice for development to put its energy into. Oculus is VR right? it is thanks I sure hope we get at least enough cooperation between Microsoft and Google to see Ingress able to be played on the Hololens. Double majoring in CS and Biology, graduating in May, and Bill Gates just approved my career path. Today is awesome! Alright! I got the biology down. Now for the challenge of programming. Biomedical engineering with a minor in financial economics it is! Thanks Bill, your insight is invaluable and has just encouraged my life's direction. You don't get much CS with a bioE degree. There is a field called Computational Biology but I'm pretty sure it's pretty much a graduate field. &gt; There is a field called Computational Biology but I'm pretty sure it's pretty much a graduate field.

Depends on the University. I have an undergrad in bioinformatics (= computational biology, pretty much^(1)). But I studied in Germany. Different countries have different tracks.

^1 To clarify, different people in the field sometimes define these terms differently but theres no agreed-on clear-cut distinction, and many, if not most, people use the terms interchangeably. In my university in the US we have bioinformatics but only as an undergraduate minor and graduate degree. It's a new field so I bet that if you get in early you have a good chance of moving up quickly (as opposed to something like CS or Bio). as a fellow german, what kinda qualification do you need to study bioinformatics? For the undergrad course you need the Abitur, thats it. Most Unis dont even have an NC for this course.

Many people who start bioinformatics have never done programming before, and many also didnt do Profilkurs biology, and they still did fine. in other words, not many qualifications are needed.

That said, without any prior knowledge, the first two years can be tough: you need to learn a lot of very different stuff  computer science basics, lots of chemistry and biology, lots of different kinds of mathematics^1  very quickly. If youre not particularly *interested* in the topic then it may be hard to pull through.

---

^1 I had different course on [(modular) arithmetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic), [linear algebra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra), [(multivariate) statistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics), [numerical analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis) and [dynamic systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system), [linear optimisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming), [graph theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) and [machine learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning). In hindsight, that wasnt even enough, I should have done more mathematics (or at least I should have paid better attention). My cousin was working on that project and I'm super proud of what they've done! Thank you for making this kind of stuff possible! I think the Hololens fits more in to the category of augmented reality, which is equally as exiting! I really want to get my hands on one and see if it does everything they say it can. I love biology! I need programming! BIOTECHNOLOGY? with coding... Hell yeah that is what I am doing! If the HoloLens is even half as good as it seems, it will still be incredible.

I've noticed that while there's headtracking, I've seen no mention of eyetracking: It seems that could be really beneficial with a display headset as it's been described; you could control positioning via headtracking on say, a floating desktop, but also control a more accurate cursor on that desktop separately with your eyes.

Hell, you could even blink to click, or wink to right click.

Anyhow, pass it on to your engineers. PM me if you need the info to pass on the royalties. isn't the hololens more like augmented reality, and oculus rift more like virtual reality? http://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2014 Um, I think you'll find that you mean to say nauseated?  I'll show myself out...

...actually, can I have a poop straw? Never mind, I'm going....I'm going. &gt; The Hololens is pretty amazing. Microsoft has put a lot into the chips and the software. It is the start of virtual reality. Making the device so you don't get dizzy or nauseous is really hard - the speed of the alignment has to be super super fast. It will take a few years of software applications being built to realize the full promise of this.

Have you gotten the opportunity to try the Oculus Rift? They are getting really close to that 1:1 responsivity. &gt; It will take a few years

 I'm pretty sure I played Virtual Reality at a county fair in 1996. I understand your concern about how fast things are changing and how any major you select may be obsolete so quickly. However, if you love computer programming (as a Comp Sci major myself) you shouldn't feel afraid to go for it.

You'll learn the basics of computer programming even if the languages you use change over time. The binary circuit isn't going away any time soon and the programming/logic concepts that you learn will be applicable for a good long while to come. +1.  Core computer science hasn't been made obsolete in fifty years, let alone five. What this guy said. I'm a CS major too and it's a ton of fun. I find that my classes focus on the basics (Sorts,  and lower-level, less abstracted, stuff (networking, basic operating systems). But on my free time I work on my own projects and that's where I learn the most. That's where I keep up with new technologies. If you're interested in programming, try Computer Science. you also learn *how to learn*. With a good computer science education, you will have the tools to learn whatever technologies lie ahead.  Knowing electrical engineering (and digital electronics) can help in super fundamental ways to Systems Engineering, as well.

Ultimately you're right and you get my upvote :) The core of computer science is at the algorithmic level, and at the low level understanding how memory and processor instruction sets work isn't going to change no matter how many layers of abstraction you pile on. Knowing how to cut **through** the abstraction, though, to implement the most efficient higher-level methods... *that* is a rare talent these days. [This is how I put it in to perspective that I don't care that he says-- he doesn't have time.](http://youtu.be/B2inExgT77s?t=1m57s) &gt; Im afraid that whatever my major is will become obsolete within 5 years.

Computer Science won't become obsolete, as it's the math and theory behind everything, not just rote programming.  The skills you learn will apply just as well in 30 years as they will in 3 years, even though the languages and hardware will change.  If your degree teaches you how to use *a* tool, it's failed.  It should teach you how to *learn to use any* tool.  You won't come out of a CS degree as a Java or Python master (unless you spend your free time building that mastery), but you should come out of it with the ability to quickly and efficiently pick up any language because you will understand the theories behind them. I like the idea of Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak hanging out. RoonilWazilbob (great username by the way)-

Yes, just yes, it would be amazing One of the early Apple Interviews (during the Apple ][) Steve Woz said he didn't think he could make Apple BASIC as good as Microsoft Altair BASIC. Because he simply thought Gates was a better developer then him. [deleted] It won't as long as you never lose the desire to learn Six years out of college with a non-CS degree (and have been doing tech jobs ever since), your degree matters way way less than you probably think and have been told.  

Seriously, I graduated with a degree in something I enjoyed while tinkering on the side.  I got my first job based on connections I made through my hobbies.  Then every job or contracting work I got after that has based on connections I make through work or other ways.  If you learn important topics and **network** then your degree is just a certificate.  Think of it this way, there are going to be hundreds of graduates with a degree in pretty much the same thing as you, why should they pick you over the next person when you're all just a piece of paper to the people picking?

Especially with the economy the way it is you can't rely on your degree or resume to get you a job.  It's all about convincing the people that they want you to work for them, and you don't do that with a piece of paper, you get an internship, or you meet them at a conference, or you put work out there on github, or you have experiences that set you apart (teaching/studying abroad), etc. Spoiler: College isn't about learning something to apply in the workforce.

It's about learning how to quickly learn skills to apply in the workforce. (It's meta! College is about learning how to learn, to prove to an employer you know how to learn really well, so you can learn their shit really well). 

All skills get outdated and require constant learning to stay on top of an industry.

For a computer scientist: be able to learn new languages, new IDE's, new SDKs, new APIs, new paradigms. That's what you need to be relevant. The ability to learn and adapt to new workflows. If you have that, success should follow.  &gt;  Im afraid that whatever my major is will become obsolete within 5 years.

The fact that you're worrying about this means that you will be fine because you will shift yourself as things change. You seem to have a very hardline thinking about college the truth is that people and courses are very malleable , there are electrical engineers working in neuroscience, computer scientists working in food labs and generally just people all over the place. After a while of being in academia you realize that degrees really don't mean much, the college experience is still incredibly valuable but it takes you to a level where you can choose and learn the things you want to learn.  &gt;Do you think this new poop water machine will make its way into first world countries? I think California could greatly benefit from it since we always seem to be in a drought.

a lot of first world countries already use these in sewage treatment plants. i know in the uk we have been drinking poop water for years, i have no idea if they do this in the us. In the same boat as you. No really, this question could've been written by me. 

Some empirical research and my own personal biases tell me that Programming, Cybersecurity and AI are probably the safest (not to mention most interesting) majors to go into. 

And to agree with /u/bitcoin_user1 despite the D-Wave and other research into the Quantum Computer, the binary circuit doesn't look like it's going anywhere anytime soon. lol he's not going to answer any of these. plus you got too greedy with his time. [deleted] INB4 ignorant, but I believe RoundUp is the problem honestly, it supposedly is 98.5% correlated with the rate of autism. What is the silliest thing you ever bought that was expensive? Probably the Porsche 959 that he didn't get to drive for 13 years. Damn...Slowest locksmith EVER. iirc US customs took the car in, as it was not certified for 'murican roads It really helps when you have enough friends in Washington to help pass a law to let you drive it...! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_and_Display What happened? The car was not regulated by Department of Transportation at the time and was basically held in customs the whole time, and as you can imagine, new rules and regulations would take a loooong time to pass through  "The cars had not been approved by regulators and had no Department of Transportation and Environmental Protection Agency approval. The "Gates 959" was stored for 13 years by the Customs Service at the Port of Seattle, until regulations were changed to allow "Autos of Interest" to be imported with severe limitations on their use."

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_959#.22Gates_959.22

 Yet it gained miles on the odometer. They had to um, test it Many things may be said about the 959, but "silly" just isn't one of them. What a work of art... One of the most impressive feats of engineering at the time, but to have not checked if you could actually drive it before you imported it is a bit silly.  It was the Veyron of its time, but pretty tame by today's sports car standards. Any car that can do 195 mph is still far from tame. I guess, but I was speaking relatively, and you can buy a $70,000 Corvette that will do 195 mph these days. Modern hypercars top out in the 240-260 mph range and run 10 second quarter mile times. So he got some laws changed because he didn't like his car being kept from him. That's what I call power. Serious reply: He's mentioned numerous times that his private jet was his most splurgiest. I also like the way how modest he is when people ask him about his richness. He's pretty cool and normal for an extremely rich man. Do you think that the access to the Internet will be free for everyone one day? Would you participate on a project to make this happen? Yes it will.  As soon as we have good encryption and onion routing and open source wifi router firmwares that know how to use those, the world will quickly evolve into a giant wifi mesh network.  This will be a Good Thing, and in most ways is inevitable on a long enough time line.  It needs to be consciencously sped up though. I really hope he answers this. How could that happen? Someone has to pay for it right? Government funding through taxes. so the internet isnt free. As free as public parks are. I imagine high speed internet for everyone would cost a little bit more. I am not completely opposed to the idea, I just wanted to clarify it wouldn't be free.  Have you ever taken a meyers-briggs personality test?  If so, what is your personality type?  MSFT, surely. My money's on INTP As an ENTP I approve [This site](http://www.knowyourtype.com/myers-briggs/famous-mbti-personality-types/) Seems to think he's ENTJ Willy Gates doesn't seem like an extrovert to me... Maybe I'm wrong, though.

Honestly I think bordering INT(P/J) leaning towards INTP. He's socially awkward, tends to keep to himself, has been known to be a bit disheveled at times, loves ideas and learning, and clearly wears his feelings on his sleeve.

He's not the coldest human (INTJ) but he does seem like the warmest machine (INTP). I'd lean towards J - he was a ruthless boss and businessman in the 80s/90s, and while he has mellowed out a bit now, he still is an ideas focused person, setting out specific goals and timeframes with the Gates Foundation BAMF In case he didn't, [here's the free test.](http://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) My best guess is that he is an INTJ. I'm pretty sure I've read in a few places that he's INTP. A different one every time, like everybody else. Wow, here comes the MBPT fanboys. Yikes! No supporting evidence. Personal experience says otherwise. Invalid statement.  [Plenty of supporting evidence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator#Criticism). Personal experience meaningless. Myers-Briggs personality test pseudoscientific garbage. It only shows the flaws of the test itself, which I agree, isn't very good. But the cognitive function theory is very valid in my opinion and shouldn't be dismissed. (And by saying "in my opinion" I mean that it's a fact for me.).  This reads like a telegram. Or Tarzan arguing, "Me Tarzan ENFJ, you Jane ESFP" I was thinking Mordin from Mass Effect. &gt; Personal experience meaningless.

The hell is that supposed to mean? It's not pseudoscience! It's fact! I just feel it in my heart! It isn't pseudoscience.  It's science with low validity/reliability.  That may sound silly, but it's different. You're just spouting pseudoscientific nonsense!!! And your statement is meaningless due to your lack of explanation/evidence. But I'm pretty sure there isn't any science at all supporting it. That would make it pseudoscience right?  The theory is valid. The test, not so much..
 no, you get an upvote. ENTJ without a doubt * What's your high score in Windows Solitaire?
* What's your very best life advice? He probably has some sort of hack where it completes it for him Hey Bill, what are you thoughts on linux and FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)?  I wonder if his opinion's changed since his [Open Letter to Hobbyists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists). There's a big fucking difference between writing software and distributing it for free (FOSS) and making unauthorized copies of someone else's software (Open Letter). Yep, you're completely right there is. But back in the day there wasn't. Everything was considered open-source and programmers working on the same software often fairly open about showing each other their work. Microsoft changed that, for better and for worse. "Bill Gates was arrested in New Mexico in 1977 for jumping a red light and driving without a licence."

Do you want to tell us this story? 'no' - Bill Gates Gilded 3 times OP pls BG pls One night, while he was driving, he realized that he didnt have his license. Nervous that he'll get pulled-over for a random traffic stop, he made a u-turn and while doing so he didn't realize that he crossed on a red light. It just so happen that there's a donut shop at the corner and cops saw everything. Cops immediately get in their car and chased and pulled Bill Gates over. In my imagination the story involves a lot more hookers and blow.
 I think he doesn't really like talking about it :( so sad =( There is nothing to tell, it just feels good to be a gangsta. Evidently not. &gt; Do you want to tell us this story?

Yes, but my lawyers have advised me against it. He ran a red light  His mug shot would make a perfect "Thug Life" meme. http://imgur.com/Ubqswds  I'm involved in the Commercial Truck world, and this locking of ECMs/ECU's is crazy. Say I own a couple trucks. I want to limit the speed to a max of 75 MPH, and also have it so the headlights come on when the wipers do. I have no way to do this on my own. I have to beg a dealer to sell me the software (Costing $600 &amp; up PER ECU/ECM per year) or go to my local dealership and have them charge me a couple hundred bucks to do it. It takes them literally 5 minutes to change a parameter. I hope that some day they follow what is going on in the auto world, but it is light years away I'm afraid. Have commercial trucks ever come up in your conversations? Diesel trucks come up a lot on our conversations. We will submit testimony from a independent Diesel mechanic talking about exactly the issue that you bring up.

What we need is open source software like RomRaider and OpenECU for all the major diesel engines. That could happen, but programmers like me are afraid of writing it because of the legal risk.

If we get the DMCA exemption for repairing cars, I think we'll see a lot more innovation in this space.

I'll give you a practical example. Detroit Diesel has an option in their software to change the temperature that the radiator fan kicks on at. I'm pretty sure that Cummins' software doesn't have that setting  maybe they only want their dealers to be able to do it, or maybe they just never got around to adding that feature.

So if you have a repair that requires changing that setting, the only way you could do it is to pull the firmware off the ECU, decompile it, change that value, and reflash the ECU. It's technically possible (maybe a bit difficult, but heywe're smart folks!), but legally very sketchy. Thank you, DMCA.

Once this is legal, all it takes is one person to figure out how to do it, post it online, and then the rest of us benefit. For what its worth, I do work with some independent programmers who have written some diagnostic software for commercial trucks, along with the ability to run some functional tests and change some parameters on certain engines. If you ever want to be in touch with them just PM me. What's the *actual* impact of a law making it illegal to hack your car's computer, or bypass restrictions on a coffee maker, or whatever? Would penalties be directed more at the consumer who was "breaking the law" or the parties providing the information or tools to the consumer?  The part of the law we're talking about here (section 1201(a)(1)) penalizes the person actually doing the circumvention themselves. That means you can get sued for money damages and get an injunction issued against you by a copyright holder or another private party.

There are criminal penalties also possible, if you're doing the circumvention for "commercial advantage or private financial gain," including fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars and jail time, capped at 5 or 10 years.

Other sections of the law (sections 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b)), keep people from making the tools that let others circumvent.

EDIT for a link to [section 1201](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201)
EDIT again: the civil penalties are in [section 1203](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1203) and the criminal penalties are in [section 1204](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1204)

 Wow. I had absolutely no idea there could be consequences beyond attempts to reduce competition and consumer choice. Thank you both for taking the time to answer our questions and thanks for the links to the petitions. 

[EFF Donation Page](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/), for anyone interested. No problem!

EFF is awesome; I work for (also awesome) [Public Knowledge](https://www.publicknowledge.org/). I'm in the DC area if you're looking for unpaid volunteers. I'd gladly donate a couple hours a week to help out with anything you need. Here, hold this sign. We buy gold now.   Seconding Sherwin on this one: [Public Knowledge](https://www.publicknowledge.org/) is really awesome and should be in your donation sights. Thanks for letting us know about Public Knowledge. [I just signed up for their newsletter](http://publicknowledge.nationbuilder.com/email_sign_up).  Question about this car "hacking" thing. I am involved in the Subaru community where its very common to flash your ECU for the purpose of tuning your car and increasing performance. This law would make that illegal? What about the companies that sell the software/hardware necessary to do these modifications? The devices/software they sell would become illegal? Not *become* illegal, they already are by default. That's how screwed up the system is. What Qwertymodo said. It wouldn't make it illegal, changing the copyright law will make it legal. As of right now it is illegal. What if you argued it differently. Like: I assembled my own coffee machine and programmed it using plastic parts that used to be a a coffee maker. I don't think reframing it would convince a judge.  That's kind of like a terrorist arguing they didn't make a bomb, they made a **clock** that had a detonator and an explosive charge as added features. The only thing I can think of when i read this that i am happy to live in Europe.  I dont mean to be rude or insulting but it seems that many of the freedoms you ought to be enjoying are just empty ideals from a time long gone. Is this kind of legislation actually implemented in such a strict manner? These criminal charges look so harsh; 5 or 10 years in prison.. Wow. 
Edit: thanks for taking the time and for sharing this info. That is serious, How often is it enforced? It seems almost unenforceable.... except if you are a person advertizing what you are doing? Could this be a way to keep the public from revising their phones and making them inaccessible to the police/homeland security? 
 Has anyone ever been sued for unlocking their phone? The actual implication is that manufacturers use the threat of legal action under the DMCA to stifle competition. That's what happened to our good friend Sina Khanifar when he developed a cell phone unlocking tool. Most of the time, the developers and consumers who get hit with legal threats simply bow down to the pressure. They pull their apps and take down their websitesbecause it's hard to fight Big Copyright and their relentless cadre of lawyers. Sina teamed up with the EFF and fought back. And now we have a Cellphone Unlocking Law because of it.

It also stifles toolmaking. Developers are afraid to tinker with hardware, and security researchers are afraid to do their work. This has chilling effects on the entire ecosystem, harming consumer choice and increasing our risk of undetected security vulnerabilities. Woop that's me! I wrote more about exactly that story and how I was threatened under the DMCA here [here](http://sina.is/unlocking-phones/) - the tl;dr is that Motorola found out I had written software to unlock their phones when I was in college and had their laywers threaten me via mail. I was 18, but the awesome EFF (and the particularly amazing Jennifer Granick) gave me completely pro-bono help and helped pushed back against their threats. And this is why I support the EFF, so they can support people like you. Keep up the good work. &gt; increasing our risk of undetected security vulnerabilities.

That's a great point that I hadn't considered at all. Attempts to prevent consumers and interested parties from figuring out how things work would almost certainly stifle efforts (to some degree) to find security vulnerabilities in our products. Parties who already intend to break the law with their activities would be far less hesitant to find the vulnerabilities and use them for malicious purposes than curious parties who are trying to do good or simply satisfying their own curiosity. I can see how laws like this might actually tip the scales in favor of those who want to cause harm than those who are trying to do good. 

Thank you both for taking the time to answer our questions and thanks for the links to the petitions.

[EFF Donation Page](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/) , for anyone interested. Fun fact: a poster on /r/talesfromtechsupport nearly fell afoul of this sort of thing while playing with [connecting his iPhone to a serial port](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2d8aed/chhopskytech_a_laptop_dies_an_idea_lives_and_i/) That was intense.  I'd add, it's not just about competition, in the traditional sense. It's about vertical lock-in.

The car is hardware. The software is software. A company might not have the economies of scale to make a car, but might be able to make better software. Or a car seat. Or a cup holder.

Once everything can have software in it, a car could conceivably have so much DRM that even the cup holders would need special approval from the manufacturer. We already have cup holder DRM in the Keurig 2.0. ;) I was trying to come up with a horrific hypothetical if things went too far. It is horrific, and has gone too far. I mean, Keurig is creating an inconvenience out of something I bought *because* it was supposed to be convenient. Fuck it. I'll make my own coffee cup maker, with black coffee and kahlua. In fact, forget the coffee machine and the black coffee. And add blackjack and Hookers &gt; increasing our risk of undetected security vulnerabilities.

Except for those "black" hat hackers who are going to be finding these vulnerabilities and using them for personal gain...

Must be nice to give our enemies tools to hurt us. 

But Congress has never been any good at technology, so I guess I'm not terribly surprised. As a tech at a shop that is not the dealership we increasingly have to tell people that they have to take their car there after our service is completed because of software lock downs, this is reducing the amount of business that even comes into our shop in the first place. Nor only shows this hurt the long term prospects for these real middle class jobs but it hurts the consumers as well when they are forced to pay labor rates that are sometimes twice what we charge they might end up paying twice because they did choke to is in the first place. Or maybe they just won't go to the dealer at all, so the repair will only be partial and the safety of them and those around them could be put at risk.  The most common example of this is tire pressure monitoring, sure most cars can be reprogrammed once the tires are rotated but not always, so if a tire is low on pressure the car will warn of it being flat at its previous location, the driver then puts air into the front left tire because that's what the car said to do, but it is actually the right reader tire that's flat, so not only do they still have a flat but the tire on the opposite corner of the car is over inflated making the dynamics even more off and the flat tire even more likely to fail.Another example is if you get an alignment, some cars stability control needs recalibrated around the new geometry but lots of cars have this ability locked by the manufacturer and protected by DRM because it's considered changing the vehicle code... So your stability control might not activate when the car is unstable, or even worse might activate when the car is stable and actually cause instability.It's not just about tuning and performance enhancement but good paying jobs and the safety of everyone else on the road Also what constitutes "hacking". Sticking a bar code sticker on a kureig? Or maybe modifying your exhaust and making some needed mods on the computer on your car? And where does this law stop? If I overclock my gpu let's say, is that hacking?  http://primera.e-sim.org/lan.338837/ In your opinion why won't manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung move to control a parts industry the same way auto manufacturers have? They're doing so now and we expect they may increase their iron grip in the future.

The best way to fight back against this is to support independent repair and speak up to manufacturers and politicians about the need for independent parts.

Darrel Issa, Zoe Lofgren, and a few other members of Congress have considered reforming patent terms for auto parts to combat this problem. They proposed the [PARTS Act last year](http://issa.house.gov/press-releases/2013/04/issa-lofgren-whitehouse-and-hatch-introduce-parts-act/). We should consider the same reforms for electronic parts. My question may have come off wrong but that still supplied alot of information. Why wont they make OEM parts more available so certified (this shouldn't have to be as difficult as it is to become) have these parts available. a few reasons. One is liability. Most people don't get electronics like cars and have a hard time telling the difference between OEM servicing and third parties. You end up with a lot of pissed off customers who let the guy at the ATT crack open their phone and screw it up. 

The second is you stand to make more money from service and repair charges if you are the only one that can do it. And the last is by controlling the repair channels you can help facilitate planned obsolescence. OEMs will stop supporting hardware long before third parties will.  Do you mean like buying out certain material/component manufacturers? If so Apple has done that already. Apple bought out the company that made the fingerprint reader for their iPhones from what I hear.

Edit: Apple didn't buy out the company that made the fingerprint reader after adding the reader to the iPhone, but they did buy out the company when the Motorola Atrix came out leaving the handset industry with "subpar" manufacturers

Source: http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/26/7904907/nexus-6-no-fingerprint-sensor-because-of-apple Yeah, Authentec made biometric scanners for PCs and laptops for ~decade before Apple bought them. I thought unlocking was legal now? Did that get revoked? The process that's going on right now happens every 3 years--they call it the "triennial rulemaking." So the win we got last year was the overturning of the Copyright Office's rule from the last time. But every 3 years, it resets, and we have to make the case for unlocking again.

That's what we're doing now. The small win is to get these rights back again.

The big win is to change the law to make sure we never have to do that again. That's a longer fight, but one we're working on. So why does this law only last three years, while other laws last presumably forever? Not all laws last forever. Laws passed by Congress (statutes) generally last until they're changed by Congress (unless they're overturned as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court). (Some laws will have "sunset" provisions in them--Congress can put time limits on them, but that's not what's going on here.)

But Congress will also pass laws that will leave the details to federal agencies. Basically, Congress says, "ok, we want laws that will lead to this result. Agency, write those laws." (There are boundaries on exactly how much Congress can delegate--they can't just abdicate their responsibility entirely--but that's a matter for a whole course on administrative law.)

Then the agency creates federal "rules." These are laws--they have the force of federal law, and can be overturned by the agency changing them again, or by Congress overruling them, or, again, if they're found by a court to violate Congress-passed laws or the Constitution.

In this case, the DMCA--a statute passed by Congress--says that the Library of Congress and Copyright Office have to make rules every three years. 

Sorry for the over-long explanation. &gt; In this case, the DMCA--a statute passed by Congress--says that the Library of Congress and Copyright Office have to make rules every three years.

Presumably this 'triennial rulemaking' would not be deemed nessesary once enough of the big players have had their victories in this space. Good question. Exemptions are granted on a rolling, 3 year basis. Last go-round, they removed the phone unlocking exemption. Then Congress and Obama overruled them. But they didn't pass a permanent exemption  they just kicked the can down the road a few months.

Everyone I've talked to expects that the Copyright Office will renew the phone unlocking exemption  it would be political suicide not to. But will they legalize unlocking tablets? What about bypassing DRM on cars or using your own feedstock on 3D printers? That's up in the air. What are the counter-arguments (i.e. those used to *defend* the opposition's point)? Who exactly are manipulating the legal system to make repairs, jailbreaking, etc., illegal?

I'd simply like to be better informed. It's also important, I think, to know what one is up against. Sources to any information would be appreciated.  Manufacturers cite a lot of different reasons for hitting consumers with a big copyright/DRM stick. In the case of repairs, they often claim that only their authorized repair techs know how to make those repairsand putting locks over the system prevents ill-equipped consumers or techs from screwing up the product. When Keurig slapped DRM over their brewers, they justified it by saying that they were ensuring that consumers got a superior and a safe coffee product. The list goes on. Whether or not you buy the counter-argument, it's key to remember that manufacturers are using a copyright law to criminalize activities that have nothing to do with piracy. And that's just not okay. &gt;In the case of repairs, they often claim that only their authorized repair techs know how to make those repairsand putting locks over the system prevents ill-equipped consumers or techs from screwing up the product. 

This drives me nuts. I paid for it. If I want to take a chance and try to fix it taking the risk of damaging it further, which would mean that I either still have to send it to them to fix or flat out buy a new one, then that should be my prerogative. I traded you my money for your product, unless you want to leave me control of that money and what you do with it, don't assume you can keep total control over the product and what I do with it.

&gt;When Keurig slapped DRM over their brewers, they justified it by saying that they were ensuring that consumers got a superior and a safe coffee product. 

This makes some sense, but IMO once I've made a modification not directed by the manufacturer; the fallout, be it good or bad, is with me. 

 Seems to me that's the whole point of the phrase "tampering with product will void the warranty". Tinker at your own risk, corporate monkey STAY OFF MY BACK. Which is how I think most people believe it should work. Nobody expects the manufacturer to pay for it if your tinkering is what broke it (or made it worse).

Yet, there's plenty of reasons to make such modifications (maybe you think it's worth the lost warranty or the warranty is expired).

Making tinkering with *certain types* of digital products illegal makes sense, since you typically don't own the software, but rather you license it (and then there's cases such as modifying software can affect other people, such as if I hack my bank's ebanking).

But with physical products, you typically own the product and it's your to fuck with. &gt;  Nobody expects the manufacturer to pay for it if your tinkering is what broke it (or made it worse).

I think you'd be surprised. In my experience, the average person who breaks their phone will try their damnedest to get it fixed or replaced at the cost of the manufacturer, because "it's still under contract". I work at a computer store, and I'll back this. We even had a guy come in about a month ago and ask for a replacement laptop under warranty... because his had been *stolen*. To the last 2 posters. One word: Retail. 

It's okay. Let the healing begin. 

 The hidden truth in this is that they want to control prices in the market. For example printer ink. There is not $40 worth of product value in the ink cartridge. 

When these companies mass produce the items basic market principles should be at play. Naturally this should be bringing the cost to the consumer down. These laws allow them to circumvent natural market behavior and artificially inflate prices. It also stifles competition completely. 

While some product certifications are good because they mean consistent product they often become so costly to any competitor that they cant even enter the market.   

Look into the legal cases surrounding ink refills and aftermarket cartridges. We are fighting the same battle with phones and the k-cup. &gt; I traded you my money for your product, unless you want to leave me control of that money and what you do with it, don't assume you can keep total control over the product and what I do with it.

Ha, almost makes me want to draft up an EULA for my money. Keurig was really trying to prevent [this](http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2a/ff/c3/2affc3abf101aad8dcfb962816e20d89.jpg). Then how should we handle responsibility if something goes wrong with the product. If one day a modded smart car kills some one due to a combination of the modded software, and a hardware glitch, who's held responsible? Isn't at least some of there reasoning valid, in the sense that currently there is a very clean line between responsibility depending on if the product is modified? I am a strong supporter of your cause and appreciate your work. Keep it up There's a large body of law already devoted to allocating who is at fault when something goes wrong in a complex system. The point is to not prevent all experimentation in order to prevent accidents.

If you're hacking something, you already do have a legal responsibility for what you've done for it--but that responsibility isn't related to whoever made the thing--it;s related to whoever uses or is affected by it later.

If someone sues the manufacturer because they're hurt, not because of the product itself, but because of a hack you made, they're going to be able to put that blame on you, the hacker. Yeah, there's all of those videos on YouTube of people doing repairs on phones themselves. It's horrible - electrocutions, acid burns, fires...

...oh wait, no, it's actually not that hard to repair phones so long as you have some basic electronic skills.

Thank you for standing up for our rights and blowing right past the bullshit these companies are trying to peddle. The dynamic here is that the way law the DMCA is written, it potentially sweeps up *all* kinds of jailbreaking (etc, etc, anywhere where people have to circumvent technical measures to access a copyrighted work including code), which of course covers things that weren't foreseen when it was passed in 1998.

So it's not like car repair is a battleground that the other side already won on, it's just clouded by this overbroad law that should never have touched it in the first place. It's nice that we have the safety valve of the triennial rulemaking, where we can make the case and get a possible exemption, but really the system should not be one where new uses of existing technology are presumptively illegal or legally murky.

Does that answer the question? Let me know, I know I kind of took this to a meta-level. :) Also, in the cell phone unlocking space, we'd see arguments like, "well, people who steal phones want to unlock them."

Which I found baffling, since it's not like someone who stole a phone was waiting on the Copyright Office to say it was legal to unlock it before they proceeded. Additionally, cell phone carriers have been using measures to disable authentication on known stolen phones via the IMEI and other such unique identifiers. The argument isn't very strong on their part because of this. I've worked in automotive and medical technologies and these already industries have big safety and recall fears that drive a lot of this. If someone dies because they hacked their pacemaker, the manufacturer is still going to have to deal with a lot of the blowback. Same if you decide to hack your Tesla to disable the auto-braking  feature. It's so much more of a liability than a feature that it just doesn't make sense to sell products with open systems. 

I think if there were laws that would specifically shield manufacturers from liability when someone modifies their products, they might not have to go the other way trying to make it illegal to modify. Even then, though, it doesn't shield them from bad publicity.  If you really want to dig deep, the Copyright Office has the arguments people have made back and forth in the last several rounds here:

http://copyright.gov/1201/

scroll down and you can find the older proceedings. Those will have all of the older requests for exemptions, and the arguments for and against. Thank you, I'll have to take a look at the page you linked to. I hope many others do as well. Well, nobody thinks that lock picking tools and skills should be illegal for legitimate locksmiths. But those tools and skills could be used by burglars as well. So what do we do about a manufacturer who wants to mass produce lock picking sets and sell them to the public?

The basic gist of the opposing side's position is that we should keep these tools out of the hands of burglars, even if it means restrictions on locksmiths. To them, it's permissible collateral damage, rather than the goal of their policies. I  work in the industry and have a slightly different viewpoint. Most locks are already 'unpickable' and locksmiths simply brute force them open and replace with something new.

If it wasn't for the burglars and enthusiatic amatuers we would all still have pickable locks and my industry wouldn't be worth billions worldwide,  millions yearly to my company or put food on the table at home.

Locking the technology to break something to a few legacy players in the market stifles innovation and development/improvement. People feel reassured having the best locks on their home, proven to be the most secure and costing hundreds of pounds/dollars, despite the fact a burglar can get into even my home using nothing more than a half brick to smash a window. iPhone Repair store owner here - I just wanted to say thank you guys for all you have done for me. Owning a small business was a dream of mine, and your guides have helped me immensely. Keep doing what you are doing! I'm Ron Burgundy? It sounds like you're making a go of it. Running your own business is hard, draining, all-consuming, and immensely rewarding. Well done!

iFixit is doing everything we can to support local repair. Running your own business is hard. We've launched a ton of open source resources with [iFixit Pro](https://www.ifixit.com/pro) to help make it easier.

I love (DRM Free) [lamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gId6nrMDmUU). Stay classy. This is incredible! I like to surf around on iFixit getting caught up on the latest repairs, and I have never seen Pro! You guys are awesome.  Just wanted to say, iFixitPro is a genius business model. Win-win-win. Good luck!  To answer your question, yes. yes you are Ron Burgundy. :) Gotta do it or auto mod bot will remove your comment Oh I know, I just felt it deserved an answer as well. :) What is your opinion on manufacturers using security screws? Does this have an impact on users' right to modify their products?

They may come up with new types as the current stock become more commonplace. I think it's bullshit. You'll notice that they only use security screws on the outside, and go back to regular screws once you're in the device.

Fortunately, it's not too hard to make a new screwdriver. It's a pain and has a big environmental impact, but it's quite a bit easier than the cat-and-mouse we have to play on the software side of things.

But it's a good metaphor for what's happening everywhere. Who owns our things? The manufacturers think that they do, and the rest of us should just fork over money whenever they ask us to.

It's a purposeful and overt slap in the face that acts to erode the can-do tinkering culture that has built the modern world.

If we succeed at neutering this generation's ability to tinker, who is going to design the next generation of hardware? Every engineer that I know got excited about their discipline by taking things apart when they were young.  If you can't open it, you don't own it. Thank you for your sincere answer.

I agree on the tinkering aspect, which, of course, extends to tinkering in the digital world as well. I became interested in computers because of the availability of mechanisms to open them and swap out parts, so I totally agree with your very last point. If you were forced, by a sealed court order from a secret court, let's say, to choose one action that your average consumer could take each day to help eradicate DRM and the DMCA's overbearing rules over said consumer's legally purchased property, what action would you have said consumer do? 

Asking for all my friends.  I would start every day with a steaming cup of [non-Keurig coffee](https://www.hilinecoffee.com/pages/alternative-to-keurig-kcups) in a [hacked Keurig 2.0](http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/heres-a-super-easy-way-to-get-around-keurig-20-drm-restrictions-121214.html). 

Then I'd mosey on over to the [Cydia](https://cydia.saurik.com/) app store to buy some awesome apps like [BatteryDoctorPro](http://www.ijailbreak.com/cydia/batterydoctorpro-cydia-tweak-ios/) and support indie devs that have opted out of Apple's walled garden.

If my hypothetical consumer happened to be a coder, I'd donate a bit of time to help out some awesome open source apps like [RomRaider](http://romraider.com/) (an incredible open source engine modding / repair tool).

But even if I wasn't a coder, I'd sure as heck take advantage of the freedoms that open source communities like [RomRaider](http://romraider.com/) (car repair), [FarmHack](http://farmhack.net/home/) (ag equipment hacking), [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) (better wireless router firmware), [SamyGo](http://www.samygo.tv/) (replacement Samsung TV UI), [iFixit](https://ifixit.com) (repair guides for everything), [OpenECU](http://www.openecu.org/) (car tinkering tools) have created for us. There are hundreds of tools out there that have improved existing products with incredibly useful hacks, tweaks, fixes, and documentation. Use them! It'd be even better if you didn't use K-Cups or even if those K-Cups were recyclable. "In 2013, Keurig Green Mountain produced 8.3 billion K-Cups  enough to circle the Earth 10.5 times. (In 2014, output shot up to 9.8 billion portion packs.)" [source] (http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2015/01/28/379395819/coffee-horror-parody-pokes-at-environmental-absurdity-of-k-cups?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_content=20150129) 

This is an unrelated environmental issue, but since we're on the general topic of protecting our rights and justice, let's avoid perpetuating other injustices while we're at it. Both battles are related in that both problems stem from corporate entities so busy trying to make as much money as possible that they disregard the significance of the negative impact their actions have.

*EDIT:* The Keurig machines can remain in use - instead of throwing out the whole system, we can replace the k-cups with re-usable filters (such as those offered by a company called Ekobrew). Saves money and coffee can be poured into them for each use. San Francisco Bay - the maker of what I believe are the cheapest K-Cups available are 98% biodegradable AND they recently had a 100% free offer to ANYONE for a Keurig 2.0 "freedom clip." 

The coffee is also really good. I use the Ekobrew and love it...only downside is the crippling irony of taking the same process (grind, scoop into filter/filtered container) to make coffee using what's essentially a fancy water heater But the entire point of a Keurig machine is that you can just put in the cup and brew.

If your going to be putting the coffee in a filter then brewing just but a regular small coffee machine. You just have to stick one of the "keurig brewed" labels in the keurig somewhere to bypass their k-cup restriction and allow you to use the Ekobrew reusable k-cup. There are instructions online. My neighbor borrowed one of my "keurig brewed" k-cups last week to bypass it. 

I still have an old one before the DRM problem, so I've been using the Ekobrew for years.  https://www.gourmet-coffee.com/Keurig-DRM-Freedom-Clip.html

This free clip will also fix the problem Whoa, didn't expect RomRaider and OpenECU to be mentioned here.  Use that with my tactrix cable damn near daily! I have Keurig 1 and used a ton of non-Keurig coffee. Mainly get my own coffee, grind it, and use a reusable cup for smaller foot print.

Can't believe they did that for the second one. Thanks for the links, some of those projects sound up my alley, and thanks for your repair guides - 5 repaired instead of junked laptops and counting, specialized tools be damned!  Makes me want to buy a Subaru, if there wasn't already a reason. I use RomRaider with my tactrix cable to tune my WRX and love it. Wow, I just use my 20 year old Bunn coffee brewer. There _is_ no DRM. it's fricken coffee, why do you even need a Keurig thingy to make fricken coffee...DRM or not.

It's _coffee_. About the easiest thing in the world to make right with minimal effort and equipment.  I fix iPhones for a living, started about 3 years ago after discovering ifixit. Thanks! So my question is.. How will these new policies effect iPhone and mobile repair?  PS: are you guys hiring? :) I have concerns about the future of mobile repair.

Anytime you fix something, you're playing on someone else's turf. Manufacturers create these devices and have a huge number of tools at their disposal to prevent repair.

Some of them are practical: proprietary screws, glued together designs, difficult to open cases, and hard to source parts.

Some of them are legal: trademarks on critical components, restrictions in the app store (Apple won't approve apps that report battery or hardware state), secret diagnostic codes, unavailable service manuals, and all the DMCA concerns that we're raising here.

iFixit's mission is to teach everyone to fix everything. We've spent the last decade systematically eroding barriers to repair. If manuals aren't available, we write a new one. If parts aren't available, we make them or part out existing products. If people are having trouble starting repair businesses, [we share resources to make it easier](https://www.ifixit.com/Pro). Now, repair faces legal threats. So we're laser-focused on removing them.

We'll continue to fight for the future of repair as loudly as we can, for as long as we have the breath to do so. As someone in the IT field it bothers me that it is illegal and incredibly difficult to find the tools and resources to fix my own phone even though I legally purchased it. Thank you for all your hard work They're always hiring! And their office is awesome. https://www.ifixit.com/Info/Jobs Can confirm. Work at office everyday. CHASEDOGGGGG Hi, Chase! Everything you said is correct. I understand that this is a problem because of how it essentially redefines ownership, but what are the main implications of this beyond not being able to jailbreak your phone or hack your own car's computer? Do you think that this will get extended and be applied to other things as well, or will it just apply to those things which are explicitly stated? 
Also, how can these rules be enforced? I can't imagine a scenario in which I would get "caught" if I had a jailbroken iphone or a modded computer in my car.
I want to thank you guys for everything that you do to protect our digital freedoms. Lots of people take this for granted and if it weren't for people like you, then who knows what sort of stupid laws we would be living with right now! Phones and cars are just the start. Electronics are moving into everything from coffee pots to washing machines. DRM is the logical next step for just about every product that a manufacturer wants to control.

Section 1201 stifles innovation. When coders and hackers that developing tweaks for new products will turn them into criminals, they stop coding and hacking. We've seen far more diesel modding tools come out of Canada and the UK than we have in the US because developers are afraid.
 There's drm cat litter machines!  There are fucking cat litter machines??? Oh you are in for a treat. I wish this were my first time reading about [DRMed cat litter machines](https://medium.com/@jorge_lo/the-future-a-cat-litter-and-drm-6dbda26428f8). Wait a second...

&gt; It didn't stop beeping, it knew this wasn't its SaniSolution. Somehow it knew. I wasnt able to even force it to run without the solution.

&gt;But the worst part of all is that people report the machine runs fine with no solution at all. Supposedly when run without the solution, the granules are no longer sticky and arent tracked as much.

This actually suggests that the company went to considerable engineering lengths to deliberately degrade the products performance to maliciously enforce a razorblade sales model.

And I absolutely believe that's well within the realm of possibility.

Fuck that company. The message I'm getting from this article is that if I build my own cat litter machine that doesn't have intrusive DRM or require 1st party cartridges people will buy it in flocks. Part of it is what happens if you're "caught" doing *something else* that a copyright holder or a manufacturer doesn't like. Maybe that's selling add-ons that compete with theirs. But that's not illegal, so they can get you for a 1201 violation instead.

As for what other things the law applies to--it's actually not specifically about cars, phones, 3d printers or anything else--it's about *anything* that has DRM controlling access to copyrighted work--which includes all sorts of software as well as media like books, movies, and music. Hi Sherwin! It's great to have a lawyer here to back us up.

Sherwin filed an exemption request for using the feedstock of your choice in 3D printers. You can submit your comments in [support of his exemption here](http://dmca.digitalrighttorepair.org/). Hey Kyle, just saw you and Parker tweeting and figured it's be fun to drop in--thanks for letting me!

Also, we're asking for the ability for consumers to rip DVDs and other video media so they can space-shift them onto their own tablets etc.

Also particularly important to me, [personally](https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/copyright-law-and-my-mothers-heart), is the request by medical device advocates and the Berkman Center to make sure that people can access the data on the medical devices that keep them alive. So like using generic ink in a 2d printer?? Security guy here. I don't do much research professionally, but I do tinker from time to time. Were I to find something exploitable after breaking DRM (which has a fairly broad definition), I'd keep my mouth shut, especially considering the charges I risk [start at a felony levels](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/01/obama-wants-congress-to-increase-prison-sentences-for-hackers/) (pending congressional approval). Now let's say I'm not a good guy, and I'm fairly clever. I keep my tracks covered and exploit my vulnerability from now until the end of time.

My industry is in jeopardy of losing the race against the blackhats. When knowing about weaknesses is outlawed, only outlaws will know about weaknesses.  The DMCA is of course an American problem. Could you explain how it might effect the situation in other countries? Is there a danger of this kind of limitation of ownership reaching other countries, or has that happened already? 

Edit: a word.  The DMCA itself is an American problem, but this anti-circumvention issue is also very international. For one thing, the DMCA's an implementation of the WIPO Copyright Treaty, a UN agreement that countries all over the world are obligated to implement. What's worse, countries looking for guidance on *how* to implement it look to the extreme example of the DMCA, so what happens in the US affects other countries in that way.

But more urgently, there are efforts afoot to work DMCA-style anti-circumvention language into binding international agreements, and these are generally being negotiated in secret. The [Trans-Pacific Partnership](https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp) is one such agreement, and TTIP (between Europe and the US) is another. The parts of the DMCA we're talking about were actually passed because of international treaties (that the US content industries lobbied for when they couldn't pass an earlier form of the DMCA in Congress).

So there's treaties at the World Intellectual Property Organization that require member countries to have DMCA-like laws. 

[WIPO Copyright Treaty](http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/text.jsp?file_id=295166#P87_12240) (see Article 11)
[WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty](http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/text.jsp?file_id=295578#P141_21174) (article 18)

Those laws don't have to be as stringent as the DMCA--they don't, for instance, have to prevent circumvention for non-infringing uses--but they're required to be there anyway.
 In your country's laws, I'd look for the terms "technical protection measures" or "technological protection measures" --which tend to be international law-speak for "DRM." Amazon started their smile program sometime last year with a wide assortment of charities available to donate to. Naturally, I picked you guys right off the bat. Is the money you guys get from that program substantial? Does amazon release any sort of stats detailing how much ends up being donated? Keep doing great work!  I'm glad you posted this.  I didn't realize EFF was an option until I read your comment.  Going to start going through smile for my Amazon purchases. I love the videos! Can you make the people say the part # of the screwdrivers match up to what the parts are in the store? I will mention that to Gwendolyn. Our [photo guides](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide) do link directly to the screwdriver that you need, and usually go into more detail than the videos. I wholeheartedly support the right to jailbreak your phone, but what are your thoughts about the responsibility of the manufacturer to you as a customer after you do so? Too often people are used to working in the world of x86 desktop platforms where you really have to try to actually cause damage with software, in mobile electronics there's many realtime systems to be managed, the failure to do so properly being potentially hardware-ruining. Your phone probably has 10 to 30 unique power domains. Sequencing them is the job of software and doing that incorrectly can be disastrous. From my perspective, manufacturers can condition certain parts of warranties and after-sale service on not breaking some things. That's fine. If I bought the thing, and then hack at it, and you don't want to help me fix it later, that's cool. But my hacking/fixing/breaking the thing I bought shouldn't be illegal in itself. I can't pick a defined side with this one. I wouldn't want to be driving behind a car that is running custom software made in the drivers garage. That's a safety hazard in my opinion. His car directly affects mine and my safety. 

However with personal devices like computers, tablets ands phones it should be completely alright. As long as the user isn't fucking with the radios than whatever he does is his business. It doesn't affect me at all THANK YOU iFixit for bringing this to light!

Why do we, consumers, NOT accept being "locked out" of having Admin Rights on our desktop/laptop computers yet, inexplicably, accept this on our phones which ARE computers after all?? Just because "It is what it is" is NOT an excuse to accept this! Google is trying to change this with Nexus devices...but this needs to be universal. 

Rooting/Jailbreaking ONLY gives the OWNER of the device CONTROL over said device. Why is this expressed by carriers as so awful, so dangerous? BECAUSE THEY want to maintain FULL control on OUR devices. Why can't I remove apps/programs I don't wish to have? Why can't I install an ad blocker if I WANT to? Why can't I make adjustments/tweaks to volume levels, startup sounds, etc...? If I don't want to hear a startup sound EACH time my phone starts up why is it I am BLOCKED from turning that off unless I am rooted?

I hope there is a SERIOUS effort to shift away from the current model. Locked bootloaders and un-rootable phones are making it harder and harder for people to make REASONABLE adjustments to our OWN devices we own and paid for...sometimes to the tune of nearly $1,000 USD.

So thank you iFixit for this...thank you Redditors for voting this up...and thank everyone for the discussions on this topic. The system is in need of change and I'm hopeful we move in the right direction and reverse this nonsense. Did everybody notice it's also my cake day? You should send [Maria Pallente](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Pallante) a cake! Thank you so much for doing this AMA - this is a subject close to my heart, as I was part of the original iPhone jailbreaking scene (albeit in a small capacity).

My question is simple: I don't really have any money, but I have plenty of free time and a strong computer science background. How can I best help the cause? PM me or [sinak](http://www.reddit.com/user/sinakh). We're putting together a cadre of coders to help us make forms like [this one](https://dmca.digitalrighttorepair.org/). The [source is here](https://github.com/digitalrighttorepair/dmca-exemptions).

Also, if you have a talent for reverse engineering ECU's, that's a good start. We all know about the companies that are trying to prevent us from using our devices the way we want. However, are there any organizations, other then the ones already mentioned (EFF, iFixit, etc.), that are also helping lead the fight? Maybe other corporate entities? As for corporate entities, it depends on what exemptions are at stake. Companies that resell and recycle used phones and other hardware are certainly interested in unlocking and jailbreaking, but might not necessarily take in interest in, say, film students being able to rip DVDs for their projects.

Software companies are used to using DRM for lots of things, so they can be skittish about calling for reforms to the whole law, even when it creates problems for them sometimes.

(also, plug for my organization: publicknowledge.org) Kyle, do you still have that awesome old Gibson bass? '65 Gibson SG FTW. I haven't written a repair manual for it because it just won't stop truckin'. Who or which group are responsible for such restricrive measures? Since unfortunately money seems to speak louder than number of signatures, how much are they spending to lobby for these measures, and how much money will it take for us to lobby against them? The DMCA, which contains the anti-circumvention laws we're talking about here, was lobbied for by, among others, the MPAA and RIAA. The lobbying effort leading to that was concentrated in the 90s. 

We've seen more and more people pushing back against expanding copyright laws--and maybe we've reached a turning point in the past few years. We're seeing the proliferation of bad laws slow and maybe even stop--the thing we want to do naw is see if we can get good copyright laws passed. That will be the true test of whether or not this is working, but it's a change that takes years (decades, sometimes) to see all the way through do you think the term "jail breaking" is working against your cause? Maybe! It also seems like a very popular term and the one that people understand when we say it, so I try not to overthink it. Language is really important, but there's a balance to be struck between deliberate, pointed word selection and ensuring that people have a shared definition. unrelated: this is the first AMA response i've received, i will remember this forever. Sorry it was a resounding "Maybe!" but CHERISH IT ALWAYS Why are there over 1,000 upvotes yet only 50 and 60 signatures on the petitions? Also what would be first thing you would do if unlocking became legal? Our [dmca.digitalrighttorepair.org](https://dmca.digitalrighttorepair.org) form is up over ~~1052~~1670 comments to the Copyright Office. So people are speaking up. Thank you, everyone! &gt; signature

Well, they got 80 now 12 minutes later, so give it some time.
 Favorite place to eat in SLO? A while back on ifixit's website, it said they were teaming up with Apple to make future devices more repairable for the users. What ever happened with this, and why now is the opposite happening? That [particular story](http://fortune.com/2014/04/01/apple-buys-ifixit/) was posted on April 1 of last year. That was an April Fools joke, I guess they got you good... How long does it take and how much does it cost for you guys at iFixit to do a successful teardown on new devices?  (Min/Max/Avg) Usually there's three or four of us working on it. 6-14 hours each, in parallel. Frequently we're doing it in the middle of the night our time.

When we fly to Australia to get a new iPhone, it's around $1800x2 for flights, a couple nights in a hotel, $1000x2 for the phone (we buy a backup that we often return), and $25 for beers afterwards. 

But it's worth it to know what's inside! Because dammit, we're curious.

Once we're done with the teardown, we use the same phones to write a comprehensive repair manual for it. That takes a lot longer than the teardown, and is a much more useful long term resource. Did you know that you've probably won the award for most acronyms in an AMA title? LOLTY DILLIGAF?! How can I put my skills to use full time and quit my 9 to 5 for a cause like this? 

I code for a living (web apps, python, web test frameworks), I am constantly fixing things for friends and family (have bought tools from iFixit) and consider myself a jack of all trades when it comes to cars/motorcycle mechanics and fabricating.  I understand the hacker/startup mentality, but I still have to eat.  Hey there! I'll chime in and say that EFF is hiring frontend and backend web developers in SF at the moment. If you're interested in moving to SF, check out the positions: https://www.eff.org/about/opportunities/jobs Pre-DMCA copyright laws seemed to focus on protecting monetization rights of intelectual property creators. For instance, you could buy a book, make as many copies of it as you wanted for personal use, but it was illegal to sell copies of a book.

With the DMCA it seems now it is illegal to modify a product you purchased even simply for personal use, with no intent to profit or distribute the modified or derived work.

Is this an accurate interpretation and is there any precedent  prior to the DMCA for copyright laws regulating how individuals can use purchased products? Pre-DMCA laws would still have prevented you from making those private copies--it just was nearly impossible that someone would (a) catch you and (b) bother to sue you, if you weren't actually selling/distributing them, and weren't planning to.

A lot of times, people like to say that technological change made copying so much easier. Well, that's true, but that's not what changed the tenor of enforcement so much. It was that technology made those private copies MORE VISIBLE. And then you ahve a way to find and target the individual users making private copies, but also there's an increased push to target the makers of tools.

But that change actually predates the DMCA. The DMCA itself is more of a symptom of a larger tren--but one with real consequences that we need to address directly, too. /u/kwiens : Why do you guys (iFixit) offer non-standard pentalobe driver sizes? Your site suggests people buy a [P2 screwdriver](https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/P2-Pentalobe-Screwdriver-iPhone/IF145-096-3) to fix their iPhone when, in fact, a [P1 screwdriver](http://www.kctoolco.com/wiha-26761-precision-p1-pentalobe-screwdriver-p/26761.htm) is the correct size. What gives? how is it a *right* to bypass DRM? freedom of speech is a right, freedom to bear arms.... but to bypass drm? how is that at a all a right? Why is it that the EFF is against the development of vulnerabilities for software exploits yet at the same time be for jailbreaking iPhones? Hi, thank you for doing an AMA. 

My question is why does the  EFF oppose disclosure rules for political ads on the Internet? 

FEC chairwoman Ann Ravel proposed that we simply look into the matter of bloggers who are paid to espouse a political opinion or political YouTube videos - neither of which is currently required to disclose who paid for their opinion - the EFF released op ed pieces suggesting that free speech was under attack, as did a number of similar groups. 

The lack of these disclosure requirements allows big companies to create the illusion of public consensus on an issue in their favor. The EFF employs smart people who are absolutely aware of this. That suggests to me that someone is paying you as well.  Okay, my question: What the fuck did that title mean? I think it had something to do with computers, and phones, but other than that it seemed to be a jumble of tech jargon. ELI5? Dear iFixit, most of the equipment you sell is very high quality, but why doesn't your[ screwdriver set](https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/54-Bit-Driver-Kit/IF145-022-1) have a good surface to grip?

I know you have 3 o-rings down there, but that means I have to grip that exact spot to have any kind of grip at all.  Can you put knurling on it to give it a better grip?  I feel 99% of the time I use [the torque bar,](http://i.imgur.com/VtBXA1t.png) it is because the driver itself doesn't provide enough grip.  When I hold the driver naturally, my fingertips barely touch the top O-ring. 

I have a [boxer set](http://i.imgur.com/ueld1P0.png) that has a great grip no matter where  your finger tips are.  The only downside is I have to replace it every 2 years or so because I wear the rubber off with heavy use.   What are your guys opinions on Safe Harbor? In my opinion, fixing the DMCA requires removing the liability black hole which Safe Harbor creates. If you're open to modifying Safe Harbor provisions for content-aware distribution networks, like Facebook, YouTube, even Reddit, then we can talk about these other changes, like to Section 1201.

But without serious reform of safe-harbor, all these other measures need to stay in place as stop-gaps.

I'm not saying that an ISP like TWC or Level3 needs to be responsible for what is transmitted, but if you're a commercial entity which wraps your content in branding and sells ads against it, you need to vet your material the same way NBC or Fox does, and if you miss something, you need to be liable for the damages.

Lets fix that, and then maybe there will be an incentive to properly monetize digital content? What concerns do you have for public safety once individuals get the ability to tinker with their car computers? I'd have concerns that an inexperienced person would disable necessary safety features and endanger others.  Can Bitcoin be used to fight back?  Our new [Digital Right to Repair](http://www.digitalrighttorepair.org) campaign is brand new and we forgot to add a bitcoin option. Doh! Soon.

So [give your bitcoins](https://supporters.eff.org/donate) to the EFF! Let's say hypothetically that I just recently found out a way to connect my car to a wireless router and SSH into it. I used a username and password that I discovered from an undisclosed source. In this scenario I gained access to the computer in my car to change the background image on the dashboard display. What are the possible repercussions of this (if any) that someone would be able to impose on me using the DMCA? What freedoms from copyright do you fight for? It would be unrealistic to have all created content copyright free wouldn't it? iFixit is an open source community. And we very much believe in open source principles. That said, copyright has a placeand supporting DMCA reform doesn't mean that we're advocating for an overthrow of copyright altogether. Specifically, there's a section of the DMCA (Section 1201) that makes it illegal to circumvent a digital lock over the top of copyrighted content. 1201 doesn't take intention into account. So, a consumer hacking their own car, or jailbreaking their own console, or unlocking their own tablet, or hacking their own calculator (not to pirate content, but just to tinker) could run afoul of copyright law. 

That's what we are trying to change. [Here's a specific list of the freedoms we are seeking from the Copyright Office right now](https://dmca.digitalrighttorepair.org). And we will continue to support wider DMCA reform in Washington.

It's triple jeopardy. 

1. It should be legal to make tools to bypass DRM. (It's not.)
2. It should be legal to use those tools to access content or hardware that you own. (It's not.)
3. It should not legal to steal or distribute that content.

1201 makes the first two illegal, which is unnecessary since #3 has always been illegal. The problem we're talking about here isn't even *really* one of copyright: it's a system of "para-copyright" built on top. In other words, the DMCA's anti-circumvention provision doesn't say anything about infringement, just circumvention.

We can have a lively policy discussion about what sorts of uses should be considered fair use, or what business models can be successful. But by putting a blanket restriction on all sorts of circumvention (except through an onerous once-every-three-years exemption process), the DMCA short-circuits those conversations. What's your opinion on the current state of DVD.ZIP and Blu-ray ripping laws, and how's it's illegal to play a DVD on Linux? This has been discussed extensively but I would like your opinion on this:

What do you think of companies that allow bypassing DRMS, but offer no support in case a damage in the equipment itself happens? 

(Still happens with jailbroken iPhones, **at some stores** we are denied service when jailbroken, even if my screen is broken which has nothing to do with me jailbreaking.) I sell products on the web and have found that presentation can do wonders for your sales. So over the last 5 years I've invested in thousands of dollars of photo equipment and hundreds of hours in honing my skill. I frequently find my expertly crafted photos and sales pitches on other vendors websites all over the world -- and while it's quite frustrating, I do have legal recourse. How would the changes you are proposing to copyright law affect me?


Also, regarding car computers. As you may be aware, computer driven cars may soon be the norm. Shouldn't the govt be allowed to prohibit modified computers of such cars for the safety of everyone?

Thanks for doing this AMA! Why does google always return iFixit results without any actually fixes? -_- There is a difference between software and hardware in most people's minds. I think most people take it as fact that closed source, compiled software is not owned in that its innards cannot be exposed. But in the case of hardware  most people believe they own its components, not just the whole working device.

I am just posing a philosophical question here. Do you believe that hardware is fundamentally different from software? And that our rights with regard to it should be different? I live in SLO and I remember my friend and I walked into your headquarters once on accident thinking it was a public store location for parts or something. It got kinda awkward when we found out we weren't supposed to have gotten in without key card access, but the door was propped open with a sandal and people were just chillin'. Anyway, I guess this isn't really a question, so once again I'll let myself out...? Do I have a snowball's chance in hell of repairing a non-operational HTC One M7 battery without totally obliterating my Digitizer/LCD? Do you think when "The Internet of Things" really starts changing the way we interact with the world around us within the next few years, these new technologies will give a stronger or weaker case for DRM? Will hacking your fridge, washing machine, or oven create a situation for manufactures that makes it difficult for them to determine if a warantee claim is valid or not due to improper and unsupported use? What's going to happen the day someone burns their house down because they changed some hidden settings in their internet-connected oven? I totally believe people should have control over the products we buy, but as this technology permeates everything around us, the stakes will be much higher for improper use. 

Thank you for the AMA.  To the iFixit crew. Last April Fools, you actually got me (where you said you were bought by apple) and I am forever hurt. My question...how are you going to win back my trust? Why is unlocking your phone such a big deal, according to your topic title? Don't people normally use Chainfire's rooting methods? Or how about Geohot Towelroot? Aren't lots of hackers working on root access? Unlocking your phone seems pretty trivial to me.  Can you just explain what all of those letters stand for? I find this whole thing very confusing and don't care much, can you tell me why I should care? Hey, Sprint Employee here. I've noticed a lot of people lately have been curious as to why Two Year Contracts and subsidized phones have been going away and every carrier is now stuck on financing or lease agreements.

The way I've understood it has mostly been because of the bill passed just last year deeming all carriers domestically unlock their phones for multi carrier use.

This obviously becomes more costly for carriers assuming they now have to support every band/network. 

Most everyone I have talked to assumes that T-Mobile started this phone financing thing and the other carriers said, "That's a great idea" and hopped on board.

Please for the love of god, tell me the way I've been viewing this, and that your influence on this is the correct assumption.

And if so could you please elaborate further on phone unlocking and the reasons you stand behind it? The iFixit in my town improperly fixed my phone and robbed me blind. From this experience, I hate your company with a burning passion. Should I give y'all another chance? Why? Some devices have solid software sales because they're locked down, like the Nintendo 3DS. When the DS's "DRM" was defeated, piracy in the form of flash cards became the popular way to play games on the system, having a significant effect on sales (which hurt smaller developers).

How do you promote freedom without facilitating piracy? Hey guys,  I met you in Nairobi, Kenya back in 2011 while you were working on some sort of movie in relation to technology around the world. I was just wondering, did it ever get finished? I forgot what it was titled and couldnt find anything when I searched. Hope the business is goin well! It's called Fixers! And we're still working on it. As it turns out, making a movie takes a lot of time and effort. And we've been pretty busy lately working to defend an owner's right to repair. But stay tuned! We'll get that movie out eventually. Do you have to be a pretentious, preachy, condescending prick like Cory Doctorow to join the EFF? Just curious. Because it feels like he's always yelling at us that we're not doing it right.

I'm all for the EFF, don't get me wrong. You guys just need more even-headed evangelists.  In order to understand the complete situation... What is on the other side of the coin, why would people want to have tighter copyright laws? I just want to say that I like your guys guides and access to parts for iPhone repairs. Granted, I ended up spending like 400 dollars repairing and then breaking my iPhone 5 like 4 times, when I could have sent it off for 99 and got a replacement, but still, its nice that I now know I never want to do that again. If this comes off as snarky, I don't mean it to. I legitimately like what you guys are doing, I just suck, and the damn parts are so tiny.

And since this is an AMA and I have to ask a question, do you like pie? If so, what kind? iFixit is militantly pro-pie. And for the love of lemon meringue, we will fight to defend the rights of fellow pie-loversif those rights should ever be jeopardized. Problem isn't the law. Problem is the underlying business and political culture which gives impetus to such law and the enforcement of it.

Striking down a law isn't enough. What's being done to change the fundamental business and political reality which created the law?

If people weren't signing up for contracts with locked phones, there wouldn't be locked phones being sold. 

If elections weren't consistently won by whoever threw the most money at campaigning, then politicians wouldn't be reliant on outside funding to stay in office, and the ability to pay for laws would be severely diminished.

 ...huh? While the manufacturers are obviously doing this for anti-competitive reasons, it seems to me that they are aided by the way our view of government has changed in recent decades.

When the culture of car-customization began, most Americans viewed the government as there to provide basic services but otherwise get the hell out of their way. No politician won a campaign by promising to 'keep America safe'.

If someone modded their car badly and caused a serious accident as a result - that was on them. They paid the consequences and everyone else went on with their lives.

It seems today that people are obsessed with potential risks and demand that the law is used to eliminate the smallest possibility of danger.

Mechanical car hacking is still allowed because it's always been around and people generally understand it. If manufacturers tried to legally restrict you from choosing your own tires or installing extra headlights it would be *very* unpopular (not that they haven't tried anyway).

But the electronic version of the same concept is much easier to attack. Most people don't understand their car's electronics, and certainly don't understand why the ability to hack them is necessary.

What's more, because people don't understand them it's very easy to spread the idea that a hacked car is automatically dangerous and likely to veer into oncoming traffic at any random moment.

Unfortunately, I can only see this getting worse instead of better. If you look at the self-driving car situation, you can see many people already tying themselves in knots obsessing over safety and legal liability issues. 

The reality is that self-driving cars are going to vastly reduce the number of accidents and fatalities, and the very rare occasion when an innocent pedestrian dies because the car made a poor choice will be dealt with as accident-fault questions are now: in courts.

But people are easily spooked these days. The government must keep everyone safe. It's almost impossible to believe that people will be allowed to hack their self-driving cars electronics in *any* way. Ever.

I don't like it, but even if you win this round, the future looks bleak for hacker freedoms.

Thoughts? I'm really glad I saw this. I'll definitely be doing all I can to help!

I have a small phone buyback program and I'm not really sure if my issue is directly related to your cause, but it's close (I think). I see phones in all kinds of conditions. I sell a lot of the phones to repair/refurbishing business and the topic of "repairing" the IMEI came up. There are multiple tools out there that allow it, but we were discussing the legality of doing it. We came to no conclusion because we didn't really find much on the subject, but what you have here seems to be related (I admit, I didn't read through all the links, but I saved it so I can later). We found multiple references on different forums like XDA that all reference the same Senate bill that never passed, but it did specifically mention altering the IMEI being legal for repair/refurbishing.

Obviously we know and feel that it should be illegal to clone a good ESN onto a blacklisted phone. We were specifically trying to understand the legality of removing the bad logic board from a broken phone and replacing it with a good logic board from another broken phone and repairing the IMEI to match the phones physical IMEI labels. There are companies like Asurion that have their own branded IMEI labels in their refurbs. I've never used the IMEI repair tools so I'm not sure what they actually change in the phone, but to me it seems like if it is legal to print your own IMEI label to match the phone then it should be legal to repair the IMEI to match the OEM label.

So! If I have a perfectly functional logic board and a phone that's beyond economical repair due only to fails on the logic board and I swap them, is it legal to repair the IMEI to match? Is it actually legal to print or swap the IMEI labels?

I really appreciate the work that the EFF and iFixit are doing! 
I can't thank the iFixit crew enough for the guides, too. Your breakdowns/guides helped me expand my business by allowing me to inspect and understand the device before I tear into it and potentially ruin something. I'm eternally grateful! I try to order my tools from you whenever I need things faster than using my regular supplier. My order yesterday was processed fast too, so thanks again!! Why do many acronyms? Do signing petitions actually achieve anything?  Any plans for an EU store? Shipping is incredibly expensive from the US to the UK. Especially heavy stuff like some of your fantastic toolkits We actually already have an [EU store](http://eustore.ifixit.com/)! We launched it in August 2013, and we've gotten great feedback on it ever since. :) I did not know that... Looks like my savings isn't getting any money THIS month! =) Wow, I'm really interested to see this post! I've actually done some writing about 1201(a)(1) and am amazed to see people discussing it and caring about it too.

Here's the big problem I wonder if you can address: If there is no anticircumvention right for owners of copyrighted works, how are they to be able to monetize those works in the increasingly access-oriented market? 

Traditional copyright is all about *copies*; before computers, if you wanted to get access to a book, etc., you had to have a physical copy. That got translated into electronic works and stretched to cover copied files, etc., on mp3s and movies. But in the age of streaming, where no one really cares about having a copy of a movie, just about having *access* to watch the movie whenever they want, what's a filmmaker (or author, or songwriter, etc. etc.) to do?

The DMCA is the pits, don't get me wrong. But do you agree that copyright should cover access rights? If so, what's a better, narrower way to start protecting it? If not, how do we serve the traditional aims of copyright law, incentivizing the production of new creative works? When will you guys release your first rap album?  When you buy something from a company, you buy it subject to terms and conditions that you agree to follow. Copyright law aside, isn't it unethical to breach your contract with the seller?  There is no place in the contract where AT&amp;T, for example, says they will encrypt your phone's bootloader, preventing you from modifying the OS or uninstalling certain programs. And if there was such a place, it would be in really tiny print.

They get away with it via ambiguity -- "but you didn't agree you'd HAVE that right, did you? So we'll just assume you don't."

I am a software developer and the whole thing is unreal. AT&amp;T and Verizon can get away with selling gimped phones (phones you can't modify the OS for -- i.e. root) without (at least) making it clear this is what they are doing. They sell you this locked POS for hundreds of dollars, then claim ignorance and unseen rules if you complain.

Their argument (what I've been told) literally goes like this:
"But it works, right? We didn't sell you a BROKEN PHONE RIGHT? You can call with it? Access email with it? That means we can lock the OS!" How much did you guys get in Amazon smile money last year? I want to make sure my support of the EFF is actually getting to you.  What are the digital locks on hardware?  Do they restrict you in anyway?  The digital locks on hardware often come in the form of restrictions on the built-in software or firmware. EFF is applying for an exemption for car repair, for example: in order to repair or conduct security research on the car itself, you may need access to the computers or code that are part of the car.

Nearly all hardware has a software component at this point, and that's been very good for a lot of reasons! But one negative consequence is that it's made legal restrictions on software a hardware problem. So without the hardware locks we can download anything? Is this something like jail breaking the iPhone so you can download anything?  What do you think about Project Ara? Hey iFixit. Thank you for all your guides. They make my everyday much more easier. Please continue.

Would you either like USB Type C or Thunderbolt on the new MacBook air?

Sincerely,
Apple Employee at Denmark.  You're welcome! Good question, let me look into that. Reading this post I finally made this connection: surely whoever coined the term "jailbreaking" your phone is an idiot, as the very term itself sounds illegal and surely must impact decisions somewhat, or has in the past.

Is there really a good reason for the term having that name? It's breaking free of Apple's protective jail. but yeah, negative connotation. I see, fair enough. It still seems counter productive to use the term going forward, as the first thing most people think of is an actual jailbreak.

Knowing technology, I understand the term to an extent (though it's not an issue I care too much about, admittedly, however I am for a free internet so I am interested by proxy) but the majority still don't. In BSD terms, a "jail" is a sandbox that software can execute in isolation from the main system; to an app, it looks like it has a full system to work with, but the OS is actually limiting what it can and can't touch. Apps on phones work this way too, they cannot interact with other apps, files, or other system components directly. 

"jailbreaking" is *escaping* the jail to interact with the underlying OS. It lets apps touch other apps running on the system, as well as access the filesystem outside of the jail.

Jailbreaking pre-dates Apple's devices, as it's a specific form of privilege escalation exploit on Unix-like systems with jail/chroot mechanisms. From a geek perspective it makes sense, in the case of the original iPhone it was locked down in "chroot jail", so you were literally "breaking out" of that jail.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot I remember a while back when iPhones were a pretty new thing, and awesome people like you fought to make jailbreaking legal (as it so obviously should be for devices owned by the consumer). Thank you for fighting the good fight, and for doing this AMA.

I haven't kept as up-to-date on this subject as I should have, but what is the current legal status of jailbreaking/rooting a cell phone? I remember a while back it was looking like it might no longer be legal, but I don't recall what actually happened there.

Thanks again for doing this AMA; I'm off to sign the petitions you linked right now. This question is a little more complicated than it seems at first, so I have to break it down a little bit.

First, there's the question of whether jailbreaking is actually affected by DRM laws; in other words, is a person jailbreaking their phone triggering the statue by circumventing technical protection measures. Many people assume yes, so let's go with that.

We're right now in the middle of a "rulemaking," where the Copyright Office and Librarian of Congress accept submissions for exemptions to those anti-circumvention rules. Those rulemakings happen every three years, and each time you have to start from scratch. Just because something was approved in the last cycle, doesn't mean it will be this time.

Three years ago, EFF won the exemption about jailbreaking and rooting cell phones, so for now you're allowed to do that under anti-circumvention laws. The petition linked above is in support of our *new* application to do that again. I totally get why we're focusing on phones.  But shouldn't the real argument be reforming the laws that surround patent/copyright/DMCA?  Certainly there have got to be other groups with similar goals so that you can march up the hill like the League of Justice dropping in to kick a little ass.

It just seems weird that the Copyright office should grant freedoms instead of grant restrictions.  That just tells me the system is completely broken. You're 100% right, jfalcon206. We're not just focusing on phonesEFF is submitting a bunch of exemptions, and other groups are too, ranging from security research to car repair (yeah) to DVD ripping to ebooks and so onbut the system itself needs fixing.

It's the triennial rulemaking now, so we're going to fight for as many user rights as we can get. But in the long term, I think many people are on the page that changingor heck, repealing1201 is what needs to happen. Presumably you've been around the block a few times.  What would it take for people to repeal 1201?  How can we make that a grassroots campaign especially as this congress begins to set agendas? Patent trolls baby. Good idea! Let's [fix the DMCA](http://fixthedmca.org/). Jesus Christ I dunno why this made me laugh so hard I have to spend the next 20 minutes cleaning my keyboard. I was not prepared. I know it would be asking too much, but I honestly think it's sad that we have to ask what we should be allowed to do.

I think it should be all the way around. Copyright should specify only the few things we are NOT allowed to do with our own copies, that we bought, and are ours. Like, say, redistributing them without permission, broadcasting them in full, etc.

Everything not prohibited should be implicitly allowed.

Copyright laws have changed to effectively do away with ownership of what we buy. When someone sells something, they shouldn't be allowed to dictate how I use that something, what I do with it. Some restrictions would arguably be ok, like not redistributing, etc, but for example, Microsoft telling me I can't install my copy of windows in a VM?? who are they to decide that? I bought one copy, now it's mine, I'll install it in a fucking toaster if I want to.

EDIT: rephrasing as a question, do you think that what I'm asking makes any sense legally? IANAL, so maybe I'm way off.
 You're not way off. This would be a much better system than what we have today. In fact, it's how the bulk of copyright law works.

The anti-circumvention rules in DMCA  1201 are an exception. They create a blanket restriction and allow for this weird rulemaking process to create temporary whitelists of allowed uses. An easy way to fix this would be to require actual or intended infringement for something to be a 1201 violation.

There have been proposals, like the [Unlocking Technology Act](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/new-bipartisan-bill-proposes-real-fixes-bad-copyright-law), that would do that. Unfortunately, it's very hard to get legislation through this Congress! You guys (iFixit) charged me 10 dollars to apply tempered glass to my iPhone. It was also tempered glass I already paid for. The same with my mother. Then you charged my step-sister nothing for hers a few days later. My step sister is pretty, but you guys made me feel really unpretty. Can I have my money back? 10 dollars is a lot these days. I'm sorry to hear about your negative experience.  I believe you may have us confused with another company.  iFixit.com does not own or operate any repair shops and we would never make a customer feel that they are not pretty.  Further, we actually don't do any repairs for our customers. We love our customers, but repair is not a service that we offer.  The idea is that by offering parts at lower costs and providing free instructions on how to replace parts and repair your device, you will be able to save on labor. Yeah, I'm pretty sure this wasn't us. We've never installed a screen protector or run a retail storefront. What do you have to say to developers whose work is rampantly pirated and stability affected by jailbreaking hackers? &gt;What do you have to say to developers whose work is rampantly pirated and stability affected by jailbreaking hackers?

/crickets Yeah that's what I figured.  So fuck jailbreaking. Maybe it's because you loaded that question like a .44 magnum? Former reverse engineer here, Why not just fight for the repeal of the DMCA? It was passed to prevent piracy, and piracy is already being attacked directly. Apple for example told Congress that itunes would never work unless the DMCA passed, meanwhile there's a dozen stores today that sell music without DRM. DRM is a joke, and after being beaten round after round with crappy implementations of encryption they just cried to the government until they made it illegal to edit your own files. Forget fighting so hard to unlock phones, you should be fighting this hard to repeal such an onerous law. Like Lawrence Lessig says, stop hacking at the branches and strike at the root.  I think they were nieve in thinking DRM would work, but I don't think they knew it would be nearly as ineffective as has been proven over time.

Seriously, when the DMCA was drafted, I didn't even have DSL yet, just 56k dialup. Knowing how to compile and run code was FAR more out of reach than it is today to the average person, and DRM circumvention was not *nearly* as easy as it is today.

In the short term, I can kind of see how that would appeal to them, not that it excuses it at all. We really need to reevaluate these outdated and broken laws to really address the issue, the growth of technology blew up faster than anybody really expected.

As a result, it's totally outpaced law to such a degree that in the time a law can be passed everything could be different! I'm a software developer. I earn a living based on people paying for my work. I am very concerned with groups like the PirateBay and people who subscribe to pro-piracy beliefs are undermining the economic system that allows music, software, movies, and books to be financially viable industries. I'm also worried that groups like the EFF are working to undermine copyright through legal battles.

I'm less concerned about the DMCA than I am about the undermining of the financial undermining of creative industries. While I do support any efforts to reduce the length of copyright terms. Personally, I think a 10-30 year copyright term is plenty sufficient. I also tend not to get too judgmental of people who pirate *if they are legitimately poor* (because "blood from a stone"). I see a lot of connections between the EFF and pro-piracy groups, which leads me to believe that the EFF is not working in good faith towards protecting the interests of creators. Rather, I believe the EFF is acting like a politician - being deliberately vague about their attitudes towards piracy while working to remove roadblocks to stop piracy. I've also read [ the article ]( http://scripting.com/2005/03/29.html#breakWithEff ) by Dave Winer, who was an early supporter of the EFF, who ultimately turned his back on the EFF after discussions with the EFF chairman, saying that the EFF cannot support copyright *at all*.

My main question, then, is **how to I support copyright reform without supporting groups, like the EFF, who I believe are secretly working to facilitate piracy by constantly aligning itself with pirates in legal-battles?** I realize that one flippant answer you might give is that the EFF does support copyright (and in the same way that Doctorow (a former EFF employee) also says he supports copyright - i.e. he 100% supports piracy), but actions speak louder than words, so don't give that answer. &gt;I see a lot of connections between the EFF and pro-piracy groups, which leads me to believe that the EFF is not working in good faith towards protecting the interests of creators. Rather, I believe the EFF is acting like a politician - being deliberately vague about their attitudes towards piracy while working to remove roadblocks to stop piracy.

DING DING DING!

Well said. 

Edit: good link too. This excerpt perfectly sums up my own reservations:

*  *"Instead of being aligned with users, the EFF is aligned with the financial interests of the electronics and software industry."* What's that iFixit? I can't hear you over the sound of you trying to vilify bonded displays.

How do you have time to get involved with fixing the DCMA when you're too involved with complaining that displays went from two air-gap layers to none? It sounds like you're trying to justify your "scoring" system that brings in more clickbait links.

That's... quite sad if you think about it. &gt;...that brings in more clickbait links.

Yet another thing they have in common with the EFF! Great username Can you describe one word about how enjoyable the future episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine season are? In one word... Hmmm.....

YOGURT!!!!! Terry loves yogurt... Terry *really* loves his yogurt. What's your favorite animal? OOOH!

You know what? I love dogs.

But lemme tell you something - I've been preparing for this Adam Sandler Western, and I have been riding a LOT of horses.

And right now, they are my #1 animal right now. **I LOVE HORSES.** I love them! They are so huge, and magnificent, and beautiful, and strong! I'm telling you - they are definitely - I think they just beat out dogs for me now. I'm gonna have some horses. Terry Crews is going to have some horses at a stable near you! &gt; Adam Sandler Western

Now we're all in big... big... trouble.  Kevin James is an overweight train robber with a heart of gold, Adam Sandler is his wise cracking horse, and Rob Schneider is a... Cactus?!? Rated pg13. But Rob Schneider is about to find out that being a cactus... *Isn't so easy!* a herp a derp a derrrp ["It's Jim Carrey in 'whatever, you'll pay to go see it, fuck you'."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFLuIn6lj5g) Terry Crews ain't gonna let that happen. The more I read this AMA, the more I think that Terry Crews is a dog trapped in a humans body - I mean that in a good way! His energy, excitement and love of other people is incredible, inspiring and friggin adorable. What do you think about the other "Old Spice Guy" Isaiah Mustafa? Have you guys ever talked or seen each other? Yes! I am good friends with Isaiah!

What people have to understand about the Old Spice ads is that Isaiah is for the *ladies.*

Isaiah is for the women who buy Old Spice for their *men.* And the guy'll say "Get me some deodorant" and the women will say "Oh yeah, that's the man YOUR man can smell like!" That's Isaiah you know?

But what you gotta understand is that Terry Crews is for the GUYS.

I'm saying *Hey, you, you stink! You need to shave. You need to get your thing together!* I yell at 'em! I scream at 'em! In the commercials, I punch people! And sometimes women might be like "Oh, this is a little too much." But the guys get it! They're like "You're right, I need to do something." So guys respond to aggressive advertising.

So the genius of Wieden + Kennedy is that they recognize both segments. 

And the world will EXPLODE when we do something together.

**Can you imagine?** So then the Bruce Campbell commercials were for men and women?! That seems sound. Smells like I sound, at least.  Just the thought of you guys collaborating makes we want to go out and buy some Old Spice deodorant right now. Thanks for answering! HAHAHA! That's great! My boss showed me the musle music one during lunch nye I almost chocked from laughing so hard.  FLAME SAX! MUSCLES MUSCLES MUSCLES! Pop p p p p power! I'm not even paid to say this but Old Spice really is a great deodorant. The smells are all really good, even for adults. Which most other men's deodorants seem to lack.

The commercials are a little odd, but they make a point and that point is that Old Spice is for men that want to actually smell decent and not like a fucking bottle of axe. I will fully and shamelessly admit that Old Spice advertising worked on me, because there is currently a bottle of aftershave in my bathroom right now that I got purely because of what it says on the back.

"If your grandfather never wore it, you wouldn't exist."

Damn Old Spice. Point made. And I mean shit, they were right because my girlfriend loves it. Holy shit - amazing transparency and self-awareness.  So the Smellcome to Manhood commercials are for moms buying kids their deodorant? Groovy. Nah, those are for the teens that think it'll make them grown up. 

Axe worked a similar way for awhile. I was in middle school during Peak Axe Usage amongst the American populace. Those were dark, stinky days and I was a lame kid whose parents bought him Old Spice.  I now have all old spice crap in my bathroom because of Isaiah. My girlfriend slowly bought it all. So, their marketing strategy worked. 

Your commercials just kick ass though, love them.  Frankly, the Old Spice marketing is genius. I've got about $150 worth of Old Spice stockpiled in my house because I'm a sucker for those ads! It really helps that their deodorant and body washes smell amazing. It would be an explosion of suaveness.

Yeah. Yeah, I'd pay to see that. The Avengers of body products. Hey Terry, huge fan!

What was it like working with Christian Bale in Harsh Times? 

Also could you comment on this (from IMDB):

&gt; In the scene when Jim (Christian Bale) and Mike ('Freddie Rodriguez') visit Darrell (Terry Crews), after shooting the scripted material, they found they still had the location for two hours, so they began to improvise. They ended up with a thirty minute scene of the three of them talking about their lives in-character. According to Christian Bale, it was one of the funniest experiences of his career.

What did you guys do and is this footage available anywhere? Sorry we didn't get to this! I didn't want him to miss his flight. I'm sure he'll be back, though. He was one of the most positive people I've ever done an AMA with.

If he, Keanu Reeves, Jeff Bridges and Weird Al formed a positivity super-squad... who knows what could happen?

^Let's^add^Jeff^Goldblun^in^there^too.^And^Guillermo^del^Toro... Damn, this was one of the coolest questions. Who's the funniest one on the set of B99? Andy Samberg. Bar none.

Can I tell you something about Andy?

Andy Samberg basically *is* the glue. He is the guy who makes this show go. And I'm gonna tell you why: he is so selfless. He makes sure that ALL of us are included in everything. It could easily become the 'Andy Samberg show' but he didn't want it that way. He recognizes the talent that's in each and every one of us that it's very humbling, really.

People don't understand how hard comedy is. And it's funny, because he'll GIVE us jokes while we're there. He'll hand us things, he'll tell me to go here, do this, and the man knows his stuff. And Andre and  I will just sit there sometimes and wonder, because here's a guy who's new to TV in a lot of ways - he did SNL, but acting as a character, it's shocking how great he is. But Andy is my man, and he is the funniest guy on Brooklyn Nine-Nine, *bar none.* I call him my little brother, cuz I feel like he *is* my little brother.  Whatever he is doing as "the glue" is clearly working. The chemistry amongst the members of the detective squad on B99 is apparent and feels very natural.  I recently started watching B99 and watching it, you just sense how much the cast likes each other, love working together, you can feel it, and few shows can pull that off.  Brooklyn 99 is the tits! I watched it from day one and just love that group. Some cheesiness but so little it does not matter. Chelsea is my fave besides Adam. She is hilarious in her role. Great show in the same vein as Parks and Rec or The Office. Worth getting into for sure!!! On a side note, Chelsea and Andy are childhood friends. I like the way they recorded it this season. Really gives you that Law and Order feel, but with a comedy feel with too. The camera work is amazing. "Do I even weigh anything to you?"  "nope" "Like a couple of grapes." I've always thought that he seems like such a genuine guy!  That is really touching. I hope the show stays as fresh as it is, and is on for a long time.  &gt; Andy Samberg basically is the glue. He is the guy who makes this show go. And I'm gonna tell you why: he is so selfless. He makes sure that ALL of us are included in everything. It could easily become the 'Andy Samberg show' but he didn't want it that way. He recognizes the talent that's in each and every one of us that it's very humbling, really.

i've watched many a sitcom in my lifetime and it's definitely true that you need a full cast to make a show work. the fact andy realizes this makes me respect him so much more. Nice try Andy.  This might be the very best set story I have ever read on reddit. Awesome. That's so lovely! On B99 it seems that all the characters have an equal part to play and it comes across as such a great show and somewhere nice to work as well. Easily the funniest show on TV at the moment  Do you actually love the song 1,000 Miles by Vanessa Carlton, or did you just have to pretend to for the White Chicks script?



^^Because ^^I ^^*love* ^^that ^^song ^^and ^^I ^^love ^^your ^^rendition You know? The Wayans Brothers basically put that song in the movie, and I practiced that thing *non-stop* for probably... a month. I mean, I had all kinds of renditions, I had different moves I was doing, and let me tell you - one thing that people don't know, is that when we shot that scene, I did that in one take.

Because I was SO READY TO DO IT.

It was like... It's finally here, I've done it so many ways and it was so comfortable. We asked Kenan, and he said "*Dude, you can't get any better than that. That's it."* and they were all just cracking up, just bawling out, they didn't know what was coming! And when I did it, they just DIED. 

And that scene, and that moment, changed my life forever.

And that's for real. 

Because I remember feeling the confidence that I was funny, and that I could just be ME, and people would like me.

There's nothing like people accepting you for being yourself.

It changed me forever.

Because so many times you're scared, you think that people will laugh at you, judge you or mock you, and I learned to just go with my flow, and it's never led me wrong - not once.  You're amazing.  Keep being you, Terry. Terry, I can't read 1 post of yours without having my mind blown emotionally. It's getting really misty over here. Terry is probably one of the best people on this Earth on pretty much all aspects. He's pretty humble, hilarious, amazingly talented artist, fucking ripped, a nice dude, and can sing 1,000 miles beautifully. 

Terry Crews for president of the world.  Its got electrolytes... http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xe42sz_white-chicks-thousand-miles-song_shortfilms Thank you for your service. Hi Terry! Just thinking about you makes me laugh!  How much time do you spend each day working out?  Also, do you have any interest in playing an action hero?

Thanks for doing this AMA.  Enjoy your flight!
 Hahaha!

I spend... almost 2 hours a day working out. It can go from 1.5 hours to 2. And on the weekends, I usually spend about 45 minutes - just 5 days a week kind of thing, and on the weekends, I always run. I run at least 4 miles *every day,* nonstop. Running clears my mind. I have what you would call ADD. I have to be active nonstop, because it makes me normal, regular, calm. If you see me, and I'm calm, I got my workout in. And lifting heavy weights, and running, just gets me to a normal place. 

Oh yeah! I mean, I play a hero on the Expendables series. But I could do more. I gotta tell everybody - when I look at Liam Neeson, Sly, Arnold, all these guys - my best, best roles might not happen until I'm 55 years old, you know? Look at Denzel! I looked at JK Simmons, all these *wonderful,* wonderful actors doing great, great work and they're well after 50. So I think Terry Crew's best role - I haven't played yet.  I need to know how many calories Terry eats in a day. Terry is 6'3", 46 years old, and weighs 245 lbs. He works out intensely 7x a week. Assuming he is natty, to maintain, he would have to eat around 3587 calories per day. He'd be eating around 196 g of protein daily.

[Source](http://iifym.com/iifym-calculator/) Hi Terry. We've all seen you singing in the car before (White Chicks, Click). Now the question on everyone's mind, do you sing in the car in real life?
 I *jam* my ass off in the car.

HAHAHAHA!

Lemme tell you something - when I'm in a car, the beats are flying, I'm singing! Because people think when me and Jimmy Fallon did our lip-synch duet, I would sing Ebony &amp; Ivory in the DRIVE! I would sing Luther Vandross to Beyonce, then I'm rapping along to Kanye. My car is my concert hall, OKAY?

My kids even know that! They'll be like "Stop already!" Because once I get going, I won't stop.

Especially if I know the words. If I don't know the words, I'm making up words.  Do we get a video of you dancing and singing Taylor Swift's "Shake It Off" like of that one cop? I never realized I wanted something so badly. I don't watch Brooklyn 99 that often because I do not really watch television anymore but if they have a cold opening that would be perfect! Can we get a youtube series of you singing those songs?

A full Terry Crews "A thousand miles" would be awesome and hilarious at the same time. "500 Miles" would be even better. Anyone here would LOVE to be present for that.  I'd pay for it.  I love the fact that your kids have been tired of it for a LONG time - makes it waaay funnier. What's your favorite kind of yogurt ? Aw man. You know, I gotta go with mixed berry. 

I'm not too greek-oriented, I ain't gonna lie to you. I like the good ol' fashioned full-fat milky Dannon with fruit on the bottom, it's almost like a damn dessert!  I can completely picture this conversation being had while Terry eats yogurt.  There's lots of spoon pointing and matter-of-fact style eyebrow raises. God Damnit. WHERES THE GUY THAT DOES THE SKETCHES!?! [homie I tried](http://imgur.com/Ot0vFMx) Hey Terry,Any tips for a guy struggling to find the motivation to work out daily, and just practice better fitness on the whole? TREAT THE GYM LIKE A SPA. 

Yes. It has to feel good. I tell people this a lot - *go to the gym, and just sit there, and read a magazine, and then go home.* And do this every day.

Go to the gym, don't even work out. Just GO. Because the habit of going to the gym is more important than the work out. Because it doesn't matter what you do. You can have fun - but as long as you're having fun, you continue to do it.

But what happens is you get a trainer, your whole body is sore, you can't feel your legs, and you're not coming back the next day - you might not come back for a *year!* 

I worked my way up to 2 hours a day. I ENJOY my workouts. They are my peace, my joy - I get my whole head together! I value that time more than my shower! And it really gets me together. But it's a habit.

There are times when - I'm not even kidding - there are times when I"m in the middle of a work out, and actually *woke up* because i am so engrained with going to the gym and being there - it's *that much* of a habit to me. The first thing I do in the morning is work out - I lay out my workout clothes the night before, and just hop in 'em. 

So lay out your clothes, and go to the gym, and relax.

HaAHAHAH!

But sooner or later, you *WILL* work out.  Thats the absolute best approach I've  ever heard towards going to the gym.  Thank you so much for that "No Pain, No Gain" is now "If it's not merry, it's not Terry" Put that on a shirt! Underdawg, you know what to do! He's absolutely right though. Once it becomes habit and something you enjoy, you feel wrong NOT going. I work a decently "strenuous" job and my coworkers always ask "how do you workout after working all day?" The answer is simple, it's fun! I enjoy it. I get to clear my mind and bump some jams and just forget the whole day ever happened. The fact that it's good for you is just icing on the cake!  Thanks so much. First celebrity AMA I've participated in, and this answer gave me 110% satisfaction!  I've enjoyed going in the past, but I've been in a rut. Gonna get back into it now, thanks a lot Terry! Wow this is actually fantastic advice. Way better than the generic "gotta stay motivated" response.  This.  People talk about meditation for the mind and that is what working out is for me.  When I'm squatting my head is clear of distractions and my mind is focused solely on the weight on my back.   How much free old spice do you get? I GET TONS OF FREE OLD SPICE. And I wanna make sure it keeps coming! I *love* my Old Spice.

I actually shave my head every day, and every morning, I use aftershave - get that little tingly - and my head is nice and ready to go! I'm a fake bald! *fake bald high five*

Hair is a sucker's game. "That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!" If you're not bound to them they're pretty fun. 

I was in a rehab platoon in usmc boot camp and I'd spend a lot of my gear guard duty in a wheel chair. I'd just do a wheely the whole time. We also did drag races, jousting, and foot locker fly overs with them. 

The front of the squad bay had the skull and crutches from jackass "shoe polished" into it. They made us remove it one time. Can't remember what for. God only made a few perfect heads, the rest he gave hair!  For some. Alas, the lord gave, and the lord taketh away &gt;get that little [tingly](http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Shaquille-Oneal-Happy-Dance-Reaction-Gif.gif)

 You'll always be a true bald in our book, Tiny Dumb-Dumb What's it like working on Millionaire? How were you originally approached to host the show? You know? You can't fake liking people.

I like people.

And there's a lot of people who *are* hosts, or who are on TV, that don't like people, and you can *always* tell.

Like they'll host for the money - but they don't really LIKE people. And when the camera shuts off, they don't even look at 'em. I love meeting people, from all over the world, all over the country, and here I get to hand people money in hard times, you know?

It's like the job of the century! You answer questions, you give away money, and I always wanted to be that guy, bringing happiness to people, and I get to do it every day!

Well, it's funny, because TV, movies, whatever you thought you knew about entertainment has all changed. There used to be a WAY to be a host. You had to be a host "type." You had to look a certain way, talk a certain way. And what's great is that ABC came to me, and wanted to revamp it, and try a new way of doing things. And they told me "Don't be a host Terry. Be *you.*" And that's the same energy I bring to WORLD'S FUNNIEST FAILS, to MILLIONAIRE, is that I'm myself.

It's great to play characters, but I don't have any skeletons on my closet I"m scared to put out there. I wrote my book last year, so I'm free and clear to be myself! So when I get out there and host and meet people and just *laugh* - I'm not a motivation speaker, I am a motivational DOER. My job is to *show* you what's possible.

To *show* you that this kid from a little town called Flint, Michigan, can make it in America, and make it to the top, off of hard, hard work.

"The answer to your prayer does not come by talking. The answer to your prayer is answered by working." And I *got* that. And once I discovered that - only by working would I become what I needed to become.

And I decided to push myself *beyond.* There are times when I'm scared. I'm frightened I'll fail onstage. But i do it *ANYWAY.* Because at the end, you become somebody DIFFERENT. You become what you always thought you could.

And that takes courage. And i Practice being courageous. I have to do something that scares me every day. Really.  &gt; I'm not a motivation speaker, I am a motivational DOER. My job is to show you what's possible.

I have the biggest man crush on you right now. This reply is so full of motivation, thank you Terry for this great AMA. you're a great guy, Terry,  thanks for doing this ama.  i have to end this with a question mark? Idk why, but this comment was hilarious to me. Terry's comments make me really happy, then your naivety in this thread was the icing on the cake. Thank you and enjoy the gold.  I'm just going to throw this out there; I was actually on Millionaire this season and Terry was so incredible. This energy he has is the same when the cameras stop rolling. It was such a crazy experience, and meeting him was so awesome because of that energy he projects.  Hi Terry, first of all, I love you. :D

Second: I would like to know what do you like the most? Drawing, acting or playing football? Because you impressed me VERY MUCH with your drawing when you presented them at [Jimmy Kimmel Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKmsx_vv68k)! 

Third: How the fuck did you become so ripped? You're the one I would pick to fight The Mountain. Aw, I *loooove* being an artist.

And football is done for me. I don't want to commentate on it. That part of my life is gone. I really like the players, I like watching, but in regards to anything with football, it's over. I'm always sketching, I always have ebook with pens and paper, because that's where everything is - until you can see it, you can't really have it.

And I like to *DREAM* it. I used to be able to sit in the mall and sketch people, but now i"m too famous. I can't people watch anymore. And the acting is nothing more than sketching - it's the same stuff. Because you're creating something that doesn't exist, out of thin air, and you're bringing it to life.

So I look at acting as the same as being a painter, or graphic designer.  I think I've seen you around Pasadena, would you ever visit the art school in the area? This just made being a Graphic Artist sound badass.  What do you think of the casting of Kristen Wiig and Melissa Mc in Ghostbusters?

I loved your Drunk History with Wiig!! OH! I LOVE KRISTEN! And you know what? First of all, as a card-carrying feminist, I am a BIG feminist, anytime I see women being stars - the stars that they *should* be, and being featured, and being highlighted, it makes my heart happy.

Because it's long overdue. Women are great, and funny, and amazing, and smarter than men - for real! - and it's a reboot that needs to happen. There are SO many good things about that, what can I say? It's going to be a HIT. And GO LADIES! I'm with you! I can't wait to make the premiere! Terry loves equality 

Edit: I took the point about smart/talented women getting the success they deserve as equality. I disagree with anything that says "this group is better than that group". Every group of people have examples of good and bad people, general statements are wrong Terry loves yogurt Terry really loves his yogurt. You know Terry loves love. godamn ants I just ovulated... Me too. I'm a man, though.

Should I find an OBGYN now? Do I have to buy tampons? Oh god, what am I going to tell my parents... Terry Crews made you the best woman you can be? Oh my god...

OLD SPICE CAN DO *ANYTHING* I just stumbled across the "Scare Me" video by Major Lazer. That looked like such a fun shoot. How'd you get the part of THE Major Lazer, and how much fun did you have?
 AW THIS IS A GREAT STORY, great story.

I had been listening to Major Lazer for YEARS. I'm a big fan of Diplo, and all his music. And it's great workout music. I have to run angry, okay? hahaha! When I'm on the treadmill, I love drum &amp; bass, a lot of alternative, and Major Lazer - I listen to that album from beginning to end!

So I get a call from my manager, and he says... *you know, there's this group, I don't know if you ever heard of 'em, Major Lazer, they're doing a video, and they were asking if you would be interested? I was going to just pass, but you told me to tell you everything* - because i have this rule for my agent / manager, which is "I don't care if someone wants me to do the State Fair Pie-eating Contest - LET ME KNOW. Because i want the right to say YES or NO."

And he said "I was gonna pass, but I remembered you told me to bring you everything" and I went "MY GOD! MAJOR LAZER IS MY FAVORITE GROUP OF ALL TIME!" and he went "I am so glad i brought it to you!" and I said "I will do it for free! I will show up!"

We shot it downtown LA, it was over 3 days, and it was a BLAST. Lauren London was on there, and we had vampires, and all this, and it was just one of the BEST EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE. See - you have to understand - I never do anything for money. Ever. I do it for the creativity, for the excitement - I need to feel like something amazing is happening. And anybody who sees the video will know that it was incredible. 

And *listen* - if they ever do a Major Lazer movie: **that's me.**  Thanks for the answer, Terry!

[Here's the video for those who are curious to see it!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EiBJPMIn8M) How cool is it that a major actor loves dnb. You should get a dj alter ego and DJ b2b with Idris Elba aka Big Driis. Spin some old school jungle, breaks and DnB was gonna mention Idris Elba, beat me to it. I skimmed through one of his DJ sets, seemed like quality stuff, proper house, deep house, etc.  Yup saw him at Low End Theory here in Los Angeles. Great DJ. Saw an interview with him how he loves DnB and jungle. Used to go to raves in London when he was younger. Fuck DJing, leave that to the people who are good at it. Terry Crews as an MC alongside a heavyhitter DNB DJ would be the sickest show ever. 

HOLY FUCK the prospect of that is just too much for me right now. Dude, him with Spy, Markey, Original sin etc would be so sick.  Holy shit that's awesome man! What are some of your favourite DnB tunes/artists? (little plug for /r/dnb as well!) &gt;  if they ever do a Major Lazer movie: that's me.

Someone in Hollywood needs to make this happen. Hi Terry! When you lifted up the police car in the first season of Brooklyn 99, was the car real? Also how much do you bench? The car was real. And the fart was real. But they lifted it up for me. 

Oh wow, I only do... I never do one-rep maxes. But I have done 405 three times in one sitting. But I don't know what the one-rep max is. But that's where I've been at.  Euro training. As an ex football player in the NFL:

1. What are your thoughts about where football needs to go in terms of protecting it's players in the long run? 
2. With the kind of head trauma we've been hearing about, and long term health problems players face, what do you think the league can do to better help their aging members, and the sport itself? 

3.Do you feel any side effects from your time as a player?



P.S. Crossing my fingers for season 2 of World's Funniest Fails! More clips please! 1.) Wow, okay. You know what? Football is football. It's gotta be dangerous. If you take the danger out of football, it's not football anymore, it's beach volleyball - nothing against that. But there's a pride that came that knowing I existed on that field and *lasted.* You are a warrior. You don't want to go to war, and have nobody shoot you. You want to be in the thick of it, and test yourself. That's what the NFL is all about.  In regards to safety, it's all technique. If you see something that's dangerous, that is *really* life threatening on the field, you are witnessing terrible technique from SOMEONE - putting a head down, trying to steer someone, back in the day, when I first started, there were guys who would leave sharp edges on certain pads so they would cut people. It's weird because all this stuff is about that one little thing that gets you over - but if you play with integrity like 99% of the players in the NFL, nobody is aiming for knees or anything, you don't have time for that. You're just tackling! I don't know anybody who aimed to break someone's neck. But with technique, you can do it all. I got knocked out on Monday Night Football, and that was all through bad technique. So technique is **key** to safety.

2.) Wow! Um... I think a lot of that responsibility is on the player. Lemme tell you something: I'm gonna go deeper right now. 

When you're talking about an athlete, an athlete tends to become his *wins* and what I mean by that is - when they WIN a lot, and are successful, they tend to believe they are better than everyone else, okay?

So the rules don't apply.

So you get to do things. You get away with things. You get to go into the party. You get to use bad technique, and nobody corrects it, because you're the star and everybody panders to you.

BUT THEN, a tragic thing happens. What happens is inevitably you lose. Inevitably, you get older. Inevitably, you get slower. So if you live by your wins, you also live by your losses.

And now, you're worse than everyone. 

Once you're on the downswing, they don't want you anymore. A lot of problems that involve NFL athletes are psychological, more than they are physical. 

When you are losing, you are lower than low. I have had friends in the NFL who have killed themselves, literally. And played with guys who committed suicide because they are not playing anymore.

And what you need to know is that NOTHING that you've ever done - nothing that anyone could ever say to you, or whatever career you've had - can EVER DIMINISH YOUR WORTH as a human being.

You are amazing. 

So what happens is when you win it's a great day, and when you lose, you'll come back tomorrow. So the big deal, with most athletes, is having a right psychology of knowing that they're priceless, regardless of whether they win or lose. 

And that's the whole thing. Because when you are done with the sport, then you are okay. But now, what happens is when people are done with the sport, it affects you physically. I don't know anyone who's not been depressed without being sick. It comes hand-in-hand. But when you feel *good* about yourself, your body feels good.

3.) None. Not one bit. I am in the best shape I have ever been in my life.

HAHAHA! Can i break it down for that too?

A lot of people have been saying "*Hey, another clip show, what's the big deal?*"

The big deal is that this is for FAMILIES. If you look at it, what we do is basically clean up YouTube, so you don't have to. You can have a 4 year old watching right along with your grandma, and you're all laughing together.

That's what the WHOLE thing is. Because lemme tell you - I tried to watch YouTube with my kids, and then all of a sudden, some strange video will pop out of nowhere, and let me tell you - the evening's OVER.

Have you over had a friend send you something, and you wish you could unseen it? Let me tell you - I unfollow people, because I"m like "*What in the world - how did this end up on my feed?!"* 

I'd get scared if I were to watch the internet with my family. But this show makes it palatable for every member, and you can watch and enjoy it together. Adam Sandler hit me up after the second episode, and he said "I watched this show with my kids, and we laughed our butts off." So that's what my mission is. 

I'm waiting for the pick up- but I'm happy! I can't wait to do some more. You never run out of fails, that's for real. Hahaha! Goddamn. That's some deep thoughts by Terry Crews. This is a guy with a lot of passion and energy and conviction. This is a great AMA so far. TIL Terry Crews is not only physically impressive but psychologically astute and profound. Tip of the hat.  M'Terry &gt; Tip of the hat

Reminded me of the Colbert bit, Tip of the Hat, Wag of the Finger. ^*tear Both Crews and Ethan Hawke's amas were a lot better than expected. I've never seen an AMA, much less a *celebrity* AMA give such an in depth and sincerely thought out response. I thought I loved you before, but now I think you're my favorite. [Link for Crews hit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLZAPifDPb8) I sprained my ankle playing beach volleyball Terry. It's dangerous too. Favorite Super Hero and who would you want to play the most ?  You know?

Again... it's hard to pick a favorite super-hero. I always did love Luke Cage, and I'm really, really happy about who they cast in the Netflix version of Luke Cage. So that's something that's already done. But you know who else I'd like to play? The Silver Surfer. I always *LOVED* - I thought I had the build, the body, I could get on that surfboard, and if they ever do a live-action version of  Silver Surfer, I think that would be perfect for me.  You'd be the most jacked Silver Surfer in history. Galactus would ask for your permission before eating a Planet.  This needs to happen for the FF reboot. &gt;"^^^^oooo ^^^oooo ^^ooaaa ^aaaaAAAA AAAAHHHHH" \*slams into ground in the middle of times square\* GALACTUS IS **TOO POWERFUL** TO EAT ITS OWN ~~COMMERCIAL~~ PLANET!!" My favorite super hero is Terry Crews. Right? He is the shit. He's the only reason I watched the expendables. With all due respect terry, Never mind the surfer you should go full Galactus... Earth eating pooooowwwwwwwerrrrrrrrrr OOOOOOOOOOOOOOLD SPICE IS TOO **POWERFUL** TO BE CONTAINED BY PLANET CONSUMING BEINGS!!!!!!!

COSMIC SPICE POWEEEEEERRRRR!!!

*Galactus's head detonates in a glorious supernova, cuts to Old Spice logo with the traditional whistle* I hadn't heard they'd already cast someone, but the news that it isn't Terry Crews is quite possibly the worst news I've heard all week. How did they fail to realize that you're the perfect actor for that part? What's your favourite videogame? WOW.

Oh!

You know what? 

*Hmmm.*

Oh man, that's a hard one.

I don't play a whole lot of video games, but I gotta go with... Oh my god! There's so many! 

Hold on one second, I got it in my phone, I want to mention it right...

I really dig the Dragon Age game. I got it for Christmas. Dragon Age Inquisition. It's a Game of Thrones kinda thing. Madden is all good. And i get into a lot of kid's stuff, know what i mean? The Disney - the one - my son plays it ALL the time, and i hop on with  him - where you can play all the characters - DISNEY INFINITY!

Those are my top 3! That way you can play with the whole fam. Dragon Age and Madden - you're by yourself.  Thanks for a really cool answer, Terry! Terry Crews likes Dragon Age Inquisiton...

This opens up a lot of side questions, who'd you romance and why was it Bull? TERRY CREWS LOVES DRAGON AGE

Someone alert /r/dragonage  TIL Terry Crews plays Dragon Age. Oh my god stop quivering, heart.  2 Questions:

1. When do you find time to sleep?

2. How many times can you curl Andy Samberg?  1.) You know... there are times when I don't. 

But I've *learned* - this is Terry Crews. Terry Crews is *white-hot-to-FIRE.* When I want something - I literally write down my goals. I write down what I want, and then I go for it. I can't SLEEP until I've done something on every one of my goals. And sometimes, I'll sleep 5,6 hours. I'll get whatever I can in, and then I'm back up again. But it fuels me. I have 3 shows on the air at the same time. But it feels like *FUN.* I don't ever - NOT ONCE - have i felt like i was at work. EVER.

And it's because i'm achieving something. My job, as a human being, is to take something that was nothing, and make it into something beautiful. I don't care about money, or all that other stuff. To me, it's about improving YOUR life, someone's life, improving a situation, improving an art piece, improving a movie, or a tv show - it's all about taking something from one place to the next, and improving it.

Terry Crews is about service, and THEN you get the money. That's just how it is. 

2.) Probably about 5, 6 times. Then he would get a little tired, HAHAHA! You know what? Lemme add this: it depends on how still he could brace himself.

Because you can't pick up ANYBODY if they don't want to be picked up! IF your child goes limp, you can't pick 'em up! It's like an unseen force - if you don't let yourself get picked up, you ain't getting picked up! oh, third person alert.

Terry, would you consider petitioning for a role as leader of the pirate kingdom in season 2 [of the ABC comedy/musical Galavant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayzw6htpi2Y)?

Your physique and sense of humor would fit in tremendously.

Some guests so far..

Weird Al Yankovic  
Ricky Gervais What's your favorite color? My favorite color... is probably blue.

And it would be *navy* blue, like that deep, dark, blue, that's almost black, but blue.  So like those pants you buy, and ur momma be like why you buy black pants again, but you try to explain to her that, no mom, these pants are not black they are navy blue, but she had enough so now you have 2 pairs of black pants instead  But... you have my momma I enjoyed this because every other question ITT has been a variant of 'what's your favourite activity and why is it being stronk?'   Of all the characters you have played, who has been your favorite? You know, I can't say that, because they're like my children, you know?

You can't pick a favorite child! I mean, President Camacho is forever a part of me, a part of my soul.

I channel Camacho when I'm working out. President Camacho in the morning!

And then I channel Lattrell, because he's me in a lot of ways, you know? He's basically a cad-dish me. But there's a part of me that thinks I run the world, you know? My wife checks me. But Lattrell is one of my favorite, favorite characters because he really got his just deserts.

And then you have to go to Julius, from EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS. Quintessential dad. And he had to make ends meet in the hood, where you don't get second chances. And he's one of the funniest characters I've ever played. And now my character on Brooklyn Nine-Nine - the way I LOVE My castmates, my kids, my job - I would seriously go to blows for any member of the Brooklyn Nine-Nine Cast - Friday After Next, that was the one that set it off, me and Katt Williams and Ice Cube, this is where you get hood famous - you can't go south of the 10 in LA without everybody knowing who you are! And Cheeseburger Eddie, I mean it just keeps going! The Longest Yard - it was my dream to always *be* in that movie, when I saw the first one! And pulling cheeseburgers out of my pants! They're all amazing and like my kids.  Thanks for the reply! To me it is a tie between Julius and Latrell. Cheeseburger Eddy is an honorable mention. You got to protect the McNuggets! We got this guy Not Sure. 

That movie always cracks me up 5 cents worth of bread. 10 cents worth of Kool-Aid! Idiocracy is still to this day my favorite movie to watch, it has that real cheesy feel to it. I have to say you did an amazing job acting in that, and knowing that you enjoyed playing President Camacho adds so much to the movie. Terry, your buddy Schwarzenegger (sharing your birthday) has a new Terminator movie coming out. I know you're an Arnold fan but are you a big Terminator fan too? Will you be there on July 1st to see Arnold kick some ass?  Well, you know, I will be there. I was murdered in one of the TERMINATOR movies, haha! In the Christian Bale / McG version of TERMINATOR. I actually had a role in that movie. But it got cut out, and I was a dead body. So I actually am a part OF the Franchise! It was the fourth TERMINATOR! If you go to the beginning - I"m a dead body lying on a pile of dirt! And you can see my face - it's Terry Crews, dead! Hahaha! That's what you call an EPIC FAIL! Found a screencap: http://www.hotflick.net/flicks/2009_Terminator_Salvation/tn640/fhd009TRS_Terry_Crews_001.jpg Captain Lazer, before he was promoted to Major. Holy shit I told my friends 'I think that dead guy is Terry Crews' and they didn't believe me! Lmao. I don't know why, but that just made me laugh like crazy. The thought of you, some time ago, casually saying "Hey i think thats terry crews" and your friends just punching you in the shoulder like, "nah bro," followed by this very day where Terry Crews himself confirms that the dead man was indeed him, is hilarious. Or I just laugh at stupid things, oh well.  'REMEMBER WHEN I SAID THAT DEAD GUY WAS TERRY CREWS AND NONE OF YOU BELIEVED ME???!"

"... No" What are your lift numbers on the big three? (Deadlift, Squat, Bench) Amazing username  Bench 405x3

Also answered last time around 

http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/yyxxt/i_am_terry_crews__ama/c6022up What's your favorite book? OOOF.

OH that's hard. There are so many, so many!

But i gotta go with... there's one called... THE MAGIC OF THINKING BIG by David J. Schwartz. That book *changed my life.*

It made me think bigger.

It made me - instead of asking "Why?" i started to ask "Why not?"

Because you don't realize how you've been doing things in your life for other people. You know?

And i started to ask *What did I want?*

Because you realize - *I wanna do this because this is what my mother wants for me,* or *I'm doing this because my dad would really like me like this,* or *I'm doing this cuz my girlfriend thinks it's great.* But you're never going to do what's wonderful until you do what YOU want to do. 

And my mission is **to help you be the best YOU ever.**

Don't ever, ever compete with anyone. Just create. Because competition is really a myth. Imagine - if you go to 5th Avenue, and every store is Gucci, no one would go!

You have to go to 5th Avenue, and you have to have Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton - everyone has to succeed for you to win!

If ABC failed tomorrow, it's not good for FOX! Or NBC, or CBS! You know what I'm saying? 

It's not about competition, it's bout creativity. 

Terry Crews does not compete. Terry Crews *creates.* That's it.

And I will always be creating.  This is how I am starting to think as I start my own business, but you put it so perfectly.  Thanks!
 Mr. Crews, I recently got an interview for a casino and they asked me what I would do if I got $25 million. I told them that I'd pay you to hang out with me for a day, shirtless, and scream and yell at my enemies all while flexing. They thought it was hilarious and original and I got the job. Just out of curiosity, is that something that you'd be interested in doing? I mean, it would just be a chill day off...I only have like, 4 enemies &gt;.&gt; Patriots or Seahawks? I think the Seahawks are gonna win.  I think your most hilarious work was in "Everybody Hates Chris" by far. If my geography/research is correct, you personally didn't grow up in that sort of impoverished/gang environment Chris Rock portrayed in that comedy. 

The cheapskate/steetsmart yet empathetic "Julius" character was amazing. What was it like playing that character and working with Chris Rock on that series?

Did he create the character entirely, or did you feel you added your own twist, as I see 'Julius' as a personality, but with the comedy stylings of Terry Crews, if that makes sense?

Also, did that show at all relate to your own upbringing, whether it be socially/racially/culturally? Would you want to star in a comedy like that again with such strong racial themes?

 All Hale Caesar! Terry, EX3 made over 200 million worldwide. That's pretty good but could have done better if it wasn't leaked. What would Terry Crews do to the culprit who leaked the movie if you and the pirate got in a ring?  AND can you name 3 actors you'd like to see play the villain in Expendables 4? WOW.

Um... the first thing I would do... is...I would take those guys, whoever leaked the Expendables 3, I would make them sit down in front of their mom, okay? And basically let their mom give them a stern-talking-to about stealing, and what it makes you.

The thing is, what these people don't know, is that everyone, all the stars, are gonna be fine - don't cry for me, Terry Crews is gonna be great. **Really**! But what are you saying about yourself if you have a lifestyle of thievery? Slowly but surely, a little bit of your soul gets chipped away, and you wonder why you never get anywhere in life. I mean, Karma is a bitch, just to be frank. You really have to look at the little small decision that make a big, big part of your life.

*EVERYTHING* counts. If you hand out a $1 to a person on the street who needs one, or if you steal $1 from a tip jar - they might not notice it, but *what does that make you?* 

I'd make them stand in front of their mother, or father, and let their parents deal with 'em!

Justin Bieber is a villain. He's gotta be. I want him to be a *bad,bad,bad* boy. 

I've been trying to get Justin in one of these for the longest time. My NEXT deal would be Jackie Chan - he's gotta be *BAD* though. He's always been the nice guy, he's always been sweet, but he's gotta be VICIOUS, relentless- YES!

And the next villain I wanna see in the Expendables franchise is my man Dwayne Johnson. You know what? I wanna see a Battle Royale, Caesar versus Dwayne, in a blow-to-blow fiesta of carnage! HAHAHA! Dwayne...vs...Terry...

Damn it man, *MAKE IT HAPPEN* Somebody get Sly on the phone! Mom is always the scariest First off. You're amazing and I love you. 


What has been the hardest aspect of fatherhood?


How do you feel about breakfast for dinner? And do you prefer pancakes or waffles?


Who is a performer you've yet to work with but you'd love the opportunity to do so?
 

Do you sing in the shower? If so, what's your favourite song for that? "*BLENDIN'*.." Do you ever get back to Kalamazoo?  Go Broncos! Hi, Terry! 

A few years ago a 'Idiocracy' spinoff was teased to focus on the President Camacho. Is there news on that front? If not, how do you like to think President Camacho's rise to fame happens?  I just listened to your episode of *Take a Knee* with Adam Carolla. So many pearls of wisdom. You're accomplished in too many fields! My question is, where do you get your motor? Who do you have a man-crush on?  Who would win in an arm wrestling contest, you or Dwayne 'the rock' Johnson?     Who would win in an 
    arm wrestling contest, you or 
    Dwayne 'the rock' Johnson? Don't worry about the downvotes, haiku_robot. I think pronouncing "wrestling" with two syllables is perfectly valid. You're a good little bot doin' a good little job. *tousles hair* Do you have any pictures from back before you started lifting weights then that you are willing to share? I'm curious to see what a smaller/weaker Terry Crews looked like. He's probably been playing football since he was 10. I think he mentioned once that he started going to the gym at like 16 He said on Conan, he's been lifting weights since he was 14. I doubt he'd be that much smaller, just shorter [Found this from a google search!](http://imgur.com/gzuAwe3) When are we gonna see you as THE leading man in an action/comedy movie? Is America ready? I think you could definitely carry a movie on your own. Do you enforce the rules on your kids today that you did to Chris on Everybody Hates Chris?   Hey Terry! Do have a favorite painting or drawing that you've done? You are one handsome fella. Your smile is lovely. So are they your real teeth or veneers? Hi Terry.  Two questions, if I may, completely unrelated.

1. Obviously the entire world is curious about your workout regime, but I'd like to ask: what's your diet/meal plan like?

2. If a screenwriter wrote an epic part - specifically with you in mind - what would be the best way to get it into your hands?

Have a safe flight. Hi Terry! 

Last AMA you said you end a bench press at 420. Any improvement since then? 
Also, love you on Brooklyn Nine-Nine! What's one of your favourite moments working on set? 
 Hey Terry. Thank you for doing this AMA

What was it like, when you got the call to be in the Expendables, and did you know any of the actors personally, before joining the cast? 

Also thanks for being such a huge inspiration Hi Terry! I'm a huge fan of your stuff and I loved your previous AMA. How the hell are you so awesome? What song are you most excited to hear Katy Perry sing at the super bowl? Just wanted to say that my wife and myself are huge fans of yours.  Finding out a new episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine is available on hulu plus is one of our TV highlights every week!  The Eurotraining bit in My Wife and Kids still makes us laugh to this day. 

For our question.  We were debating the other night how much time you spent in the Gym.  So what does your weekly workout routine look like? What was it like working with David Ayer and Christian Bale? Why did they take away the Terry Crews Waze voice??? :( So I'm sat at the Airport browsing through reddit, and I stumble upon your AMA. Just as I start to read through the comments 'A Thousand Miles' starts playing on the radio... Now I'm sat here like a complete tool with the biggest grin on my face.

I'm a huge fan! (Obviously) And sorry if this has already been asked, but who's the most enjoyable character you've played? Do you hate Chris?  What kind of diet do you have to stay trimmed but bulked at the same time?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uBxxK4c3U&amp;t=6m25s 

I call bullshit  What are your biggest struggles while on the set of the show Game of Thrones? Very long hours. Because I love to sleep. I like sleeping more than most of my siblings. So staying awake and working long, long hours is very difficult.  Where in the world would you most like to visit? Ehm... I wanna go back to Iceland, but in the winter. It looks *so* beautiful.  Being a Belfast native, I'd just like to ask what it's like filming here?  FREEZING cold. But the people are lovely, so that makes up for it.  Have you had one of those "I can't stop laughing" moments on the GOT set? If so, what was so funny??? The one time was in series 3, episode 8, when I was supposed to laugh anyway - when Arya cracked up laughing at the news of her dead aunt - and I was watching funny videos on my phone, so I giggled endlessly, and they liked it, and so did the audience.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ja-VmdTPyQ what is your favorite guilty pleasure movie? Oh! JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE. It's like, about 3 girls that fancy this one guy, and it's so cheesy, but I can't stop watching it, ever. This is by far the most damning piece of evidence that you're a teenage British girl and that Victoria can perfectly voice a person through text. &lt;3 How's your left-handed swordplay coming along? MUCH better. I feel like I've improved a lot. I don't hit anyone, or myself, as much anymore. Still don't know if I could actually kill anyone though.

I could try? I volunteer as tribute. What one thing really pisses you off?  Patronizing adults, saying "*back in my day, blahblahblah"* because I'm sure they found it annoying in their day when adults said *back in MY day* - I don't know what it was like in your day, I was only born 17 years ago, so stop being patronizing about it! You'll understand when you're older.. 

^^^Bants.  At what point did you realize that Game of Thrones was becoming a huge deal? Season 3. At the season 3 premiere, we went to the Chinese Theater in Los Angeles, and stepping out of the car, with hundreds of people screaming my name, is when I realized that this show completely changed my life. It was very, very daunting - I found it quite scary - but it happened gradually, so I had time to get used to it.  Hi Maisie! If you were somehow elected as supreme queen of Westeros, what would be the first law you would pass as ruler? Ehm... oooh, if I was the queen of Westeros, the first rule... I would make everyone a Wildling, because I think their costumes are really cool!

It's probably the most shallow answer *ever*, but it's true.  Tommen would outlaw beets, so you're doing a bit better than him so far. Beets should be outlawed though!

ALL HAIL KING TOMMEN! House Schrute would like to have a word with you. Beets...bastards...battle of the blackwater Hi Maisie, thanks for doing this AMA. What's been the biggest change in your life since starting Game of Thrones? Also, which cast member is most like their character on the show? Being recognized in the street. I used to enjoy being quite anonymous, and now I have to kind of be aware that people know who I am sometimes.

Rory is quite similar to The Hound before breakfast, in that, if he hasn't eaten, he's kind of grumpy! haha! But I love 'im regardless.  I bet Rory eats every fookin chicken in the room for breakfast Yarp HOLY SHIT. he's...! that's...! WOAH. /u/Funslinger just had a life changing epiphany Hi Maisie, Do you still have contact with/see/visit the wolf from book 1 of game of thrones (nymeria i think) ?
 I don't get to see the dogs anymore. But after my dog (who played Nymeria) finished playing Nymeria, she actually went on to play Shaggy Dog, and they dyed her. She was the best behaved dog out of all of them, so she ended up playing all the other wolves, even though she was mine originally.  Yeah. It's cool! &gt;She went on to play Shaggy Dog

&gt;She was the best behaved dog

Does not compute The dog's just a *really* good actor. I heard might even be in the running for an Oscar this year. What are the chances that this dog gets an Oscar before Leo? Dyre wolf of Wall street? Because she's a dye-r wolf.... right? Hi Maisie! Just curious, do you get to keep Needle, or at least a replica of it for yourself?  Not yet! But I'm hoping to steal one in the future, so I can keep it for myself! Hello Maisie, has there been a scene so far in Game of Thrones that was particularly difficult?  There's actually a scene in the coming season... which was my most difficult scene to film. And I think fans are going to be really excited about it. More emotional than we've seen Arya in previous seasons. Oh, Mercy me. Heh. I take it this is in the books and we are all clueless.  Arya is Azor Ahai confirmed. Arya is Benjen  Wait, I'm confused. Just how hype should I be getting? **Valar Dohypis**

All men must hype More emotional than Nymeria, I don't believe it. Where the shit is that goddamn wolf anyway.

EDIT: yes, I've read the books, I know there are hints, but I want her back for real. :-) You have any souvenirs from the show at home?  I have sneakily removed some of the Faceless Man coins from set. And they have gone missing. And I have *NO* idea where they went! No one took them. You lie. Hi Maisie! I hear you're a dancer. What is your favorite type of dance and why?  I like jazz, because it doesn't matter what shape or size or length your legs are, you can use this dance to benefit you. Yeah. It's good for all shapes and sizes, I guess. You can modify it to benefit your body type. [Maisie Dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zczwVZzmuQw)

Edit: Another (non-dancing) [favorite Maisie clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_wkhdoE-c0) with Arya Stark, Drogo &amp; The hound at tampa Bay Comics. And yes that is guiness that Drogo and the Hound are drinking...

Edit 2: [Maisie trying out Nintendo 8-bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDOZbvE01Fk) Masie, when you came to Indianapolis, a guy in the con asked if you could read his name in the death prayer. After a bit of a laugh and doing it you said that was the strangest request? Has anything topped that yet? 

And could you put my screen name in one? A little bit of irony, i know. NO, that is still definitely the weirdest fan encounter that I've had.

I tell people about it all the time, it was so funny.  If you could meet any famous person or historical figure dead or alive who would it be and what would you do with them? Audrey Hepburn. And I don't know if I'd even want to do anything? I'd probably just want to sit and stare at her for a bit, because I think she's really cool.

I'd be starstruck. Embarrassing stuff, really. But it'd be worth it.  How do you managae to work school/college around your acting? Also, what is your favourite subject? My favourite subject when I was at school (apart from the usual drama and english) was mathematics, and it was really hard to juggle school &amp; work. And... I sort've... this is a tricky question - school took a bit of a back-seat, and I took my opportunities in live, and hopefully in the future, if I go down a different back, I can go back, get my grades, my certifications, and go and do something else if I want to. Elon Musk has said in interviews "If you have a good idea, go for it college will still be there."

I think the same applies to you. You've had (and do have!) incredible opportunities ahead of you and you can always go back to complete college. If you don't know the words to a song, do you improvise? All the time. I thought Taylor Swift's new song said "Something-something-Starbucks-lovers" when it actually said "I've got a long list of ex-lovers" and that was news to me. And I realized I'd been embarrassing myself for like 2 months! She doesn't say "starbucks lovers"? Are you shitting me?! I thought she said 'Star crossed lovers' as in Romeo and Juliet.. Lol, this is news to me as well http://41.media.tumblr.com/7f272a6b0d5857f30aa611e663a00dd0/tumblr_nij791rBPs1tdqm0do1_1280.jpg This is a meme I can so get on board with. Hi Maisie!

Do you have any favourite video games? A while back I saw you were a fan of Hat Films!

Absolutely loved Cyberbully and really looking forward to seeing The Falling. Me and my brothers enjoy playing a computer game called "Amnesia" which is *really* scary! 

We haven't completed it yet, but we're close. So, Maisie Williams' metaphorical brass balls are bigger than mine in *and* out of Game of Thrones.  Valyrian steel* Hi Maisie
Regarding the Last of Us, have you ever played the game? Do you it'd make an impact on your decision playing Ellie? (Personally I think you'd be spot on!) I've watched a walk-through with my brother, and our next mission is to play the game, and I'm really looking forward to it, because the walk-through was *insane.*  Favourite cartoon / show when younger?

Dexter's Lab was ace.  I used to watch Pingu *religiously* and it's about a little penguin, and that's basically it. But then this one episode came along where Pingu lost his mother, and it basically scarred me for life, because Pingu was crying, and I was crying, and then, yeah, Pingu was never the same after that.  What do we say to the God of Death? NOOT NOOT I also would have accepted NOOT TODAY Remember how much his dad loved to iron?  
It was a lot. He loved that shit.  
  
edit: wow! Thanks so much for the gold! NONE OF THEM WORE CLOTHES! Right, because his dad was always ironing them.

Edit: Reddit gold! Thank you! I'm curious how people handle children/minors on the set of a TV series with so much adult content.  Is there a lot of separation between the parts you film and other parts?  Are you allowed to watch GoT? I'm allowed to watch the show. I'm not around when they shoot the more adult scenes. But yeah, I watch the show, I enjoy it, and I feel like I'm a bit of a fan of the show. This gave me an image of Arya and the Hound sitting at a tavern watching the Mountain vs the Viper live on tv and being more engaged by the outcome than any fan watching the show Why are you so obsessed with the Lion King intro song? Because... it's kind of the only song that anyone can sing, no matter how good or bad their musical talent is. And it's just really catchy.

And I just like doing it to animals. And they quite hate me for it, but it's funny.

Like, I did it with a ladybird in a Vine. And immediately afterwards, it flew away. Which was very sad.  What you don't realize is that ladybird couldn't sing, and was very sad and jealous. But you gave it hope. It didn't just fly away, it traveled the world, watching every broadway show. And years later, when you least expect it, you'll wake up to a ladybird singing the Lion King intro song. Have you read the books? Had you heard of them before you got the role? I haven't read the books. And I didn't read them before I got the role.

I do want to read them but I'm going to wait until the season is finished. But I can't wait to see what really happens to Arya! Yes! Judging by the rate at which Martin's working, you'll probably get to act out what happens to Arya before we get to read it. Are you and Rory McCann really good friends still? I hope we have not seen the last of the Hound! We are very close friends. I saw him when I was at the SAG awards at the week-end, and it was really nice to see him again, and I hope that's not the last I see of him. ^^cleganebowl... ^^GETHYPE Is there any actors who you would love to work with? Um... I would like to work with... I really admire Charlize Theron, but I don't know if I'd want to work with her, because I'd be hugely intimidated, but I think she's a fantastic actress. Actually, Charlize Theron is a [GOT addict](http://screenrant.com/charlize-theron-game-thrones-interview-rothc-175696/) and would really like to play a part. So what I'm trying to say is, it could happen, and then she would be on your hometurf. Hey Maisie, can you say thanks to Aidan for us? HEY AIDAN!

He's just gone outside.

AIDAN - EVERYONE SAYS THANK YOU!

He's gone, but we'll come back to it in a minute so we can write his answer. Aidan's back now.

Everyone wants to say thank you very much. 

D'you have anything to say?

*FOR REDDIT!* I did it for reddit! - Aidan what just happened? Hey Maisie, I'll ask what everyone on /r/thelastofus has been talking about.

**Will you play Ellie in The Last of Us Movie?**

Did you do a table read of the script?

Do you *want* to play Ellie?

Thanks! THE LAST OF US movie is in very early days. I have spoken to powerful people who are getting THE LAST OF US on its feet. And I'm hopeful that I can play Ellie in the future, but we'll all have to wait and see.  My tear ducts are ready. I'm sad that I can't ever play that game for the first time again.  I grew very attached to the characters. Okay you've convinced me. Buying it right now. Be jealous of my first time experience. STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM SPOILERS

You're in for an amazing ride. Don't look up anything online, just enjoy.

The last of us is easily the best game I've ever played. Hey Maisie. Love your performance as Arya, GoT is hands down my favourite show on the air, and the amazing cast is to thank for that! 


My question is, how has the experience of portraying the character development of Arya been like, do you feel any similarities or differences between you and her? ...and also, do you ever look at chickens the same way anymore? 

 Heheheehee!

I think as I've grown up, as Arya's growing up, there's definitely similarities between us. And it's been really helpful for her personality to change as I've gotten older. And it's been great for me to make the transition into being an adult actor with the same character. And I still look at chickens and think they're delicious, haha! Do you have any strange habits? I follow you on Twitter, you're super cool. What's the funniest thing your turtle has done?  I came in, like 2 weeks ago, and one of my baby tortoises - one of the youngsters, if people follow my account, they'll know I had 3 little ones being born - and one of 'em was upside down in his dish, and I thought he'd drowned, cuz he was so little, and I went over and picked him up, and he was just in his waterfowl! I don't know how he did that, they're pretty study, but he was just floating around upside-down in his dish. And his head was out of the water, so he was fine.

I nearly cried, and then I realized he was fine! I was like "Goddamnit Stevie, don't do that to me!" Classic Stevie. Hot pie or hot cake? PIE!

I like savory pies, like meat pies.

I don't really like sweet food.  Hi Maisie! Is there anything you specifically find odd about American culture?  Ehm... I don't want to offend anyone... is there anything I find odd? You drive on the wrong side of the roads, in my opinion.  u wot m8 http://imgur.com/kkWTVcB Thank you for this .gif, holy shit you made my day !  No, we drive on the right side! Hi Maisie! Nothing groundbreaking with this one, but what is your favorite movie? What TV shows do you secretly enjoy? Secretly enjoy?

Oh! Well it's not much of a secret, but I really enjoy The Great British Bake-Off. It's like a competition show, but they all bake it, and it's very funny, because they all cry over techniques. Like if they get their cake wrong, they're just sobbing over a spongecake, and I find it hilarious.  What did you think of the episode where that woman took that poor guys food out of the freezer, and it literally ruined his entire dish? I felt so sorry for that guy, he looked really really angry. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/YGgqohN.jpg?1) I was literally screaming at that bitch. THAT'S NOT YOUR CAKE. WHY MOVE SOMEONE ELSE CAKE WITHOUT TELLING THEM?!?!  I don't even think she apologised. Are you a fan of any sports? I used to enjoy high-jump, although I'm really short, I did beat a lot of kids that were a lot taller than me. I have a very springy jump, I think. I enjoyed high-jump.  Tea or coffee?
 Tea! No milk one sugar. *RULE BRITANNIA* Which actor from the show would you put on the iron throne?

Also, did you have fun at the [Ed Sheeran concert](http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-06/29/14/enhanced/webdr09/anigif_enhanced-28532-1404068337-1.gif)? Took me a while to spot her Yeah, I thought it might have been a fake out. But then I noticed her in the back. Oh man that Ed Sheeran performance was amazing, someone threw a cup full of piss at my face  How is your day going? Really well! I've actually been up since 4 AM, so I'm a little bit wired, I drank loads of coffee. But it feels like I should be going to sleep, and it's 3 in the afternoon, so a bit long.  Hi Maisie!
 On your quest to become a Pokemon master, which starter Pokemon do you pick? Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander?  Charmander.  Well, let's see. I can choose a plant, a turtle, or a MOTHERFUCKING FIRE BREATHING DRAGON. Hmm, tough choice.  Nice try daenerys.
Edit: For the gold, I thank thee. "WHERE... ARE MY CHARMANDERS!?" Cats or Dogs? 

 Dogs. We used to have 13 dogs. That's quite a lot of dogs. And I'm never had a cat. Dogs are awesome.  So you can say you have plenty of experience dealing with Hounds? And never much luck catching those cats. What would your personal house sigil and house words be? 
 
^Edit: ^Prob'ly ^shoulda ^realized ^that ^there ^is ^no ^way ^this ^is ^the ^first ^time ^anyone's ^asked ^this, ^and ^I ^probably ^could ^have ^just ^Googled ^the ^answer. ^Oh ^well.  
^^^Maisie ^^^Williams ^^^answered ^^^me!!! I've answered this question before! My sigil would be a tortoise, and my saying would be "Go hard or go home" because your shell is hard, and it's also your home, so... You wish you had your tortoise emojis on reddit right now, don't you..  These you mean?  The just show up as squares... Is my computer sick? It's the banner for the House ASCII   
  
  
^^edit: ^^Someone ^^made ^^me ^^Master ^^of ^^Coin! It's actually the house of badly supported UTF-8.  "We do not render." "Eight bits are enough" "Sans Serif, Sans Mercy" Hey Maisie, what would you name the first city on Mars?  Pffffffbbbbbbt.

Ehm. What would I name the first city on Mars?

Mar-zipan!

I find marzipan quite disgusting, but that was the first thing that came into my head. &gt;Pffffffbbbbbbt.

That sems a lot like what Ray Bradbury named martian things in The Martian Chronicles. &gt; Pffffffbbbbbbt

Brilliant name. Great work in Cyberbully, I saw it and you really keep the attention of the viewer all through, quite a feat for such a focused one-room movie! I'm curious what is your favorite music and your favorite movies or tv shows at the moment? Cheers My favourite music... ehm... is probably like drum &amp; bass, and bass lines? And the TV I watch at the moment, I don't have a lot of time to watch TV. So probably as I said earlier, the Great British Bake-Off. I religiously watch that. You should totally check out Game of Thrones. I'll let you borrow my HBO Go password if you'd like. That was surprisingly tame. I'm proud of you.  Do you like crunchy peanut butter or smooth? Crunchy! People who like smooth peanut butter are just aliens.  Do you have any interest in doing theater work in the future?  I'd love to work in the theater! I was recently talking to Emilia Clarke, who's another actress on the show, about what it was like being onstage, so yeah, in the future, I hope that crosses my path.  How did you get your start in acting? Game of Thrones! It was my second audition. I was completely in the right place at the right time. And now it's completely changed my life, and now I find myself doing a reddit AMA, which is kind of crazy. Do you want the Hound to live?

What do you want to be when you grow up?

 Yeah, I would love The Hound to live, because I'd love to work with Rory again. So in an ideal world, yeah, the Hound is still alive, in Maisie's opinion.

I wanted to be... well, when I was like *really* little, i went through my old books I did at school, and on the first page, one of them says "When I grow up I want to be" and there's a little picture of me being  skateboarder. Yeah! And then I grew up and wanted to be a dancer. And then I started acting! Hi Maisie, big fan.

In the event of a "cheeky Nandos" what spice do you have on your chicken?

Cheers and have a nice day! I go with Lemon &amp; Herb, but I get the medium sauce.

And occasionally, if I'm feeling daring, I go with the Wing Roulette, and burn the mouth! since I'm assuming Victoria is answering....that would be Wing Roulette - although may lead to ring roulette in six to eight hours.... What book is on your nightstand? I am! It's called "How to build a girl" by Caitlin Moran. You're a book on your nightstand? I suspect Victoria inserted a modifier like "...if you're reading something right now." If you were a pizza, what kind of toppings would you have? Um... pepperoni with some extra pepperoni, and then sprinkle it with some pepperoni. Yeah! My absolute favourite. rip in pepperoni Hey Maisie! If you could only eat one type of cheese for the rest of your life what type would it be and why? It would be... Halloumi Cheese, because I think it's probably the best thing that has to be invented. But it has to be grilled. It's like rubbery, and squeaky, like cheesy bacon. You should try it. It's really salty. Amazing.   Who rips the biggest farts on set? Well, I spent a lot of time with Rory, and he definitely farted a few times when I was in his presence, and it was *really*, really funny to be honest.  What would be in your perfect sandwich? Perfect sandwich... cold chicken, salt &amp; vinegar crisps, and tomato ketchup.

I actually had it last night, that was my dinner.  That's sounds like something I'd dream up if I were drunk and pillaging the kitchen. That's the heart of British cuisine. What's your go-to cure for a rotten, stinking cold? Manuca honey, lemon, and hot water! Or just like, *loads* of green tea. But that's just me every day. Hi Maisie! Thanks for doing this! Watching you and Rory McCann play my favorite duo on the show has been a dream come true for me. I would go so far as to say you guys did it even better than I pictured in the books, so thanks for being so awesome! I have a couple questions (feel free to ignore if these have been asked already)...

1) If you could trade roles with anyone (male or female) on Game of Thrones, who would you want to play and why?

2) Who would YOU want to sit the Iron Throne?

3) If you could have any superpower, what would you pick?

4) If you could have a career other than acting, what would you pick?

5) What's your favorite colour?

Thanks again! You are such a fantastic performer to watch, and I really look forward to seeing what else you do in the future =D 1.) I would love to play... Cersei, because she's badass. 

2.) Ehm - I think... Bronn (Tyrion's left hand man) would do a really good job? Cuz he's funny! 

3.) Ehm...oooh! If I had a super-power... I can't think of anything? Oh! Probably shape-shift. 

4.) Dancing. That was kind of my career path before acting, but yeah. Things change. And now I'm acting.

5.) Green! I think you mean Bronn :). People are so much nicer correcting Maisie [than they were Daniel Radcliffe](http://i.imgur.com/I6i7OOl.jpg) My bad! Sorry I've only had one cup of coffee! You are so adorable &lt;3  Now kiss Victoria is probably the Oberyn of Reddit. 

Just because she manages to be so awesome despite literally slumming through every comment at a particular time on a default subreddit every day for a living Must a real eyesore. It must be extra weird when the person is sitting with her.  Was there. Seeing someone calling Daniel Radcliffe a filthy casual regarding Harry Potter and being gilded for it is one of those "only on Reddit" moments. I bet he laughed his head off at that one. *nearly laughed his head off Are you sure it's [nearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu7HyyVmrno)? AHEM! /u/KhalChris Sadly I missed this AMA- i was at uni. Lucky for her I guess, ASOIAF is my favourite series so there would have been no mercy! lolololol because they're just correcting Victoria's reporting of what Maisie is saying [Or the President of the United States](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60n05h).  Nobody is safe.

At least he was polite. well u do see the difference  5 Gold to ...... to be fair, "you filthy casual" is obviously sarcarsm Thank you. I never saw this and it's amazing. Sassing Harry Potter about details in Harry Potter.

Only on Reddit. Oh come on that was clearly in good fun, even self-deprecating, and I think Daniel can laugh at himself. That was so beautiful I tried to upvote the jpg. That chirp to Daniel is pretty damn funny tho! Greatest post in the history of the Internet.  AHEM! u/KhalChris Without meaning to offend, how can she get that wrong, I mean seriously, maybe auto correct though. &gt;Victoria from reddit will be helping me out.

Probably because she didn't type it. I was like, "I read the books, and I do not recall any character named Ron...." It's SER Bronn Shape shifting, of course! Very appropriate. Thank you for answering my qestions, enjoy the AMA and good luck with everything! :) You guys are vaguely spoiling shit and I know it. 

I need to get out of this thread. Sorry man. The books have been out for 20+ years and we're entering the 5th season of a show that has become one of the most popular in the world. The fact that you've made it this far without spoilers is a miracle. Oh shit if we've already passed the deadline for people to read ASOIAF, I'll just ask my boss to chuck all of our copies. Yeah that's exactly what I meant. You haven't seen Season 2? Haha, wow, didn't even pick up on that. 

Also, props to you for not freaking out about someone answering you on their AMA... I've only ever really been answered by the professional cuddler and a Wendy's employee. They were both awesome, though!

EDIT: And now I've been answered by Maisie Williams. :) Nice birthday present.  Oh I'm freaking out. I love Game of Thrones and ASOIAF to the point of obsession and I've been camping her userpage waiting for this opportunity. Arya is my favorite character and I have a deep, undying love for Arya and the Hound. But I'm just a username on a website to her, so freaking out all over her comments would just be inappropriate. I'm just thankful my questions got answered :D She answered me too! :o I posted two more comments thinking that she hadn't. I didn't check my inbox. :/ 

Should I go delete those other comments? If they're just questions I don't see why you should. I'm pretty sure there's no rule against posting questions in multiple comments? Ah, okay! Thanks.  I remember that professional cuddler! Good on you mate Maisie answered me! :D Of course! I was blind not to see that! hehe And "dancing". A shapeshifter was walking down the road. He turned into a bank. No spoilers damnit! No spoilers, I promise. :D sounded like a spoiler haha. I should probably get out of this thread All hail king Ron! Weasley is our king New candidate for best Harry Potter/GoT reference. Thanks! Pretty rare for the two to come together. He always lets the Quaffle in  *Ahem*

He never lets the quaffle in. I prefer Stoppable.  Oh man, its been a while since I've had that "poem" stuck in my head.  Since nobody else is going to do it, props for the excellently placed Harry Potter reference. If I had gold to give, you would be receiving it my friend. I got you, man. Bene King of the friendzone I am the KING!! 
-Geoffry The Ron in the Souf! Hail. Ron Fucking Swanson! Bronn*


Edit: M'lady &gt; M'lady

Spoken like a commoner.  B'Ron This is one of the few times this is appropriate  Go eat a bushel of neeps, wun wun &gt; Probably shape-shift.

Oh that's clever &gt; Probably shape-shift.

Then you could be "no one."  =) clever :D I GET THIS! cause I read the books :) ayyy lmao "I would love to play... Cersei, because she's badass. " --- But Arya is much more badass than Cersei... Cersei is just obnoxiously cruel and an inept politician.  Arya just the whole water dancing thing and she's quick to kill when the situation requires it.

 She hasn't read the books, so I think it's easier to see Cersei as a woman who just "gets it done" on the show than the poor politician she turns out to be in the books.  Still a water dancer! Green is not a creative color. Should have expected that answer to the third question hehe  You came close to number 4. You know the Dance of Braavos! ;) &gt; 1.) I would love to play... Cersei, because she's badass.

funny, out of all the characters in the show, yours currently has proven to be one of if not the most bad ass. Cersei is a brother loving, crazy scoundrel.  &gt;3.) Ehm...oooh! If I had a super-power... I can't think of anything? Oh! Probably shape-shift. 

Lizard Illuminati confirmed. &gt; no spoilers

&gt; Shape shifting as favorite super power

I'm watching you...

 For anyone interested, here is Maisie Williams crip walking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zczwVZzmuQw &gt; 5.) Green!

MINE TOO! Sorry about your dancing master.  Shape shifting is the best power, because you could theoretically have almost all other desirable powers! 

Wanna fly? Turn into a bird. Invisible? Turn into a bug. Wanna go fast? Turn into ~sonic~ a falcon or a cheetah. Super strength? Mother fucking rhino.  You're already a water dancer Green is not a creative colour. Shape shifting? Would you take changing faces? ah yes, shape shifting.... all famous people are shape shifters, look out! you mean face shifting huh huh wink wink COUGH COGH HUUUHH?!?!???!? Sweet someone famous has the same favorite color I do. Valar Morghulis. Too few people pick green :D We share the same favorite color *__* Oh man, I have a few responses here. 

1. Well she's Sarah Connor, of course she's badass.

2. I hope you get cast in a superhero movie as a shapeshifter some day!

4. *insert Braavosi water dancing joke here* Bron* Badass Quotient: Arya &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cersie &gt; Face-shift

FTFY its bron :/ &gt;Ron

Oh god...that hurt me a lot. Green is not a creative color dream bigger Great comment. My dream response. Thank you for making this come true for me. [deleted] Oh look it's my favorite type of redditor: arguing the semantics of a post so you can purposely ignore the point of what I said in order to appear intelligent and/or funny.

Their performances were more than I could have hoped for, and I feel fortunate to be able to watch their great dynamic and chemistry play out on screen. I don't know if anyone could have done it better, but their portrayl is a dream come true for me.

Is that better? Does that satisfy you? [deleted] Your point was that someone who gets excited about an actor doing an AMA on one of their favorite series is sad? Even if I *did* want Rory and Maisie specifically to play those parts, why is that sad? My post was upvoted 300+ times, so I think some people agreed with what I said. Not to mention this entire AMA was the #1 post on the front page, so if you're saying everyone who was excited for it is pathetic then I think you need to take another look at yourself.

You know there are people on the other side of your screen right? When you comment there's a real human that reads what you said. You're not just shouting into a void. Almost every human is on the planet is just "someone on the internet."

I'm not angry. But if you want to pretend I'm angry so you can feel satisfied and superior to me, then you're free to do that. Can we address the very confusing use of "favorite colour"? My brain needs you to stick with either British or American English, please I'm Canadian, so really its either way with us. Hello, Maisie! Typical Reddit question: what is your favourite breakfast cereal? 
 Muesli. But only the special kind from Waitrose. It's like the green stuff. It has to be that one, otherwise I won't eat it. Very specific.  Quite amused by Victoria's struggles to figure out what exactly the alien British things Maisie's referring to are. I can completely relate.

It's "Waitrose". Poor Vicky. Or maybe she's called Tori. Or Ictor.

...Probably not Ictor.  And "muesli". We have muesli and granola in the states but never could tell the difference. Is muesli just Swiss granola?  Granola is typically baked with some sort of sticky agent (like honey or syrup) so it clumps and is sort of crunchy. It goes nicely over yoghurt and adds bite. Muesli (or msli) is more dry and not baked.    
Bircher muesli is kept overnight in milk or fruit juice or yoghurt until it is ^gross, sorry until it is mushy. You can also add fruit chunks to the milk and let it soak overnight until it ^(looks like vomit) is the perfect Bircher consistency.  Ah, the baking part is the difference. Thanks.  I know muesli from the cartoon Duckula that came on after Danger Mouse on Nickelodeon. :) Oh wow. forgot about that. I loved Duckula and Danger Mouse when i was a kid.  I don't really know what granola is, and I especially don't know about Swiss granola. Oh, well muesli was invented by a Swiss physician so that's where the name comes from. Granola may just be a different word for the same thing.  I always thought of muesli as like oats with fruit &amp; nuts. Granola as sort of like, balls of oats stuck together? I think we'd just call them both muesli though, I never really hear anyone use the word granola. Granola is literally your definition of muesli. It actually predates muesli. Looked it up because I was curious. Basically Kelloggs began producing granola in the 19th century and then the Swiss began making muesli in the early 20th. It would make sense for the European version to make its way (namewise) to the UK rather than the US version. 

Edit: granola is baked with honey and muesli is raw oats.  What did Victoria put? It's been edited now! Waitro's ^hides^face^in^hands this ama has made me feel very american, i've never heard of any of these things Me neither. :P *Westeros Quite. for all non-brits, Waitrose is the go-to supermarket for the posh/rich/wannabes, it's a strange experience to enter one (at least for me) That's not quite fair, it's slightly more expensive but you get what you pay for and their stores are all over! I'm just stating MY opinion on them So, it's the British version of Whole Foods. That sounds more like m&amp;s to me. Waitrose is just slightly more upmarket for the middle class mums. Where I live there's a tesco, sainsbury's and Waitrose. Still go there sometimes. They just tend to have things the others don't.  like Mexican Beer  that's true they do have unique things, but where I live the people that I mentioned are the main demographic that shop in my local one Oh Waitrose.

Best british supermarket.

can confirm, am british.

^^all hail waitrose Ahem. Waitrose :) Uh... Yeah... I know exactly what you mean. *nods* Uh-huh 

Thanks for answering!

 She spelt it wrong, it's Muesli:

https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Muesli

And it's very nice.


And the shop she is referring to is Waitrose.  If Victoria's typing these answers out she's not doing a very good job today. Nah, Victoria's doing great. The British words are probably getting her confused. Also It would have been like 4 in the morning when this AMA started. xD

EDIT: Whoa Remember that Vic is typing at about 200 wpm to get through all these questions in an hour. @/u/chooter : [Waitrose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitrose) as a guy from the U.S. i understood nothing from this post.  Can confirm.

Source: American Muesli is a type of cereal, like granola, and Waitrose is a high-end grocery store chain in the UK. [deleted] You talkin shit about raisins, m8? What? ^how ^^Dare ^^^YOU!!!!!! The big chunky raisins? They're the best part! We get Waitrose stuff here in Bermuda, I love their products! Whoa. Someone else from the Caribbean on Reddit! Waiterosi muesli? You should try Just Right. As a muesli lover that is really good too. How about with rice? Rating out of 10 if possible As Americans we have no idea what you're talking about. Yea.... Can someone enlighten us yanks? :D She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah French Toast Crunch FTW. Best of all time.  My favourite is actually Cinnabon cereal. Whoops Do you believe in ghosts? No.... &gt; ....

Not even the ghost of Harrenhal??? :P but would you consider doing horror films? [deleted] How is this not answered? What did he ask? He asked: at what age did you lose your virginity. I don't remember lol Thanks  Sorry I couldn't be much help :/ I'm really bad at remembering things. I just remember it was a good question tho. Hey Maisie! Greetings from California at around 6 am. I stayed up all night to make sure I could get a couple questions in. I love how you portray Arya Stark, you're amazing! I love your vines as well they're pretty funny! Now onto business:

What would you like to move on to after Game of Thrones? 

How great is Sophie Turner in real life?

How was it like not fainting around Pedro Pascal?

Now the obligatory reddit question:

Would you rather fight one Hound sized duck or a 100 duck sized Hounds?
 First of all, thank you for staying up so long, that's really really nice of you!

And after Game of Thrones, I'd love to continue in television, and I'd love to move on to movies as well. I don't really know what I want to do? But I think that's quite cool, because I'm only 17 and I don't have to decide yet. But definitely staying in performing.

She's absolutely fantastic. She's probably one of the funniest girls I know. And I'm so glad that I met her.

It's very difficult. I'm madly in love with him. And it's quite - everybody has a crush on him. But I'd never tell him. Oh well, now the internet knows.

Hahahaha! Oh! 

I would love to fight 100 little duck-sized Hounds. Because I'd never in my life looked down on Rory, and that would be an interesting situation.  It's okay, he already knows you have a crush. It is known. It is known.  I bet Jon Snow doesn't know. He knows nothing. It is known. It is known. *cough*/r/thingsjonsnowknows*cough* Hahaha.  I was like, there are 14k subscribers but no posts.  Then I figured it out. 
It is KNOWN 

The greater good. Hodor. It is known. So say we all. Is it known? Is it safe? KEEP IT SECRET
KEEP IT SAFE One guy doesn't know. Good ol Jon Snow. Is it known? It is known. It's a cone. Everyone in the world, male, female, and trans, has a crush on Pedro.   I sexually identify as an Attack Helicopter and I have a crush on him. Now we know.

Now we know.

NOW WE KNOW!

NOW WE KNOWW!!!

NOW WE KN-


I'm doing it again aren't I? Mitchell &amp; Webb is great. I'm a straight man and he is my biggest man crush  r/gayforoberyn Especially The Mountain. Because he... literally crushed him. He seems like kind of an asshole in the bedroom. And frankly I don't want him around my asshole in the bedroom. TIL that I already had a crush on Pedro Pascal, I just didn't know his name.  I think he has a weirdly shaped head..kinda flat. He totally does. And he makes it sooooo sexy. [deleted] I don't believe you! [deleted] Stop being a punk dude, its probably so deep and instinctual inside your body that you don't even know, man! Sorry to burst the circlejerk, I have no idea why all the fuss? Whatever don't answer really I don't want to listen to your dribbling.  The simple solution to your dilemma would have been to not ask.  But then how would I let you know that not everyone in the world has a crush on this random guy whom I don't care if I ever see again? You did claim to speak for the whole world didn't you? You ever heard of a rhetorical fucking question? You needn't answer any of these btw, they are all english language devices utilised in a way as to express my point. Now go and wank over that really quite average spanish guy and leave me in piece, I have said all I wanted to on the matter.  You could have tried saying "Not everyone in the world has a crush on this random guy, and I am one of the ones who doesn't." You asked a question and said you didn't want to know the answer. I'm familiar with rhetorical questions. And they are not devices exclusive to the English language, fyi. I'm just choosing to ignore what you want because you're taking this too seriously and being petulant. 

And didn't I claim to speak for the whole world? No, you're confusing me with the other user. But if being left in "piece" is what you prefer, have at it then. Few pieces missing if you ask me.  Great this is exactly the kind of pointless retarded dribble everyone could do without. Also, autocorrect asshole. Also, go die somewhere not here. The end.  Who doesn't have a crush on him?  We don't speak of *those people* Even The Mountain had a crush on him. Too soon.  Always too soon. Pedro gets Unsullied hard. Khaleesi thinks Pedro is too hot. It is known The Mountain probably had the biggest crush on him.  I just read your username in his voice. ayyy He's probably just safe to assume anyone he meets has a crush on him, normal sexual preferences be damned. But umm... I thought he knows nothing? I'm sure he is familiar with being crushed... Oh you Like this? Too soon m8.

Haha, just kidding, I'm sure there's a *mountain* of girls who have crushes on him. &gt; It's very difficult. I'm madly in love with him.

Oh Gods the Fanfic-writers are gonna go batshit crazy over that one.. implying they haven't already. It doesn't matter that Oberyn died without ever meeting Arya. Those bastards will find a way. They always do. Please be the next Kitty Pryde.  I would throw so much money at that movie. Pedro... that face, and those........ eyes...... We've known forever, love. I saw Pedro at comic con last year.... there was much swooning by everyone! Maisie and Pedro, I ship that. Yeah, everybody has a crush on Pedro. Especially the Mountain. I heard he *majorly* crushed on Pedro.  I would love to see you and Sophie do comedy.  You could be like the British Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.  I bet the two of you could write better material than the "sheep shift" bit in your sleep! Dont worry, everyone likes him, im pretty confidant Pedro Pascal is one of those guys even the straightest man on the world would have trouble saying no to...

and he knows it. The Mountain was definitely crushing on him pretty hard! I'm disappointed in you for missing the opportunity to ask "100 chicken sized Hounds or one Hound sized chicken." I'm so glad my dad woke me up this morning thinking I had school.  [VINES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZbebwqIqj4) Why didt you just get up early? You could've just gotten up early instead of staying up all night.  Why didn't you just wake up early instead of stay up? Hi Maisie. I'm the person who posted the [original AMA request](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2t60v7/ama_request_maisie_williams_aka_arya_stark_in/) a few days ago. I'll ask you some of the questions that I put on there: 

1. What is the strangest piece of fan art that somebody has given you?
2. What would be your dream role to play in any franchise?
3. What has helped you to mature the most as a young actress?
4. How would you best describe Arya's progression as a character from Season's 1-5?
5. Are you going to be playing Ellie in The Last of Us movie?

Thank you for doing this AMA!

Edit: Thanks for the [Gold!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSq8ZBdSxNU)  Damn. Original requester gets left hanging.  I am just glad that this was organised more than anything else. I think most of my questions were answered in other posts anyway.  Thank you /u/itsSuperRob! We owe you! Can we get /u/itsSuperRob to do an AMA to make up for it? Thanks for being a good guy about it. Plus you got karma and gold anyway.  No worries buddy, we got you covered...[in karma!](http://i.imgur.com/xJVt2.gif) You da real mvp  good guy original requester  &gt; I think most of my questions were answered in other posts anyway.

yeah, I think all of them were indeed Nah, you're probably just an Arya's list somewhere.  You're a sport That's rough buddy http://i.imgur.com/kDJkMhv.jpg Should be illegal  He's the Original Requester Reddit deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So he'll be left hanging. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful requester. A Reddit knight. Answering 5 questions for 1 person isn't as good PR as having 5 different guys all giddy. Maybe don't ask five questions next time.  I'm not sure why people don't seem to get this. Whenever there's an AMA people that load a comment with questions are almost guaranteed to be ignored. Never ask more than one question in the actual AMA. The person answering sees a list of questions, says "Woah, fuck. I'm going to answer some simpler questions first." Then never gets back to it. Asking five questions tends to be a good way to not get any of them answered.  Ask one, or maybe two or three if you're feeling bold, but five is too many. Too many questions in one comment lol Too many questions.  I blame chooter. (Just kidding Victoria, we all love you) Damnnn That really defeats the purpose of having to come up with questions for an AMA request at all. They should be required to be answered first thing the moment the AMA starts, if not in its original post. I requested Hans Zimmer a few years back and when he eventually came around I was too late to even comment. It stings, man. Maybe don't get greedy next time with a five-part essay prompt.  Just sayin' - keep the questions short and sweet. Well the dude asked a bunch of questions, can't really blame her. Should've just asked one or two. Maybe if Bruh didn't ask 19 questions  people that ask a litany of questions get ignored a lot.  Rightly so, in my opinion.  Ask one question and then let others get a chance. 5 questions is a lot to answer in an AMA He sounded snooty  Whoa, I didn't know there was gonna be a The Last of Us movie. That would be awesome. My PS3 broke just about the time the game came out so yeah. 
  Your PS3 is similar to my dad.  He passed away? Or did he go bankrupt? He broke when I came out.  Oh. Hopefully in the way someone breaks when they hear good news? :(   Dad was a peasant? Did your dad play tlou and comeout super butthurt? The Last Of Us is already pretty much like an interactive movie.  Dammit I really need to get my PS3 fixed.  Just go with a ps4, might be just a little bit more than fixing it, and some ps4s come with the last of us as a free download Eh, fixing my PS3 might just be easier  True, I only say this because I was in the same boat, hdmi port on my ps3 fried, and everything I saw to fix it was going to cost about as much as a new ps3, so I just saved that money and put it towards a ps4 Meh. Not 100% sure about that in my country Doh, the dude that asked for the AMA didn't get his question answered.  That sucks.  Thanks for helping to make it happen.  Is interesting reading a 17 year old responses to goofy questions on Reddit.   No problem! I have enjoyed it! :)  No response. Bummer. God, I know there's a timing thing but I feel bad for you. This is worse than the American Dad! super fan that Rachel MacFarlane never answered.  Related question: did the request do anything or was it just coincidental? For reference, I linked to it in my email to Maisie's management team just as a way of saying that lots of people want to see it happen. I'm not 100% sure whether or not she saw the request or her friend. I was stoked when I saw your request, so glad it happened, thanks for being that guy! She's just here so she doesn't get fined. I find it funny that the mods allow this, but when subreddits posted their top questions in single posts for the elon musk AMA, mods deleted the posts.

I find it strange mods will apply a double standard for AMAs with a reddit admin involved.   The original AMA request for Maisie was over a year ago, I know because I upvoted it. Haha you thought you would get the attention and got ignored hahaha Why isn't your name ItsSuperRobb?

Edit: jeez people. Forget the typo, and focus on the second b. &gt; Why isn't your name ItsSupetRobb?

Probably because he isn't supet.
 He's upset. Supet? Because Supet isn't a word. &gt; I'm the person who posted the original AMA request a few days ago.

Yes, I'm sure no one has posted a request for Maisie Williams before you did, a few days ago, and that she did this solely because of you. LOL.  Rekt. Ooooh, look out! The REQUESTER is here!!! [deleted] Considering that my request gained much more popularity than the rest, I think it was only right that I did something about it.  As a father who named his first daughter, Arya, after this character, I'm a huge fan. Please answer this other fan as well. My child will want to know why we named her Arya, and what better than to hear it from Arya herself. :) Wow you're the person who figured out that reddit wants to talk to the actress who plays Arya? your ability to read minds and see the future excites me, any more predictions?  Hmmm stalker much??  I have actually been working with Victoria to organize this AMA so that's how I knew. I'm just trying to do something good for reddit :)  Who is this Victoria I always hear. [Victoria](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fgsv2/i_am_victoria_from_reddit_amaa) is reddit's Director of Communications and types up a lot of the AMA's for the celebrities who participate.  Oh ok thanks. What's the secret to remaining friends after working together all these years?  Too often we see a falling out between buddies who start businesses together. Ben and I spend an incredible amount of time together, still. A very large percentage of it eating.

And we... have always shared a love of food. And occasionally it lurches into overeating. But we are trying to curtail that.

Another interesting thing about Ben &amp; me is that we have very similar values in how we see the world. We both believe that business should be using its power to *help address* social &amp; environmental issues, and not just making money. So that's help define the mission of the company.  At the same time, Ben &amp; I have very different skills. Ben is very creative, spontaneous, risk-taking, bounding... adorable... whereas I am more adorable in my own way. Different ways.

 Well, Jerry's a lot more diplomatic than I am. In the early days of the company, you know, we'd be walking around, I'd be first, he'd be second, I was just walking faster, and you know, I'd be coming up to people and I'd say "This is wrong, that's wrong, you could do that better" and Jerry would be walking back and saying "What ben MEANT to say was..." he would put it in, you know, a tone that people were more ready to accept the input in. And I have learned quite a bit from Jerry.

I am more cute and adorable NOW because of my relationship with Jerry.  He's sweet!
 Ben &amp; Jerry's Frozen Bromance. Sold with two mini plastic spoons. Contains adorable almonds.

I was originally going to say Banana Bromance, but let's just move on from that idea. Frozen Bro-gurt. The words work but the mental imagery... gross. It starts off as an empty cup. pls no Like the real life Ben Wyatt and Chris Traeger What puts a flavor in the flavor graveyard ? Flavors go into the Flavor Graveyard if they don't sell enough. If people aren't buying enough of a particular flavor, they go to an early grave sometimes. And it's funny because my particular favorite flavor happens to be in the graveyard. Ben's too! It doesn't matter if I like the flavor or if he likes the flavor - if not enough people buy it, it goes bye-bye.  I am pretty sure I was purchasing enough oatmeal cookie chunk to keep it in production, what gives? You and me both! That flavor was a terrible addiction. Delicious and addictive.  They had to put it to sleep, it was a public service to save the world from the inability to breathe due to copious amount of icecream jammed into their respective trachea.

These men are heroes. Omg the oatmeal cookie ice cream farts are in the annals as my husband's worst of all time. Whenever we go over our relationship fart timeline, even Indian buffets don't make the grade over this. God, me too.  That and Fossil Fuel. I have an imagine in my head of you two staying at the factory after hours and making your favorite pints when no one else is around. 

Edit: I ain't changing it! &gt; an imagine One imagine please.  [That'll be $4.99 thank you](http://i.imgur.com/4zziYOt.jpg) &gt;  they don't sell enough. If people aren't buying enough of a particular flavor, they go to an early grave sometimes. And it's funny because my particular favorite flavor happens to be in the graveyard. Ben's too!

Following on from that, under what condition does a flavor comes out of flavor graveyard? I'd assume popular demand.  or necromancy Necreamancy Is it Rainforest Crunch? Because it should be Rainforest Crunch. It was sold as an individual candy treat and it still died? I was confused and sad. Neat! Can you tell us which those flavors are? I assume it's not Cherry Garcia and Americone Dream, I think those are both still available. If it came down to it, a pure battle of Ben vs Jerry who could eat the most ice cream. Who? Jerry! Jerry can eat the most ice cream. There is no doubt in my mind.  It's absolutely true. At Ben &amp; Jerry's, we recommend eating ice cream in moderation.

I don't always follow those recommendations. 

HOWEVER, I will say in the early years of Ben &amp; Jerry's, Ben did all the flavor development and quality control for the ice cream. So he was always concerned about having enough big chunks in the pints of ice cream, and when he was testing a pint of ice cream he would eat the entire *pint* because Ben claims that any ice cream tastes good for 1 or 2 spoonfuls. 

But you need to be willing to make the sacrifice of eating down through the entire pint to make sure that quality holds up.  This goes along with the whatdya call it - axiom - never trust a skinny ice cream.  [deleted] Do you have any advice for a young entrepreneur?  Do something that you're passionate about. Something that you believe in. Something that is really meaningful to you, as opposed to looking around for what business you think is "Hot" and trying to get into that.

And also, to kind of... personalize the business.

I think customers can *feel* it when the business is run by someone who really *cares* about the product or service, and really *cares* about customers.

And I think that what Ben &amp; Jerry's has proven is that it's not only possible to run a business in such a way that it benefits the society, but that it's... good business sense.

It makes for a very financially successful business.

Because you know, the reality of life, the spiritual reality of life is that as you give, you receive. It works the same for businesses as it does for individuals.

As a business supports the community, the community supports the business.

So I think the key is to combine what is seen as the separate realms of nonprofit / social service / political advocacy with business. They support each other.  You guys are famous for your interesting business philosophies, like your run at taking control over salary disparities. What is the one 'counter culture' business idea/philosophy that you think has worked well for you, and one that turned out to just be more trouble than it was worth? I think one thing that has worked out well for Ben &amp; Jerry's is that the company pays a livable wage, not just minimum wage, to ALL our workers. And it turns out that it's actually beneficial to the company. In addition to that, we've just finished converting to Fair Trade ingredients, and also converting to all non-GMO ingredients. And the company's been able to do that without raising the price of ice cream as a result of that.  I think one thing that we weren't able to make work was - as was asked in the question - was the salary ratio. Earlier on, Ben &amp; Jerry's had a compressed salary ratio - the highest paid person in the company didn't make any more than 7 times what the lowest paid person made. And we weren't able to make that work when we first recruited a CEO from outside of the company. We weren't able to find somebody in a short enough period of time, and so from that point on the company paid market wages for all our executives.  How do you guys feel about the fact that the scoopers are now paid (just over) minimum wage? I used to work in the Church Street scoop shop and found myself correcting a lot of myths over what the company offers "all" employees. I always figured it had to do with Unilever buying the company, it's just sad to see ideals like paying all employees livable wages go out the window. I have been waiting my whole life for this moment.

On the description of your flavor "phish food", it states that there are chocolatey shaped fish. Doesn't that imply that there are, in fact, fish shaped like chocolate and not vice-versa? What gives?

EDIT: I was referring to [this](https://www.handla24.se/ProductImages/a_01/original/076840600151.jpg) packaging. You know, I think Mr. Germ brings up a very interesting...uh...whaddya call...conundrum. And when I lick the fish - lick the ice cream off the fish so I can see them - it's clear that the chocolate is shaped like fish. But I believe that, lexiconically speaking, Mr or Mrs Germ points out a problem that - some kind of problem.

There's a problem.

It's not said quite right. 

But the important thing to know is that when you DO lick the fish, you find the fish are smiling.  Wow, /u/wheatgerm42 may have just singlehandedly changed the packaging for one of the most iconic ice cream flavors ever. Or not, I have no idea what that response means.  I think Ben is telling us to lick more Fish-type things, for a world of smiles. You heard it boys! Start licking! I think they're stoned, man. tbh i would have been disappointed if the god of my munchies weren't stoned. Do you happen to also be the author of Lessons of Vivec?  Ben &amp; Jerry's is the secret to achieving CHIM: Confirmed.  Pure poetry. This reply sounds fantastic in my head when I read it in Jeff Goldblum's voice. I don't know what the explanation was, but I believe the packaging has been updated:

Edit: This isn't the first time Reddit has raised this question:
http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2ohi6x/ive_written_to_them_about_this_several_times_now/ Wow, that was fast! Well, we did it guys 

History in the making right here I think it's OK if you look at the sentence as:

    Chocolately (shaped fish)

... meaning the "shaped" fish are chocolatey, rather than 

    (Chocolate-shaped) fish.

The question of what a Shaped Fish could be is left to the readers.  Chocolatey fish shapes.      fish.setShape(chocolatey); What does your day-to-day lives / jobs look like?  To what extent are you still involved in Ben &amp; Jerry's, the ice cream brand?  If "not at all" what do you do to fill you time on a regular basis right now?  

From Wikipedia: 
&gt;In April 2000, Ben &amp; Jerry's sold the company to Anglo-Dutch multinational food giant Unilever. Unilever said it hopes to carry on the tradition of engaging "in these critical, global economic and social missions". Although the founders' names are still attached to the product, they do not hold any board or management position and are not involved in day-to-day management of the company. Personally, I'm stamping my balls off.  Well, I still work at Ben &amp; Jerry's, as does Ben.

And the central work of my job consists of portraying the person known as "Jerry."

And I'm constantly trying to improve that portrayal. And in addition, I do some non-profit work - I'm the president of the Ben &amp; Jerry's foundation.  Are you ever tempted to rename it the Jerry &amp; Ben's foundation? How about Jen &amp; Berry? So both are first and second. Do you guys still have any creative input? Yeah, I'm a little confused with these responses, as they seem to imply that they're regularly involved with the decisions related to the brand, while I thought that B&amp;J were now pretty much just brand ambassadors. Does Unilever give them authority as founders to be involved in the types of decisions that people are asking? I know several people who work at the HQ in Williston, VT. 

From my understanding, Unilvever owns the brand. But Ben, Jerry, and the rest of the gang still have a *lot* of creative input and control over what happens. That's how they're able to be so progressive, steadfast, and outspoken when it comes to these environmental/political/social issues. Unilever has a representative that spends almost all his time in Williston, too. I'm not sure what the official title is, but he's basically the boss-man when it comes to how the brand interacts with the parent corporation. And, from what I've heard, he's really, really, cool. Laid back, easy to work with, flexible, fair, basically all the qualities you'd hope to find in a boss. 

He once said: "the day scientists can prove that wearing a suit and tie to work will improve productivity is the day where I'll enforce a dress code. 'Til then, enjoy the tye dye." Or something along those lines.

Like I said. They're owned by Unilever, but they've earned a very long leash.  That's fantastic-- I'm really glad to hear that. I guess my statement came across as pretty accusatory, which wasn't the intention. I've honestly wondered how much freedom the brand had.  Unilever person here, pretty much this! TIL Neither Ben nor Jerry hold management or board positions at Ben &amp; Jerry's. They're on the custodial staff! Ben and Jerry,

Super fan here. Polished off four pints this past weekend (Candy Bar, Half Baked, Mint Chocolate Cookie, &amp; Strawberry Shortcake). Believe it or not, I keep a fairly strict diet outside of ice cream consumption, but there are no substitutes in life for a pint of Ben and Jerrys. 

I do have one very pressing question. You guys are based in Vermont. Vermont is the United States largest producer of maple syrup. Where is the maple syrup infused ice cream? I didnt forget about the Maple Blondie Limited Batch you guys put out a few years back. That stuff was delicious and I still think about it before bed occasionally. Any thoughts to bring this flavor, or another maple syrup concoction, back into my life?

Thanks for taking ice cream where others dare not venture. 
 It's a fantastic question.

Ben &amp; Jerry's has made many flavors flavored with maple syrup over the years, dating back to when we first opened in a homemade ice cream parlor in 1978. 

And, uh... there is this idea that people have that because Vermont produces so much incredible maple syrup that the natural thing is to put it in Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream, but unfortunately very few people purchase those flavors.

It is a DELICIOUS concoction. I personally LOVED Maple Blondie when we were making it. But the marketplace has spoken, once again! Well, in the early early days, I was the ice cream deliverperson. 

And in the early early days, we had a Vermont Maple Walnut ice cream. It was a flavor. And nobody ever bought it, and I'm wondering *Why is there this flavor* and I finally did a promotion one time, at the State Capitol House, and I discovered the only people who eat Maple Walnut are politicians.

Yes.

I think they're just trying to prove that they're really Vermont-y or something! Wait, really?

Maple Walnut is one of my favorite flavors. I never had seen it until I went to college in NH, though. Have you considered running for office? I think we have found a revolutinary new way of finding competent politicians

Edit: Spelling I think it's time to bring back in the maple flavor, but this time do it with bacon! Bacon always sells!! so does siriracha but I don't think that would go so well with ice cream. 

EDIT: Thank you for gold! Let's bring home the bacon! Yeah they already made a Liz Lemon flavor, why not a Ron Swanson flavor with Bacon and Steak? If they wanted to make a "Parks and Rec" themed flavor, they could call it "Ben and Jerry's" Yes, i second the maple bacon. Throw some pancake bits in there and candied bacon. It would also be an excuse to give my kids ice cream for breakfast.

Edit: Holy crap, thanks for the gold.

/u/atoms12123 has informed me that according to B&amp;J bacon will never happen, since it is not kosher. I'm very sad now. Somewhere Michelle Obama just felt a chill down her spine No wonder... it is fucking cold outside.  Don't think this would be limited to children either. College students everywhere would rejoice.  Market that shit in Canada. Maple syrup ice cream would be a cash cow up there.  Hey Guys!

Did you see *City Slickers* and what did you think of the guys portraying "you"? I thought it was a great movie. They didn't tell us anything about us, or contact us before or since. Most people think they are us, but they're not.  To add to that, the characters in that movie had the ability to tell you what ice cream flavor would go best with what meal - and Ben and I do not have that ability. 

I mean, Ben could pretend, but he can't do it.  What is your favorite kind of salad dressing? Now, some people might think it is a non-sequitor, but I just put this on my shopping list.

I want to say that Ken's Lowfat Peppercorn Creamy Salad Dressing is like, *the best.* TOTALLY the best. It is really really good.  Ben is wrong.

The best salad dressing - the best EVERYTHING - is Newman's Own. 

Particularly when you get into the organic Newman's Own. I don't think they have organic salad dressing, but it is the only thing that TRUMPS Newman's Own.  Well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of Reddit comes the end of our fellowship. Hi guys!

Thanks for the AMA.  How did you decide on Ben and Jerry?  Why not Jerry and Ben?  Did you flip a coin?  Was Jerry mad? 

Also, having been recently pregnant and a huge fan of your products, I think you should create a joke flavour pairing like 'pregnancy pickles' ice cream. Mmmmm.  You know, I've heard many stories about pregnant women sending their husbands out on late night ice cream runs.

And they have a particularly specific flavor that they want.

And husband might end up going to 3 or 4 different stores to try and find that flavor.

Obviously, it is VERY important to find the particular flavor a pregnant woman wants.

Ben, at one time, thought of setting up a program whereby there were certain stores that would have ALL Ben &amp; Jerry's flavors - all the time. 

"AFISAAT." All Flavors In Stock At All Times.

It obviously is a brilliant idea that Ben &amp; Jerry's has not seen brought about. But that would solve a *big* problem for many pregnant women and their doting significant others.  Also, here in Vermont, there's a phenomenon known as "Ben &amp; Jerry's babies."

They come out REALLY big. 

Those are babies from moms who have eaten a lot of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream during their pregnancy. And the babies come out very robust.  You guys missed the important question here. Why not Jerry and Ben? was addressed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rr72o/we_are_ben_cohen_and_jerry_greenfield_of_ben/cniisd1) Ben and Jerry,

I have to say your ice cream is incredible. No other brand tastes quite as good as yours. My question, what is the best reaction you have ever seen because of your ice cream? Well, it was the woman who came up to me and said "I call one thigh BEN and the other thigh JERRY." I like it when people come up and talk about how they have Ben &amp; me in their freezer, as if our little heads are stuck inside their freezers! Good morning little Ben good morning little jerry [Little Jerry?](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120911225943/seinfeld/images/0/05/The_little_jerry.jpg) Ever thought of having dead flavours come back from the graveyard over Halloween? 

*edit- Holy wow, thanks for the replies guys! Since this has apparently exploded I'll confess for full disclosure that I honestly can't remember whether I actually came up with this, dreamed it, heard it mentioned somewhere or read it on here or what, but it'd definitely be cool if this were a thing to put the Reddit sticker on. :D* OOOH! I think that's a great idea. No, I had never thought about having flavors from the graveyard come back for Halloween, but I think the guys here... might work to resurrect them! We could call it *re-incone-nation.* Oh Jerry. Classic Garry. Classic Larry. Larry Garry Gerry Gurgich Gingrich  Slow clap for the Parks and Rec fan base  Ew, that's my step dad, Gary. Don't talk to him, he's such a nark. Would  work because all the old flavors were cream-ated We now know who comes up with the names. Hi Ben &amp; Jerry!!!! You guys don't understand how OBSESSED I was with Half Baked! I would have it literally every day. Unfortunately, I am lactose intolerant.
Do you see yourselves creating a dairy free ice cream line in the future? Almond/Coconut based?!!
Here is a petition in case you haven't seen :) https://www.change.org/p/tell-ben-jerry-s-you-want-non-dairy-ice-cream-options

**EDIT**:: I don't mean froyo or sorbet. I mean almond/coconut/rice/banana based vegan ICE CREAM (*no soy*) :) We love the idea of offering our fans all kinds of choices, everything from yogurt to lower-fat to sorbet to lactose-intolerant. We love the ideas to pursue future alternatives that way.  Yes!! Thank you for answering!! Love you guys!!!! Never say never! I would LOVE to see a dairy free Ben and Jerry's! I love the sorbet you have, but there's nothing like the taste of ICE CREAM. And almond based ice creams are delicious and healthy. Vegans would go crazy over it! Chiming in to say I would love a non-dairy/vegan choice from Ben &amp; Jerry's. I don't do dairy and more and would love more choice.

In the interim, Mellyyx, try the chocolate cherry chunk soy ice cream from trader joes.  Yes! This would be wonderful. Non dairy ice creams are quite delicious, too. Unfortunately they only really come in plain flavors and could use a Ben and Jerry spruce up.  Thank you again for doing what you guys do. The Stampede is an amazing thing. Although you highlight stamping, what has been your return of seeing these bills back in change?

Have you thought about doing "Where's George" type of tracking? It would be awesome to see how those bills move. So yeah, you know, I was in an airport once and got a stamped bill - it's a great feeling. Of course this is a project that goes on for YEARS, and we need to hit critical mass, so it's gonna take a while before people start getting them back, but people are noticing them. If you go on the instagram, the pinterest, you find people who've taken photos of these bills with their smartphones and sent 'em out to their friends just because it's so unusual.

And have we thought about doing "Where's George" system ? Indeed we have, and we are very close to launching a system whereby when people stamp the money, they will have their unique user ID on the stamp, and that way someone who finds it can go report it on a website, so we will see how those bills move around the country. 

We're calling it "The society of maniacal stampers." If anybody has a better name, they should let me know.  I am a complete stamper. All my money is stamped, all the time. And, uh, like Ben, I have switched over to spending a lot of cash as opposed to using credit cards - I go to the bank to get lots of $1's, and I am actually in the process of buying a new wallet that will do a better job of holding all my cash. My current wallet has been getting overstuffed, and I'm going to buy one of those wallets that is already spread out - the credit cards are spread out so you don't have as bulky a wallet when you fold it - and that will give me more of an opportunity to fit more stamped money in my wallet. 

I'm also considering adding a money clip. Because even with more space - a lot of $1 bills take up a lot of width. So I'm thinking of going to a dual system, whereby I have a thin wallet to begin with, and then adding a thin money clip - not as an accessory -but an essential money management system.  I'd like to go further than that -to expand the discussion to a POCKET management system.

The approach I've been taking is looking at what else is taking up room in my pocket. What I came across was this huge lump of keys. Especially now that car keys are this incredibly huge lump by themselves because of all the electronics. I became aware of a really new design of key-containment called the KeySmart.

So I'm going to use - I have the KeySmart on order, expecting it any day - and that will dramatically decrease the bulk of my wad of keys. Which will allow more room for stamped dollars.

The direction I've been going in - I think Jerry's direction is very interesting - but I've been storing my stamped ones in my breast pocket There's a lot of people who have a breast pocket, but they don't make much use of it. And I find that a little wad of stamped ones fits there, and it's handy and easy to peel out when you are looking to make a purchase.

And just the people who have not yet made the move to cash - cash is cool.

Cash is retro.

I mean, pulling out a wad of money and flipping through is a very cool, debonair, somewhat gangster-ish thing to do. People are impressed. Jerry, I [met you](http://imgur.com/bilissU) a little over a year ago at the University of South Florida. I remember you embracing me and saying you are a hugger. I just will always remember the kind words you gave me about joining the Peace Corps, now I'm serving and of course crave Ben and Jerry's. 

I just wanted to ask if you have any plans to ship to South America and second what can more can we do to support the fight against Citizens United?

Edit: fight against Citizens  United not for
 Who's higher? Completely-Baked You look like what Haley Joel Osment would look like if he had a normal sized head/face Ben Cohen has a campaign (www.StampStampede.org ) --and it's trying to overturn the havoc that Citizens United has unleashed into our political system. Are you a Stamper? Huge fan here
Please answer this
How exactly did our supreme leader Stephen Colbert end up on Americone Dream? We were looking for the coolest, hippest guy we could partner with in 2007, and Stephen's humor and values were very much aligned to us at Ben &amp; Jerry's. We love the fact that he is left of center, and quirky, and the flavor has done INCREDIBLY well, landing in the top 10 of flavors.  Will the flavor continue even after the "Stephen Colbert" character becomes just regular old Stephen Colbert, host of the Late Show and not extreme AMERICA fan? Can we please get Mission to Marzipan back?! No. Next question! Shut down.  Excuse me, do you have a level 6 clearance lanyard? If not, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.  Cold as ice (cream) You're willing to sacrifice our fudge!  So can we get a hint about any new flavors coming out this year??? We have some new CORES flavors coming out that we're ready to announce next week, so it's taking our popular CORE flavors from this year - with a big dollop of jam or fudge or caramel in the middle - and raising that to new and greater heights! So next week - there's very little time you have to wait before you can dig in! My body is ready. Thanks guys.  How did you guys come up with the name? ;) Well, you know, I was trying to be like - I don't know what the heck I was trying to be like. I was thinking we should call it "Josephine's Flying Machine."

It's a song.

*Sings* Come Josephine, in my flying machine...

So anyway, it was a really stupid idea, which is what Jerry said, and we realized it was traditional for an ice cream parlor to call itself by the names of the owners.

And then the question was: should Ben or Jerry come first?

We decided that the E sound belonged at the end, it just rolled off the tongue better.

Because of that, we made Jerry the president of the corporation. I don't know what i was. Subcommander president?

 And the pint containers, you might notice, have a photo of Ben &amp; me.

When the ice cream first came out, the photo pretty much covered the entire lid of the container. And over the years, the size of it has been getting progressively decreased - now it's about the size of a nickel, I think, and in no time at all, we should be down to the size of a dime.  you are getting nickeled and dimed? So you own an Ice Cream factory that is loved by all AND you're a Sub Commander? Is there anything you CAN'T do? He can't fail the commander. NOT EVER.  Lots of name pairings sound best to English speakers when they're arranged this way (one syllable name, and, two syllable name) because English is mostly trochaic! With this order stressed and unstressed syllables alternate, starting with stressed (opposite would be iambic), which is apparently pleasing to hear.  What's your best Grateful Dead story?  Well, I only met Jerry once.

I had been running a small company called "Rainforest Crunch," it was a cashew-brazil-nut buttercrunch that was conceived at a Grateful Dead concert benefitting the rainforest, the idea was that the rainforest could be as economically viable as if it were sustainably harvested as when it's cut down and used for cattle ranches. What they needed was a market. And one of the products that comes from the rainforest is brazil nuts, so I came up with a product that used a lot of brazil nuts. 

It was quite tasty.

And so this guy was doing a - at the time - it was a benefit cassette for the rainforest - and he wanted photos of these various rainforest projects and there were various musicians that had donated tracks and one of them was the Grateful Dead. So he wanted a photo of us all together, during a time when Jerry was performing at the Beacon theater with the Jerry Garcia band. It was the longest-running show they had ever put on there. And you know, somewhere in the middle of this show, they set up this photoshoot in the late morning, 10 or 11 am, we're all there assembled for the shot, and there's no Jerry.

About a half hour later, he walks in and says "Gimme a cup of coffee and a whole lotta aspirins." 

Those were the only words he ever said to me.  You know... the best time I ever had at a Grateful Dead show, I was passed out most of the time. What do you do with all of the "imperfect" ice cream at the factory? I know for most of us B&amp;J's fans this sounds like an impossible labeling, but when someone "messes up" what happens? Well, I think a lot of times what happens is that there's usually too many chunks in it, or not enough, so we strain out the chunks and start again. Sometimes we maybe don't have enough milk, or cream... or sugar... and we'll start again and add that to it.  Is there really such a thing as too many chunks? I can't fathom that at all "Hello? Yes, I'd like to make a complaint. This tub of ice cream doesn't have as many chunks as the one I bought last week!"

That is why. &gt;too many chunks

What? I used to work in a Ben &amp; Jerry's factory (not the well-known one that does tours, but a different one that produces a lot more).

In the break room was a freezer full of "factory seconds", or sub-par pints. All employees were allowed to take 3 pints home every shift. Since I was a temp who ate a lot of ice cream and many employees who had been there for a decade were sick of the stuff, I would often get somebody else's and leave with 6. I also used to see pints with a "factory second" sticker on them at local convenience stores that sold for half price.

For the most part there was nothing "wrong" with these, except for the Chocolate Fudge Brownie, which always had terrible brownie pieces. I still refuse to get that flavor, but that's also because it consistently clogged up the machines at the factory and caused trouble.

Also, the factory had a limit on the amount of bad/melted ice cream that could be poured down the sink. If we ever had a backed up line and ice cream needed to be thrown away, it was collected in barrels and given to local farmers to feed pigs. Those pigs must be delicious. The pork equivalent of Kobe Beef. They should have mystery containers like the end of lollipop lines use their inbetween lollipops as the mystery ones. Hi Guys,
What's your favorite movie?

And do you like the TV Show Game of Thrones and if so who's your favorite character? I've been thinking a lot about Groundhog Day lately.

I think that was an amazing movie and Bill Murray just hit it out of the park. 

And I'm totally clueless about Game of Thrones.  "No white chocolate. No fudge." "Scoop of chocolate. Scoop of Vanilla. Don't waste my time."

 Dinklage.  Because he's pint-sized?

Edit: First gold comment! Made my morning. [http://imgur.com/r/InternetGifs/xJVt2](http://imgur.com/r/InternetGifs/xJVt2) You are now a moderator of /r/dadjokes Waffle or sugar cone?
 Well, waffle has 2 meanings - like homemade made there right in the store? Definitely that.  I gotta go with a waffle cone also. It's got the texture. It's got the crunch without being brittle or splinter-y. And you can shove a LOT more ice cream into a waffle cone than you can on a sugar cone.  Aw man I remember LOVING making waffle cones in the morning when I worked in one of your shops. The smell was so excellent. And we'd get to munch the mistakes. And I prided myself on making my cones with a nice sealed bottom to avoid drips. 

MAN this AMA is making me nostalgic! Greetings from across the pond. One very pressing question here:

When is our tea flavoured ice cream coming? Call it "God Save The Cream" and make it tea ice cream with chunks of scones with raspberry swirls and clotted cream? GO!

Edit: Ben, Jerry, do you gentlemen have any creative positions open? I never stop creating.

Edit: Okay, so they don't own the company anymore. Put a bug in Unilever's ear then :P O&gt; [deleted] EDIT: THE SPICE CREAM MUST FLOW *Uhhhhhhh* I don't have a good answer for this.  Gentlemen,

It use to be that your website listed a sugar-free variety that was suppose to be available at your retail shops. I never had any luck finding it, and now I don't even see it online.

Do you have any plans to offer sugar-free varieties in the future? Those of us on low-carb, keto or diabetic diets want to enjoy your treats too!

What are the challenges of offering sugar-free deserts? Is it harder to "engineer," does it cost more? Is there not a large demand? As a lactose intolerant individual, thanks so much for the great Cherry Garcia Fro Yo.  Love it.  I'm also a big supporter of the Constitutional Amendment you propose.

I recall learning in business school when you guys started the company, the highest paid employee salary was tied to the lowest paid employees salary.  If I remember right, the highest paid person could not be paid more than 7 (?) times the lowest paid.

I also remember hearing that policy is gone now.

Can you comment on this policy and if it still exists and if not, why?   Hey there, I'm a big fan of both your ice cream and your activism. Thanks so much for doing this! Why do you think stamping money is the best way to get the message across to people?  Well, the amazing thing about stamping money is that every time you stamp a dollar bill or $5 or $10 or $20 - about 875 people see it as it gets passed around from person to person. So one person stamping 3 bills a day for a year ends up reaching about a million people. And right now, we've got over 30,000 people around the country that are stamping money with messages like "Stamp Money out of Politics" and it's starting to make an impression ! It's kinda huge.

What's kind of amazing is that everybody wants to get money out of politics - they know that's what's killing the country - and all you need to do is make your voice heard by turning money into media. The Supreme Court said "money is free speech" and we're going to start making our money talk.  Thanks for answering my question! Money in politics is definitely a big problem that I personally think contributes to voter apathy- since it's hard to believe our vote actually makes a difference over all that cash. Congrats on 30k stampers and best of luck with your movement, you have my support.  Yeah, can I get a scoop of georgia peach and some nuts?

No in all seriousness, can you start bringing more flavours to Europe? Is there any plans to do this? I usually can only find Caramel Chew Chew and Cookie Dough (and the odd Baked Alaska), and I love them but I'm more of a fruit kinda gal. What is the weirdest flavor that has been suggested to you? Hey Ben, avid stamper here. So glad you're doing this! And hi Jerry! I've been stamping for a while now and I love it, so what's next for the Stampede? Well, we're launching our yearlong project in New Hampshire- the presidential primaries are occuring there right now, the candidates are already coming through, and our project is to flood NH with stamped money. So we have calculated that there are 32 MILLION $1 bills circulating in New Hampshire - we want to be 10% of them stamped - so that when the presidential candidates come in and the press, they are all finding stamped bills that say "NOT TO BE USED FOR BUYING ELECTIONS." So that's 3.2 million. We are on track to get 6,500 people in New Hampshire stamping money. If each one of them stamps 3 bills a day - that would be just about 1,000 bills - and 1,000 times 6500 is 6.5 MILLION - double what we need! So that's the plan. And you can do this in any of the early primary states - that would help.  Is Seven Layer Bar going to be released in pints?   There are times when I need a pint of that ambrosia, like, right now! So Coconut Seven Layer bar - the flavor is available in ScoopShops. I personally *love* the flavor. The history of coconut flavors with Ben &amp; Jerry's has been checkered. In fact, my all-time favorite flavor, Coconut-Almond-Fudge-Chip, the company used to make in pints - is now in the flavor graveyard. It's really unfair, there oughta be favoritism shown for Ben &amp; Jerry. I mean, shouldn't the company be able to make MY favorite flavor even if it doesn't sell well?  I mean, wouldn't you want the cofounders of the company to be able to eat  their favorite flavors? It seems short-sighted.  I wonder what the minimum order would be to get Coconut-Almond-Fudge-Chip. 

It's probably like a day's production - how many pints is that? Probably a couple hundred thousand pints.

If we can get a couple hundred thousand people to say they'd buy it - you may have to come to Vermont to pick it up.  This is a perfect example of a genius at work. Talking to himself and replying to his own answers. This is why they were successful.  What's one flavor you've always wanted to make, but couldn't get just right?  how is it you're so amazing? I was just telling someone the other day that the further away you get from where we live in Vermont, the more amazing we seem. The closer you are to us, unfortunately, things come into a little sharper focus.  it's true. Nobody is a prophet in their own hometown. The question is WHY are we amazing? How are we amazing? Who thinks we're amazing? 

 I think it's not that we're amazing.

Ben &amp; I are two regular guys who didn't have any business training and never expected to be successful businesspeople. And over the years, we've found ourselves having this respected ice cream company, and we're faced with the opportunity of being able to use our voices and our platform to talk about things that are important, and not just what are the needs of a business.

And we're able to try to influence things at Ben &amp; Jerry's to have the activities of the business be addressing human needs, and not just business profitability.

And I think... having that opportunity, that platform, you feel lucky to be able to do it.  Yaddayaddayaddaa.

What people want to know is: how do you get free ice cream?

All you have to do to get free ice cream, if you're reading this AMA: 

go to the StampStampede.org website, you order a stamp, and we (at the Stampede) are gonna assume that anybody who orders a stamp in the next hour came from reddit Ask me Anything.

And we are gonna send a free pint of ice cream to ANYBODY who gets a stamp in the next hour.

**So how can I get free ice cream?**

There you go. &gt; Yaddayaddayaddaa.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; What people want to know is: how do you get free ice cream?

This should be on a fucking statue or taught in every philosophy class or some shit. This is why y'all are amazing Jerry, I'm curious how the non labeling of GMO foods affects your products. Also, do you feel labeling of GMO foods or regulations about GMO foods taking precautions for local/national ecosystems will be the most beneficial? 

 So I am a big supporter of mandatory labeling of GMOs in food and the company is as well, because we believe that consumers have a right to know what they're buying and eating.

It's simply a matter of a customer being able to make an informed decision.  Do you believe that forcing companies to label GMOs contributes to the belief that GMOs are somehow more dangerous to consume than "normal" food? People who want GMO labeling inherently believe they are dangerous despite the lack of evidence for the claim.

Most all beliefs about GMO's are extensions of the naturalistic fallacy, which holds that "naturally" occurring things are safe.(ya know, like lead, arsenic, cyanide, or mercury! All naturally occurring!)

The arguments are just a front for pushing a wacky believe or they are a brilliant strategy for preying on consumer ignorance regarding the actual science behind GMOs. 

There is no disagreement among experts in the actual biotech sciences on the safety of GMOs, thus there is no reason to label them other then to confuse ignorant customers.
 I know. I just wanted to see if he would answer. I think GMOs are safe but I want labels on my food to know where it comes from.  

I want to know what state or country the produce was grown in, if not the farm it came from.  I want to know the conditions that the animals were raised in.  I want to know if the food was sprayed with organohalide pesticides.  This info isn't all about the safety of food.  Some of it is because I simply want to know what I'm eating.

The place I buy food from covers most of these.  I would like to see a GMO label in addition.  Why?  Because food is the most important thing you will ever buy and we have a right to know what we are eating. Right, so only buy foods that choose to include that information. That's on you. But most of us don't care, and you wanting a full background check on Bessie your milk cow is costing everyone else a shitload of money if it's mandatory. I would actually support this - As long as the label includes ALL info and EVERY input, it doesn't put an undue emphasis on GMOs. Exactly, this, agree 100%. As much as physically possibly should be available So all fruits and vegetables would have the GMO label. Hell, every food out there would need a GMO label.

Banana's, apples, watermelons, oranges, carrots, they were all selectively bred to get certain qualities. Hell, dogs also get selectively bred. Pretty much everything we eat (excluding dogs, I don't like dog as food), has been genetically modified via breeding, which is pretty much the same to what they do in a lab, to get it to a point which we eat today. Ah, would you like the name of the chicken too and a brief summary of its personality? &gt;The place I buy food from covers most of these.

Doesn't the fact that these things are currently optional, and yet you can obtain them, prove that forcing companies to label a certain way is not necessary? If enough people share your view then the market for such foods will increase so more companies will do it. What is the logic for forcing everyone to do so? It's a completely fair question, especially when "GMO" is a vague term. By one definition, any corn is GMO because after all, it never grew that large before humans started futzing with it 10,000 years ago. Ditto all cabbages (cauliflower, broccoli, brussels sprouts), tomatoes, and most squash. The claim that consumers are going to be able to make an "informed" decision if "GMO" labels go on produce ignores the fact that very few consumers know the first thing about GMO or how humans have a very long history of modifying their food. I've always had this same question. People see GMOs and they instantly panic without necessarily knowing the difference. I'm not one to blindly support GMOs, but at the same time it is something that would scare people away when they otherwise wouldn't care. They'll eat at McDonald's but avoid something at the grocery store because THAT's what they label.  Personally, I am not a scientist and therefore cannot have an expert opinion about GMOs.  Therefore, my informed decision whenever I'm in a situation like this is based on what the consensus among the experts actually is.  The overwhelming consensus within the scientific community is that GMO foods are not more dangerous than non-GMO foods.  (See the [decade long research commission by the EU](http://ec.europa.eu/research/biosociety/pdf/a_decade_of_eu-funded_gmo_research.pdf) that supports this [despite the EU banning GMOs for economic reasons and ignoring their own scientific research] and the consensus of many other scientific organizations such as the American Medical Association, the FDA, as well as international organizations such as the  WHO.)

I think that the worry about labeling GMO foods is that it will unnecessarily worry the public about potential "dangers" of GMOs and impede progress in the development of GMOs that may be beneficial in a world where food security is becoming an ever-increasing concern due to issues such as global warming. &gt;  The overwhelming consensus within the scientific community is that GMO foods are not more dangerous than non-GMO foods. 


Yes, when you ask Monsanto affiliated "scientists". Also there have been no studies as to the safety of GMOs which have not included strict NDAs and limits on what is published, by, you guessed it, Monsanto.

Equating that to "science" makes everyone involved look like mouthbreathing idiots. 

Predetermined conclusions in studies funded by the company whose products are being tested are the EXACT OPPOSITE OF SCIENCE.

That's known as pseudoscience. If you look over the study that I linked, which is one of the most extensive research projects done on the topic of GMOs and was commissioned by the EU (which actually bans GMOs and has a vested economic interest in keeping GMOs banned for trade reasons), you'll see that the findings still show no higher risk of danger with GMOs than other conventional crops.

It is not just Monsanto affiliated studies. Why that specific breeding method?  Why not radiation mutagenesis?  Why not chemical mutagenesis?  Why not haploid breeding?  These all have much more impact to an organism's genome than any transgene on the market.  In addition to that, I think any food company oughta be allowed to talk about the ingredients they put in their products. They should be shouting them from the rooftops! &gt; I think any food company oughta be allowed to talk about the ingredients they put in their products.

Would anything prevent you from voluntarily identifying GMO ingredients? Including dairy might be one.  GMO labeling doesn't include dairy, yet dairy cows eat GMO's to produce milk that's used in your ice cream.

Ironic isn't it?  

For the record I'm against a label bc it does nothing to educate people on GMO's or how there food was produced and if it contains GMO's, case in point is ice cream having a GMO free label.  Label based on science, not fear mongering.


 I'm cool with that because I give credence to science and actual scientific findings over the fear-based scaretactics used by GMO labeling proponents.

Come at me, my body is ready. Well thats the real irony here, dairy farms have cows for a long time, some cows over 10 years.  So if GMO's were actually harmful to the health of those that consume them, then farmers would be seeing this in the lifetime of there herds.  If it negatively affected them they would stop using them. &gt;"So if GMO's were actually harmful to the health of those that consume them, then farmers would be seeing this in the lifetime of there herds."

~~Well, That would only be correct for OP's m~~

Omg I can't believe I was about to pull a mom joke on B&amp;amp;J. Forgive me, what have I become. i agree with being against the new label-- [organic](http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentidonly=true&amp;contentid=organic-agriculture.html) already covers it, and would be redundant Why does it work in Europe then? Genuine question It depends on what you define as working.

&gt;Since 2013 the experimental planting of GM plants has also been abandoned owing to persistent vandalism.

 I was referring to labeling laws in the EU but thanks for the links, they were interesting reads. I'm not sure whether the being vary of GMOs is bad though. In Germany for example the organic movement has gained such a movement that almost everything is organic, from the eggs you buy to the chocolate, and because of the demand they are almost the same price. So GMOs essentially led to a rise in food quality in Germany.  Why do you think organic is healthier or better quality?  Here its not a mandatory label its voluntary as scientific studies show there's no real health benefits.  In the EU its politically mandated which more or less protects their farmers by labeling a GMO product is inferior.

http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2012/09/little-evidence-of-health-benefits-from-organic-foods-study-finds.html

This would give you an idea on prices, not sure what all you eat or buy organic but it lists 16 products and various countries.  Keep in mind as well that many countries subsidize to keep the price down, for milk the US subsidizes $4 billion, the EU is $56 billion, Canada has no subsidy but a quota system.

There's an assumption that organic's don't use chemicals which is how they like to market it, but its far from the truth.  Look at #1 in the list Bt.

http://www.extension.colostate.edu/chaffee/mast/mast_docs/NewOrganicPesticides.pdf

Here's a good example:

https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~lhom/organictext.html

&gt;A recent study compared the effectiveness of a rotenone-pyrethrin mixture versus a synthetic pesticide, imidan. Rotenone and pyrethrin are two common organic pesticides; imidan is considered a "soft" synthetic pesticide (i.e., designed to have a brief lifetime after application, and other traits that minimize unwanted effects). It was found that up to 7 applications of the rotenone- pyrethrin mixture were required to obtain the level of protection provided by 2 applications of imidan.

&gt;It seems unlikely that 7 applications of rotenone and pyrethrin are really better for the environment than 2 applications of imidan, especially when rotenone is extremely toxic to fish and other aquatic life.

&gt;It should be noted, however, that we don't know for certain which system is more harmful. This is because we do not look at organic pesticides the same way that we look at conventional pesticides. We don't know how long these organic pesticides persist in the environment, or the full extent of their effects.

&gt;When you look at lists of pesticides allowed in organic agriculture, you find warnings such as, "Use with caution. The toxicological effects of [organic pesticide X] are largely unknown," or "Its persistence in the soil is unknown." Again, researchers haven't bothered to study the effects of organic pesticides because it is assumed that "natural" chemicals are automatically safe.

Here's a German study (shows funding) that shows the benefits like reduced chemical pesticides.  So farmers aren't choosing chemicals based on what is less harmful to the environment or better for the crop bc its political and not based on the actual science of growing food. 

http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0111629

&gt;On average, GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yields by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68%. Yield gains and pesticide reductions are larger for insect-resistant crops than for herbicide-tolerant crops. Yield and profit gains are higher in developing countries than in developed countries.

 Thank you for taking the time to write that up. The reason why I think organic is better is animal welfare. Food inc. does a good job illustrating how horrible industrial farming practices can be. From cows being fed corn to chickens not being able to walk due to their weight. The second reason is growth hormones, I simply like the food I eat to be hormone free. Those two are the only reasons really. 

Btw I know about the chemicals and agree with you on the pesticides. I think it's foolish not researching how harmful organic pesticides are. And I'm not even anti gmo. But I got to tell you it's anecdotal evidence I know but I never got sick since I bought organic, and it wasn't even my choice it just sorta happened. Everything has an organic sticker nowadays, it's impossible not to buy organic.

Finally just a question, the study you linked stating that organic food isn't more nutritious than conventional food is a meta analysis. Doesn't that assume that all the studies they have chosen to review need to be free of bias/corporate interest skewing the data? Or if the sample is big enough, does it not matter that much because real evidence is bound to triumph over skewed results when the sample size is big? what are they eating that is gmo? Crops like corn, soy, and alfalfa are eaten by dairy cows.

Also if GMO's were harming animals we'd see it in dairy cows as they consume a lot over their lifetime.  If it was actually affecting them then farmers would stop using it.  Literally every dairy farm is proof there's no harm from consuming GMO's.

 Hey I'm on your side was just curious if you knew offhand.  No problem, I didn't downvote your questions, just wanted to make sure that people reading understood the complete picture.   Roger that.  No, nothing at all.   lol yea of course jerry cuts out there [Chipotle does it](http://www.chipotle.com/en-us/menu/ingredients_statement/ingredients_statement.aspx) You are already allowed to market your products as GMO-free. Do you support mandatory 'Feces Grown' labels on organics for the same reason? Does that analogy help you see the problem with the labeling of GMOs, a technology that has proven itself to perfectly safe for human health and the environment? OP pls Except GMO isn't an ingredient.  All ingredients should be listen, but a GMO molecule and a non-GMO molecule are the same.  Wouldn't labelling reinforce the bad science of thinking GMOs are some bogeyman? They are allowed to.  So with this in mind, what's with all the stuff like caramel color, corn syrup solids, etc., that makes its way into your ice cream? After buying a ton of your ice cream over the years, that was ultimately a turn-off for me. The mandatory 'Caramel Coloring Label' folks aren't a big enough group to effectively market to, that's why. &gt;smoke weed erry day I agree. But isn't the best way to do that to educate the customer, rather than just give him one highly charged fact that he doesn't understand?

I have no issue with GMO labeling but I think it needs to be paired with *real* consumer education. Right now, most anti-GMO people have no understanding - literally none - of what GMO even *means*. Especially considering that a majority of foods we eat are technically genetically modified. Bananas in their natural state, for example, are disgusting. But the modified plantain/banana hybrid we find in stores are delicious :) My dad has been GMOing it up in his huge garden my whole life... He loves creating crossbreeds, he comes up with his own names for them. Like a mad gardener!  I believe that most people who want GMO labeling aren't interested in labels for food that is the product of selective breeding, but rather food that has had it's dna directly manipulated by people. The anti-GMO crowd thinks that "GMO" means transgenic breeding exclusively. Most of them [that I've talked to] are entirely ignorant to all the other varieties of genetic modification, including radiation mutagenesis which is the primary way new commercial varieties of organic crops are bred. 

Transgenic breeding means taking one specific gene from an organism and putting it in the exact specific place you want it in another organism. It's far more precise and exact than any other variety of GE, where hundreds of genes can be crossed or changed in entirely random and unpredictable ways. The anti-GMO crowd says they oppose transgenic breeding because it's unpredictable and "you don't know what might happen!", but that's only because they slept through science class. In my experience, the anti-GMO crowd equates GMOs to "crops and fields saturated with chemicals" without realizing the massive dilution process and ignorant to the fact that organics use chemicals too. It needs to be a clear definition then, I think. Otherwise there will be too much grey area and people will find ways around it. Despite about a couple thousand studies performed all over the world giving GMOs a thumbs up, it's still a very dirty label. If you back mandatory labeling, you should also be backing mandatory education on what GMOs really are.

B&amp;J are probably doing this for business rather than a genuine care for consumer health though. It probably wouldn't be good for them to promote labeling as well as say, "Hey, it's not bad". &gt; Despite about a couple thousand studies performed all over the world giving GMOs a thumbs up

Can you please link to some of those studies that are transparent and independent?  In other words, some studies that aren't industry-sponsored (directly or by proxy) from the likes of Monsanto, etc.?

I ask this because despite all the cheerleading in this thread for GMOs and the derision for Ben &amp; Jerry's GMO labeling, I'm not seeing many sources of evidence to support these arguments and I've found the issue to be more nuanced than many here are trying to make it seem.

For example, respected science journal *Nature* (who is mostly pro-GMO) says that research on transgenic crops must be done outside industry as well.

There's also the myth that there's absolute scientific consensus on the overall safety and efficacy of GMOs in all circumstances and that isn't true.

I certainly don't think all GMO in all forms are "evil" and bad in all cases, but there needs to be more independent studies. Corporations like Monsanto need to stop making that more transparent process difficult. If they've got nothing to hide, then they should stop acting like it.

What I want to know through more **independent** and **transparent** studies (without conflicts of interest) is all the downsides so I can properly weigh that against all the purported upsides we get from opaque, industry sponsored studies from the likes of Monsanto, etc.
