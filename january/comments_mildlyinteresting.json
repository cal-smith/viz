As the box will need to be scanned the dimensions must exceed the bar code sticker that is attached to the box with your sender/delivery information. Say you are shipping a box from Buffalo NY to Sacremento CA. The item will generally be sent from a receiving outlet on a box truck to a [central location](http://www.vanderlande.com/upload_mm/2/5/3/5959_fullimage_DP_DHL.jpg) where it is off loaded and processed into the depot. This could be the local depot that would then ship it to a [regional depot](http://images.bwbx.io/cms/2013-09-18/0918_FedEx_Express_630x420.jpg) for processing and sorting. Once in the regional depot it will be separated into land or [air freight](http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/31886227.jpg) depending upon the service paid. If it is a land delivery it will be sent on an 18 Wheeler/Semi to another regional depot where it will once again be in processed and sent through another series of belts and slides, thrown onto another vehicle to be dropped at the local depot or outlet. Transit by air freight is similar with the difference being re-sorted and weighed for the air cargo number crunchers to generate weights and measurements for the air cargo hauler company to comply with the weights and balances of the aircraft along with other packages being sent as cargo. So along the way it has gone through a local depot, regional depot, Central hub depot, another regional depot and a local depot and finally on to a truck to be delivered to a local outlet for pick up or to be delivered to the receiver address. Each depot has it's own system for routing and handling your package. The reason your box is larger than the small item inside is so that it doesn't cause [logistics issues](https://i.imgur.com/Lu6DWh.jpg) in the chain such as falling between the rollers or not being sufficiently weighted as to keep it stable and easily stackable.

Three days later, you still remember the advertisement. \n\nThere is evidence of this concept that everyone can relate to. For example:  \nA guy bakes a cake and leaves his oven on. The oven displays a red light indicating 'ON'.  \nAs he rushes out the door, he sees the red light but thinks nothing of it. This has created conflict in his mind, because he knows something is wrong, he is just too preoccupied with other thoughts.  \nAfter leaving he realizes \"SHIT! I left the oven on\".  \nWhat you need to understand here is how he remembered.  \nIn many cases, he would remember baking, but not turning off the oven.  \nIn other cases he may even ask himself \"did I turn off the oven?\"  \nBut quite frequently it is more like \"I feel like I saw the oven lig- OH SHIT\" and THEN thinking \"did I turn off the oven?\" and THEN thinking \"I remember baking but not turning off the oven\". \n\nI am sure you can apply your own personal examples.\n  \nSubliminal advertising should not be all that common, from what I understand it may even be illegal(in some forms such as flashing in on a screen quickly?) but the point is, it has the potential to work with little backlash.

And curiosity driven experimentation and observation is a GOOD THING, even when it involves playing with your food.\n\nHave you looked at a lump of rosin that a violinist uses to prepare the bow? It is a block of yellow or orange material. But where the violinist has rubbed the bowstrings along it, it looks white. And the powder it produces definitely looks white. This is another example of essentially the same phenomenon.\n\nMarmite is a material that has visco-elastic flow properties, somewhere between a viscous liquid and a soft gel. When you pat the surface repeatedly with a spoon, what you are doing is generally roughening up the surface into a tangle of microscopic peaks and valleys. Some marmite adheres to the spoon, and is lifted into a sharp peak as the spoon is withdrawn. Because the material is not truly liquid, the peak stays there.\n\nOptically, marmite (as usually encountered with a smooth surface) is an indescribable brownish-black colour with a significant surface lustre. It can look quite shiny. What this means is that the light which reaches our eyes from a sample of marmite has travelled through a fair amount of light \nabsorbing material before we get a little bit of it reflected back (the brownish-black colour that we see). \n\nBut is also means that a small but significant proportion of the light -- perhaps 10 to 15% -- is reflected directly back from the surface (the lustrous or shiny appearance). When we roughen the surface, we increase the amount of that surface reflection, and we change things so that the reflection will be a diffuse one from several surfaces rather than a direct one. The result is that the material looks \nwhite, because most of the light we see coming from it has been reflected off its front surface in a diffuse way, without ever penetrating deeply into the material where it can be absorbed.\"", "score": 1},{"body": "That's a picture of a cup on top of a black car, so no it doesn't.\n", "score": 4},{"body": "Nope.

That is to say, if *m* and *n* are positive integers, we have:\n\n*m* \\* *n* = *m* + *m* + ... + *m* (where the number of *m*s in that expression is *n*)\n\nand\n\n*m*^*n* = *m* \\* *m* \\* ... \\* *m* (again, with a total of *n* *m*s in that expression).\n\nAs far as positive integers are concerned, these can be taken as *definitions* of multiplication and exponentiation (and are usually presented as such in elementary education). Notice that addition is presented as the *foundational* operation, since multiplication has been defined as repeated addition, and exponentiation has been defined as repeated multiplication, which incidentally makes it a form of repeated addition as well. So we can say that addition is the *first* operation, multiplication the *second*, and exponentiation *third*, in some sort of hierarchy where the next operation is *n*-fold repetition of the previous one. Then you might ask, can we continue this hierarchy beyond exponentiation? Certainly. The fourth and fifth operations are naturally called \"tetration\" and \"pentation\", from the Greek numeral prefixes for *fourth* and *fifth*. Being of little practical use, there is no standardized notation for tetration and pentation, but tetration is usually denoted by putting the index (called a \"hyperpower\") before the base, instead of after (in contrast with exponentiation). Thus, we have:\n\n^*n* *m* = *m*^(*m*^(...^*m* ) ) (*n* times)\n\nFor positive integers *m* and *n*. (Notably, the extension of tetration to non-integer numbers is not quite settled, for more info see wiki). And similarly with pentation.\n\nWe can continue this hierarchy forever. But here's something interesting: we know that 2+2=4, 2\\* 2=4, and 2^2 =4. But it turns out that the the operation of 2 with itself is equal to 4 *for all* operations in the infinite hierarchy. Why is this true? Well, suppose that we have 2 operated with 2 equals 4 for the *N*th operation in the hierarchy. Then 2 operated with 2 in the (*N*+1)th operation is given by: 2 operated with itself 2 times, with the *N*th operation. But we already supposed that this is equal to 4! If you are familiar with mathematics, you should realize that I've just made an inductive argument; this proves that 2 operated with itself equals 4 for all operations in the hierarchy.\n\nNow earlier I said that addition was the foundational operation. But it happens that addition itself can be represented as repetition of some other operation: this \"more foundational\" operation is called *zeration*, the *zeroth* operation. Again, there is no standardized notation, but here I'll use the \"at\" symbol @. Due to some technical aspects, I have to refer to the \"successor function\" S, which gives the next integer. So S(0)=1, S(1)=2, S(S(1))=S(2)=3, S(98)=99, etc. Then zeration has the following peculiar definition:\n\n*m* @ *n* = S(m) (if m&gt;n) **or** S(n) (if n&gt;m) **or** S(S(m)) (if m=n)\n\nAnd, as you can prove for yourself, addition can be *constructed* from zeration, as follows:\n\n*m* + *n* = *m* @ *m* @ ... @ *m* (*n* times).\n\nNotice that even in zeration, we have 2@2=4.\n\n(You might ask, can we go further backwards, with negative operations? The answer is no, and it's pretty easy to prove yourself. Assume that a \"-1\"th operation exists, for example, and you will eventually find a paradox, meaning that such an operation cannot exist. However, we can extend the ordinary number system to allow such a thing to exist, similarly to how we have complex numbers for inversion of exponentiation.)\n\n**tl;dr** the \"2edgy4me\" meme generalizes to \"*n*edgy(*n*P2)me\", where P is any operation in the infinite hierarchy of operations described above.", "score": 1},{"body": "Can someone please find/photoshop a Pigeon *Coupe*?", "score": 1},{"body": "That's how they get ya", "score": 1},{"body": "mercury's in retrograde.
