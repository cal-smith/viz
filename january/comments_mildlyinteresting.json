The shifter can cycle the order of the bits *ABCD* as *DABC*, *CDAB*, or *BCDA*; in this case, no bits are lost. That is, it can shift all of the outputs up to three positions to the right (and thus make any cyclic combination of A, B, C and D). The barrel shifter has a variety of applications, including being a useful component in [microprocessors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor) (alongside the [ALU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit)).\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/NI1wpU6.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Crossbar_barrel_shifter.svg) - *Schematic of a 4-bit crossbar barrel shifter. x\u00a0denotes input bits and y denotes output bits.*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^BKM ^algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BKM_algorithm) ^| [^StrongARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StrongARM) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cnmhlus) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cnmhlus)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "score": 16, "created": 1421074215.0},{"body": "[Do a barrel shift!](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110914205058/random-ness/images/e/e2/Peppy_resized.gif)", "gilded": 0, "score": 10, "created": 1421076283.0},{"body": "Biv, Roy G.

An error in one component may then be out-voted by the other two. In a triply redundant system, the system has three sub components, all three of which must fail before the system fails. Since each one rarely fails, and the sub components are expected to fail independently, the probability of all three failing is calculated to be extraordinarily small; often outweighed by other risk factors, e.g., human error. Redundancy may also be known by the terms \"majority voting systems\"  or \"voting logic\". \n\n&gt;Redundancy sometimes produce less, instead of more reliability\u00a0\u2013  it creates a more complex system which is more prone to various issues, it may lead to human neglectance of duty, and it may lead to higher production demands which are overstressing the system making it less safe. \n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/Ef9E90w.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PC-Netzteil_\\(redundant\\).jpg) - *Redundant power supply*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Carrier ^grade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_grade) ^| [^Data ^redundancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_redundancy) ^| [^Don't ^repeat ^yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cnlyg5k) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cnlyg5k)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "score": 6, "created": 1421020424.0},{"body": "I see what you did there..

Life isn't so simple and a \"simple\" solution usually works only in a certain circumstance - a circumstance that the misguided advocate of simplicity (you!) conveniently forgets to tell anyone about.\n\n##Exterior Freeze-Proof Faucet\n\nIt is constructed as follows: The valve is *inside* of the building, and there's a very long extension outlet tube between the valve and the spigot. It should be installed with the spigot a bit lower than the valve. When you close the valve, the remaining water will drain out naturally.\n\nIt might fail:\n\n1. If it's installed improperly (spigot above the valve), it won't drain properly and may get damaged.\n\n2. If you leave it dripping, you will destroy it. As it cools from the outside in, the dripping water will plug it up on the outside, eventually filling the entire outlet tube, freezing it solid and bursting it.\n\n3. If you leave it with a hose attached, it may never drain properly in the first place, and will freeze solid and the outlet tube will burst.\n\nFinally, the *failure of the outlet tube is* **insidious**. First of all, with the valve closed, the failure is after the valve, so nothing leaks. Once you open the valve, there will be a small leak if there is no restriction of the flow. So you might open the valve and the water will flow \"OK\" and you're none the wiser. Eventually you attach a hose, open the valve, and the flow restriction will add some backpressure that will force the water through the crack in the already burst outlet tube. This water will usually go straight inside of your wall, slowly destroying it from inside. I hope you see why I had to type *insidious* in bold above.\n\n##Exterior Non-Freeze-Proof Faucet\n\nIt is simply a valve on the end of a pipe. The valve is on the outside of the building. When you close the valve, the pipe going through the wall is still full of water. To protect it from freezing:\n\n1. Close the shut-off valve inside of the building - by most codes every exterior faucet should have a shutoff valve inside.\n\n2. Open the faucet so that it drains.\n\nIt might fail:\n\n1. If it's installed improperly (spigot above the shut-offvalve), it won't drain properly and may get damaged.\n\n2. If you leave it dripping, you will destroy it. As it cools from the outside in, the dripping water will plug it up on the outside. The pipe going across the wall is full of water and it will freeze solid as soon as it stops flowing, and will burst.\n\n3. If you leave it with a hose attached, it may never drain properly in the first place, and will freeze solid and the pipe will burst.\n\nThe failure here is also a bit insidious: You'll get a huge water leak after the temperatures get higher. So while everything is frozen, things will look OK. Due to mechanics of the pipe, it's very likely that the split will also happen inside the wall cavity. You might flood the inside of your house once it gets warmer outside.\n\n##Interior Faucet\n\nIt might have the pipes feeding it installed in an exterior wall. With inadequate insulation or inadequate interior temperature, the pipes in the wall will freeze.  The workarounds are twofold:\n\nFirst, simply keep the water warm enough so that it won't freeze.\n\n1. (what you propose) Keep the water flowing. The incoming city water will have a temperature  about 38-39F. As the water flows in the wall, it will cool down. As long as you keep it flowing fast enough so that the temperature at the faucet is above freezing, the pipes will not freeze - the water inside of them is warm enough not to freeze.\n\n2. Decrease the thermal resistance between the pipe in the wall and the warm inside air. Thus - open the cabinets under the sink and wherever else the pipes run in the exterior wall. Move away any furniture that would keep the pipes in the exterior wall insulated from the interior air.\n\n3. Increase the interior temperature.\n\nAlternatively, drain the pipes from water.\n\nEDIT: Apparently we can't all have good things.

Snow rollers have been seen to grow as large as two feet in diameter.\n\n&gt;The following conditions are needed for snow rollers to form:\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* There must be a relatively thin surface layer of wet, loose snow, with a temperature near the [melting point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point) of ice\n\n&gt;* Under this thin layer of wet snow there must be a substrate to which the thin surface layer of wet snow will not stick, such as ice or powder snow\n\n&gt;* The wind must be strong enough to move the snow rollers, but not strong enough to blow them apart.\n\n&gt;* Alternatively, gravity can move the snow rollers as when a snowball, such as those that will fall from a tree or cliff, lands on a steep hill and begins to roll down the hill.\n\n&gt;Because of this last condition, snow rollers are more common in hilly areas. However, the precise nature of the conditions required makes them a very rare phenomenon.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/dssh7tX.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Snowroller.jpg) - *A snow roller in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Snow ^cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_cone) ^| [^Snow ^grains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_grains) ^| [^Temperate ^climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_climate) ^| [^Extratropical ^cyclone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+co8713y) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+co8713y)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1422835865.0},{"body": "Can someone explain how it does the 'hover to view' thing?
