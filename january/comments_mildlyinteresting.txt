Your Economics class is on floor \#F2CE19.
 Still somehow easier to find than "lecture hall 1." "Oh, you're in the wrong building, lad. This is 'Hall of Lecture #1', which is entirely different." "Hi, sorry I think I'm a little lost. Can you help me find Lecture Hall 1?"

*"Oh sure, it's just down the hall, second door on your left."*

"Great, thank you so m-"

*"That door leads to a different wing of the building. Once you're there, take your third right to the end of the hall and then a left. You'll see a door marked "Danger: High Voltage" It's just past that on your right."*

"Whew, okay. Thanks aga-"

*"Inside that door, you'll meet a retired sea captain named Higgs. He'll ask you three questions. Answer only the first and last ones correctly. Do this, and he will give you a paperclip, an old handkerchief and an expired container of yogurt. These will come in handy once you reach the Gargoyle King."*

"What."

*"Walk back out into the hall, through the door labeled High Voltage, down six flights of stairs and out the door with the Egyptian hieroglyph of a hawk with the body of a cat. Once outside, you'll need to commandeer a small rowing boat, travel to the furthest point of the Dark Pond and burn a red candle. You do have a red candle, right?"*

"Fuck it, I'll take Astrology instead." "Ah yes, astrology. You'll need a blue candle instead." You'll meet the night man as well. If you happen to run into the day man on the way there avoid him at all costs. He's a real fighter. Avoid the troll at all costs. He likes to collect boys' holes. Hey, you're back. How did the rape seen go? rape seen? can't say I've scene one of those lately. It clearly says boys soul I'm so memorizing this in case somebody asks for directions Or you can play Higgs. ARE YOU READY KIDS? "Aye aye captain."  
  
That's one question down, this is easy. **I CAN'T HEAR YOU!** AYE AYE CAPTAIN!! Why do they call you Higgs?

Because I'm both everywhere and nowhere, and nobody can tell whether I exist or not. I should do that as well. Because I apparently look like a walking map of my university. People ask me for directions all the damn time 1) get a campus map.
2) visit a t-shirt printing place.
3) become a walking map. "Turn left at my right nipple." That was....turn at your left nipple, right? You came up with this shit in 6 minutes. Damn. 

Summoning /u/AWildSketchAppeared for a visualization of the directions. I'll attempt it if I have time after class.  If you ever find the class.

NUAHAHHAHAAHAHAHA Re-summoning /u/AWildSketchAppeared! Your people need you!! I kinda want to hear what the rest of the quest would be... [Don't worry, the directions get easier when you're going further...](http://xkcd.com/461/) [Image](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/google_maps.png)

**Title:** Google Maps

**Title-text:** Apparently Google assumes you're traveling during the ferry's normal operating hours.  We lost two hours circling that damn lake (to say nothing of the Straw Man).

Oh, well then you'll want to head down the street until you meet the ferryman... He will ask for 3 silver pieces, you must only give him one copper. At the other shore, there will be a man in a yellow raincoat. Tell him "the singing stones are restless." He will lend you his van. Drive down the road until you feel your blood chill in your veins.  
You will then meet the spectral wolf. The spectral wolf fears only fire.   
We can no longer direct you, but if you best the wolf it will lead you the rest of the way.

Godspeed. Little did you know that you were in Lecture Hall 1 all along. (Lecture Hall 1 is a metaphor for death.) ...so is this pass fail  You're just in the wrong phase at the moment. Once you've completed all the necessary steps you'll be transported to correct layer. 

You need to burn the red candle to gain permission to see Jim the Peg-Legged Newt. He'll have the rest of the directions.  You know those moments when youre not suppose to laugh so you keep it to yourself, laughing queitly..but the act of restraint makes you laugh harder til people can hear you breathing in and out rapidly with laughter, negating the whole point of holding back.

I just did that.  Please continue this! this is how i feel on my second week of college... i get lost everyday... usually resulting in a 4-5km walk throughout my day.  It'll happen all the way up until you graduate, trust. On orientation weekend I got lost for 3 hours once, so much walking, walking and disappointment.  Freshman fifteen be damned! I lost 15lbs my freshman year because I played wow 24/7 and only ate McDonald's once a day as my only meal

And that was bad because I was already underweight But please, for God's sake, make sure the sun is in the House of Carflag. I have been on reddit for years and this is the first time I read through someone's comments for fun. You are brilliant. If I hadn't recently lost a $100K, I would give you gold. Not reddit gold, the metal kind. How does one lose 100k Well obviously he didn't take economics on floor #F2CE19.  He set it down and walked away You just leave us at "If I hadn't recently lost a $100K,"? This was a great read.  Turned into a cool quest The worst part is that I work at a university with multiple different campuses in different counties. Someone came up to me one day and asked to find the 'MECD' building. The look on their face when I informed them it was on one of the different campuses was heartbreaking and also enjoyable. http://i.imgur.com/7Zfko9C.gif ROSL *RDSL

FTFY So its the building over there?

"No no no, that's The lecture Hall. It came before lecture hall 1 hence the 1 was added to distinguish them. Your on the wrong side of campus" "The architects who designed the buildings were programmers. It's actually The lecture Hall 0 but we drop the 0 because it's faster to say." Eventually, the department expanded, and now there's a new building on the other side of Lecture Hall 0. That's Lecture Hall 4,294,967,295. I've asked why it wasn't simply Lecture Hall -1. They mentioned some mumbo-jumbo about  "unsigned overflow in the database column". No idea what they meant, I'm just a Whale Biologist after all. I once had a lecture on the 11th floor of a building - which was somehow above the 12th and 13th floors. Would have killed for some colour co-ordination.  At the Escher College of Architecture, surely? Especially when "lecture hall 1" and "lecture hall 01" are, in fact, different rooms like at my university... don't ask me who came up with that ingenious idea. My Uni recently renamed all of the Lecture halls from "Lecture Hall #" to "Building Rm. #" When new students would ask me where Physics Rm 108 was I had no idea. I could have told them where LH7 was in a heartbeat though.
 [That's this floor](http://i.imgur.com/FfhWT5O.png) http://i.imgur.com/3zAKUUI.gif [deleted] Can't you read, that is June Burns. I never knew they could do that with their nostrils... Yeah its pretty weird for non-initiated, i'm a zoologist and i've been working on the subject for several years now, its a specific movement of the thoracic cage during, that allows the incoming air to pass, to do so their nostrill are moved by the  levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle attached to the upper frontal process of the maxilla , this allows them to quickly regain their respiration after spending several minutes underwater.
Sorry if i'm not clear, I don't speak english.
 Yea you speak zoologist ...use them to breathe? Look at the gif. Either I'm looking at it wrong or they fold into each-other. Pretty freaky.  Gotta keep that water out somehow. As a color blind person that's literally of no help It looks like piss.   How would that help a colorblind person? They'd also have trouble seeing the color of piss... 2nd floor according to this picture then? &gt; F2CE19

No. Again it's the F2CE19th floor. Fuckin' hate this school. Your Intro to C Programming class is in lecture hall 0xdeadface. Your Music Theory class is in lecture hall 0xeeecdddb. The diner is in #c0ffee floor. [deleted] Reminds me of Mirror's Edge. Not the same as OP, but this library really gives me a Mirror's Edge vibe

You guys have a sweet library and you embarrassed my school's basketball team yesterday? Damn Congrats on your team's victory against the fuckheads down the road!

-a passionate Heel w00t! I am also wolfpack member! I'm currently browsing reddit in that very library. Oh damn, was not expecting to look at this and see my library. The bathrooms look very similar to the ones in *the Shining* imo. My thoughts exactly. Reminds me of the mall level
 These many colors would give the player a complex. Runner vision kicked into over drive. Actually its more like Antichamber Mirror's Edge is SOOO GOOD! Agreed, I loved it. I hope they don't ruin the sequel by trying to make it "open-world" just because that's the newest fad. The best part of the game was when you got in the groove and figured out all the routes as they came at you. You can't do that in an open-world game if you're just wandering. They do need to improve on the combat, though. Either downplay its importance or overhaul the mechanics. They made combat clunky because they wanted to force the player to use the environment to escape enemies, which would have been a smart choice had they not then gone and included several levels where completion was all but impossible (or, in a couple cases, literally impossible) without taking on enemies. Innovation is key in gaming. I have faith (heh) in the mirror's edge team to incorporate the same feel of the first mirror's edge into the open word template they are most likely going to use for ME2. I think it'll end up great. Take a picture looking down  [It's less impressive...](http://i.imgur.com/B4gtrFE.jpg) I think that's even more impressive. It has glitter and everything  If you fall down that staircase you'll see a rainbow blur before you hit the ground. It's about as close to Rainbow Road as real life gets. [Here you go.](http://i.imgur.com/a7VXJ5F.png) Almost had me there! Somewhat reminds me of Antichamber Glad to see I'm not the only one.  I want to jump down it, but I know in real life there's no springy square thing at the bottom. We fall down when there is nothing there to support us.  Some choices leave us running in circles  trippy I didn't know Wonka's factory had a school in it.  Wonka would've put ROYGBIV in the right order.  It is in order, well kind of.

&gt;

&gt;A __barrel shifter__ is a [digital circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_circuit) that can [shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_shift) a [data word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(data_type\)) by a specified number of [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) in one [clock cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_cycle). It can be implemented as a sequence of [multiplexers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexer) (mux.), and in such an implementation the output of one mux is connected to the input of the next mux in a way that depends on the shift distance.

&gt;For example, take a four-bit barrel shifter, with inputs A, B, C and D. The shifter can cycle the order of the bits *ABCD* as *DABC*, *CDAB*, or *BCDA*; in this case, no bits are lost. That is, it can shift all of the outputs up to three positions to the right (and thus make any cyclic combination of A, B, C and D). The barrel shifter has a variety of applications, including being a useful component in [microprocessors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor) (alongside the [ALU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit)).

The violet dye, of course, was extracted out of Violet Beauregarde. Did you consider perhaps that the school has a Wonka factory inside of it rather than the opposite? Reminds me of Antichamber. Antichamber gave me the biggest sense of accomplishment of probably any game I've played once I finished it. Such a fun and rewarding game. You can finish Antichamber? Yeah. Credits pop up and everything. Yes. It has an ending puzzle and cutscene and everything.

Hint(no spoilers): in the antechamber(the beginning), behind the glass wall, you can see the door labeled "Exit". Throughout the game, you will be able to reach and open this door many times, but every time you do so, there will be a wall directly behind it. Except for the last time. Hey this may fit well in /r/woahdude also. Nice pic.  Or /r/crazystairs! Didn't realise there was such a sub. Thanks.  Wow. At my school they just grew some ivy on the wall and raised tuition 9%.  Which university is this? This looks like Sheffield Hallam owen building
source: am student that uses blue floor I walk through the uni nearly every weekday and I've never appreciated the colours. I thought this was Sheffield Hallam too. Fancy that. I thought it was University of Sheffield because we have funky buildings Yeah it is, not as cool when you have to walk all the way up though...  I took this in the Owen Building at Sheffield Hallam University, South Yorkshire, UK. The building has around twelve floors and the walls on each are painted a different colour - [you can just about see the colours from the outside, through the glass of the atrium, here.](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@53.379353,-1.465355,3a,75y,241.64h,112.03t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1sW8ZX3csI7O8AAAQfCOxh0A!2e0!3e2).  

&amp;nbsp;

[Here's another picture](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@53.3791818,-1.4648965,3a,75y,136.87h,85.82t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1stK92bECz7_kAAAQfCOyn-A!2e0!3e2) from inside the building on level 12. You can see the turquoise wall, and the view.   Great idea... "I'm on yellow floor for example". Some people don't remember numbers well. Yeah, but then again, some people are colorblind. [deleted] Some friend. Yeah, what a loser  Worse, some people disagree on what each colour is called. The most common is purple/pink and orange/yellow. is this SHU by any chance  I thought this might be sheffield hallam! My first thought too. Was Owen building wasn't it? Yes! Has to be the Owen building. Interesting colour scheme aside, this is a damn well-framed photo. **EDIT:** /u/mini_molko_169 pointed out that I was wrong. Take a look at my picture anyway, it's cool.  
  
  
Pretty sure that's the cole Polytechnique de Montral.

http://www.canadianinteriors.com/bestofcanada/competitions/ABCDC10/images/Pavilllons.jpg

The lower floors are red. It's not fun being in an all red corridor with no windows. Now *that* looks like Mirror's Edge. I'd parkour the shit out of that place (in game). Read the comments to find out what school this was, because it made me think of Polytechnique, but I can assure you it's not, I used to study there. It only has 4 colours, orange, red, green and blue from bottom to top Seconded, I also studied there. I don't think so. OP's picture is looking up, with red on top, opposite of your picture. That's what I thought too but at Polytechnique it's meant to represents the layers of planet Earth IIRC. So red (core) up to the blue (sky). It's Sheffield Hallam, UK - Owen Building to be specific. It's got 12 floors and they painted them each a different colour in around 2011. Yeah the design of this building is great if you're visiting, but when actually studying/researching it's awful. Almost none of the research labs and offices have windows, and they're all white with the dreaded glow of cheap fluorescent tubes instead of sunlight. Winter months are the worst. You come in early, still dark, spend the day inside working, no light, come out at 4-5 pm and it's dark again. Did Google open a University or something? Must be a liberal arts college Doesn't have to be, if it's in Europe. I know a couple of colleges in my country that have modern interior designs like that, and they're not liberal arts colleges, [including my own](http://www.homeadore.com/2012/07/30/amstel-campus-interior-oiii-architects/). I didn't know IKEA had a university... Public buildings in the Netherlands are often hella cool Why? I've seen this sort of stuff at all sorts of places. Engineers like color-coding as much as the next guy. Engineers would have put them in order by wavelength. My brain says this but my heart hopes it's MIT.  Well MIT does have some [goofy buildings](http://mostweird.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/mit_1.jpg). I was definitely thinking MIT. Maybe in the ziggurat.

Edit: Agh, no. My wife informs me that the ziggurat on that side of the river isn't part of MIT at all, [it's a Hyatt hotel](http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/hyattregency.jpg). Hi Don't do drugs. At least not there. Def do drugs there Can confirm. Drugs should be administered in that location. Username checks out as reliable source, carry on. I'm with I_LOVE_LSD on this one.  Do you love me?

    this is what it sees. Maintenance painter's worst nightmare. Heck I feel sorry for the guys putting that on. I love unique staircases. They're always an appropriate thing to add a bit of creativity to. That's basically a counter measure to make sure you don't enter class FUCK HIGH  You say I'm colorblind, I say those stairs are fifty shades of grey. Come out of the closet only to fall down the stairs.  Some poor maintenance worker is gonna have to keep up with cans of paint for every floor. What kind of fancy university do you go to where they actually do maintenance??? XD Is that a skylight at the top? So I'm definitively color blind.  /r/crazystairs Biv, Roy G. \#ColorblindMasterRace?

:( Well that's trippy as fuck.

Your university is clearly not hangover friendly. My College had this, which seemed creative and awesome until you spent the majority of your semester on a bile green colored floor.  Not the best place to be hung over. So many of those look the same to me.

Damn my eyes. Colorful vagina, weird shape though  pretty sure that's an STD That stairwell is looking dangerously gay. So is it like a gradual change between colors or is there a softstop/hardstop of one color then to another? I can't quite tell. That looks like it might have been inspired by Joseph Albers. It looks pretty awesome! Googleschool? [What is drugs?](http://youtu.be/jRSH--pRkQU?t=30s) Taste the rainbow of fruit flavors. I think, in this case, you would be urging someone to commit suicide with that kind of talk.
 Where is this? So awesome! Psychedelic staircases. Because it's cheaper to get high by visual stimuli. More legal too.  Which university?  Sheffield Hallam Britishers  See the rainbow. Climb the rainbow.  This design reminds me of a game called Antichamber. That is the new Roy G. Biv Hall.   It looks like a gob stopper.  This is a beautiful image and idea. And it reminds me of this:

"Rot, Orange, Gelb und Grn, sind im Regenbogen drin,  
Blau und Indigo geht's weiter, auf der Regenbogenleiter,  
und zum Schluss das Violett sieben Farben sind komplett."

It's even a kids' song, loosely translated:  
"Red, Orange, Yellow, and Green, in the rainbow can be seen,  
Blue and Indigo do matter on the rain bow colour ladder,  
and finally the Violet seven colours are a set."

Please send the designer back to class, after all, this hurts the eye. &gt; rainbow

Came here to point out the same thing, at least put the colors in the right order.
 It looks as a infrared scanner, with the coldest as green and warmest as blue. I think I'd hate walking up the staircase. Waaaaaaay to bright, talk about migraine. pretty, but horrendous if you have a migraine or hangover.  Super gay Super homophobic. Super gay Lovely colors...almost a rainbow. Where do you go to school LGBTU?? Universities always have interesting ways to spend money.  Fuck that, i'll be taking the elevator. This is awesome. Looks like the world is going to turn into lego. This will make an OCD murderer very happy. 
Or an OCD victim for a few seconds. *gets stabbed*

*falls to floor* 

I take a last gasp of breath as I stare longingly at the perfect pool of blood that lies beside me

"ahh"

*dies peacefully* *As your eyes slowly fade in to the welcoming abyss of the afterlife you see a final drop splash in to the tile and break the bonds* You monster. Thats my favorite part.

Hypothetically. "....dat.....cohesion...." *Surface tension** *surface tension is fancy cohesion An effect of cohesion.

Yeah yeah, since you've been gone *....dat force per unit length that acts at right angles to an imaginary line drawn on the free surface of liquid.* that's actually not how surface tension works.  surface tension is parallel to the surface of the liquid (i.e. perpendicular to the surface normal).  it resists any increase in the length of the surface. hence "surface tension". *surface* *tension* *intensifies* At least he died doing what he loved - staring at majestic blood pools "Dexter, what do you make of this?" Nothing, I'm a goddamn lumberjack. Please when a fellow Redditor stab me let my blood drip into a any shape or drawn to look like DickButt From now on when I'm stabbing people, I'll ask them their reddit username first, so I can fulfill requests like these. "U...Unidan" he gasped.

Wallrunner pulled his quill from his jacket, dipping it in the gaping chest wound of the fallen man.


The next few minutes were spent painting a masterpiece upon the tiles in the incapitated's searing velvet river, fine lines manipulated by the smooth hands of the killer.

Twenty minutes later, the masterpiece was finished and WallRunner had long departed. Two policemen stood from the body, now surrounded in black and gold tape.

"Shame about these murders, huh?" a british accent echoed from the taller one, with a leather shoe flavored mustache and a dead mans glare on the glaring dead man.
"Why do you think he's doing it?" asked the younger one, who had already seen too much for a man of his age and carried the scars of the past in his eyes, past his pleasant young walnut toned face.

"The higherups are linking the tagwords and pictures left behind to some online forum called Reddit. Some sick bastard stalking others to their whereabouts they say." Said the other, a crimson stain of past life on the wall now turning to his attention.

"What you think it is?" piked the short. "Looks like a crow I'm guessing, they're meant to be the foreboder of death and bad luck you know, possibly an ill omen of bad things to come." The coppers exchanged a worried glance, then back to the mortem man before them. "You think they'll be more?" muttered the youth.

"Many, all will probably meet the reaper in the same fate, that's how these cases turn."

"Speaking of which; this one's body is nothing more but for the crows, best call the undertaker."

"Those are jackdaws right?" pipped the elder.

The corpse popped up, it's bloodshot eyes and ghostly white iris striking the men, mouth gaping as a demonic voice boomed the room shaking. 

"HERE'S THE THING"

"YOU SAID A JACKDAW IS A CROW. IS IT IN THE SAME FAMILY? YES, NO ONE'S ARGUING THAT."

The two men backed against the wall in horror at the gristly sight.

"AS SOMEONE WHO IS A CORPSE WHO STUDIED CROWS, I AM TELLING YOU SPECIFICALLY, IN DEATH, NO ONE CALLS JACKDAWS CROWS. IF YOU WANT TO BE SPECIFIC LIKE WHAT YOU SAID, THEN YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER. THEY'RE NOT THE SAME THING."

"IF YOU'RE SAYING "CROW FAMILY" YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE TAXONOMIC GROUPING OF CORVIDAE, WHICH INCLUDES THINGS FROM NUTCRACKERS TO BLUE JAYS TO RAVENS"

"CALLED A JACKDAW A CROW BECAUSE RANDOM PEOPLE CALLED THE BLACK ONES CROWS LETS GET GRACKLES AND BLACKBIRDS IN THERE THEN TOO." 

The corpse rolled it's eyes in a circle out of it's visage window, exposing the hideous flesh and veins withholding them and causing the younger of the two officers to faint on the spot.

"ALSO, CALLING SOMEONE A HUMAN OR AN APE? IT'S NOT ONE OR THE OTHER, THAT'S NOT HOW TAXONOMY WORKS. THEY'RE BOTH. A JACKDAW IS A JACKDAW AND A MEMBER OF THE CROW FAMILY. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID!" the melted eyeballs of the deceased fixed upon the policeman, voice rising to a horrible screeching. 

"THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID! YOU SAID A JACKDAW IS A CROW, WHICH IS NOT TRUE UNLESS YOU'RE OKAY WITH CALLING ALL MEMBERS OF THE CROW FAMILY CROWS, WHICH MEANS YOU'D CALL BLUE JAYS, RAVENS, AND OTHER BIRDS CROWS TOO! WHICH YOU SAID YOU DON'T!"

The bared teeth of the ghastly white body twisted and turned, maturing into gnarled spiky gnarled fangs.

"IT'S OKAY TO ADMIT YOU'RE WRONG, YOU KNOW!?"

An eerie silence fell over the entire room the next twenty seconds, as the horrific visage slowly receded back into the corpses face, eyelids closed and lying back down.

"Blimey, what the fuck was that?"
 Holy shit, this Unidan sandbagging has reached another level... it's like getting rickrolled. Thanks man. &gt; "Shame about these murders, huh?" a british accent echoed from the taller one

It just doesn't have the same ring to it in a thick Glaswegian accent. "No luck finding them killers, then?"  it's just the one killer actually Gripping and funny story. [This dead jackdaw approves.](http://i.imgur.com/IykDb17.gif) What a story... Unidan will be missed. By his own fake accounts. must post this to redd.....  This is a scene from a movie. A fantastic potential movie.  So, as someone with OCD, this is how it actually works -

Oh, that's blood.

What kind of blood? Can I get sick from that blood? Will I get sick from smelling it? Will I get sick from being in the same room? What kind of sickness will I get from it? Do I have to clean it? Can I wash my hands after that? How do I clean it? Do I have to get chemicals? Will those chemicals make me sick? Can those chemicals burn through my hands and make touching the blood even more dangerous? Will smelling those chemicals make me sick? Did I clean the blood? Is the blood still there? Are there still germs there?

Wash hands. Wash hands again. I can still feel the germs. Wash hands again. That's three times. Three is a bad number. Wash hands again. Four times. Four is a good number. Things are good now, time to walk out of the bathroom.....

Yeah. Yup.  The worst is actually, oh, twelve hours later.. when your ear starts itching (or something) and you go "What's that?  Oh, yeah, the blood.  Didn't I read something about infections that start at your ear?  Something about the lymphatic system?  Do I have a sore throat?  {swallows}  I dunno, that might be sore.  Now that I think about it I might feel fever... hmm  {swallows again}  yeah, that's definitely getting sore.   I'm hot.  Oh god, what could I have contracted?   Should I get tested for something tomorrow?  
  
What if the incubation period is longer before it shows up on test?  Maybe I should get tested in a couple of weeks.   Maybe I should get tested tomorrow to make myself feel better, and again in a couple of weeks.  
  
{swallow}  yeah, I have a sore throat..."
  
{sigh}  I hate nighttime.   Never trust any thought you have after 10pm.
 You know, this explains so much. i mean, i'm sure it's not exactly the same, but for like my whole life i'm kept up at night tossing and turning at night, even since i was 5-6. I've been through just about everything in these two comments, is this not a normal experience?  I do this with everything. Left arm pain? Heart attack. Head hurts? Stroke or brain tumor. Eye sight blurs? Blindness onset by brain tumor. Is this a sign of being OCD? I think it depends on how far you take those thoughts and how much they really nag on you. You could just be a worry wart. I do the same thing, but it doesn't persist so I doubt it's anything like OCD. Could be wrong... I don't know, for me its constant. Every pain, every headache, every weird thing. And I don't go the doctor because I think I'm overreacting, so then I just get more paranoid that I won't go to the doctor when something actually is wrong with me because I'll just think I'm being paranoid It could be anxiety from obtrusive thoughts that spiral out of control.  OCD is always made light of, but in reality it is very torturous and all-consuming. If you think about such things often, they always pop in your head and then cause tension and even worse thoughts, then I would see a psychologist or a psychiatrist.  The best thing for OCD is cognitive behavioral therapy.  All that I have typed above is from my own experience.  I have thoughts about getting ill or in a freak accident that instantly kills me or someone that I love dearly.  The CBT has helped me to get a better grip on dropping those thoughts when they start.  I hope this helps and good luck!   No, it's hypochondria not OCD. Thank you. I don't have OCD, and I hate it when people claim to have it because of their natural urge for cleanliness. What *is* the right term? There has to be some kind of word for people who are very particular about wanting things in a particular order, who can't focus on anything else until it's fixed. I want to know what it is! Neurotic.  Too broad. It'll do in a pinch, though. Anal Fussy, the word you're looking for is fussy. Anal retentive. There is Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) which is more in line with what most people mean when they say "I'm OCD." It is less severe and in a completely different category of mental disorders  (personality vs. anxiety). 
An important and helpful (although Freudian and outdated) distinction between the two is that in OCD the obsessions and compulsions are ego- dystonic and in OCPD they are ego-syntonic. This refers to whether or not the obsessions are in line with what the 'self' wants or feels or if they are something that the 'self' fights against.  This is me, so much. It's hard to explain to some people that I'm NOT OCD, but that I also only eat my food in even numbers and bites, I haven't stepped on a crack in the sidewalk in a decade, and am perfectionist to the point that I never get shit done because it's never *right*, among other things. There's just a certain way things need to be and be done and yeah it'll irritate me if they're not right but I don't get anxious and actually distressed over it.  That's how I am, but it's not every day. If I touch the ground with my left hand, I have to touch it with my right hand to be "even". I constantly try to perfect things until I either get flustered and quit, or I just make it way worse. Nobody ever notices the imperfections but me. They tell me not to worry about it but I can't help it lol. I have this symmetry obsession too.  If I bump my arm, I have to bump the other arm in the exact same spot with the same amount of pressure. It if I step on a crack, I can feel it through my shoe and I have to step on a crack with the opposing foot in the area that my first foot hit the crack.  Since doing cognitive behavioral therapy, I find that I hardly do these things, but I do still find myself doing things by threes or fives from time to time.  When I was younger I used to switch light switches five times to turn them off or on.  Now threes and fives slip into exercise rituals, like sets for lifting and such.  I'm diagnosed OCD, and have several friends with OCD. I'm no doctor, but that sounds very OCD to me.  I've been called Anal Retentive. What if this would otherwise describe you, except for the fact that you suffer from the occasional accidental anal leakage? I had anal leakage once in my life. I was 21 and had just broken up with my girlfriend. I stayed home and ate nothing but Totino's pizza rolls and Coke. Then I was sitting on the couch and I thought to myself: "Did I just shit my pants? I don't feel like I need to shit, but it's kind of wet down there..." I dropped trow and looked in my briefs and saw what looked like a grease stain; like oil or grease came out of my butt and stained my skivvies. It was unsettling to say the least.

I lied about the having a girlfriend part. The rest is true, though. Pedantic? Nitpicky? I have OCD and I'm messy as hell. An embarrassment to the community really As someone with OCD that's primarily compulsive, 'oh that's blood'.

Most of my OCD is 'do this thing with the goal of something impossible, do it until you collapse'. Yeah, I didn't explain that aspect.

"Good" and "bad" numbers exist because of impossible perimeters and reasoning. Same with "good" and "bad" letters, words, sentences, movements.

Then if it doesn't feel right. *FEEL RIGHT*, you do it all over again. Yeah, people thought I was joking a couple years ago when I said 'if I add you to Facebook I'll have to delete a friend because it's a prime number'. As someone with ADD, it appears that I have more fun.  as someone without ocd that is exactly how my brain works.  so after you've washed your hands raw, you experience debilitating anxiety over the fear of sickness and dying? I can see that; blood is gross and gross things are gross. But, the difference is the anxiety. Do you have it? Do you *feel* it in your stomach? Do you feel it curl and sit in your stomach as you wash your hands three times, now four times....now five times, but no - five is a bad number, so you have to wash them six times, now seven, and now eight times, because that's four x two, and that's a safe combination of numbers.

Wait....did the back of your hand barely touch the faucet handle when you turned it off with a paper towel(because you cannot touch the handle; imagine the germs)? *It did*. The anxiety rises again. You can just walk away, no big deal. So you do....but wait, what if you get sick? What if you touch a door handle and then your friend touches it and gets sick and dies? The anxiety hurts now, you can feel it burning in your chest....so you wash your hands again. And again. And again. One more time for four times. It went okay this time.

It's time to walk out of the bathroom. The lights are on. I lift and put down my left foot, and then my right. I turn off the lights. I lift and put down my left foot, and then my right. I walk out, I back up. I turn on the light. I lift and put down my left foot, and then my right. I turn off the lights. I lift and put down my left foot, and then my right. I walk out, I back up. I do this two more times, to make four - my safe number. I don't know why it's safe, but it is.

I hope to god this isn't how your brain works. Well, I did it eight times (2^3 is safe), but... it feels uneven on my left side. Better do the whole thing again in order favoring my right side slightly to even it all up. And then once more evenly just to be safe. Don't mess it up this time or you have to do it all again.

I'm fortunate to have gotten much better about it. CBT did a lot for me. dammit, this is exactly how my brain works.  I had this thing I did, a quirk even.  I used to twitch my nose to one side, then the other, but I had to do it an even number of times and if I didnt I would obsess over finishing that twitch until it was even.  Sometimes I'd stop the process early at like 6 or so, but I'd have to keep going till I reached 10 or I couldn't be at peace.  Finally someone called me out on why I do that strange twitch and made me self conscious, from then on I quit by conditioning my brain to be less obsessive...  I'm not a doctor, but I think you have AIDS Thank you for posting this. We had a woman with OCD speak at my university last semester and it really opened my eyes up to what it really is. Through that, I'm slowly trying to figure out if what I have been dealing with my whole life is a phobia or a mild form of (non-germ-oriented) OCD.  That's really All the common misconceptions must be really frustrating or insulting, I'm sorry.

[^bot ^info](http://www.reddit.com/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index) That's a low blow, Bob Loblaw. Fellow meat clerk redditors for lyfe. A&amp;P? Jesus Christ I was thinking the same thing. I worked in a Zehrs and all of our fresh counters had this tile behind them. Former cleaner here. Learned to moonwalk on those floors. Definitely drew a few second glances from customers who saw me moonwalking while squeeging. They were damned jealous. My favorite part is I can sing as loud as I possibly can to the late 90's easy listening garbage they play in my store and very few people can hear me. I WANNA STAND WITH YOU ON A MOUNTAAAIINN... Oh man. I thought I was the only one who has Savage Garden play at my store.  They played that shit in the computer lab at high school all the fucking time. I was only ever in the lab when I needed to desperately work on some crappy assignment, and whenever I was in there, Savage Garden was also.

Later when I finally got a CD player (yay me!), only then did it end. Did you lap it up? With ferocity. I really hope you're a butcher.  I'm the closer, so I get to clean up after a long day of butchering. Are Dexter references still topical?  No. Not even the season finale joke. With Dexter being one of my favorite shows, even now I still don't want to spoil. In hopes it may drive just one person to watch the series, for all it's ups and downs. It's totally worth the ride. *He's a serial killer and he's okay...* *He sleeps all night and he kills all day*

 Every night i would walk in and say *"tonight's the night..."* Do you work at [Burger King?] (http://youtu.be/1YW914HNLPU)  No, meat department in a grocery store. Local meat department closer here too! As a butcher at a family owned place that can't afford a nice tile floor and instead have years and years of blood and guts beat into a concrete floor, I envy you.  That sounds awful... Are there not relatively inexpensive coatings for concrete floors? Honestly not sure on that point. I think we tried painting this crop over it one time but it didn't work too well.  Dentist It's also worth noting that this isn't blood, but mixture of Myoglobin that most people mistake as blood in raw meat. I came here to say this. There is very little blood in beef. It has been bled out. The red stuff is protein.  Mostly water, with some myoglobin carried in it. Thank you for being that guy so I didn't have to. That's [oddly satisfying](http://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/) Thats the gate to hell.

FTTFFY Why does he keep jumping back in?! I can't tell if it's someone jumping in water cgi'ed into a puddle or someone jumping into a puddle cgi'ed into falling into a deep hole...

or the true mindfuck. If it's not CGI. It's not CGI. Here is the full video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqqYbWuoVXI Oh my god, the description of that video is ridiculous. It sounds like it was taken directly from a newscast. Real source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mVQ5fu6q8M I love how he's literally on the ground laughing. 
 Rofl The only part I'm not sure about is if his buddies knew there was a pothole there and trolled the guy, if just he knew, if they all knew, or if no one knew. 

But he definitely jumped in to the deepest puddle ever. The one where the guy is trying to cross the flooded road while carrying his gf is a close contender for next deepest puddle.  This didn't work in reddit is fun on my phone.  Here's an alternate link for those with the same problem:

http://i.imgur.com/PJkX1rv.jpg Oh shit, that happened to me once.  I was walking along a little creek that was barely frozen over, busting up the ice for the noise it made.  I doubt there was more than 2 inches of water under the ice.  Then I jumped on a patch of ice and dropped in up to my hips.

Fortunately, wasn't far from home to get out of my wet clothes. Do you work at Comcast? If they worked at Comcast wouldn't it be splattered everywhere instead of in this perfect square of a tile? Comcast couldn't come close to this level of perfection. They sure as hell don't on my internet connection. Or the Overlook Hotel? Kind of surprising that with all that dripping, there were no splashes outside the tile.   Yeah, something's up here. From even 6 inches up blood splatters like crazy. Next time you get a nosebleed let it drip into a white sink for a few seconds and see what I mean.

Nope  Religions have been born over less.  This is set up. Blood splatters. The surrounding tiles and grout would not be perfectly blood-free after a 3-4 foot drop. He probably poured it carefully on to the tile. Made for a cool picture though.  Are you Russian? Because that's a red square. [most underrated comment award.](http://i.imgur.com/9QpcmFg.jpg) I thought it wasn't blood it looks as if you applied hydrophobic material to the surrounding tiles. I'm not saying this is what OP did to get karma (even if maybe it is) rather I say it APPEARS to look like that. The fat from the butchered animals might be a little hydrophobic itself and if it gets caught between the tiles, it might not get cleaned out of the space between the tiles as well as it does on top of the tiles. This may cause a little hydrophobic border around the tile that causes the blood to pool on top. That's terrifying... so who does this blood belong to? Why does this make me think of Hannibal. You're till grout isn't black and I don't have any human way to express my jealousy gross BLOOD MONEY My first thought was, "Who puts grout in a butcher shop? That floor must be awful to clean." If it dropped there would ba a little splatter.  This sub is turning into /r/thatHappened  I can't understand why there isn't any spatter marks, surely when a drip of blood plops into this lovely square pool of blood it would splatter a little bit? or did OP clean up  [Bloodbath at Burger King](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM2p6YlIg2k) I saw this IRL Looks like a fruit roll up.

http://i.imgur.com/ZbJLbWu.jpg "at work" Hey, maybe it's his job to kill people, you don't know. Why use tile on a floor in that area?! Seems like it would be harder to clean. Tile like that is very easy to clean? You just hose it off. Cheaper than carpet. Floors on  areas like that are treated with sealant, they are not as porous as you might think. Nothing in the affordable range is easier to clean than sealed tile. You just spray it down and everything rolls off. Even if it isn't sealed for some weird reason it can be buffed with a cleaner and waxed in under an hour. Those are antibacterial tiles.  Most kitchens or places that deal with food use them over linoleum or regular ceramic because they actually prevent bacterial growth, and some come with other features like hydrophobic coatings.

I spent some time making custom autoexec.bat files even to provide boot menus for different purposes. But I can't remember much anymore, just something like this:

    @echo off
    prompt $p$g
    mouse.com 
    set path=C:\DOS;


     prompt $p$g

O gawd.... the memories are coming back. those skills are still useful if you use the Windows command line.  Create an environment variable called "PROMPT" and set the value to

$t$h$h$h$S$p$g

and just like magic, your prompt is

More Info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file As a kid, I suffered through a weird off-brand sound card that had a driver larger than the normal SoundBlaster driver (albeit one that provided SoundBlaster compatibility).  I had to choose between having ANSI.SYS for my cool prompt and colors, or having enough memory to load sound and mouse simultaneously for games.
 
Later I tried to run some weird COMMAND.COM replacement that came with Norton Utilities because it had *even better than ANSI.SYS* capabilities.  Oh god the extra RAM that took.
 
Then came DOS 4.0 with it's fancy, actual-GUI-with-rounded-corners DOSHELL.EXE!  Except I also had a weird and crappy video card that supported EGA, weird-Tandy-something, and VGA-but-only-sort-of.  It didn't go very well.

It came with a few utilities that could play MIDI and also pipe mic input which I used to create a entirely batch-file driven "karaoke" program.  This included transcribing lyrics by hand into the one monolithic .BAT with all those ASCII box characters (185-188) for menus and displays -- which is why I needed my ANSI.SYS so very much.  Because by god if you're going to draw ASCII boxes with drop shadows, you're going to want colors. life was hard Indeed it was. But it was also fun!

Nowadays everything is easy, touch screen, voice commands... But everything is encapsulated, and such levels of customization are not allowed unless we engage in reverse engineering and hacking.

Technology is now accessible to everybody, and many people have no idea what is a command line despite using computers. I still find that those who ever used a command line and had to deal with all this things, have a better understanding on how things work at the lower level and have better problem solving skills when necessary.  I find that to be true as well. Even to the point of installing windows 95 from 30 floppies (or however many there were), y'know, but first

I can recall the earliest days of tech support. You could call and ask one of two question: how the hell do I get this to run or how the hell do I finish this game? The developers would actually walk you through it. Best fucking education in the world for a 5th grader in 1980. They taught me all about config files, memory manager and so on.

 emm386.exe was not available in dos 4.0.  Your joke is invalid. Not when using extended memory.  Legacy problems arise without NOEMS. Mmm yes, computer stuff. Couldn't agree more. Don't be hating on us older folks who had to deal with where devices where loaded (high or low memory) so we could play games.  We where ground breakers for console and current PC gaming.

No highmem ment no Wolf3d.exe or Doom.exe Don't be such a dip switch. Back in our day things were awesome. It was before the rush of idiots that came from AOL. (they all stuck to their own AOL world).

In our day if you didn't know how to free up an adequate amount of conventional memory your program didn't work. You could play a nice exciting game of "not enough memory"! Even if you bought 1 MB of RAM it wouldn't be good enough because you only have 480k free out of the lower 640k. We had to enable himem and move drivers up there by editing config.sys. That's the way it was and we liked it!

I... I can't get involved in this :( Calm down Shakespeare's ghost, you had your fun. It's the little details that make things beautiful.  Especially if you got bronchitis 200 years will see the dawn of the Linux desktop, and this will be useless. Well, to be honest, it's only been 30 years.  it's less than it was when it was new. quite a bit less if you include inflation.
 Found 3 copies of Windows 98 sealed at a car boot sale. 3 for the lot. 20-30 each on ebay. Tidy. Quite. Indubitably.

 /r/Flipping  so instead of garage sales and yard sales you guys across the pond sell stuff out of your car's boot (trunk for you fellow yankees)?  Or is a car boot salesman like the guy that I used to see driving around trying to sell empty speaker boxes to suckers? Yes, it's probably more popular for towns to hold a weekly sale in a field. People turn up in their cars loaded up with their old junk, pay a small fee for a pitch and stand in the cold all day with their wares out on a folding table hoping that they bring less junk home. It's like a load of small yard sales in one and there's usually some good stuff if you're into flipping and know what sells.  That's like a flea market over here.  Your way is a lot more convenient for the sellers though since they have their wares right next to their car.  At flea markets you have to bring your junk from the car to a central area. They're great fun to attend and sell at (in the sun).

https://i.imgur.com/xIP23aI.jpg Yup. Flea market/swap-meet. This is the 3.5 inch version. Should be worth a lot more. [deleted] [Picture of (m)y big (f)loppy]( http://oldcomputers.net/pics/floppy8.gif) Risky click Bah, everybody knows DOS 6.22 is where it's at.  Plus 6.22 is still available to MSDN subscribers. It came with Drivespace built-in so you can compress your 85MB harddrive so it can fit more pcx files! Real men use DblSpace In DoubleSpace no one can hear you scream... DR DOS (later Novell DOS) is where it's at. Fully functional multitasking under DOS.

It was never successful though, as MS attacked it very aggressively and unlawfully (e.g. intentionally making Windows incompatible with it etc.) Yeah it is! :p

Guess what Kroger corp. Telxon devices run on?  I about shit myself when I saw DR DOS pop up during a reboot. damn. beats my 5.0 still packaged i found at work also. DOS 4.* sucked huge donkey dick. 
It was the Windows ME of DOS. came here to say this. 3.3 or 5.0. DOS 4.x was balls.

I started out on DOS 3.30. 5.0 was a huge improvement. (DOSKEY! HIMEM.SYS! EMM386.EXE!) I remember doskey.  It was like a revolution. What was doskey? Command line history. You could press the up arrow to reuse commands you'd typed before. This was a big deal in the day. You never knew how much you'd miss DOSKEY, until you had to go back to using a system without it.

 Pro-tip: If you're stuck using a system without DOSKEY, you can still reuse your last command by pressing the F3 key. TIL!  Now I can't wait to get back on a DOS 3.3 or 4.0 system so I can use my new found knowledge. You forgot the big one.

MSDOS 5.0 saw the addition of QBasic. And thus the greatest of all OS features, Gorillas.bas IBM-DOS 2.1 on a PC Jr here 6.22 master race! 

It was still a ball ache to load the cd driver.  I'm sure glad there's some sane people in here that remember DOS 4 as the piece of shit that it was. No, it doesn't.  4.0 and 4.01 were one of the worst DOS versions.  Everyone stayed with 3.0-3.22 until 5 came out.
 The packaging/branding looks strangely not dated.  At least compared to what a lot of 80s packaging/branding looks like now. That was my first thought too. The only thing that gives it away is the type. Microsoft's logo loss the same, but it still looks clean and modern today.

That's some solid typography. Microsoft MS-DOS Operating System.


Microsoft Microsoft Disk Operating System Operating System.

And I thought "ATM machine" was bad. Do you have OCD disorder?  C:/DOS

RUN/DOS/RUN

fixed it Ah, back in my days, we have to run memmaker once in a while and manually defrag our hard drive. And we learn to mark bad sectors with scandisk and *love* it.

Filenames with 255 characters? Pah, we make do with 8. Those were the more refined era.

Kids these days. C:\PROGRA~1\ Sears Canada still runs dos on all their machines.  They might be running [FreeDOS](http://www.freedos.org/). That way they have some better compatibility when they need to replace machines with new one due to hardware failure. 100% compatible you say?   He should try to use it. When it fails he should call up Microsoft and ask for a refund. Bill Gates is over there in the other thread, maybe he'll be able to help out. lol Looks like there are some people trying to sell these on eBay for $50. Doubt anyone would buy it. I had a higher up once place that I worked that thought old software was gold. He ran IT at one time even though he knew nothing about computers and would buy 10 copies of software, open 1 box and only install that 1 license and then put the other 10 copies in a "software vault" which was a damn huge bank vault he found somewhere. 

He died 5 years ago and didn't do anything with the computers or software in close to 15 years. I'm still finding copies of dBase, DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows 95, WordPerfect, etc hidden in various spots throughout our buildings.  &gt;  He ran IT at one time even though he knew nothing about computers and would buy 10 copies of software, open 1 box and only install that 1 license and then put the other 10 copies in a "software vault" which was a damn huge bank vault he found somewhere. 

I know what you mean, but the off-by-one error made me laugh. Had an office mate for some years who was a real packrat. We moved into an almost empty building from another location where we had both offices and a lab. Just one office allocated to us, but we squatted on an adjacent office with a bunch of boxes from our different labs. Eventually we had to vacate that space. He whined about all the shit he had to throw out, including boot disks for "Tophat". This was the demo/alpha load that Bill Gates wrote for IBM. It was the common base code for both OS/2 and Windows 95.  My father is also a bit of a packrat.  Except he owned a rather successful computer company.  They've been around since the very begging installing old IBM mainframes and what not.  
  
The **Shit** that I found in the warehouse while they were moving locations of one of their buildings was mind-boggling. Your friend would have had a field day.  
  
I have a disc drive that's like 1 meg.  He used it as a paperweight because "that damned drive cost me $600,000 back in the day!!" For one meg!! T_T In case you somehow don't know - if he happens to have a bunch of IBM Model M keyboards kicking around, those can be worth from 50 to several hundred dollars apiece.  (The several hundred dollar ones are typically the super rare ones - Model F and Model M SSK come to mind, but they are out there.)  You will have no problem moving them on Ebay or at /r/mechmarket . I'm pretty sure I have a large box of them in the basement.  I specifically remember my brother using one as a baseball bat when we we're younger! Next time I'm at the parents I'll have to take a gander.  
  
Thanks! &gt;  I specifically remember my brother using one as a baseball bat when we we're younger!

Yep, sounds like a Model M.  :-) Model F reporting in, give us the co-ordinates of the city you wish to annihilate and we'll drop the keyboard! I just flipped up my IBM keyboard:  **Plt No F9 Model M, IBM Corp 1984, Made in the USA**

Aww yisss.........mmmhhmmm....

YOU SHOULD KNOW:  It weighs more than my whole Samsung laptop, this massive main battle tank of a keyboard. I still have an XP disc still in its original wrapper  :( that's still useful Yes, after 5 hours of installing Service Packs and updates. It's only 32 minutes in microsoft time No, it's 2 hours. No, wait, 12 minutes. Scratch that, now it's 4 days. Oops, no, you were mistaken, it's actually 14 hours. and then realizing the OS is EOL and will never receive another security update again. I guess after 5 hours that would be both a blessing and a curse.  Only if you're going to put it in a VM. Besides the antiquated hardware support, XP is a minefield of security holes since support sunset. I'll post this here. http://m.imgur.com/QzJGLNH
Had a chance to open up one of the boxes :) Some guys a work found a copy of MS-DOS.  While I was on vacation they swapped out the hard drive in my work laptop then installed MS-DOS and Nibbles.  

I was incredibly confused when my computer was booting up into a 25 year old game.   [It belongs in a museum!](http://i.imgur.com/jnB2gXW.jpg) Screw that noise! Put it on etsy and sell it some dumb hipster for $500. They'll see it's vintage and can't help themselves. Hey do you live near Lethbridge Alberta Canada? My employer up here could use an update. Most of Lethbridge could use an update Coming soon: Unboxing video on VHS *and* Beta! Were there PCs that were less than 100% IBM compatible? Yes. In the early days there were a bunch of OEMs with Intel-based CPUs that were largely incompatible at the hardware and BIOS level.

DEC, HP, Tandy, etc, would have their own version of DOS. You would buy 'MS-DOS for HP Computers', for example. Thus, DOS was originally not sold as a software package, and was only available to an OEM.

You were never guaranteed that the DOS application you purchased would run if you had a clone. 

It wasn't until companies started to reverse-engineer the IBM BIOS that they were able to  *really* be compatible with the IBM PC. At the time, the BIOS was essentially the only proprietary thing that IBM had.

Compaq is often credited as being the first to have a 100% compatible clone. Later when Phoenix Technologies began licensing their BIOS to anyone and everyone the '100% compatible' clone market really exploded. For the most part, the Phoenix BIOS was the first 100% compatible BIOS available to 3rd parties. (IBM and Compaq keeping their own to themselves) Yes.  Some were even made by IBM. At the same time Gates is doing an AmA, I smell something funny. [Mine is black and white. Does that mean it's older?](http://imgur.com/rVLVm05) i think maybe yours was packaged with a computer and OPs was just the OS OEM vs Retail.

Retail is typically worth much more. OP's box says "Not for retail sale except with a computer system" It's newer. I think that's a DOS 6 manual. Well that's sad. true.dat Wow even on 3.5 discs. Thought it would have been 5.25 floppies After 3.11 DOS supported 3.5" floppies, which quickly became the standard. Geez, GWBASIC? This was even before QBASIC. That's hardcore old school. Welcome to... DOS?  I mean, yeah it predates it.  But not by that much.  5.0 was nearing the end of DOS.  Before GW-BASIC there was also BASICA. &gt; Geez, GWBASIC?

Gone Wild BASIC 5.25" DS/DD or GTFO! Would be amusing to discover that in that sealed eco-system it evolved into some weird version of Windows. Would be twice as amusing to discover that it evolved into some weird version of Linux. Kinda like that sealed Antarctic lake Russian researchers have been drilling into.

Anyway, continuing that lake analogy, I don't know how much MS-DOS itself will fetch on eBay, but if you list it as "one breath of air from 1980's" it might attract some serious buyers.
 Will that work on my Macintosh? Bad command or file name  Abort, Retry, Fail? those were the days :D ... i say that but ... i started on v3.0 ... 6.22 was awesome many happy days playing games when games were cool and kept in C:\GAMES\  Sell it for billions and get laid Install it!!!!!
 Drive A: Does not exist Abort, Retry, Fail? Abort, Retry, Fail, Ignore?

 Never fail.. that kills the drive (until reboot). At an old job I found a shrink-wrapped copy of "Microsoft OS/2, v1.0a"

It recommended having a 2nd Floppy drive for optimal OS / app interaction or "a hard drive" in order to use multitasking. You work at Kmart, don't you? sell it to Bill Gates, I think he's on reddit today Microsoft Microsoft Disk Operating System Operating System Not sealed, but I've actually got a copy of IBM DOS 3.30 in my cabinet.  Everything inside is sealed (manuals, etc..) but the box was cracked.

Hi-five for DOS! Maybe you could run it on my still shrink-wrapped [DX2OD66 processor](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/2u0dcg/i_see_your_msdos_and_give_you_my_dx2_overdrive/ ) All I remember about DOS is: "C:\&gt;cd  /games/wolf3d/wolf3d.exe (enter)"   Wow. This must have quite a value for collectors of historic things. Even I started with MS-DOS 5.0 back in the 90s... Wow man... 4.1 was the first version I had, on my first computer.  286 6MHz. Now, refrigerators have more megahertz. I just looked at my smartphone and it blew my mind thinking about how things used to be.  My version of 4.1 was on 5 inch disks too.

Now that's a term I've not heard in a long time... A long time. I still have it on my old Linux box! I used it a lot at work on very old PCs as boot disks. MS-DOS 4.0 is the Windows Vista of DOS. Freaking memory hog during the 640KB ram era. DOS has the same sort of tick-tock release quality as Windows:

* DOS 3.2 - Windows 2000 (finally usable OS)
* DOS 3.3 - Windows XP (the standard or fallback for a very long time)
* DOS 4.0 - Windows Vista (why???)
* DOS 5.0 - Windows 7 (this stuff works)
* DOS 6.0 - Windows 8 (ooh, new features none of which anybody likes)
* DOS 6.22 - Windows 10 (yay!) Windows 2000 is awesome.  MS did everything they could to kill it over the years.  You can still run most things with kernel/dll/dependency hacks that you can on XP.  Even the server/datacenter versions supported higher amounts of RAM. Isn't there a version of DOS that is equivalent to (shudder, cringe) "Windows ME"? I got IBM DOS v4 included with my IBM PS/2 Model 30 286 10 Mhz desktop PC. I hated it. Golden Axe game had more features with my friend's DOS v3.3! I was jealous and mad! It belongs in a museum!

 All the PITA memories are coming back:
QEMM replacing HIMEM.SYS

Tools that compress files on the hard drive to essentially "double" your HDD space. (STACKER)

Getting enough memory (610KB/640KB) to run Wing Commander and other games way ahead of its time.

Running the program that allows you to run DOS windows in individual boxes -- looking back, it was supposed to compete with Windows 3 before it was released.  We all know what happened with that!  Forgot the name -- dammit -- I think they were the same company that released QEMM.

Getting old again... I forgot everything... *senile* Fuck yeah wing commander, that game was the shit Actually, all that's left is packaging. After thirty years the floppy is riddled with bad spots.  This brings back memories of going to EggHead to buy huge boxes with a disk inside. Great memories or looking at all the games on the shelves and buying them sometimes. It's amazing that those games were so exciting to me with so little graphics.  Don't forget trying games on their computer in store. I discovered my old Egghead post-its I got for free. I recently finished them, but did leave one stuck on my cubicle wall before I got laid off. :/ Wow, that's a flashback to my days of working at CompUSA. I remember staying in my local CompUSA store as a callow ant and a teen(ager). :D We have tons of Windows 95 unopened packages Why? Epic. 5.0 would have been the real score. QBasic FTW! nibbles   
Gorilla   Free upgrade to Windows 10? Slap an avocado barcode on it for a discount. I can't believe those things are $35 a piece, a few years ago I bought one at a farmers market for like $6. That was during the emu trend. It was supposed to be the next big thing and a lot of people (ranchers/farmers) started raising them. Then when everyone realized nobody wanted to buy emu stuff (meat, eggs, ect) they became pretty much worthless. Some people just let them go in the wild. I was walking in the woods in Texas one day and a wild emu appeared, kinda scared the shit of me. Why didn't you capture it? He didn't have the balls to catch it.  I keep a few master balls on me at all times just for this. A few? You cheater Maybe he's just really lucky with the lottery Yup, rare candy and masterballs in slot 3 then find missing no Tricked his little brother into trading a pokemon while holding a master ball.  He probably tricked his friend into thinking that it would evolve when traded if the emu held the ball. Save those for a shiny emu Because [reasons](http://i.imgur.com/UfuZ4.jpg).

&gt;

&gt;The __Emu War__, also known as the __Great Emu War__,  was a [nuisance wildlife management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuisance_wildlife_management) operation undertaken in [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) over the latter part of 1932 to address public concern over the number of [emus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu) said to be running amok in the Campion district of [Western Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia). The attempts to curb the population of emus, a large flightless bird indigenous to Australia, employed soldiers armed with [machine guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_gun)leading the media to adopt the name "Emu War" when referring to the incident.

the heads only angry and confused because somebody killed his brother :(      
^(or maybe its just a baby retroactively added from the next generation?) I'm actually really interested in your post.  Have enough been released to create naturalized breeding populations in the US, even in small pockets?  How would they thrive across the various US landscapes I wonder?  Would they screw up the ecosystem like an invasive species, or would just they find a niche and fit in? Too many questions :o I can tell you that Texas is almost identical in climate and landscape to parts of Australia where emus are native. I remember driving across west Texas and thinking that if someone decided to release a bunch of 'roo's there they would thrive, most likely to the point where they would be hunted and culled because of damage to grazing land.

It's likely that a stable breeding population of Emu would be wiped out pretty quickly, but given the trouble we had during The Great Emu War, I'd love to see a bunch of Good Ol' Boys try and sort 'em out. Emu meat is actually really good. It's surprisingly close to beef, it's red meat and nothing like poultry or fowl, and it's very lean. I've had ostrich burgers that were delicious, so I'm not surprised!  Ostrich tastes nothing like emu. Frankly, most people don't like emu because all the meat has a sort of livery taste. Ostrich taste like beef but with much less fat. Wasn't there a king of the hill episode with that exact plot, and he drove a bunch of emus down the road in the back of his pickup truck? It may be fiction, but King of the Hill is full of things that really happen in Texas.

Source: Am Texan I watched that episode last night actually.  Hilarious episode. Guacemule. I found that emusing. Bemusement aside, no one should honestly believe the egg can emulate an avocado. Correct. Guacemule would be the wrong kind of emulsion. 

Edit: [Either way, I am not demure about having some emu in me](http://www.rfadventures.com/images/Animals/Mammals/ringtail-lemur-face-bg.jpg)... *smack lips* I feel ostrichized  That pun was a bit of ostrich. You... smart. I like.  Charlie? Honestly, is $35 worth it? Uhhh yeah. Once you buy one you can plant it and grow an Emu tree to get all the eggs you want for free.

 that looks nothing like an emu You're right, *that's* the problem with his logic. Can't get anything past this guy. He's like Robocop of emu facts. I wouldn't say NOTHING like an emu. It has long legs, a break, similar body shape. It looks generally like an emu. It looks nothing like prolapse. That sounds wrong, but I don't know enough about emu eggs to dispute that. You have to fertilize it first. Sigh.  
^^^*unzips.* it is known. is this even in USD? [Yes](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/2tepow/emu_eggs_at_the_supermarket/cnydxm0). It's a Whole Foods in NY. Its probably the Union Square one as I've only seen these eggs at that location. Though I recommend going out to the Union Square Greenmarket literally right in front of it and going to the Roaming Acres stand so you can support a local farmer. Its sold for $5 cheaper from that stand too. There is very little reason to go into that Whole Foods with the Greenmarket right there. 

edit: just looked at your link and it wasn't even the Manhattan location. Well, if anyone is interested, the Greenmarket has them.  I got some amazing cheese there at the Greenmarket last time I was in Manhattan. Sad thing was we had access to a full kitchen during a 5-day stay there and I found the Greenmarket the last day we were there. Damn. &gt; Whole Foods

Ah, that's why it's about 3x the normal cost. Makes sense.
 As an in-shape 30 year old guy I have to say Whole Foods is probably THE BEST place to go if you want to get eye-fucked by a bunch of bored, in-shape, 40-something soccer moms. Where do I go as an out of shape 30 year old guy? The gym. Can't really argue with that.  I think I would pay that once for the novelty of it. Ditto.

Also to do something with that shell...it's beautiful. I would buy one just to eat a $35 emu omelette and be exceedingly happy with my decision. 

 An emu egg is ~10 chicken eggs. It would be a damn big omelette. That's normally what I make my omelettes with anyway, so this would just be that much more convenient. Win. I wonder how many eggs one would need in order to fill a paella pan If we're talking a 16 inch paella pan (pretty standard size) and your average large egg, about 73. Don't tell him what he's about, son No, that's why they're $34.99 each. So much cheaper It's basically $34! biggest regret in my life has to do with an emu egg..was duck hunting once and I saw one within 15 feet of me on the other side of a barbed wire fence, friend wouldnt let me get it because I had on his dads waders. fuck my life that fried egg would have been stellar You might of found a foetus in that egg/gotten viciously mauled by mother Foetus are vicious  35 what? US dollars? Because that sounds extremely expensive. Oh im sorry, how much does your supermarket charge for emu eggs? Dollars? I don't have that kind of money! I used to have a friend that owned an emu farm and I got to taste these. they are really good, but I don't know if I would pay 35$ for them. She used to make cool stuff out of the shells too once they are drained and cleaned. they are really thick. Also, Emu and Ostriches are assholes. Can you describe the taste compared to chicken eggs?

 it was a richer flavor is all I can remember. It has been like 20 some odd years ago. '20 some odd years' must sound strange to non-native English speakers. I write scripts/record audio as part of my job, and sometimes when you record 10 - 15 takes of the same generic English sentence you realize how much of our language is just totally made up nonsense.  The other day I had a line that included the phrase, "as long as he doesn't find out."  And I had never before pondered how unintuitive the phrase "as long as" would sound to a non-native speaker that was having to manually translate each spoken word with his limited vocabulary. Whoa, this is incredibly interesting. Do you have other examples? Gosh that just happened yesterday or the day before which is why it's fresh on my mind, I'm not sure I could recall any other examples that are just like that at the moment.  Not quite the same thing, but there are of course non-consequential things we say all the time to just take up space such as, "the thing about it is.." which has a very hard time translating to other languages (especially those that don't have subject pronouns like the/it, making the entire phrase complete lunacy). 

 Mostly what trips me up is sentences that you write that sound totally normal but when you're recording and really trying your best to clearly enunciate each syllable instead of the way we kind of sliiide through each sentence letting the ends of each word blend with the beginnings of the next, they can sound completely different and twist your tongue.  I had, during the same recording as before, a line that included *"..within the vicinity.."* which spoken casually to your friends you would never think twice about.  But when recording something that demands perfect pronunciation, such as "the" being said "thee" instead of the casual "thuh", you all of a sudden have an in-line rhyme of "within the" and "vicinity" mid sentence which made me trip up a few times.

I imagine this kind of stuff is pretty dull to read about for people who don't think about this kind of thing, but it does make a slight impact on my day-to-day at work. That's interesting.  In classical singing, the rule is that if "the" is followed by a consonant sound, then it's pronounced "thuh", like "thuh book", and pronounced "thee" when followed by a vowel sound, like "thee orange". This is a great rule of thumb in my experience as well, but depending on the cadence you're speaking at it will sometimes be necessary to perform the "thee" sound if speaking in a very slow/deliberate manner depending on the following word.  I imagine in singing this scenario doesn't come up as often. Has anyone really been far as decided to use even go want to do look more like? Well of course IDIOMS! Hey, relax, its not their native language.  They're still learning. I'd rather just eat like ten eggs than pay 35 for one of them. They look trippy though. And I'd rather pay $35 than 35 for an egg The flavor is way stronger, I could see how it could be easily off putting to someone that doesn't like a strong eggy flavor. I would say it's almost like how game meat is more gamey than normal pastural meats. &gt;...game meat is more gamey...

I know what you mean because I've had game meats, but that's a hilariously terrible description for anyone that has not. Meat bought at the store is more storable  That's why I really appreciate the convenience of convenience stores. To be fair, I've only ever really heard game meat described to people as "gamey" regardless of whether that means anything to them or not. Which always seemed to be a bad way to describe it, but I'm not really sure what a better way is. Yeah, I don't know either, really.  It's just a circular description that means nothing unless you've experienced it.  Flavors are difficult to describe! The best way to describe "gamey" meat is that it has a much stronger meat flavor, meaning that whatever it tastes like farm raised its gonna taste much more strongly if you just cooked it with no spices or seasoning, and secondly its much more mineraly which is due to the increased levels of myoglobin in the meat because wild animals are much more active than farm raised animals. Additionally, wild animals tend to have a tinge of flavor based on what they ate in life, you can even taste this in grass fed versus corn fed beef. Grass fed beef really does have a sort of "hay" taste to it. I agree, it's hard to describe that flavor. When I was in high school my friend and I tried an ostrich burger. We both agreed that it tasted like "something that had been running in a field" I always found emus to be pretty docile and friendly.  Rheas and ostriches though, yeah those guys are assholes. As an Australian, emus are cunts. They remind me of someone's creepy uncle and I've seen them, on multiple occasions, drop disgusting splatters of diahorrea on the ground. Like in front of everyone they just don't give a shit

Also they make weird as fuck subwoofer noises

[seriously look at this fucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsZr8Y5y6ug&amp;x-yt-ts=1421914688&amp;x-yt-cl=84503534&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=31) Honestly it sounds like they give a bit too much shit.

I remember as a kid visiting extended family on an emu farm near Ballarat.  The young ones were pretty friendly, and even the adults were generally okay so long as you didn't wear anything shiny and gave them a rub on the ear-hole.

Now, Cassowarys, those things are Emu's bigger, meaner cousins with a prison record. You're just mad cause you guys lost a war against them. Hers certainly weren't. They were not as bad as the ostriches, but they still sucked.  My cousin had an ostrich farm with a small handful of emus. I don't really remember anything about the emus, but DAMN those ostriches are mean fuckers. I was just a small girl and they terrified me to the point where I am nervous around big birds still.  Do you have PTSD flashbacks when you watch Sesame Street?  Sigh*, the typical casual speciesism I expected from reddit.  There are assholes in every species.  However, there are a lot of really nice emus that would be offended by your comment.  I would know, my [best friend](http://imgur.com/nH5zeFS) growing up was an emu.  What was his name? Tweeter.  He was my homie.  Raised him from the egg.  We played and swam together, and sometimes just hung out lying  on each other in the shade.  Pack of stray dogs got him one night.  He was maybe 12 years old.  It was a senseless hate crime.  They didn't even eat him. Jesus, man. Poor Tweeter. Stray dogs are dickheads. Sigh*, the typical casual speciesism I expected from reddit.  There are dickheads in every species.  However, there are a lot of really nice stray dogs that would be offended by your comment.  I would know, my [best friend](http://imgur.com/siTcnw5) growing up was a stray dog.  Not the time or the place, man; we just found out Tweeter *died*.  Holy fuck I hope your joking, because I just laughed my ass off. If you're serious then I feel really, really bad :( True story. Well that is sad.  The real bird to watch out for is the cassowary "Why the fuck is my cake so damn dense?!  It reads: '1 large egg', I used the largest I could find! An addition of more egg than usual would decrease density and flavor depth, increase sponginess. I am starting to question your cake skills and your life biscuit skills may come into question as well  Attempted emu egg, sunny-side up. Yolk didn't hold together though, so ate it scrambled

What are these things, a roast? /s Now make a goblet out of that shell.  Holy hell! Now THIS is the picture I was looking for.  I really wanted to see what one looked like cracked open.  Now that I've seen it, I'm kinda grossed out. Also what I was looking for. Not grossed out, just looks like it requires sharing. Before you get too excited, it's basically /u/frehsprints job to go around with those tiny hands making eggs look huge. It's weird, because I like eggs. But I feel the exact same way. It's just too much. That's a lot like a big chicken egg. I expected more like a goose egg with a huge almost inedible yolk.  I do not like green eggs and ham. I will not eat them, Sam I am. Then don't eat them with ham bro jeez Eat them with skittles then, please Or give them to bumble bees.

All I know now, Sam I am,

Is I do not like green eggs and ham. http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3365 You should buy three of them; then walk into a blazing fire and wait for the dragons to hatch. Then plan your take over of Westeros. &gt;Then plan your take over of Westeros.

And then never actually go there, just free a bunch of slaves over in Bumfuck, Essos for a couple years. In other fantasy novels things probably work out like this... she'll ride in with her dragons and save the world. But this is GRR Martin world, things are never easy and people don't get happy endings. At this point I won't be surprised if one day the dragons decide to fry and eat Daenerys randomly. And then Tyrion is in charge of the dragons. "I'll make my own iron throne, with blackjack hookers and dragons " Your lack of a comma leaves me to ponder what a "blackjack hooker" is exactly.  you mash two or more hookers that are less than 21 together If I don't see Bran do that thing he does (trying to avoid spoilers) with a dragon at some point, I'm gonna be mad. And for anyone who wants to know the spoilers:
  
...  
  
...
  
He fucks them. 

Bran fucks animals and /u/brycedriesenga wants him to fuck a dragon, because it would make him immune to STDs. oh fuck

Now I will too. Don't get my hopes up.  If I have to hear one more fucking Daenerys speech in a made-up language I'm going to fry and eat her myself. I'd eat her...

(   ) &gt;  people don't get happy endings

What are you talking about? We got to see two weddings, and a King gaining his crown of gold. Actually with the number of whores and brothels, there are arguably more happy endings than any series in history. Spoiler tag please, I haven't seen Breaking Bad yet! Mother of Emu's.  When I was a kid, my dad put some ostrich eggs in our back yard and convinced me they were dinosaur eggs. They "hatched" when I was at school and I came home to bearded dragon "dinosaurs." That ruled. Your dad was my kind of dad.  I scored a couple ostrich eggs once and decided to make deviled eggs out of them. They actually turned out pretty awesome. Here's a picture of me holding one of them in one hand a regular deviled egg in the other.

http://i.imgur.com/JNPA7y2.jpg Those are SO beautiful!  I almost want to spend $35 on one to use as decoration... but they would probably smell awful after a few weeks.
 Drill a small hole in the bottom, and drain it.

https://www.google.com/search?q=emu+egg+decorations&amp;tbm=isch Can confirm; [have empty emu egg on my desk.](http://i.imgur.com/mxOD2yW.jpg)

EDIT: [Better photo](http://i.imgur.com/PSuqnq1.jpg) for those interested in seeing the rest of my knick-knacks, [listed here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/2tepow/emu_eggs_at_the_supermarket/cnyl7cx) The fact that it's simply labeled "emu egg" is way funnier than it should be. Nothing spells celebration like a carved aborted fetus. Whoa there.  It's not fertilized, so it's a carved *period*. for reason people always get grossed out when I ask them if they want a fried chicken period.  I think they're just confused. It should be "Do you want a fried chicken *question mark*" Ah, prom night memories /r/nocontext  The shells are much harder than a standard egg, so this is required. However I can confirm that they do not smell after draining, just wash it out with some water through the same hole.

Source: Uncle had an Emu farm for a while, had several egg decorations. In Texas these are fairly commonplace, along with other emu products. Oddly there are emu farms in Texas, and occasionally the massive birds would escape. It is very odd to glance out the car window and see a 7 foot tall bird running next to you at 25 mph.  Nobody in Texas drives 25mph.. Nobody! bulbasaur will hatch from that you watch I'd pay $34.99 for that.  I wanna try!!!  Where is this supermarket you post of? Whole Foods of course it was Whole Foods. That 100% explains the $35.00 price tag.  Which one there are so many?

I am in Austin so hopefully somewhere around there
 I'm in Lake Grove, NY.  My friend in Manhattan says they have them there too, so maybe they all carry them? Mine has ostrich, quail, chicken and turkey eggs but no emu eggs.  NJ

Edit: oh yeah, and duck eggs Mine had ostrich eggs a while ago too.  I don't go often, so I don't know if they were just out of stock I used to live on a farm in Georgia outside of Atlanta  and we had a few emus. 

Once, one got out and caused a little panic around our little town. It got behind a Kroger and we had to behead it bright there before it could harm anyone. Apparently they run around just like chickens when they are decapitated. The cops finally arrived to see my cousin in a blood-soaked shirt holding a machete. 


It was a fun time at school for me the next day.  I feel like if I was going to drop $35 on an emu egg I would probably want some sort of protective carrying case to take it home in.

Edit: TIL Emu eggs are hard as fuck. The normal eggs below it are still making me a little uneazy. Like a shell! I needed to use the claw end of a hammer to open mine. I wouldn't worry about it accidentally breaking open
 That just makes me fear the pecking power of newborn emus. The shells on emu eggs are super thick Eggspensive... Emu kids lay eggs? No wonder they're so ostracized.  Do they cut themselves? I first read that as an emo egg. They're $50 at Jungle Jim's! I'd snap one up for 35.  I was once on a tour of eastern europe, and came across a monastery in Ukraine where the monks had a full emu farm going. Most bizarre thing I could have imagined. They bred them, sold the eggs (both to eat and drained/decorated) etc. Was their main source of income, though they had some other animals too. It was just completely out of place there. Make an Emulette How much protein in one of these bad boys? TIL emu eggs are green, I'd assume they are the same colour as ostrich eggs, so more or less like regular chicken eggs except much bigger but no, they are much more beautiful :) Some poor Emu is trying to make ends meet by selling her children and we're all sitting here like "Fuck that, $35 is overpriced." 

How about you think about others ass holes. Holy overpriced, Batman! I got mine for $12 All I can think about is [that scene with Chris Farley in Almost Heroes...](http://youtu.be/GbpRpJzZK7s)  For $35 it better cook itself and clean up afterwards. [Couldn't have said it better myself.](http://imgur.com/FvSdvRJ) That aint no supermarket motherfucker. Joys is a supermarket. Walmart is a supermarket. That be like me shopping at fucking tiffany's and saying "look what i found at the local craft stand" fuckoff with yourself. I bet you listen to feist Well aren't you the *feisty* one. Hey ohhhhh! I thought this was kind of a rude and uncalled for comment until the feist remark...that's fucking hilarious.  So whole foods isn't a supermarket? You heard the man. Fuck off with yourself. Nice, a whole omelette in one egg. If (according to Wikipedia) the average emu egg is 5-700g, while the standard (American) size Large chicken egg is 57g, that's 8-12 chicken eggs worth of egg.

I once saw a man eat a 12 egg omelette. 

Once.

([here's the 6 egg](http://www.bethscafe.com/photos.php?img=6egg)) Beth's for scale Do you know Ron Swanson? I can't imagine anyone not vomiting after eating any more than 6 eggs. My boy Luke can eat fifty eggs! Well I believe I'll take part of that wager. Challenge accepted. But seriously didn't Alan Richman beat that one? Or get really close? At Beth's? I swear that was on like yesterday Beth's!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 Reasonably priced too! /s What makes you think that price is unreasonable? Not so much unreasonably priced due to the novelty of the egg. I was speaking more to the cost of an omelette made from said egg versus one of similar size made from chicken eggs. Perhaps that wasn't well communicated in my initial statement. I dont think you needed to explain. $35 for an omelet is definitely unreasonable.  except that as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, an emu egg is 10x as large as a chicken egg.  you can make 5 omelets from one egg, which at 7 dollars a pop doesn't sound that bad to me. You said an emu egg is 10x that of a regular egg.  I like my omelets to contain around 4/5 eggs. So... That means your emu eggs only contain max 2 omelets at 10x the size of a regular egg.  Thus,  ~12.50 per omelet, which is definitely too much  And I buy organic cage free!!!  I find that 2 is roughly the right size for a meal for me, and that any more than 3 is very hard to handle in a skillet. We need to settle our egg differences  You eat some tiny-ass omelettes. Also, seven dollars is way too much to spend on an omelette you're making yourself. Ok.  Yea. Right.  Ok.  hahaha i like how you had to explain that, I thought it was clear enough What makes you think 35 dollars for an egg is reasonable? There's two sides of it, though.  From the store's perspective, it is only unreasonable if they have to throw them out due to spoilage.  If they're able to move them off the shelves, it's by definition a reasonable price to charge.

I'm trying to think of how it might be a reasonable thing to buy, and it's a lot harder to work out. If people buy it, it's a reasonable price. That doesn't mean the people buying it aren't idiots. I don't see people saying that 200$ for less than a liter of cognac is unreasonable. However, if it's a novelty egg then it's totally different for some reason. Here you go: $200 for less than a liter of cognac is unreasonable. cognac /=/ eggs

Cognac you dont chug the entire bottle at once or it goes bad, you pour a bit out and drink it. Point is you can buy more cognac for less money but people will still pay more for prestige, originality or taste if we are talking about the eggs. Bacon Emu and Cheese please Fun!  I have a friend who raises them and gave me some.  I made an quiche with on and it came out beautifully, but has a bit of an off gamey taste.   I ended up not finishing it, cause it has some flavors you just don't really want to eat.

Might be what they were feeding them though.  Anyway, the shells are fun - be sure to save it for crafts or something.   I had a hollowed-out Emu egg as a kid, probably around 2nd grade. I felt like such a bad-ass when kids would come over and I would tell them it was a Dragon's egg. 

When I was young, we moved *a lot*. We had been living in this house for 2 years and , as we had before, the move came and we had to load up all of out stuff. Well, it was my mother's job to put my stuff away, and I kept the egg on a shelf about 5 feet above the ground.

Well, while trying to get it down my mother dropped it and it shattered. I was upset for a long time, and I haven't gotten another one since.

TL;DR : I had an Emu/dragon egg as a kid. Mom dropped it, kid sad. 34.99 for an egg. Better come with a baby T Rex inside Emo Eggs ? My parents used to have around 100 emus on a 27 acre farm a in the late 90s and boy did those emu chicks sell. The chicks would sell for thousands of dollars after a year or so old. I There was a huge market for them at the time for their oil and exotic nature. Now we only have 2 emus that are close to 20 years old.  TIL emu eggs are super expensive. Does anyone else get angry inside when a mildly interesting post is *extremely* interesting? Doing the traditional forehead egg crack game would probably result in a KO I used to work at a zoo in Australia, and scrambled an emu egg once. It tasted like a chicken, but there was probably enough of it for 5 portions. Cool, but not worth $35.  It was closed this weekend (Jan 10, 11 2015) because they're installing that new adjustable median.  how does this adjustable median work? Maybe like this? http://i.imgur.com/dDfI96i.gif We'll see on Monday. :)

More info here in a local subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/2md6ez/golden_gate_bridge_to_close_jan_1012_2015_for/
 Cool. I could think of a bunch of roads/bridges in the Washington dc area that would benefit from that! There's actually one on the highway 50 bridge from Virginia. You can see the vehicle at the end of the bridge going east into the city. But on highway 50 (Roosevelt Bridge) they never move it!  I have lived in Virginia for over 3 years, and in the DC area for almost 20, and I have never seen the divider or that vehicle move! They move it every single weekday.  Don't know what time they widen the inbound lanes (earlier than I get up), but they shift back around noon. Can confirm, they move it literally every day for the traffic switch. In DC they change the lane direction of traffic depending on rush hour...so where are you referring?  [deleted] Still there as of 2011.  I wish they would engineer it so that they can expand the highway during evening rush hour.  Great for the morning, but not so great for the evening.  Traffic sucks.  One reason I left after the military, but a bunch of others too. Yep, still there as of last month as well.  I really wish they'd expand it too, it'd make a big difference in traffic.  I guess they're hoping rail does that instead. They have had plans to do a westbound zipper lane for a number of years, but the main issue has been the budget. holy crap that was oddly satisfying. Sick drift bro.  The Harlem Globetrotters theme song played in my head as I watched this. I have no idea why. I had yackety sax.... That would be "Sweet Georgia Brown" by Brother Bones I know it is sped up a bit, but that still looks amazingly efficient. I'm a transportation engineer-in-training and I've never seen this before. Cool stuff. Bringing this to work tomorrow. Thanks! My guess is that it works [something like this](https://i.imgur.com/dDfI96i.gif)

Edit:
[Looks like my guess was right.](http://vimeo.com/115360942) credit to /u/Robinsta5967 Fun-fact:

That machine is made by YKK, the world's largest zipper manufacturer. That IS a fun fact! Another fun fact: If you wave at the zipper operator they'll usually wave back very excitedly.  I do it every time I see one and it makes me happy every time.  If my job was to drift down the middle of a highway to control traffic bandwidth I'd be excited too. Aw that's adorable. Hey, that fact *was* fun! Holy shit that was *real*!

I guess it can't be a time lapse or anything, that's amazing! It's sped up.  Sorry, I should have been clearer.

 I know it's sped up, but it's not like the thing is stopping for long periods of time while people get out and move the barrier pieces. 

I think of time lapse as referring to really long processes, though I guess I'm wrong to expect anyone to recognize it that way. I think "stop motion" is the term you're looking for. Proof? That's hard to believe. haha fucking cool. The world largest zipper manufacturer and the manufacture of the largest zipper in the world. http://i.imgur.com/UXvljLg.jpg MULTI-TRACK DRIFTING! This is by far the most fascinating thing I've seen all week. 26 seconds earlier than the other guy with the exact same gif, but only 1/3 the karma. Poor guy.  [It's ok... I don't care about the karma](https://imgur.com/Ufzw03A) [Here's how it worked before.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Etu_Dv05pE) That's insane They have these on the Tappan Zee bridge. I believe there is a vehicle that drives over them and slides the segments left or right. Not sure of the name of the vehicle, though. The Tappan Zee is different than the gif the was posted elsewhere on this sub, with one vehicle kind of angled, moving the barrier entirely.  This might have changed since I used to commute over the bridge, but it used to be moved with several vehicles, each moving the barrier a couple feet.  Driving in a staggered line, one after the other.  It was a cool thing to see.  /u/nocallerid posted a gif elsewhere in this thread  Thank god, the little poles were terrifying. If you've ever walked the bridge under normal circumstances you know how loud it is with all the traffic, I'd love to go out on it with no traffic, I can only imagine how peaceful it must be.  Rode across it this morning. It was surreal. Nice! I was thinking about heading out there to walk it but i didn't know if they were letting people on the sidewalks, ima have to head out there! Do it! Literally a once-in-a-lifetime experience! As is jumping from the bridge! "See the Golden Gate Bridge, if it's the last thing you do" wow, this thread got dark quickly... For most people. There have been a few survivors which is crazy. It's a shame that there aren't more survivors, I bet most regret jumping immediately, like this story I read a while ago:

So the Golden Gate was the spot. Id heard that the water just sweeps you under. On the bridge, Baldwin counted to ten and stayed frozen. He counted to ten again, then vaulted over. I still see my hands coming off the railing, he said. As he crossed the chord in flight, Baldwin recalls, I instantly realized that everything in my life that Id thought was unfixable was totally fixableexcept for having just jumped. My brother's high school chemistry teacher jumped and survived. He went back to work months later after he recovered, and never said a word to his students.  Its STUFFED with people. Looks like something out of The Walking Dead. Yeah, I'll pass.  Were there a lot of people on the bridge?
 A metric fuckload.  I wanted to ride across, but there was no way that was gonna happen. Surprisingly no more than any other weekend. Maybe even less; I imagine it's a pain to get up there if you're not on a bike- the main parking lot for the bridge is closed (the one on the western side of the bridge should be open, though).

[Pics](http://imgur.com/a/TbPi2)

Edit: other commenters are saying it's packed now. Might be the case, I was on it at around noon and again around 2:30. The new center median is going to save many lives by eliminating head on collisions on the bridge. I am proud of San Francisco for taking these measures to make traveling the bridge safer. Not *that* many lives--head-on collisions are pretty rare on the bridge. Between 1971 and 2007, there were only 17 fatalities from head-on collisions, or one (death) every 117 weeks. 

The bridge is less dangerous than a lot of the state's intersections; (California highways claim around 10 lives *every day*.) Caltrans has its hands full installing much less expensive (&amp; more mundane) safety measures elsewhere ($30 million buys a lot of [jughandles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jughandle).)

Meanwhile, someone commits suicide by jumping from the bridge deck every other week. (~600 suicides between 1995 and 2012). That's the real source of bridge fatalities.

Read all about it (&amp; everything else) [on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge).  yeah I think it's gunna be a really good step. I tend to see people stray from the center-most lanes because of the chance of a head on, and maybe with more diversity in the lanes people pick there will be less traffic. idk.  [deleted] There's no way to get close to the side of the bridge by car
 Hundreds of special effect riddled movies say otherwise  Planet of the Apes? And Godzilla.  &gt; Hundreds

checks out. 1+1=3 No I Not Final Destination. And hell, even Monsters vs Aliens. And San Andreas (the movie) Are double yellow lines everywhere being replaced? Are people constantly crossing over those and causing head on collision? I get this median will be more safe. But why, do people just get stupider when on a bridge?  GG bridge used to just have posts that were hand moved to change the lane configurations depending on traffic flow. Six lanes total could be four one way, two the other, three in both directions, or three one way, two the other with a median lane. The speed limit is 45 with many going faster. In medium traffic, this put a lot of people going 50+ in opposite directions inches from each other on a narrow road prone to high winds. I kept thinking GG bridge meant it was a good guy. I read three other posts before I went "Ooooooh. Golden Gate."  I initially thought "good game". Haha. 

GG bridge no re Is there no breakdown or emergency stopping lane? I'd hate to be the poor bastard who had a breakdown on that bridge. You would surely get cussed into oblivion for what that would do to traffic Trucks push breakdowns off the bridge. They are pretty quick about it.

Not, like, off the side of the bridge... The GG Bridge is a bit different. IIRC, during the morning rush, there are 4 lanes going south and 2 lanes going north, but during the afternoon rush, there are 4 going north and 2 going south? It can be a bit confusing for people who've never driven on it. GGWP Bridge Because they reverse lanes on the golden gate. They used to use movable cones to indicate the center lanes. Now there will be a movable cement barrier.
 There usually is a median on a freeway, and the GG Bridge is both highway 101 and 1. I think you're talking about streets.  At the risk of sounding condescending, I'm surprised this wasn't done decades ago. It's such an obvious and simple safety feature. The Golden Gate Bridge is heavily trafficked. Commuters and tourists. The reasons those "cones" lasted so long is because they were easy to move. They can shift lanes depending on time of day and traffic flow. So switch one direction to having more lanes to help alleviate traffic. 

The reason the concrete median was never put in place is it needed to be moveable. While the technology has been around for a awhile, it was finally decided to implement it. They use this funky looking vehicle that basically shifts the concrete barrier one lane over quickly and efficiently. 

Also, due to the nature of the bridge, aesthetics are often deemed more important than human lives. Such as the suicide barrier which is constantly debated because it may change the "look" of such an iconic landmark.

It is possible the other poster was correct that some Union stuff was at stake, but I'm skeptical of that reason. The Golden Gate Bridge is still privately owned, everything is maintained by their own work force. The amount of "cone" shifting workers was probably 5 people maybe less. They could easily move them into one of the hundreds of other positions needed to maintain that bridge at same pay and benefits. Plus some still needed to be retained in the median movement abilities as it is still not an automated process and requires a crew to accomplish.

Edit: fixed for clarification yeah [this funky looking vehicle](http://i.imgur.com/dDfI96i.gif) Imagine seeing this thing in your rear view mirror eliminating the lane you're in, and catching up to you!

Someone should make a movie just to have that scene.

(Yes, I know it goes very slow. Maybe it could be chasing a street sweeper. Damn, this movie is writing itself!) A chase scene with this would be hilarious! Going all slow but with intense music and both drivers freaking out and yelling. Sounds like an Austin Powers bit! That looks like it'd be unnerving as fuck to drive. That's pretty rad. It may look funky but it still allows for lane shifting and the barrier will be much safer than those little cones. Hadn't seen this in action, I think it's pretty interesting. My feels exactly my dammy. Rad as fuck. The zipper truck is an incredible machine.  That thing is crazy ^^(awesome) looking. Cool.  Apparently they're called [barrier transfer machines, or zipper machines](http://youtu.be/dl0Q2bDnBUc?t=22s). The movable barrier is old tech though. I would have expected somewhere like San Fran to have that shit before us.  

When I say us, I mean New Zealand. Yes, New Zealand has had this barrier for years. We can't afford shit.  Well we only have one bridge to maintain.  We spare no expense on it lol. &gt; While the technology has been around for a few years, 

Just small point of clarification, they have had this system on the Tappan Zee Bridge in New York State since 1992, and it was considered old proven tech at that point.   There have been some accidents, but it's not exceptionally dangerous in terms of accident or fatality rate. It is a movable barrier.  So depending on which way rush hour is traveling they can add a lane in that direction.

Here's an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0Q2bDnBUc LA needs this. Especially the 405.  I was just in Vancouver and was shocked to see the bridge north out of town was like the golden gate with no median, however the middle lane changes direction simply by turning a green light above the lane on. I have to assume people die on a daily basis there. Usually when they change the lanes on that bridge they turn the symbol on the center lane to a "merge over as soon as possible" for several miles for an hour or so. If you can deal with the traffic in the rest of that city then the bridge is not even a concern. I think having a giant truck shuffle heavy dividers down a several lane highway at 8 miles an hour seems super costly to maintain, dangerous,  and definitely wouldn't work on the limited road space in Vancouver but that's my opinion.

 I'm pretty sure the roads and parking lots in Vancouver were designed to discourage people from having cars there. Why build more parking lots when you can build condos for foreign investors to dump their cash into? I live in van. Definitely not on a daily basis. I'm sure there are crashes but less so than you'd imagine. And thank fucking god. That center lane was terrifying. Save many lives? There hasn't been that many given how many people use the bridge each day.

"There is no official record about how many head on collisions the bridge has seen since it opened in 1933. **At least 16 have been recorded since 1970, with five deaths since 1990.**"

http://abc7news.com/traffic/golden-gate-bridge-closing-for-median-barrier-installation/463101/

In 25 years there has only been 5 deaths. Those are extremely low numbers. 

 Not only that, but it's a movable barrier to give more lanes to one direction during rush hour traffic.  They've been doing that for years already, it's just that the median was rubber pylons only I'm also looking forward to the new southbound merge. The way those left lanes used to disappear always seemed so dangerous to me. How many head on collisions have occurred at the Golden Gate? Not many.  16 since 1971.

[Or in just the cables, even](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/GG-bridge-cable.jpg) Holy shit that's intense. Hah yeah good luck camping inside that giant cable ya doofus! Get out of here dad! Sorry for being in your hair. You mean tense Woah! The total length of wire is more than 3 times the circumference of the earth :o I've heard that if you took out all the wire on the bridge and stretched it end to end, hundreds of motorists would die and an international manhunt would be started for you.  Oh. TIL bridges can be unraveled like sweaters. Come on, you're just making that up.  Directed by Steven Spielberg Is there any particular reason why the cable is an aggregate of smaller cables More flexibility and easier manufacture and transportation come to mind.  And lower chance of failure I believe. One crack in a small cable will take that cable out but leave thousands more. One small crack in a big cable can grow over time and break the whole thing.  Exactly, in fact that's a very common concept in engineering called [redundancy.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering\)) [fixed link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering\)) [Just in case.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_\(engineering\)) [NASA used triple redundancy on the Space Shuttle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering\)) #####&amp;#009;

&gt;

&gt;In [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering), __redundancy__ is the duplication of critical [components](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Component) or functions of a system with the intention of increasing reliability of the [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System), usually in the form of a backup or [fail-safe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-safe).

&gt;In many [safety-critical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety-critical_system), such as [fly-by-wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly-by-wire) and [hydraulic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic) systems in [aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft), some parts of the control system may be triplicated,  which is formally termed [triple modular redundancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_modular_redundancy) (TMR). An error in one component may then be out-voted by the other two. In a triply redundant system, the system has three sub components, all three of which must fail before the system fails. Since each one rarely fails, and the sub components are expected to fail independently, the probability of all three failing is calculated to be extraordinarily small; often outweighed by other risk factors, e.g., human error. Redundancy may also be known by the terms "majority voting systems"  or "voting logic". 

&gt;Redundancy sometimes produce less, instead of more reliability  it creates a more complex system which is more prone to various issues, it may lead to human neglectance of duty, and it may lead to higher production demands which are overstressing the system making it less safe.

Thanks. Another good point. It would be very hard to stretch such a thick and heavy cable accross the span between pilons. Therefore, at first they place a single thin wire. Then they bundle up some more. And more...

There would be an issue with flexibility and anchoring.

Suspension bridge anchor: http://www.highestbridges.com/wiki/images/thumb/4/4b/354MaanshanSuspensionAnchorWall_copy.jpg/750px-354MaanshanSuspensionAnchorWall_copy.jpg Engineering, yo how in the fuck did we build this Pencil, paper, drafting board.  seems like it wouldn't be very structurally sound if that's all we used. What about the mackinaw bridge? It's 5 miles long.  It doesn't count because you spelled it wrong. All jokes and pedantry aside, due to a different style of construction, it actually *is* possible to imagine the amount of steel in the Mackinac Bridge. Punkatrain Bridge in Lake Punkatrain Luisiana Luscious Jackson Bridge across Chessapeek Bay they're installing one of these: http://i.imgur.com/dDfI96i.gif Here's a [video](https://vimeo.com/115360942) of exactly what they're doing. TWO TRACK DRIFTING lmao [deja vu!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWQMOUmb3Ng) Bunta behind the wheel of the train, no doubt. It's like a IRL version of the old Zookeeper arcade game. CAESAR!! Glad to see the bridge back to normal after the Damn dirty ape war.  [deleted] That's really odd.  My husband and I went to SF a couple of years ago and I was shocked at how beautiful it was.  I had all these images from tv and movies but none of it did it justice.  It's not even just the bridge....it's just the beauty of the area.  I can't imagine seeing it and not being impressed. [deleted] I wish I could figure out how to post a pic.  We went to the opposite side of the bridge from SF, up on this mountain with a lookout point.  Looking at the bridge and SF was just beautiful!  I didn't want to leave! https://bevilblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc_0302.jpg

It's a very popular sightseeing spot! the marin headlands That sucks. I've lived in the North Bay all my life, so the bride is just a part of the scenery, something I see every time I go into the city. Last year, though, a friend visited from out of state. She'd seen SF before but she'd always flown into and out of SFO without getting to the edge of the city. When we crossed the bridge she got so freaking excited it really showed me how jaded I'd become about such an amazing piece of engineering. Now I really try to appreciate how beautiful and picturesque it is when I drive into the city. 

There is something about that sight, when you exit the tunnel and the bridge is there, disappearing around the corner, with the cliffs and the pacific to the right and the city and the bay on the left.  Some people are awed by that stuff, some aren't.  

I am in your camp.  

Nothing I have ever seen has awed me like Manhattan from observatories.  I think maybe Hong Kong may rival it, but have never been there.  It also looks like many Asian and MidEast cities are trying, esp Dubai? Not sure how much time has passed since the move, but how do you feel about your decision to move now?  Well worth it I hope? I grew up in the bay area and have been over these bridges a thousand times and am in awe each time. Bay bridge is just as awesome as GG. The Verrazano bridge in NYC is just as long as the golden gate. Maybe they were just nervous and couldn't say anything since all they could think about was how the bridge could fail at any moment.  Just a guess idk.  Some people have fears of bridges.  Personally, even the most basic bridge is pretty interesting to me just from a engineering standpoint let alone the view. Its like a video game It's like every apocalypse movie set on the west coast, ever. Here's how you can do it, even on a busy day.

http://i.imgur.com/SKYbUyR.jpg I did this on a nudist beach and it cropped out the beach and left the dicks. So... It worked?  If you think about it, in both cases, the pictures are empty because they were related to medians.

[Woah.](http://i.imgur.com/DWrI2JY.gif) Hooray! Now I won't hit those stupid cones when they inevitably get misplaced and fall into the road. Planet of the apes? CAESAR!  Notice how clean it is?

Any they say we cant have nice things. This was the Manhattan Bridge on Christmas day: http://i.imgur.com/dHAQtMC.jpg I'm glad I got to see this picture considering I had to use the bay bridge on Saturday. I hate the bay bridge. Would love a big version of this. To print out as a poster to hang on my wall. Here's a parallel photo of an empty Brooklyn Bridge. I took it early in the morning riding a bike one day. https://www.flickr.com/photos/13515581@N00/8950178736/ Thought this might interest some people:

With some Photoshop trickery, you can remove all cars and people from an image.

1. Put your camera on a tripod

2. Take about 15 pictures about every 10 seconds

3. Open them all in Photoshop from File-&gt;Scripts-&gt;Statistics

4. Choose "median"

Example: https://i.imgur.com/Gkn1ngK.jpg I just watched dawn of the planet of the apes too.  Well the Golden Gate Bridge is closed this weekend. Is OP working on the bridge? They had the east sidewalk open to pedestrians and bikes.  Was in San Francisco for the first time from Friday-Today, and couldnt go on it because it was closed.. Didn't know some of it was open :/ The wind is so punishing! We rode our bikes and were brutally wind-lashed down and back, but regaled in the awesomeness of the views and the bridge itself. People don't regale in things as much as they used to, and that vexes me. It's the precursor to the next scene, where we see all the zombies.  I made a wallpaper out of it if anyone wants it.
http://i.imgur.com/A7Pjbey.jpg
 I would wait for the pack of wild speaking monkeys cross it first. You never know...  You could just use long exposure too get this shot... Or multi shots and combine them using photoshop, I remember reading abou this method on /r/photography to remove tourists from tourist sites shots.  When I visited the Golden Gate Bridge 2 years ago, I took a few panoramas while on the bridge.  When I got home and I stitched them together, I noticed that the bridge looked pretty empty.  The stitching software had inadvertently removed most of the cars from the bridge.   http://lifehacker.com/remove-people-from-your-photos-with-this-photoshop-scri-1245505649 There are tons of ways to get this photo digitally as well, but doesn't that defeat the purpose?  A west coast version of the zipper from Boston! Reminds me of that one photo of Grand Central Terminal in NY empty after closing for Hurricane Sandy. Very eerie.  Wow this is a gorgeous picture But it's not empty if you're on it. Why our Mackinaw Bridge up north gets no press is beyond me. It's 5 miles long and dwarfs the golden gate.  I found out this "empty shot" can be achieved easily with any road with a very long exposure.  I'm lucky I wasn't planning to drive home this weekend I'm not sure if I like this photo from a /r/minimalism standpoint or an /r/engineering aspect.. 

 *I'm really fun at parties* You're pretty much the worst though.  It's like, someone photoshopped all of the cars out of this picture. First time in the bridges history: 

http://goldengate.org/news/bridge/mmb_closure.php well, kinda. It's been closed to vehicular traffic for major anniversaries twice, one time there were so many people standing on the bridge that it flattened a bit(my mom, aunt, and brother were there). It was closed in one direction for the Amgen Tour of California bike race one year. It's not empty - the chimps are above, and the orangutans are below. [deleted] You can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs, brah.  It's because it leads to silent hill. I live in Oakland and have seen all the roadside announcements.  So, why was the GG closed this weekend? Installed a new barrier. Wish it was like this when I visited 2 weeks ago. I would have put folding chairs in the middle of the closed road and had a picnic and maybe play a board game or two with anyone who wanted to join. :) And then you'd spend the night in jail.  I never had that problem in MN.  I've done that numerous times on temp. closed bridges around here.  :) Thanks for the pic.  I was up at dawn to ride across, but decide it was too foggy.  When the sun came out, so did the people :( Looks eerie.  FWIW - you can get this image even when cars are driving on it using a pretty neat technique. http://lifehacker.com/remove-people-from-your-photos-with-this-photoshop-scri-1245505649   Now that is one mildly interesting bridge! It's so void of vehicles!  It not that rare for it to be empty. Isnt closed when Karl gets to thick? According to the bridge's website, it's very infrequently closed:

&gt;Full Closures due to Weather: The Golden Gate Bridge has been closed due to high winds three times:

&gt;December 1, 1951: As gusting winds reached 69 miles per hour, the Bridge was closed for about three hours. 
December 23, 1982: High winds of up to 70 miles per hour closed the Bridge for almost two hours. 
December 3, 1983: Once again high winds closed the Bridge for the longest period in its history3 hours and 27 minutes. Wind gusts reached 75 miles per hour, but again the Bridge suffered no structural damage.

&gt;Full Closure due to Construction: On July 13, 1975 the entire Bridge roadway was closed from 3 am to 4:20 am to move the cable traveler being used for the Suspender Rope Replacement Project.

&gt;Full Closure for 50th Anniversary: On May 24, 1987, the Bridge was closed to traffic from 5 am to 11 am for the 50th Anniversary Pedestrian Walk.

&gt;Full Closure for 75th Anniversary: On May 27, 2012, the Bridge was closed to traffic from 9 pm to 10:01 pm for the 75th Anniversary fireworks display.

&gt;Brief Closures for Dignitaries: The Bridge was closed very briefly on two separate occasions for visiting dignitaries President Franklin D. Roosevelt and President Charles de Gaulle of France. "

http://goldengatebridge.org/research/facts.php#BridgeClosed This is also the longest closure int the bridge's history. Nobody calls it Karl. Come on.  Theoretically you could do this with a very long exposure, such as if you were to put a 64ND in front of the lens.  With bridge bounce you would probably need a gyro stabilizer though. Or many short exposures and a copy of Photoshop. You can combine the images and only keep the details that are consistent to all of them. It's a feature. Only minor cropping would be required to account for bridge bounce, if any.  No, you actually use an array of seven trombones and play them like pan-flutes It's like op just never even tried to play in the band. [Serious here] I do own 4 different sizes of trombones, so I could almost do this... [You could almost recreate this video with some friends](https://youtube.com/watch?v=fqjW5_BbodM) I need this in my life.

What kind of life do you life that this wasn't one of your day's highlights? I guess I'm just selfish for thinking my life should be filled to the brim with the sort of joy I gain from watching a series of grown men playing progressively smaller trombones. That moment you realize you have more trombones then friends... I know a guy with at least 18 guitars. I haven't seen him in person in years. Stupid trombonists and their easy vibrato. It's almost like cheating. As a fellow band member I love the pettiness And truth in this statement. Wasn't that song in Office Space?

I think it was when Milton was on the beach at the end saying he would put strychnine in the guacamole.

Also, WHERE CAN I GET A LITTLE POCKET TROMBONE? [These are the ones they used.](http://www.thein-brass.com/index_en.php?strUrl=%2Fcontent%2Fen%2Finstruments.php%3Fitname%3Dtrombone)

They're extraordinarily expensive though (while being extraordinarily good). It was. It's called "The Peanut Vendor"

[It also made an appearance in Breaking Bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUjORDny2-w) This song is fantastic. My high school jazz band played it my freshman(?) year, and we had most of the band walking down the aisles of the auditorium. It was fantastic.

Now I feel like a loser for missing high school. Band and choir were the best parts of high school and I miss them everyday.   I don't miss anything else. What was the naked dude....playing? the skin flute That was fucking beautiful. That was....surprisingly awesome!! Why was this so entertaining?

Fuck d flat in the staff haha You're right, just play C sharp any time in comes up... still impossible to find because 5th position Just get a double trigger.
Makes everything so easy Sure let me just dip into the thousands of dollars I don't have to get a sweet double trigger.

if only... Don't worry, using the second trigger for 5th position is basically pointless in 99.9% of cases. You have to tune the second trigger out of tune to get 1st position-both triggers depressed in tune with 1st position open and 1st position F trigger. I had maybe one jury piece in college that I used the Gflat trigger independently, and I removed the little extension on my horn, making that trigger actually G. I am familiar with all of these words. 


I don't think I've ever seen them in that order.    I can only read treble cleff and that confused the shit out of me for a moment  I don't get it. Is it because it looks like Bb? Makes sense to a Trombone Player. We're not the brightest bunch. Played for 12 years. Can confim. Yep. Played all through grade school and in the city symphony band here until I went off to college. Band director was in the symphony band as well. No one there ever expected me to know the big words or terminology. They dealt with me because I could make pretty noises. &gt; pretty noises.

Ehhhhh.... I play/played trombone. I think it's an instrument that is hard to make sound pretty, but when someone is able to do it, it's awesome.

Good stuff.  Plus, it is really fun to play. I've been meaning to locate my bazooka ever since my kid started trumpet this year.

Thanks for the link, too.
 I would really like to get back into it, but I may not until I am closer to retirement. I just have too many other hobbies and goals above it.

Despite playing from middle school through the first half of college I never thought my tone was very good. Part of that was my lack of inherent talent (I had to really work at it), but I think the instrument itself was also a factor. The trombone I played, and still have is the cheapest beginner my parents could find. Still had a blast though!  I wish Russell Brand had stuck to the drums. Dude, trombone solos impress the shit outta me because you can't change notes on the same blow and ya gotta tongue the shit outta that huge thing. Yes, it sounds sexual, but you can make an innuendo outta just about any instrument. 

-Signed,

A drummer with who can't blow brass for shit. Bonerama is awesome, I saw them live in New Orleans, and they are sick.  They cover Zeppelin and stuff in their set. Shameless plug for a [piece for trombone](https://soundcloud.com/sonic-monkeybars/captain-and-coke) I wrote in college! [Only second to the Blue Whale in its majesty](http://inception.davepedu.com/) Ladies go nuts for it bro.  &gt; pretty noises

So here's the thing... Isn't tone deafness a prerequisite to being a trombonist? From what I remember in my middle school trombone days, it wouldn't really hurt that much. The slide positions were marked on the slide or something, and the notes were what they called slotted. I'm not sure if that's the right term. But basically it was easier to play the right note than to play off tune. So you didn't really have too memorize what it sounded like, just where it was. This could all be wrong though. I played for one year over a decade ago. Yeah, that'll slide (pun definitely intended) in middle school, but once you get beyond the high school level it gets to the point that every single note basically has its own slide position, so aural training for trombonists is a must.  I've also met a lot of really good trombonists who are good trombonists because they are good singers (because they know how things should sound ahead of time).  Basically what you just said is true, for being a middle school trombonist, beyond that the story is quite different. You'll get the note. Being in tune...probably not  Played(ing) for 13 years, can confirm for all 3rd seat players. Had this exact chart in middle school.

Shitty trombonist confirmed. I played trombone all through Middle and High school, and sadly this chart is useless to me for remembering how to play.  It was all about where the hand was positioned relative to the rest of the instrument; none of us really cared where the end of the slide was located.  Except for when we were trying to poke those damn Sax players in the back of the head anyway. Yeah it was all about where your hand was compared to the bell.  3rd is right just before the bell and so you make 2nd halfway between 1st and 3rd.   4th is right after the bell.  

Then everything after 4th was a wild guess made based on how annoying it was to reach.   Fuck you, 7th position.  I play trombone in an orchestra specifically so I don't have to make any effort. I miss having friends in band. Those kids were always a blast. And the shit that went down on trips was epic. Trombone player for 7 years can confirm. I'll be your friend. Tronbroners I have the love for 7th - just whack your arm all the way down and extend your fingers.  
5th was the problem child for me.  
Also - screw all those ledger lines. Screw them right in the butt. Long arms here.

This does not end well. You probably need the one labelled "6" in the picture - or maybe "7"! 5th is the problem child for everyone. Absolutely. It's the guy you have to invite to the party but REALLY hope won't turn up. Fifth is out in the middle of nowhere. It's really a guess; I would just hope I got the note right.


Seventh is how you get yelled at for shooting your slide out like a missile. Who needs 7 when you have a trigger?  Also why trombone was best in marching band. A lot of time in my college days they wouldn't give all of us music. I'd just watch where the other slides were going an be mostly in tune. Although I never could answer if I was playing first or second trombone. Just a general "yes-ish".  Gotta agree with this. Did you ever do that thing where you held the bell and the slide, to get to about 3rd or 4th position (I can't really remember which)? (Un)fortunately for me, my band instructor was a trombone player as well.  He often sat with me during practice sessions since otherwise the band had all of one trombonist (least represented other than french horn, which he didn't play.  Even tuba had 2.).  He made sure to smack any "cheats" out of me real quick :P Hahah, nice. I should get around to playing some more, trombone is great. Yeah I was sad to give it up.  Bike accident murdered my lip; doing the proper mouth piece vibrations was hell after that.

I still &lt;3 the trombone though.  Even though it's so maligned by people, it has such an iconic sound and no other horn gives you so much flexibility. &gt; Yeah I was sad to give it up. Bike accident murdered my lip; doing the proper mouth piece vibrations was hell after that.

My studio prof did the same, but actually blowing his lip out while playing as part of a circus band in the 60's. He had a shit embouchure and was "slamming and jamming" to get the higher portion of his range. It took him years, but he developed a proper embouchure after that. I feel you.  I spent 2 years sucking at trombone and having everyone hate me for lowering the standards, and then I got my braces off, and it was like angels were flying out of the bell.    The sick irony is that I got my braces off 2 weeks before I finished school, and I didn't even own my own trombone.  I know right! People give it so much shit, they should listen to some heavy Russian Romantic music and think about that... Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky loved the trombone. Mine has been in my closet for almost a year :(

I totally did this cheat though. Pretty sure it was third position. Yeah, that sounds right. Good. Your teacher did the right thing for you. 3rd, trigger 3rd, 4th, and double trigger 4th could all be approximated via the bell. However, this defeats the point of playing a huge tuning slide, as you totally ignore the actual needed length to remain in tune not only to yourself, but to any other players you may be playing with.

As an extension, completing 4 years of college with bass trombone as your major instrument and then subbing for your high school's jazz band (and helping out with band camp) makes playing difficult, as they generally do not use their ears and you are trying to tune yourself on the fly to 4 different pitch centers in the group or section. Aw man, I miss playing bass trombone in my high school's jazz band! Third position haha. That was my go to mark in case I ever slipped up.  Thank the lord I had long arms and a trigger trombone for my days in the band  Well that makes sense, unless you learned trombone while watching a video feed of a camera that was recording the side of you. You know what you call a beautiful woman on the arm of a trombone player? Either sister or tattoo. 

Jokes told by trombone players to trombone players.

Perhaps if someone wrote some music that featured the trombone, we'd be inspired to be better players and somehow would become smarter and more attractive. I blame composers and arrangers. Props to him for doing it, but it's hard for me to believe that the most renowned trombone solo, The David Concertino, is written by a violin player (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_David_(musician)) #####&amp;#009;

He's the one who can't figure out the slide and needs a push to swing. Have you seen Trombone Shorty?! WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING ABOUT RIKER, MAN?!??! He had enough trouble with chairs.  I found out recently it was because Frakes had back problems and it was reduce the stress on his back of sitting down and standing up and over after every take. It's also why Riker leaned on everything. Yar, sick bay is for wimps Trouble? He made those chairs his bitch. There was actually one episode where he was told by a holodeck character not to quit his day job. Yep,  despite the slide handle not moving,  it is incredibly obvious to players. The handle was just lazy on the animators part, either way the point gets across  I haven't touched a trombone in 10 years, but I still know all the positions with or without an F trigger. Dem F triggers, I got one in 10th grade, and then I got a bass trombone with a trigger for Jr. year symphony band (We had two bands, symphony for the good players and concert for the lesser players. Due to me being me, I played in both because I'm awesome and concert only had two trombones) It does but even though it has been over 13 years since I've held a trombone after playing one for 9 years before that, it threw me off because I taught myself to play with up to 6 positions. 0_6. All the way back was 0 and  all the way forward was 6.

I was confused mostly because of the 7 position. It took me too long to figure out that 1 to the chart was my zero.  Screw you for trying to change my counting. Hitting the wrong note?  Don't worry, just keep going until it's the right one. Goes for all low brass people. LBKA  obviously, if you never evolved to valves Who needs a fingering chart wen you've mastered the 7 positions? Well clearly as you blow more air in the trombone inflates  It's things like this that made me switch from trombone to percussion after the second week.  The difference between 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc?  No clue -- hit or don't hit?  YES!!!  You have to listen to yourself a bit more with trombone. If you are trying to play an A natural in second and it sounds bad then either push in or pull out. If one way doesn't work then do the other. Yeah, this is also around the time I learned, much to my musically inclined mother's horror, that I have a tin ear!  She had perfect pitch -- I have trouble carrying sheet music! Well there's your problem, you should be carrying the sheet music with your hands, not your ears. If it starts to sound bad, always pull out.  If you didn't like the trombone because of lack of accuracy, then don't try the fretless bass or the orchestral stringed instruments haha Its not like trumpet where there are several valves for you to press with confidence. The trombone positions are (for me) determined by where it is in relation to the bell. Why I never switched from trombone to literally any other instrument? Eh.  I immediately regretted not picking the baritone. Ypu obviously don't play the timpani then. That's all intonation  I can confirm, i have played the trombone for years and that's how it works: a trombone is a closed system, when you blow air into it it inflates. That why it appears to get bigger. This is some guy with one stock trombone image trying to simulate a moving slide with the free transform tool and not giving a fuck. "I'm just here so I don't get fined" Bound to get bigger when you put your lips on it and blow.   http://gifatron.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/sGx39yA.gif [Twoot ;)](http://i.imgur.com/aP1VvAG.gif) That's how my grandmother died. (   ) I can help! 

First - the slide is all the way in

Second - slide out enough to see ~ 1 inch of the metal underneath it

Third - if you stick your fingers out on the hand holding the slide, third position is about where your fingers will touch the bell while still holding the slide

Fourth - slide the slide out to where the metal underneath is exposed all the way to just past the bell

Fifth - about 3 inches past fourth

Sixth and seventh - seventh is about as far out as you can get the slide without it falling off (keep it on by an inch or so).  Sixth is halfway between fifth and seventh.


Good luck, OP. Nobody has ever, ever, ever in the history of ever been able to say for sure where the fifth position is. It might just be a myth. Give not false hope. Just whack yer arm out and hope for the best! I nailed it once ever, and it wasn't during a performance. Fifth position is right there.  Its different for me every day, sometimes twice a day if I play in the morning and evening. Can confirm. Played trombone for years and still not sure.  For me, fourth was always where my thumbnail touched the bell.  Fifth?  No idea.  Sixth was almost fully extend arm and seventh was way out there (Or back to first and change my embouchure a bit).

One thing I loved about trombone was that if I hummed while playing it sounded like crap, but the clarinets always got blamed. &gt; Sixth was almost fully extend arm and seventh was way out there (Or back to first and change my embouchure a bit).

The F Key changed my life. With a very well-greased slide, 7th is how I got yelled at for shooting my slide off the trombone like a missile. Yeah, but you need to listen for yourself to see exactly where those pitches are once you get better. Every horn is different. I hate doing scales... I appreciate this.  /r/crappydesign
 It's telling you to buy 7 different sized trombones to hit the various keys  Someone should cross-post this to /r/mildlyinfuriating. Its a three dimensional display, move left to right to change notes. *Jimmy!  You were supposed to use the #4 sized trombone on that note!  God Dammit Jimmy!* As a former trombonist, that is WONWAWAHWA! It would be useless regardless. The only way to find the right position is to listen while playing. It's meant for beginners who haven't played long enough to be able to hear the differences. No beginner is hitting that double b flat... read the text on it sheet, it mentions this.  Sure, but if you'd ever played the violin, you'd know that the space between notes varies by a certain amount. It's good to know where the amount is bigger or smaller so you can listen to the accuracy of your playing. 

However, this picture gives absolutely no help. I just hate the argument of "listen to yourself is all you need to be gooder" Pretty much useless is a stretch. Anyone with enough wit to make it up to 8th grade and join band would just know slide it out that much more. Trombone player, reporting in. Saxophones can suck it. Maybe the same trombone is just getting closer at a quick rate, in which case it would sound different http://youtu.be/RhTgNpMF7_0 every time I see a trombone I think of this guy  Ummm... Everyone knows it takes seven different sized trombones to play the major scale.  Some strapping young college graduate probably made that and thought it was the most amazing fucking thing in the world. You're supposed to quickly move towards and away from your audience so the doppler effect changes the pitch of the notes. They're a bit rusty, I guess. damn...i remember playing trombone, those 4 years were actually pretty fun.  "Just let your hands do the listening for you!" Gives T-Rex hope of achieving his dream of playing in the marching band. Inaccurate but perfectly understandable, therefore not pretty much useless. A trombone that comically increases in size when you play it - my new thing to laugh hysterically about...  You had one job... As a musician its more like /r/mildyinfuriating Womp womp... "Hey Marc, I have this illustration here, do you know how to make it look like the slide is moved out?" "I dunno, just make the whole thing bigger or something." Don't you know how to make your trombone bigger? Now I know why they needed 76 trombones for the big parade. I mean, would't it work? You just have to make your whole instrument larger to change the pitch... I chose Trumpet and in 1990 or w/e because it only had 3 buttons. seemed simple. Turns out the ones with tons of buttons are easier to understand. By the time I got to senior High Scool stuff where the teacher gave use Hard College music for our last project I was having a major headache. That's partly a personal problem though. I think it means you are supposed to get closer and farther away from the audience. /r/CrappyDesign I think you mean completely useless. I used to always gauge positions from the position of the handle to the bell. However it varies from trombone to trombone so even if they did show the slide moving, the likelihood that your trombone matches the positions of the in the pic is rather small. you don't slide it, you rub it to make it longer. I thought this was /r/CrappyDesign until I didn't see the eye-searing subreddit style. jesus I went and looked and had to abort So um, this is probably the product of someone who knows music being coerced into writing something to help trombone players, or a trombone player coerced into writing something to help his fellows and not knowing how to photoshop. took me a bit to work out what you meant. Someone held shift in Illustrator when they shouldn't have. Even without holding shift it wouldn't have worked (the whole trombone would still be stretched), you need to use the 9-slice scaling method for that kind of things... or... just select the end of the slide and move only those points... it's probably way faster... Am I the only one in this thread who doesn't play trombone and doesn't understand what's wrong here? Explanation? Anyone? You change the note on a trombone by moving the slide (u-shape at the front) in and out. In order for the chart to be useful, it should show how far to move the slide to make each note. Instead it just scales up the drawing, so you can't tell. Wait - you guys didn't just make your trombones bigger and smaller to get the different notes, and moved the slide? - Huh - I'll have to try that. You raise and lower the pitch on trombone by changing the length of the instrument by moving the slide. Guitar strings work kind of the same way: shorten the string, raise the pitch of the note. 

The diagram is a wreck because instead of showing how much to move the slide forward, it just shows a larger trombone. &gt; Guitar strings work kind of the same way: shorten the string, raise the pitch of the note.

Not to be pedantic, but instead of the guitar, it's more like a violin. It's that fret thingy that makes the difference. Trumpet is more like guitar, with discrete steps. Violins don't have frets, so you kind of have to guess where you put your finger til it's on the correct pitch. Same with trombone. Somehow, you get used to it with either instrument.  It gives you a bigger image of the instrument instead of any useful information on how to play. I wonder how the author would have depicted a valve trombone's fingerings.  Did anyone else ever get frustrated that the tuning note for band was "concert A" this on trombone was 2nd position so basically a useless baseline to tune the bloody instrument as by ear you could just move the slide a wee bit. That's one of the best parts about playing trombone: tuning on the fly.  Nope, because the tuning note for band is Bb. Apologies. Was always orchestras i was in where it was a from the oboe Thays cool I once knew a girl that used an icycle for something else. Appeared cold and awful. She seemed to enjoy it. Oh, that sounds unpleasant  Doesnt it though? Vaginas are hot....that thing would really melt fast  I'm absolutely disgusted with the way people sexualize ***everything*** on Reddit! Why would you just assume that she inserted an icicle into her vagina? I'm so fucking triggered! Misogynistic asshole.

^^^^^^She ^^^^^^put ^^^^^^it ^^^^^^in ^^^^^^her ^^^^^^ass. Misogynistic icehole.
 [Fargin icehole.](http://youtu.be/6GVCgTFw2Qk?t=22s)  Just watched that not too long ago for the first time in many years. Still holds up well.  Poopsicle Well that icicle-lated quickly... Tryin too hard.  why the fuck didn't you put a trigger warning on this fucking comment you asshole? you should put a trigger warning on your username, i was abducted by an alien and now I have ayyy lmao PTSD. You need to put a fucking trigger warning on your trigger warnings. I was literally raped by all the triggers all the time constantly and your triggering triggers my trigger of triggers. My kerjigger! I don't know but I've been told...
Eskimo pussy's mighty cold... I don't know what has been said, /u/Imadurr's mom is good in bed. When I was in high school there was a girl that allegedly used a frozen hot dog at a party. We called her Oscar Mayer until she graduated. I don't remember what brand of hot dog it actually was, but this just shows the power of market branding that company has. This a story in every high school in America. Along with the "I knew a girl who let her dog eat her out at a party" high school story. I knew a dog who let a girl eat her out in high school We had this one too, she put peanut butter on her twat to make the dog lick it.  We also had another one where a girl used a beer bottle to get off at a party. Yeah it is..we have a similar story of someone using a frozen hot dog and it broke off and got stuck in her. Had a girl stick a drum stick up her ass and "play the drums".   Fun times  Our girl supposedly put the handle of a fishing rod in her butt.... as I get older, it seems more and more fake. But still. I want to believe A good one at my old high school was about this girl who ingested eight gentleman's shots before vomiting a stew of captain Morgan and men-of-the-se all over the floor at a party. Yup had someone at my school with that rumor. Didn't believe it though, she was just too nice and wouldn't have told anyone even if it had happened. Well, they're not called wieners for nothing  We all know that girl. She is a fun friendly gal. Oh good! You happen to know her number? We didn't keep in touch, I'm recently divorced and I'd like to get ahold of her. We've got this school reunion thing coming up and I'm in charge of getting folks together cuz I'm such a good guy.
Have her text me. I'm sure you won't have to warm her up. Should be an easy conquest. Bless her little heart and giant vagina. I bet she packs her own appetizer That is truly disgusting... "Anything can be a dildo if you're brave enough"
-Thomas Edison  ctrl+f 'brave'

i knew someone would say it I had a girlfriend who would put ice in her mouth when she would give me a blowjob. Try it, I highly recommend it. The ol' ice tongue. JD would be proud. My mouth would get cold  So did my penis. You're supposed to give OTHER people presents on your cakeday, right?
 I was super confused about what an icycle is- I thought it might be some new trendy Apple device. I believe the word you're looking for is icicle.  Tired of biking *outside* where you have to expel energy and the **sun** can get to you? Just download our totally free app, icycle! You can ride for hours, crushing all those pesky leaves along the way, and never get tired! Totally not going to be any in-app purchases either. Promise*

*we reserve the right to take over your life, make you send requests to your fb friends, and yeah we'll probably add in-app purchases once this thing takes off. Yeah, one letter being wrong is supper confusing. It would take a genius years to decipher that gibberish. Is it diner time already? Looks more like a bowling pin to me. It looks like a murder weapon. That disappears above 32 degrees.  Or 0 degrees. So, Mr. EmmaWatsonSnipple, do you get taller when it's 0 degrees out? And can we see it either way? Only if you're a commie! Everything looks like a murder weapon to you. Will there be blood? It would be a great murder weapon.  Quick, OP, make 9 more! Is that faucet turned off? Because you should turn it off. Actually you're supposed to leave faucets dripping when it freezes. Keeps the pipes from freezing. I know this, and yet the first freeze of the year I forgot my faucets and ended up with frozen pipes. Two days without water. 

Edit: a lot of replies. My bad, leaving them running is for indoor only. Kinda screwed the pooch there. There's a lot of useful info in the comments below mine. Sorry for the mistake. I don't leave the outdoor ones going. We've never messed with those, so far so good. It's just the inside ones we leave on a bit. Apologies again. Read on down for a better guide to plumbing in the winter, or do as one guy said and move to a better climate. No, the faucet should have a shutoff valve in the basement.  Close that, then open the outside faucet to let the residual water drain.  Close the faucet and now you're set. Yep. Out door faucets need to be treated differently than indoor ones. Depends on the whether the sillcock plumbing comes from an insulated and heated space, and whether it's a frost resistant  type or not. 

Ideally, you have a freeze proof sillcock that's installed so it drains out, it's sealed around where it penetrates your home, and the seat of the valve is in an insulated and heated area.  That is an old sill cock and not a [frost free](http://www.homerepairforum.com/images/uploads/2005-9-12_Frost_Proof_Sillcock_w550.JPG) As a plumber do you still giggle like a schoolgirl at the word sillcock? i feel like being a plumber would make that less likely. Can confirm, dad is a plumber for 30+ years, I've worked with him for several.  Plumbing is a dirty, silly business for the first two weeks, then nothing funny after that.

Ballcock

Sillcock

Nipple

etc Plumbers can't touch horsecock that's for electricians. let's not forget the RectumSeal, uh, I mean RectorSeal. My dad still refers to RectorSeal putty as "rectum sealer." More likely at [nipple extractor](http://www.aqualineinc.com/NEW/images/products/NE-ZINC_lg.png) I've seen nipple vore, but not full-on nipple extraction. Wait til you find out about petcocks.  Cock hole cover is funnier. 
Edit: [link](http://www.amazon.com/Cock-Hole-Cover-Chrome-Plated/dp/B0006HGOG6) As an electrician, we use horsecocks and nipples frequently in our trade.  LPT: install your sillcock so the outside tap is lower than the inside hose barb. This allows the water to drain after the tap is shut. I learned the hard way!
Also, detach your garden hose in the fall! Yep. Been got from leaving the hose on twice now.

Also got got by leaving the hose on: "Oh, no water because frozen" then leaving it, forgetting to turn off. Then came the thaw...

Though I believe you can get a kind that will drain even with a hose on. I'M A PLUMBER AND YOU NEED TO TURN IT OFF YOU WILL BURST A PIPE IN YOUR HOUSE. Plumber here. Shut your damned mouth.

(Kidding. I'm not ~~a jerk~~ *that much of a* jerk.) Californian here. Move to Southern California. I have no idea what any of you guys are taking about. So sometimes when it gets really cold, rain will freeze into these MAGICAL poofballs that fall from the sky.

And then your pipes freeze and expode and you need to poop at you're neighbor's for a week or 2. I live in southern California. What country do you live in where the pipes freeze and you have to use your neighbors lavatory?  Northern California  Northern California here.  It's 70 degrees outside, and I'm at some elevation. Well this is awkward.  It's 82 and sunny, but then again I'm in Los Angeles right now. I grew up near Sacramento and one December when we were visiting family back east there was a crazy cold snap and our pipes froze. We had to use the neighbors' until it was fixed. TBH, I was like 8 years old, so I don't remember exactly how long though. Oregon during a small window of the Year Happens in the northern Best Coast all the time (Best England) Stop it, There's already too many people here! That's because you don't have any water to drip. I much rather deal with frozen pipes, instead of wildfires and droughts... Don't forget landslides when it rains after the wildfires.  Also earthquakes.  Jokes on you, it never rains here  And Lex Luthor severing the continent in two to make the land you're living on slide into the ocean. And OJ Simpsons. Sounds like japan We live in a gated community.... So..... Plumbers around me make so much on emergency calls for this... Plumber here. I approve of this message. Basement? What is this...


- Texan No basement here.... But perhaps under my house... Also I was told that, but it's a little less work to just leave a faucet dripping. Usually I leave the kitchen and bath, no going outside or climbing under the house. I'm good with that. No, turn off outside faucets. They're usually the first to burst.  The best way to avoid frozen pipes is to do like I do and be in California where it's nice.  Do you even have water in your pipes anymore? Great question. No.  Ha! I grew up in San Diego. If you had told me how cold Georgia can get I'm not sure I would have moved. No, No, No! Do not do this! Running water CAN freeze, contrary to popular belief!  (It just takes longer than still water)
Lack of water (air) cannot freeze and blow up your pipes, though. Shut the water supply off inside the warm house and open the faucet to drain the pipe. Do not turn the water to that faucet back on until there will be no more freezing outside, or if you need to use it, shut it off inside and drain it again.  You're supposed to turn the faucet all the way open, but shut it off at the source. That way no water remains in the pipes and freezing isn't a bust risk. It's a bit more complicated than that - I really hate such "simple" solutions. Life isn't so simple and a "simple" solution usually works only in a certain circumstance - a circumstance that the misguided advocate of simplicity (you!) conveniently forgets to tell anyone about.

##Exterior Freeze-Proof Faucet

It is constructed as follows: The valve is *inside* of the building, and there's a very long extension outlet tube between the valve and the spigot. It should be installed with the spigot a bit lower than the valve. When you close the valve, the remaining water will drain out naturally.

It might fail:

1. If it's installed improperly (spigot above the valve), it won't drain properly and may get damaged.

2. If you leave it dripping, you will destroy it. As it cools from the outside in, the dripping water will plug it up on the outside, eventually filling the entire outlet tube, freezing it solid and bursting it.

3. If you leave it with a hose attached, it may never drain properly in the first place, and will freeze solid and the outlet tube will burst.

Finally, the *failure of the outlet tube is* **insidious**. First of all, with the valve closed, the failure is after the valve, so nothing leaks. Once you open the valve, there will be a small leak if there is no restriction of the flow. So you might open the valve and the water will flow "OK" and you're none the wiser. Eventually you attach a hose, open the valve, and the flow restriction will add some backpressure that will force the water through the crack in the already burst outlet tube. This water will usually go straight inside of your wall, slowly destroying it from inside. I hope you see why I had to type *insidious* in bold above.

##Exterior Non-Freeze-Proof Faucet

It is simply a valve on the end of a pipe. The valve is on the outside of the building. When you close the valve, the pipe going through the wall is still full of water. To protect it from freezing:

1. Close the shut-off valve inside of the building - by most codes every exterior faucet should have a shutoff valve inside.

2. Open the faucet so that it drains.

It might fail:

1. If it's installed improperly (spigot above the shut-offvalve), it won't drain properly and may get damaged.

2. If you leave it dripping, you will destroy it. As it cools from the outside in, the dripping water will plug it up on the outside. The pipe going across the wall is full of water and it will freeze solid as soon as it stops flowing, and will burst.

3. If you leave it with a hose attached, it may never drain properly in the first place, and will freeze solid and the pipe will burst.

The failure here is also a bit insidious: You'll get a huge water leak after the temperatures get higher. So while everything is frozen, things will look OK. Due to mechanics of the pipe, it's very likely that the split will also happen inside the wall cavity. You might flood the inside of your house once it gets warmer outside.

##Interior Faucet

It might have the pipes feeding it installed in an exterior wall. With inadequate insulation or inadequate interior temperature, the pipes in the wall will freeze.  The workarounds are twofold:

First, simply keep the water warm enough so that it won't freeze.

1. (what you propose) Keep the water flowing. The incoming city water will have a temperature  about 38-39F. As the water flows in the wall, it will cool down. As long as you keep it flowing fast enough so that the temperature at the faucet is above freezing, the pipes will not freeze - the water inside of them is warm enough not to freeze.

2. Decrease the thermal resistance between the pipe in the wall and the warm inside air. Thus - open the cabinets under the sink and wherever else the pipes run in the exterior wall. Move away any furniture that would keep the pipes in the exterior wall insulated from the interior air.

3. Increase the interior temperature.

Alternatively, drain the pipes from water.

EDIT: Apparently we can't all have good things. Reddit, why did you dumb down markdown so much? 2 days without water is very lucky for you.
Had it happened instead to a cursed jackass, it would probably burst the pipe, and leak water unoticed until the water supply company called the landlord and said that the house had used an obscene amount (1,000 USD) of water, prompting the landlord to show up and discover the swimming pool under the foundation, and sever hundreds of thousands of dollars of potential damage to his property.


...not that this happened to me, because i'm not nearly as fucking ignorant about home maintenance as my Mother. Aggressive  For someone who is Verymean, that was ironically one of the nicest, most apologetic edits I have ever seen. I know... The name doesn't suit me. But that's ok. I can be mean, if I try. And have a cover on it. No one mentions an insulating cover for outside spigots? 

Man it's kind of depressing to see how widespread ignorance of basic home care is. I was looking for this. My dad always had a Styrofoam cover during winter time.  cant believe i had to sift through over half the comments before this came up! Things like this are such common knowledge, its crazytown how  many homeowners are naive as shit THIS, I can't believe no one else has said this it's the easiest/best solution and apparently nobody on the internet has a clue.
 Put an insulated cover over your out door faucet $2.99 Home Depot.  No, no you're fucking not. 

There's nothing worse than waking up in the morning, turning on your faucets, and no water comes out. That's when you pray your lines didn't burst. 

Lesson here kids: If it get's below freezing at night, leave your faucets dripping/running slightly. (Someone once told me if it gets below 28, but 28, 32, not a big difference) How the hell did that happen? Alcoholic ghosts. Casper the friendly drunk.  Boo!.....................ze. I'd assume dripping from the faucet. The water would be in the leaves and soil if it was dripping. It takes time for water to freeze too. Not if it's far enough below freezing outside.  It wouldn't take much time at all. They froze water in a bottle, broke the bottle, then placed the ice under the faucet. Profit. That sweet sweet karma. I'll take a guess. There were warmer days during the lower portion, letting the water spread out more before freezing. Once the temperature dropped the water had less time to spread out before freezing. Also the ice is clear differentiation right at the border of the white siding and the concrete foundation.  Probably during the day the white siding reflects sunlight, melting that portion slightly.  The concrete is less reflective and and will take longer to radiate any absorbed heat.

tl;dr: top part and bottom parts also influenced by thermal/reflective properties of nearby wall. Ding ding ding ding!! Right answer here, please direct your upvotes towards this man OP called it "the ice underneath my faucet", not "the ice formed by my dripping faucet". 

i don't think the faucet is responsible for shaping that ice. 

(also, i would contend that this is in fact a "spigot" rather than a "faucet") I would contend that you are in fact a spigot. Spigot* [this](http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/q_41.html) suggests it's regional but most places agree with you, so i changed it. thanks! Man, Nevada wanted close to nothing to do with this poll. It would be impossible for ice to for like that under the faucet. That's just semantics it WAS formed by the water dripping from the faucet My guess is that it was far enough below freezing outside to the point where the first droplets splashed and froze on the bark below.  As this continued happening, a cone shape began to form and rise towards the faucet.

The neck of the bottle began to form at the height where the droplets stopped splashing and instead just ran down the ice that was already there.  The water froze as it went to form the rounded, clear part near the neck.  This part is so clear because it was slowly layered on by the remnants of each droplet that didn't freeze in the neck.  Once the neck got high enough, there wasn't enough water to continue making the body of the bottle wider, as the entire droplet froze more or less where it first hit the neck, so the neck just continued to grow. That's pretty cool. Is this a pun? I see he hasn't responded to you. Perhaps he's giving you the cold shoulder? What a chill guy OOP THERE IT IS! WHO THE FUCK SAID THAT You should really turn the water off to that from inside the house... Because that ice on the ground, is probably on its way into the pipe as well.  And you should hope you are home when the pipe freezes and bursts.... Source: I'm a plumber. Frozen pipes are awful.  Use it as a dildo butt plug Science-y question here... can the inside of your ass sense cold?

 Well, go be a scientist today...

Report back please. *gulp* So how'd it go? ahem, a *friend* once told me, if you put an icecube in your ass, you will feel it really cold on the outside, but once its inside it doesnt really feel cool anymore. username checks out don't know, never had anything COLD, in my ass Ice ice baby... Calling BS on this. OP froze water in a wine bottle then shattered the bottle leaving the ice mold intact. The indent at the bottom of the ice mold looks suspicisly like the indent at the bottom of a wine bottle.  Isn't that a spigot?  *OR* a dildo that melts away, and with it, all your secrets.  Ehhh..... yeah, I'd take one. Is your house Jesus? I read this in a  Russian accent Nah, no worries everyone. He formed this in his freezer and put it under the faucet on a mild day. Plot twist: OP put a wine bottle down and froze it! Talk about turning water in to wine. Am I right...? Looks like Jesus wasn't the only one to turn water into wine.    So would that be an Ice Wine? You should have a bib over that so it doesn't freeze. You'll end up with frozen pipes dripping or not and then you'll have a really nice insurance claim. if its that cold outside you should shut off your water faucet valve. this will prevent your facet from going to shit or a split pipe. You could probably get that in your butt if you wanted to. It actually looks like a bowling pin. Totally read this in a Russian accent.  That would be a spigot That would be a ["sill cock"](http://i.word.com/idictionary/sill%20cock)  That's some stalagmite shit right there Looks like a Bowling Pin Looks more like a bowling pin What a beautiful horse You have the same siding, mulch and spigot as my parents house........Mom? Dude. You're supposed to shut off the valve to the spigot, drain it, and cover it with one of those things that looks like a fez. When you're an alcoholic, everything looks like a bottle of wine. Spigot My previous comment was a joke, but now that I look at it, it seems more and more likely that there was a wine bottle there, and it shattered after the water collected in it froze. Notice how the turbulent part of the ice begins at a very specific point, and how everything underneath that is smooth. At the very bottom the smoothness breaks, but that can be attributed to some melting at some point or another. We call that a spigot.  Make a bong Water into wine. Has it been mentioned yet? Turn off the supply feed to that spigot otherwise you may get a visit from your friendly neighborhood insurance adjuster(me) after your pipe bursts (on the inside) and your basement/crawlspace floods Anything's a dildo if you're brave enough It's a spigot Make a bong out of it and go ride the alcohol bottle bong karma train on /r/trees So... are people choosing not to talk about how bullshit this is because it's too obvious, or do people really think water somehow formed in the shape of a wine bottle? Leeave faucet dripping into wine bottle, smash wine bottle, clean away shards, take "mildyinteresting" picture and win gold?

Edit :: SPACE It's the perfect murder weapon.

Smash it on someone, and all evidence of you doing it is gone. The weapon would melt and so would the finger prints. Also, your spigot needs to be fixed. I see bowling pin. 

See what I did there. 

Icy bowling pin.  Maybe because it was a wine bottle filled with water that got carefully broken after getting frozen?  If water is in the pipe, it could freeze inside the house and burst causing flooding.  You should buy a cover like this for that faucet: http://shconline-com.3dcartstores.com/Outdr-Faucet-Cover_p_1303508.html.  This looks like an old faucet so you may not be able to turn off the water supply to that faucet inside the house. You know you can get foam insulators for like 2 bucks instead of letting it drip like an old lady wine bottle ...
yea, sure... Exactly. How would the drainage just magically form a structure that looks like a bottle. It would look more like an ice pile on the ground instead of a bottle.

OP is a fag that's one....

 Looks like a recent vintage. Bowling pin This must be Jesus Christ's house Water into wine . . . . . bottle . . . . .  jesus you know what to do
 That's how you make ice wine. So here's what you do. 

Take the ice block by the handle, kill someone with it, let it melt, investigators will not be able to find the weapon, get away with murder, find this easy to do, so you become the ice serial killer crafting specialty weapons out of ice. I would make sure the media calls you subzero if they ever find out you are a serial killer that uses ice. I've never wanted to take something and smash it up against another something so badly before.  How on earth has that small faucet been able to squeeze that wine bottle out. This is why you shouldn't flush your empty bottles down the toilet. You just took that photo in Invercargill six months ago and posted it when more people would understand it. It's not a wine bottle (   ) It must have become colder, so the neck froze faster to become thinner?

Except I'm pretty sure /u/takeitatanangle meant punching the roll, not the person who unrolls it. I would be satisfied by chucking it at a foe I just realized that I have no idea of how snow behaves.  As a Florida native, I agree. This just about blew my mind.  **These "snow rollers" naturally occur!**  I moved to and had my first winter in Ohio last year, after living in southern states for many years.  In January I think, for a week or two, these things were everywhere in fields and other open areas.  It was crazy-looking.

I'm not lying or exaggerating -- [Look it up](http://www.ohio.com/polopoly_fs/1.462231.1390880874!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_500/roller28-03.jpg).  With just the right snow and wind, you get conditions that make it look like tons of kids starting rolling snowmen, and stopped at the first ball (roll).  Apparently it's a rare phenomenon, and I was disappointed my children were too young to really appreciate or remember it.  But it was one of the coolest weather-related phenomenon I've ever seen. As a Midwesterner, this doesn't surprise me. Snow actually has a tendency to stick together. It's nothing like powder or pixie dust.  Depends on how far up north you are I suppose. Here in Thunder Bay, it's all powdery. I've only ever seen the sticky stuff towards the beginning and end of the season. It's powdery depending on the temperature.  Humidity and moisture Humidity. Temperature has very little to do with it. The humidity determines how the crystals form from the seed, and the shape of the crystals determines how much they stick together, in combination with ambient humidity. You really can't do that with snow most of the time. You'd need just the right conditions when it was falling. Like a... perfect storm. I've spent all of my winters in snowy climes and I'm confused by this. The only way snow sticks together is if it's wet/packing snow. Its a bitch to drive in as it basically creates a slick streak of ice under the tires. Powdery snow doesn't stick together, and will blow away easily. 

At home, we call it Snowman Snow, cause its the only type of snow that will make snowmen.  To do something like that (or even build good snowballs) the snow is a little bit wet. It's  a little bit "crunchy." It sticks together really nice :) Theres fluffier, flakier snow, which doesn't stick together.  Australian here, I've never seen real snow... How does it do these things?! Does it even science? 
Tomorrow's ELI5 Haskoli island? The photo is taken there, yes :) Yay slendingur! Sll vertu! Looks like bubble tape after you take it out of the container.

These never lasted long for me. I'm almost 40 years old and I still chew that shit. I LOVE that shit. For some reason I thought u/LivEisJeebus was referring to bubble wrap at first. The thought of you maniacally chewing on a roll of it was quite amusing to me.   It's like the PopRocks of packing material. Are u a lefty by any chance. Only because a person who is a righty would have started at the spot where u took the picture  If I tried to do that, it would have definitely fallen into the water halfway through, and I'd be so mad As someone who has live in Florida my whole life and had very little exposure to snow, I really look at this and think, "what the fuck?" Don't worry, I live in New York and feel the same way. This happened naturally all the time last winter in the midwest and northeast US, for some reason. They're called [snow rollers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_roller), apparently. It was weird seeing them all over the place, because I've lived in snowy areas all my life and hadn't seen them before. #####&amp;#009;

&gt;

&gt;A __snow roller__ is a rare [meteorological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorological) phenomenon in which large [snowballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball) are formed naturally as chunks of [snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow) are blown along the ground by [wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind), picking up material along the way, in much the same way that the large snowballs used in [snowmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowmen) are made.

&gt;Unlike snowballs made by people, snow rollers are typically [cylindrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical) in shape, and are often hollow since the inner layers, which are the first layers to form, are weak and thin compared to the outer layers and can easily be blown away, leaving what looks like a [doughnut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut) or [Swiss roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_roll). Snow rollers have been seen to grow as large as two feet in diameter.

&gt;The following conditions are needed for snow rollers to form:

&gt;


&gt;* There must be a relatively thin surface layer of wet, loose snow, with a temperature near the [melting point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point) of ice

&gt;* Under this thin layer of wet snow there must be a substrate to which the thin surface layer of wet snow will not stick, such as ice or powder snow

&gt;* The wind must be strong enough to move the snow rollers, but not strong enough to blow them apart.

&gt;* Alternatively, gravity can move the snow rollers as when a snowball, such as those that will fall from a tree or cliff, lands on a steep hill and begins to roll down the hill.

&gt;Because of this last condition, snow rollers are more common in hilly areas. However, the precise nature of the conditions required makes them a very rare phenomenon.

Same way you build a snowman I'm guessing. Start at one end and start rolling it, if the snow is sticky enough it will start building up. but how... how does it look so perfect? definitely satisfying. idk why though. It really is.  Everything about it is just perfect.  I think I've achieved inner peace. Next week someone will retitle it, "look what the wind did to this snow!"

*Asshole.* 

Edit: I can't spell. are you jesus THAT IS NOT SATISFYING

I NEED YOU TO KNOCK IT OFF THE FENCE PLEASE How do you do that? The snow needs to be the right texture, likely closer to freezing when it fell or just starting to melt. *Dude*, it's rolled the wrong way.

My girlfriend would be *pissed*. Nah, you have to put it in like that, otherwise the cat would unroll it.  Well done! Cool! Now finish the job. This is why the internet exists. God bless.

 I love watching when they do this. It happens on mountains with snow, as the wind blows a bit of snow falls. If it is the right angle, the snowball effect will happen and you get this giant circles of snow everywhere. Are you in a Russian city? 100 bits /u/changetip

 Yes, but does it unroll? I would totally lose it if it did. Florida guy here. I don't understand how this is physically possible. I though snow was just a powdery substance, like flour.

My dad was working in an old bell tower when he discovered a note made in 1928 by an apprentice carpenter, simply saying "Its cold as hell up here". I went through a few pages of your comment history. You really never use the letter 'f'. I went through it too. I kept reading words in my head that make an f noise and got excited. Then I got disappointed when it was a 'ph' or a number.  Sorry. May I ask, why do you hate such letter? Several reasons.

Primarily, it's not a real letter, it's just a disabled E, that someone threw into the alphabet because they got lazy. 

Also, in handwriting, this letter plagued me throughout my school years. I cannot write it, and i am not even sure there is a correct way to write it.

And lastly, the phonetic sound it makes is horrible. It sounds like a disabled person trying to have sex with a mailbox. Part of me wishes your actual name is something like Frank Fafferstein or something like that.  I like you. You're a dedicated son o' a bitch. You leave their mother out of this! I have a similar complaint about the letter "c", though I am not as dedicated as you as to abstain from its use. "C" makes a grand total of two sounds, both of which are already taken by two other letters. "Ch" should be its own damn letter, and "SCH" is bullshit.  And what about "ck"? that's just messed up!

They complained they weren't paid... I was doing some electrical work in my office building that had been around for a very long time. I popped open one of the older electrical panel boxes and noticed that for one of them it was labeled "security laser turrets". This was a box that dated back to at least the 1970s, probably earlier. Thought it was kinda cool that I was probably one of the first people to see that in a very long time.

Similarly back in the 90s I worked in a university datacenter. I left a couple notes under the raised floor tiles. I imagine someday someone will find one of them. I was doing some wiring in the building that required me to go above the drop ceilings and I left a note or two scribbled up there too.

&gt;Hey, I'm a niece of Niel's and the sister of the nephew /u/tougemonster spoke about in the post above (my brother can verify via FB). He decided to get me to post instead of him probably because I'm already on Reddit (but I'm currently using a throwaway).
&gt;
&gt;He wanted me to say:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks /u/tougemonster for tracking down my Aunt and her children. It is a very kind gesture that is much appreciated. Neil built the house that you live in in the late 1980s. I understand that he and his family lived in it as the children (my cousins) grew up until just a few years ago.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;We have let my Aunt know, who remembered this being written, and was pleased to hear about it. Thanks for doing this - a great example of the power of the internet and Reddit!
 Wow, that's, strangely moving.

OP...leave that writing there.  Go down a tile and write you and your family's own names and the date.  Then re-tile or carpet or whatever you are going to do.  Someday, another family will likely find it and maybe they'll add their own names in another spot.  This is like a time capsule of sorts, but one that only gets found by accident.

You've created a unbroken line of love that has followed this little house of yours for almost three decades, and likely will continue for many decades more.   You can't buy that sort of thing, not for all the money in the world.  I envy you. Great idea, I will do that!

I have found the others on this list on FB and have sent them the picture. I hope when they see it that it will be a good memory for them. I'd love to hear about their reaction. I haven't had any reply yet. Will update when I hear anything.

EDIT: Still no luck, I'm now trying some of the relatives who appear more active on FB. Strangely enough I have mutual friends with one of them.

I've also learned a good friend of mine went to scouts with Wade as a kid, but still no closer to contacting them.


EDIT 2: I have a lead with one of the relatives who is putting me in contact with them!

EDIT 3: I have had a conversation with the nephew of Neil. It seems that Neil may have built this house from scratch with his family. He is going to pass the picture onto the immediate family, he predicts it will be very much appreciated. I also shared this thread with him, he will comment in here later, which I will link in a comment further up.

EDIT 4: A message from the nephew:
"Thanks for passing this on. I spoke with my Dad who confirmed that this is the house that Neil built. My dad will speak with Glenys tonight. I will post on Reddit tomorrow once I have heard back from him."

EDIT 5: The image has made its way to the family. See [post further up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/2r9iyw/found_a_message_while_removing_our_cork_floor/cndqzca) FB will often send messages from unknown people to an "other" inbox and not notify the receiver. You may have better luck if you send them a friend request. (FB is moronic at times, as we all know) You can pay a dollar or two to force it to their regular inbox. Fuck... That.  For $7, you can file a complaint with a supervisor.

Thank you for choosing Comcast. I think the logic is that spammers aren't going to pay for the feature.  .. really? For $100 you can send a message to Zuckaberg's inbox. Strange feature but it's there.  For $1000 dollars I'll make an account and you can be my friend, $1000 more you can call me Al and I can called you Betty.  When my mom first got facebook a couple years back, she sent Zuckerburg a message suggesting ways to improve facebook and her account was banned for 24 hours. Is that sarcasm or for serious Serious, at least they were doing it in the past anyway, I don't personally know of they still offer it. The justification for it was that $1 makes it unaffordable for spammers, but gives people a way to send a message to non-friends that they will actually be alerted to.  Unless they have the messaging app and OP used it to send the messages. For some reason, those are automatically sent to the standard inbox.  whoa..didn't know that. I was wondering why I never get messages. I checked the "other" folder and to my surprise...it was also empty. You know, because of this, I checked my other inbox and found a message from my half sister who I never met which she sent me 18 months ago.... So that was weird. 

TIL my half sister wants a relationship with me.  Whoa, same exact thing happened to me. I only saw her message once I added her as a friend months later.  You can alert them for free too (although creepy). Join a group that they are in and you will be able to tag them in a post. Alright, nice find! You can't tag until you've interacted. They keep changing the "rules" of communication.  I found a guy's wallet once. He had a pretty unique sounding name so I looked him up and found his Facebook account. Photos that were publicly available matched. So I sent him a message. Knowing that it would probably go to the other folder I sent him a friend request. Never heard anything back. You know if I lost my wallet the first thing I'd do is look out for unknown people friending me. Oh well, his loss.

Oh I should say, I held onto the wallet for a few weeks hoping I'd hear something. In the end I just mailed it to the address on his driver's license. Though by that point I imagine he got all new cards and stuff. But at least he has piece of mind. I did that once before too.  It was a little boy's wallet that had $80 stuffed in it.  His family ate in the restaurant I was working in before they boarded a flight home.  The boy seemed pretty thrilled he still had cash leftover from their vacation and he was playing with his wallet the whole time they were there.

 At the end of the night one of my co-workers found the wallet while cleaning up.  I chatted with them throughout their meal and they told me they were headed back to Pennsylvania, so I found the credit card slip from their meal and found his mom's Facebook page.  I sent her a message and didn't hear back for a few days but they did eventually call me.  

I sent back the wallet and a few weeks later I got a thank you card from the mom and the kid.  The kid drew me a picture and a five dollar bill for returning it.  They were very appreciative of me tracking them down.  

On the flip side of things, last night while driving a cab, some drunk lady left an original iPhone with a screen cracked to an almost unusable.  She called it at midnight and I let her know that I had it and I'd return it as soon as possible, but I was getting ready to take a new fare.  I got back to her neighborhood in a little under an hour and she was on the phone with the police reporting me.  I was being nice going out of my way on a Friday night near bar close, my money making time, to return a phone with almost zero monetary value.  Needless to say I did not get a cheerful drawing or five dollars out of it.
 Omg..she probably had to update her instagram you ass!   Why not just mail it immediately?  I don't know about you, but my driver's license is two addresses out of date. They only forward mail for so long.

Edit: Since no one can read the goddamn thread before leaving the same comment, whether this is illegal varies from state to state, because *literally all driving laws are state laws.*

In my state, it's perfectly legal to have an outdated address on your license. Check your local DMV. Might not still live there. I move around a lot, so the address on my id very very rarely reflects my current physical location. I found it in San Francisco. The address was in a suburb of Los Angeles. I was hoping I could give it to him in person. He looked youngish so I figured the address was his parents' place and he had recently moved to SF. Maybe he was just visiting. Oh well, shoulda accepted my friend request. Well, I dunno about living with only a piece of my mind. Damnit. Leaving it so the world knows I'm an idiot. Missed out on winning an all expenses paid trip to see a DJ in another country because of that stupid inbox. When I discovered it and went through I found a message in there from a promoter sent three months earlier saying 'Can you confirm you're free on XX, if so send us your details cause you've won'. I assume cause I didn't reply they gave it away to someone else!! My favorite is this one. I saw it months after it was originally sent. Not even sure what game it was in reference to: 

"Sweetheart, you have attacked a lot yesterday. For what, I do not know. I am a pretty powerful player. But my clan is very powerful. You lost all the attacks and I did not hit you back. But, I did go in and ice your Godmother. I am a nice guy, a retired Vietnam Veteran. I will accept you friend request if you send it, and we can be friends. I am a much better friend than foe. I have little doubt I could ice your entire clan. I am just not that kind of guy. Have a good day and God Bless."

...because apparently whatever game I wasn't a "very powerful player" in was this guy's life blood. Ha!  It was Farmville. He was threatening to freeze your crops over.  You just made me feel a whole lot better about that girl that never responded to me. Keeping my hopes up As long as this wasn't you I cannot verify you've been ignored: 

"Hope you're not offended? but you are a beautiful lady! Your profile interests me. I seek a serious relationship. Write if you'd like to know more about me ... hope to hear from you soon
Warm regards!!
Henry" I did this a few years ago when I found a note behind the medicine cabinet in the wall.  Found the family on FB, showed the pic and basically got a "cool story bro" from them.  Was very underwhelming. Unless it's a memory of their dad yelling at them nonstop for the house they had to build. Great. Now whoever moves to your house can search for your obituary and tell us about it. Good guy OP!  I'm going to rip apart all my future tiles. We do that with our house. Every house on our estate had a bespoke yorkshire stone floor to ceiling fireplace, and little did we know when it was pulled down (by my evil parents who didn't like the awesome fireplace) the past owners left writing there of the first stone to be laid. Wow for some reason this comment made my eyes well up with tears. Nicely said.  Did you see /u/mont2702 responded and said that he knew Neil and would pass this on? 
Not sure if it's for real or not but I thought I would point it out as it looks like it's been buried  f Your house is haunted, if shit starts moving around he's probably vengeful about you removing that cork tile. Ghosts don't like it when you remodel. This has made me happy/sad - Neil and I worked together for several years and he was indeed one of natures gentlemen.  His passing was a genuine loss to not only his family but to his many friends and work colleagues.  A good man in a world where there are few, I am surprised and pleased that he has made it to the front page of reddit no less.

Edit:  I will pass it onto his family of course via work.

Edit 2:  I forgot how cynical the internet can be!  :o)  Yes, I knew Neil very well through his work with the Queensland Police Service and have just now spoken with his former OIC who will ensure his family are made aware of his new found internet fame.  They will see this, rest assured. Please do pass this on and let me know how you go.

RE - EDIT 2: fantastic, thanks. It's looking like they're going to hear about it from quite a few people. :) Well that is nice to know that at least one of his children grew up, fell in love, got married, and had a family of their own.

He was a father when he laid the tile down, but he was a grand father when he laid to rest. [I did not ask for these feels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2HPep6ZRGk) He's laying cork in heaven now. He had the most excellent handwriting. This is really sad :(

At first I thought it was a message from OP's father This is like watching a movie then finding out the main actor is dead. Really depresses me.  Bit like how I felt watching Ghostbusters yesterday

R.I.P.Harold Ramis :( Grandparents live around that area and knew everyone, i wonder if i could get a bit of info off them. 2 years ago* I bet you his kids would love to see this My birthday!!!??? This cork tile floor and I were born together..more than mildly interesting for me. Thanks OP. And thanks for ripping it up and letting me win. Haha, how bout that.

Birthday bros! It was my 16th birthday, I think I got money for Bon Jovi tickets. 
 I was also born on this day with the cork tile floor! cheers! Count me in for March 27th as well...though I just turned 4 when this tile was laid down. We have the same birthday. How about that? :) March 27th baby here! Except I was still in my dad the time this was done.  Do you ever feel bad tearing up stuff the previous owner probably worked hard to put in?  Sometimes I do, even though it's my house now and that fence looked absolutely awful... I'd feel some guilt/regret for ripping that specific cork tile, especially seeing that it ripped while being removed.

I get too sentimental to things, specifically things that have a history or were a gift. Until I can't remember who/what it symbolizes I can't throw it out. Atleast I have my hoarding instinct in check that I can throw it away if i admit I can't remember. [This commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBqhIVyfsRg) might be for you then. I was wondering where they were going with that, wasn't disappointed. Also applies to new girlfriends. HEYOO *OOYEH* If its slightly shitty tile or something, sure, but man is corkboard ugly as sin. 

I have actually volunteered to help friends tear out wallpaper, that shit is always ugly. Fuck you, every past home owner, for thinking that was an acceptable choice. Helped a friend remove three layers of wallpaper, each more hideous than the last. 

Now he has nice white painted walls. My last place had the most horrible poorly hung dark red wallpaper. God I wish I could have torn that off but it was a rental.  [deleted] I was helping my mother paint when she said she was going to write something scary I turned around and she'd written in drippy red letters "REDROOM" I informed her it was redrum and she said she knew but didn't want anyone in the future to get scared. When we were done in a certain light you could see the writing. 51034 REDRUM UOY ROF ERA EW REDRUM 51034 Great idea  That's honestly so cool. Makes me wonder if there's anything like that in my old ass house.

Be right back, tearing my floor apart find out. I always leave notes on pieces of card board or drywall behind peoples walls usually write the date and my take on a current event, a fear, something about the job, anything I think would be interesting to find really. I can remember being about 8 and my mum was re-wallpapering our hallway.
I was allowed to draw all over the walls before the new paper was put up. This was great fun.
Trouble was, I had for some reason just learnt what a swastika looked like and I enjoyed drawing them. I covered the walls in swastikas of varying sizes.
I'd love to see the looks on the faces of whoever has that house now when they redecorate. forgive me.... but... cork tile? It was the 80's everything was corkboard.  [Also dogs love corkboard and this was obviously a family of dogs based on the names.](http://corkology.com/images/dogbone_bulletin_boards.jpg)   I like to think that the dog wrote those lists himself, and that sammy is his owner.  Hey, we have a cork floor and its warm as fuck and soft. Love walking barefoot in my home when its -25 C outside. It's antimicrobial, mildew resistant and doesn't get cold like stone tile. Actually pretty ideal for bathrooms. It's finished on top like hardwood or laminate, not like the corkboard at school. One of my neighbors has cork flooring in the communal areas of his house, and it actually looks quite nice.  Looks quite similar to [this](http://img2-1.timeinc.net/toh/i/steps/cork-floor-toutX.jpg). yeah my mum loves cork. You can get some really good looking stuff.

Pro, basically what misslovey said and that it's soft, so feels nice on feet and dropping glass etc is much more forgiving.

Con - it's soft. It does mark pretty easily.

Not outrageously, but I wouldn't walk around in high heels on it. (mainly cause I'm a guy and don't really drag out that much, but also because it marks) [deleted] well, I'm pretty sure she doesn't soak the cork. It comes ready to go. I guess if it needs to be soaked, it's been soaked before my mum takes it.

I just know she loves the feel of cork is all.

She loves it inside the kitchen. Loves it in the bathroom. Anywhere she can put cork, she will.

She's a cork fiend. my parents just lined the entire first floor of their country house in cork, and it looks and feels amazing. first winter I haven't needed slippers. 

that said, it is like one none stop continuous thing, not squaerd tiles, and looks more like wood than the corky stuff in these pictures. the surface feels somewhere between linoleum and hardwood. Sure, it's great. I'm sitting in it right now (well, in a chair above it), and I've had it for years. Helps that I live in the world's first cork producer, and stuff's cheap here.

It never gets too hot, it never gets too cold. It is very easy to wash, and you can walk barefoot in it without any worry.
 I'd love to see this reach the front page and find out that Nicole or Wade are redditors.   [Would you settle for a co-worker of the father, who's dead now?](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/2r9iyw/found_a_message_while_removing_our_cork_floor/cne0hw6) it's on the front page now! is there a specific sub for this kinda stuff?? This one? 

This is very mildly interesting. 

There might be an /r/messagesfromoldhomeownersunderdrywallandflooring but it probably has two subscribers and one post.  The problem (although I hesitate to call it a problem) is that this sub continually produces *very interesting* content and posts like this one are often swept beneath the rug as they're not *quite* interesting enough to live up to the standard that is now set.

It's not necessarily a bad thing, but I miss the days when you'd visit the sub and be greeted by a barrage of mildly interesting things. 

Although you know what? Looking at the front page of /r/mildlyinteresting it seems I'm wrong, and the things there aren't as interesting as I am making them out to be. You should therefore disregard almost this entire message. /r/corkfloors  My first thought was, "Wow.  Cork flooring lasts longer than I thought it would."  My second thought was, "Maybe the floor you're removing isn't the first but the second...or fourth."   That stuff lasts forever. 
The floor in my old bedroom at my parents house. Has been there since 1979. And it's still looking as ugly as the day it was put in. 
I have to say it is really nice and warm on your feet when you wake up in the morning.  My living room's cork floor has lasted 15-20 years, no maintenance. Still waterproof and everything. 

Apparently you're meant to resurface it every four years of something, we just... haven't needed to. I have this feeling a LOT of people are going to be calling around looking for cork floors on Monday... When I redo my floors I'm going to make things easier by writing sumthin like '__dilligaf__ was here. Please post to Reddit and remind my kids about the time I had to hire a contractor because they were too busy to help with renos'. It'll probably be the closest I come to making Front Page.  "1/3/2015

Ayy lmao

[dickbutt drawing]

-MrLamar3"

I'd be able to cash in on so much karma in 26 years. Are you sure reddit still exists in 2040?

I mean, every place people might have thought to post it in 1988 is probably gone by now. Or at least almost nobody still reads it. "This will be awesome on Compuserve!" Yeah, the internet is fickle.  Before Reddit there was Digg; this whole community news aggregation will likely evolve into something totally different in the next 30 years.  Awesome - I've decided I'm going to do something similar...  But mark a spot with red dye and then paint a body outline.   Oh, the possibilities...... When we were moving out of our last house it was being remodeled to sell. Behind our bathroom medicine cabinet the last owners had written their name and birth date (they both died) so I added the date they died. I also added the date hubby, son and I lived there and moved out. I realized later, moved out date might be taken as date we died. Now it looks like every owner of that house has died (the old man that bought it is keeping it empty for now, so more than likely..whoever ends up with the house won't know about us)

edit: clarification. the reason I knew the past owners died was because I lived next door to them as a kid and my family was friends with them and inherited the house.

edit2: I considered writing something creepy/scary :P Is there a subreddit for stuff like this? With dates, from the past? Carvings on trees, cement, writing on grounds ect? There needs to be one. seconding My brother did something similar, but instead it stood:

"To lay this floor it demanded:

* 120 cans of Beer.
* 5 Litres of booze.
* 2 Floors.

On the *date*." I once remodeled some cabins at a really old summer camp. When we pulled down the old wall paneling we found hundreds of children's signatures dating back to the 1940s. that's really cool. Hopefully you can find them and show them this picture.  the man is dead :( but his old co-worker showed up in the thread and is going to tell the rest of his family about it [Did you soak the cork first?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deqx-Xb-yHY) Man, the penmanship on that 2 That's my birthday! /r/mildlyinteresting When I was growing up and my family was decorating we would stand against the wall and draw a pencil outline round ourselves on the plaster then sign and date it. It looked like a vertical crime scene. There was a story posted last fall of a boston man who did something similar

Except instead of a sentimental message he told the person on ripping up the floorboards to "go Fuck yourself"

http://www.boston.com/real-estate/news/2014/09/03/charlestown-threshold-scribbler-revealed-albert-stella-remembered-son/9nVfCoo7OOULS7z2huRisM/story.html I WAS BORN ON A SUNDAY TIL! Under our wood floor it says "WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU TEARING UP THIS NICE FLOORING?! THIS COST ME A FUCKING FORTUNE?" courtesy of my dad. My dad put cork tiles through our whole house in the 90's. He has a habit of making things un-doable and has said if we want to change them to just go over the top. 

I hope the Barkers did a crappy job for your sake!  Was it also the first one removed? Looks like it I feel for the person that tears up the flooring we put in our first house. There are chalk body outlines of the entire family, including the dogs. I've left a note or two in a house.  The one I'm most eager about somebody finding was a *really* awkward piece of flooring I put in, it says "Fuck this piece was hard! [company name and my signature, 2013]"

Once we had a customer get into it and we scratched a "help us plea" into a basement wall and sprayed red dye on it before framing/finishing. TIL cork floor tiles are a thing Holy shit that is my birthday! His kids are my age. That's so cool. I would love to receive something from my past like that.   OP - write a new message alongside the old one. keep the tradition goin Very cool.  
The house I grew up in was 120+ years old and had a similar written time capsule - the last several occupants of my bedroom wrote a message in pencil inside the bedroom closet.  They wrote their names and years they occupied the room.  
My sister and I both grew up in the room and I added our names to the list before my mom moved out in 2005.  We painted the room and closet before moving and kept that part uncovered.  Wish I had taken a picture of it.
