And a triple-click to shuffle.\n\n2. Another feature should be detecting a secondary audio stream from chrome and then muting itself respectively. Obviously I do not want it detect an audio stream outside chrome as I can see this maybe hell to implement. i.e I have Streamus running and then suddenly I want to watch a youtube video, streamus will pause itself. Then maybe un-pause itself when I stop/pause the youtube video. (This feature should be toggle-able.)\n\nAgain, I lack the time and the know-how to create this. These are just some ideas that someone with more skill can tackle ;). I feel like these are some reasonable/useful features.\n\nEdit: After reading over it seems like I am saying, 'I want this! Someone spend their time and energy for me!. Please believe me when I say that, I feel like these suggestions would be useful for everyone.", "gilded": 0, "score": 4, "created": 1421708040.0},{"body": "Dude you should apply to Google.

I use it every day at work and at home. The recent design change looks good. I love the keyboard shortcuts, it makes it so much more useful/convenient. \n\nOne problem I have a lot is that I can't think of any music to listen to. It would be great if you added something that would let you see suggestions or recommendations or what is popular. This could work well as the default when you click the search icon, since it is now just a blank space. Otherwise I have to go back to Pandora or Songza when I can't think of anything. I guess I'm just saying I wish there were a better way to explore new songs.\n\nAnother thing that could be improved is when I remove the current song from the stream, it will often appear again right a way or after a couple. I would prefer that the song didn't come back again, since I already removed it once. \n\nOne last thing I can think of is that sometime I don't like the songs that come up in radio mode. Maybe if the search area (or similar) would show a list of songs that will come up and I can remove them before they start playing. Or similarly if I could tell it to add x number of songs to the list (without have to skip through them all manually and then going back) and then edit the list beforehand, instead of on a song by song basis.

Here's the story of how I met Billy, my ultimate idol, and thereafter learned he is a bit of a douche. I doubt Billy will remember, but if he could he would corroborate. It's a few days before Machina drops, and I skip class to wait in line at the Miami Beach Speck's (record store) where the Pumpkins are doing a free show for the first 100 or so people. Show is scheduled for 1pm or so, and I am in line at 5am. I sit on the floor with a couple of other people just me, my blanket and a guitar.for the next five hours or so, I play all of Siamese Dream, most of Mellon Collie and some other favorites, like Starla (acoustic, no less). By the time several hundred people are there, we have quite a show going on, and I'm getting everybody in the mood to hear the real thing.  I wasn't just a Pumpkins fan, I was an absolute fanatic. Siamese Dream spoke to me like no other music has and to tell the truth, like no other music has since.  There's lots in there for a 15-year old kid, and Billy Corgan was my Hero. \n&gt; \n&gt; The show begins and it's quite intimate. Audience sits on the floor of the record store and Billy, James Iha and some other dude (or girl? Not D'arcy) on the bass stand on the floor about three feet in front of us. All acoustic. They play about 45 minutes and I am in complete earphoria. Then Billy says \"let's play Pumpkins trivia! Who here knows how to play guitar?\" Tons of people throw their hands up. I stick up my hand holding my guitar pick (emblazoned with the SP heart that I hand carved and painted). Billy picks two girls and me. We stand up and walk a few feet to where he is and I lean over to him and say, \"my lifelong dream is to play Mayonaise with you.\" He looks at me, gives a mean chuckle and says \"yeah, like that's ever gonna happen.\" Nasty. I look a little shocked at how callous he was (not that I really expected him to say, \"let's do it!\"). I look at James and he shrugs his shoulders as if to say \"I feel you...sorry dude...\" \n&gt; \n&gt; Pumpkins Trivia begins. Billy asks blonde bimbo #1: \"what city are we in?\"...\"Miami?\" \"Alright, she gets one point!\" To Girl 2: \"what's your name?\" ... \"Jessica...\" (Or something similar) \"Ok, you get one point!\" To me: \"what was the name of my first band and why?\" I respond: \"the Marked because both you and the guy you formed the group with have birth marks.\" \"Ok, one point for you...\" now to Bimbo 1, \"who's your favorite band?\"....to girl 2: \"do you have a boyfriend?\" To me: \"when's my birthday?\" I knew it was sometime around St. Patrick's day, so I said that.  \"Nope. That's not a day. Thanks for playing! And then he turns to the pretty bimbo blonde and says \"do you play guitar?\" She shrugs and says \"I dunno...\" \"Well, do you want to learn?\" \"Ok...\" And he then gives her the guitar he played the show with. The band members sign it, but for some reason when James goes to sign it he puts his hand in his chest to stop him. It's pretty clear to everyone there that Billy just behaved like an ass, particularly to everyone that sang along to our many hours of pumpkins prior to the show. \n&gt; \n&gt; Then James does a classy thing, he goes over to Billy and says \"can I give him my amp pedal?\" Billy just looks away without answering. James Iha then gives me his green pedal and a bunch of SP guitar picks, and as he's doing it, he says in a hushed tone, \"sorry, dude...\"\n&gt; \n&gt; I left the show a bid sad but it wasn't until I was walking to the bus stop when one of the dads that was there with his kid told me that he went after the show to have his copy of the cd signed, and told Billy \"hey, that kid was out there with his guitar playing your songs all day--he's a true fan, you did him wrong, man.\" Billy responded \"yeah, well, we can't all be winners.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; I later found out the blonde that got the guitar didn't even like the band. She was just there with a friend. I also found out that she pawned the guitar pretty shortly after the show. \n&gt; \n&gt; Throughout the years, I mused over this story and realized that it's a sad day when you meet your hero. I mean, James was so beaten down he couldn't even give me his own amp pedal!! He had to ask Billy for permission! The whole \"Pumpkins Trivia\" thing was already pretty egocentric. But the fact that he brushed off a true fan in such a dismissive manner in favor of an underage blonde girl pissed me off quite a bit. \n&gt; \n&gt; Then I heard him on Howard Stern (this morning and previously), and you can tell he's still pretty much a dick and sees making music as a business. On Howard Stern today he said in no uncertain terms that making music is a business first and other bands are competition. Billy's idol was Kurt Cobain. I like the irony that his idol broke his heart by taking his girlfriend (Courtney Love). \n&gt; \n&gt; Now, I just enjoy the music (little of which is any good since Mellon Collie) and will likely take a look at the new album. However, I no longer look up to the dude and instead rather pity him. Still clinging to the band name, when the name is all that is left of the group.

I had never been so excited for a show, even though I had moved past pop punk and gotten more into Harcore/Metal.  As they started, I immediately realized it seemed a bit off.

I went to the record store with my aunt in Fall of 1999 and managed to buy *Enema of the State* with my allowance money when she was off looking at Spice Girl records with my girl cousin. I grabbed it from the cashier and shoved it down in my shirt, tucked my long sleeve shirt in and put my hands into my hooded sweatshirt pouch to keep it from flopping around. My mom wouldn't have let me listen to it if she saw the Parental Advisory Warning and definitely not since a porn star was on the album cover. I listened to that album over and over again and it meant more to me throughout my teen years than any other album or music that I had owned and/or heard along with their eponymous album from 2003. Those two albums in particular along with *The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show* were the soundtracks to my childhood. \n\nEverything about the band and their music was in tune with my childhood. My friends and I were all into the Tony Hawk video games and that got us into skateboarding and dressing like skateboarders sort of like Blink would.

My friends and I used to tag up our binders, lockers, and bathroom stalls with all sorts of shit but always were sure to tag them with *Blink-182* with pens or whiteout pens. We used to have sleepovers and listen to *Enema of the State* over and over until it was around midnight and then we would watch music videos on MTV and would always catch Blink videos because they were always in rotation. We all were naturally curious about girls at the time and so we sought out movies like American Pie where Blink had a cameo during [that scene where Nadia goes over Jim's and his buddies are relaying her stripping on webcam to the whole school while Blink's song Mutt plays over the scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRZOlJBaUAY) That scene and those days with my friends were about as \"Blink\" as it could get, really.

Three stages of a separation.\n \n**Stage 1: The Shrine**\n \n*\"Sunlight over me no matter what I do  \nApples in the Summer are golden sweet\"*\n \nImmediately after the separation, he is determined to be happy. Apples seem to represent the concept of love; the love he shared with her was sweet, but he must now go through his days without her love. The apples are not gone, however. They are simply no longer shared with her or anyone else.\n \n*\"I'm not one to ever pray for mercy  \nOr to wish on pennies in the fountain or the shrine\"*\n\n*\"And I wonder what became of you  \n What became of you\u201d*\n\nHe wishes to be happy, yet he still occasionally places pennies on the shrine. By placing pennies on her shrine, he sometimes wonders what became of her life, although they are now lives apart.\n \n**Stage 2: The Argument**\n \n*\"In the morning waking up to terrible sunlight\n When you talk you hardly even look in my eyes\n In the morning, in the morning\u201d*\n \n*\"In the doorway holding every letter that I wrote\n in the driveway pulling away putting on your coat\u201d*\n \nThe song picks up the tempo and practically blows up, expressing his frustration and anger.\nHe presents imagery of what he is going through; memories of the argument. The painful mornings he deals with every morning of every day the moment he wakes up, a sentiment very relatable and personal to me. The mornings truly are the most miserable times of the day while in grief. He then presents very direct and powerful imagery by recalling moments of the argument and her departure.\n \n*\"in the ocean washing off my name from your throat  \n in the morning, in the morning\u201d*\n \nIn anger, he wishes her memory wiped from his, and his memory wiped from hers.\n \n**Stage 3: The Aftermath**\n \nIt isn\u2019t officially called The Aftermath, but it seems fitting to me.\n \nThe song quiets down immediately. The guitar plays while some ambient noise soothes the listener. Only, it isn't just ambient noise. It sounds, to me, like clay/ceramics/stones sliding against each other, almost as if falling apart. The Shrine, I believe. The perfect image he had of her, along with the thoughts fueled by emotions of anger and mourning are crumbling. I might be reading too much into this, but I think it was intentional.\n \n*\"Green apples hang from my green apple tree  \n They belong only to, only to me\n \nAnd if i just stay awhile here staring at the sea  \nAnd the waves break ever closer, ever near to me  \nI will lay down in the sand and let the ocean lead  \nCarry me to Innisfree like pollen on the breeze\u201d*\n \nHe feels a little lonely. He has his green apples, and he enjoys them, but he has no one to share them with.\nRegardless, he does not long for a relationship. He now seems strangely content. Now he only longs for the ocean's waves to wash over him and carry him where they shall.\n \nHe wishes to be carried to Innisfree, where he can live a life of leisure free of his worries.\n \nInnisfree is a fictional location in the poem Lake Isle of Innisfree by William Butler Yeats. In the poem, the speaker longs for a fictional utopia on the island of Innisfree, where he can escape his urban life and return to nature by growing beans and caring for beehives. \nInnisfree, to me, embodies all of our longings, our desires, what and where we aspire to be.\n \nAnyway, that's my two bits.", "gilded": 0, "score": 25, "created": 1422828016.0},{"body": "I was just going to say it's an awesome song but you knocked it out of the park!", "gilded": 0, "score": 4, "created": 1422834864.0},{"body": "It's amazing the continuous theme of Innisfree and how that is idea of perfection and human growth and when he gets there, he will have all the answers.
