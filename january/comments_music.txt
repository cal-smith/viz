It is aparent to anyone who has read the comments that MeoMix is in this for the right reasons and has his mind right for this project. 

I am amazed that in this entire thread he hasn't even once mentioned that he has a [donation](https://streamus.com/#donate) page. If you have come to the same conclusions and me and will use this product, give the man his due reward. I don't donate often to projects like these, but I think he deserves it. Was looking for this, thanks mate.  Send this to the top! If you've quit your job for this OP, we wouldn't mind contributing, especially since I've been using it so much since the first release.

Please have it as an Edit in your post! I was searching for that and was surprised he didn't say anything about donations. Thanks for providing the link for us! well buddy, you are indeed great :) Only found out about this today and I love it!  Yay! Excellent. Let me know if you get confused at all. People seeing the program for the first time are invaluable for figuring out good UX.  Hey bud, amazing work, I use the extension all the time, here's my question (no idea if its been asked) the one main shortcoming is that the stream has to be manually started and stopped when other audio is played. Since chrome can detect audio from tabs (or something...idrk) would it be possible to code in an auto-pause (or significant vol reduction) when another tab plays audio? This would be a significant usability improvement, allowing you to have a constant background playlist that auto-pauses whenever you play a YouTube video (etc...), and auto-resumes without requiring manual interaction every time.

Best of luck, thanks

EDIT: [This](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/permissions) leads me to believe after the fact opt-in permissions to enable this feature shouldn't be difficult to implement. [Image.](http://imgur.com/FRg8KnX) I.e. The default required permissions would remain unchanged while an option in settings would enable the feature. I'm counting on you OP! This is totally possible. The trade-off is privacy permissions, though. Right now Streamus doesn't have the permission to snoop all your pages. If people want that feature then they'll have to acknowledge that I can look at their information on any site which is pretty scary. 

I'll need to put together a questionnaire or something to see how people feel. It's one of those things that nobody would let an unpopular program do, but wouldn't think twice when it's well-known and trusted. 

EDIT: [A relevant comic from a strip I read frequently](http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/12/17/a-fistful-of-permissions/) I think it would be fine if it was opt-in, like upon installing it popped up and explained the feature and what the extra permissions mean, then if you want you can change your mind later by going into settings. I for one would be perfectly fine with that, I just found this today thanks to this post, and it would be a cool feature. I certainly understand what OP means with wanting to see how people feel though, since people tend to get pretty riled up about privacy in scenarios like that, even though he certainly is doing so with good intentions.

The opt-in is a great idea to help with that though, I personally don't know how hard it would be for OP to implement, but great suggestion! I just think having options is a great, don't force something one way or another. I think even if it's an option, it'll still show up during installation and the user has to accept it. I have not see any addons that let you accept a new permission after the addon has been installed. It is possible to do some optional permissions. 

https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/permissions I think you may have misunderstood me, I am saying that he should add this feature, not that it is already part of the add on. Wow. You are an incredible developer. People do that all the time to other apps without considering users' rights. 

Also, you have obviously done a lot of research of Google's Material Design, and you have clean code. 

I &lt;3 you good sir. 

Carry on and do great things. Yeah! I &lt;3 Material Design. And I &lt;3 refactoring. Coding is the shit and making quality software is awesome. What a world we live in that one person can give to so many!  Be very careful with how you manage feature requests and the verbalized experiences of people. People often think they want something that they actually don't like when it's done and a vocal minority can nag you for stuff that most people won't like. Sometimes people like new stuff, sometimes it takes time for them to appreciate and so on. Take everything with a grain of salt and always have your own "vision" in the background.

There are many good online articles on these issues. If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.

:) It's awesome that you take this policy. I think so many programs take the opposite one, and it has led me to not use a lot of pretty cool plugins. I'll definitely be checking out this one.  http://www.commitstrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Strip-Trop-dautorisation-650-finalenglish.jpg

This comic comes to mind... Thank you for taking this position by default. A really good constructive comment, good idea man! I am a UX researcher and I just want to say that I love how user first and open minded you are being about this. This process is how good software is built.  What (path taken) did you do to become a UX researcher? How do you like it? Have been looking hardcore into becoming one. Thank! He read some blog posts on unbounce. So I have a degree in Human Development, and worked in research (research assistant) for 3 years out of college. I quickly got bored with working for a university, so I looked at cool companies that I wanted to work for and tried to start finding places where I thought I could fit in.

I love my job. I get to talk to people all day about what they like, and learn from them. Then I get to assist a team of developers and designers to make websites better. It is really cool to see the work that you do directly relate to measurable improvements.

I know this wasn't a great answer, but I can send you some books/videos/websites if youre interested. Feel free to PM me. I'm doing something very similar (Ergonomics/Human Factors, focusing on UX and HCI). I did a degree in Psychology and am in the middle of an MSc now. I know there are courses you can do which aren't MSc's but they are really expensive (in the UK anyway). It's really cool though, it's all pretty much common sense (something which is surprisingly uncommon when it comes to engineers and programmers) and it's a relatively young industry so it's constantly evolving. The money can be very good as well once you graduate if you build yourself a decent portfolio and work freelance. 

edit: these guys are really cool if you're interested in UX and I think they offer courses https://www.interaction-design.org/ I'm on my phone and will check it out when I'm home. Good on you and I wish you all the best! Just started using it, One thing ive noticed is when you click the cross it closes the search bar, But doesn't delete the text in box, Also, could we get a smaller X for deleting the text without closing the search bar.

Thanks! Loving it so far. It will clear the text after 10 seconds of being closed. I didn't want people to have to re-search for things after accidentally closing the search window or the whole UI :)

The whole search input needs to be cleaned up a bit, it's on my list of UI improvements for sure.  Posted this as its own post, but i'll write it here as it has a greater chance you'll see it.
"Would it be possible to make so you load the audio but don't load the video? (unsure if this already is how it works). As this would be a great benefit for people (such as me) with slow internet.
Other than that, GREAT APP, I love it :D, love the youtube link integration, the playlist function, search function, ease of use and the design fits well into chrome.
EDIT: If you could make it so an already existing youtube playlist could be imported via the link the playlist has, that would also be great!" I can't rip YouTube's audio out from them without breaking their TOS, sorry. Same reason I don't offer downloading. Oki, thanks for replying :-), i also discovered the playlist import is already a thing.
Do you think Google Music integration would be possible?

Link to Google Music: https://play.google.com/music/listen &gt; playlist

Brand new user here.  Can't figure out how to add a song to a playlist. I check the check box to the left of a title (after a search) and that doesn't seem to add it.  I also highlight it and then click the ADD button, no luck. I'm I missing something? This can already be done.

Click create new playlist and one option is for a URL put the URL of the desired playlist in there Do you have any plans to port this over to FF? Same! I am so stoked to be off the Spotify Bandwagon!
 Exceptionally decent. Great job OP! Fuck yeah! Exceptionally decent! :D TY!  Might I ask, I've been interested in software development as a career for a while now and I wanted to know if you have any tips i.e. relating to being a good developer, what languages to focus on, what sort of projects the majority of devs end up taking part in, etc.

Any feedback would be highly appreciated. I would totally love some last.fm integration. Everything else works just fine! Thanks a lot for this awesome extension. :D  https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/issues/116

It's totes on the books. Google play music...? There's no api which makes it a bit harder! There's an unofficial one though that may work!  That there is no Google Music API is really strange. You'd be to think they want that integrated into as many apps and products as possible.  As said below, no streaming API for it. If they come out with one for sure though. Not sure about TOS violations on using an unofficial one.  Is there a way to take a youtube playlist from an artist and add then entire thing into a streamus playlist? Copied from the website;

**Adding playlists**
The playlist management pane can be expanded by clicking the button located in the upper-left corner. You can add, delete and rename playlists from here. When adding a playlist -- you may provide a YouTube channel or playlist URL as a source. In the future, you will be able to login to YouTube and access personal playlists as well as SoundCloud and other services. awesome, thank you. That is exactly what I was hoping for. It copies the songs into the streamus playlist and then you can add or delete them.  Can you try to integrate closely (if at all, I get that the lack of a respectable API is an issue) with Google Play? For those of us with android phones, I find myself wishing that there was a clean link between Play Music and YouTube - since I tend to search YouTube for music (the "Hey man, check this song out" use case) then come back to Google Play for a song I know. Thoughts? There's no api for streaming music from Google Play! If they make an official way of doing that then I'm totally down.  Would it be possible to incorporate Soundcloud at some point as well as YouTube? * https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/issues/4
* https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/blob/Development/src/js/background/model/soundCloudAPI.js

Soon :) Im pretty sure you are not allowed to use that trademark because you are not Blizzard. Ahahaha.

But seriously, I want more than 9 deck slots in Hearthstone.  THE TECHNOLOGY JUST ISN'T THERE YET We can build it, we have the technology. Better, Faster than before. Million man reference?  Maybe reference to  ylvis - stonehenge Tried using Streamus, bought 40 classic packs. I don't know, dude, that sounds really confusing. Or Riot Games  Or Valve. +1 on this, i usually pick some weird genre i came across and just let it play like swing-hop, would be cool to do outside of the browser since i always close them constantly by accident.
 Why would I use this over, say, Spotify? It's a good question. I'll try and explain my thought process.

So, first off, YouTube's music quality is worse than Spotify's. There's no real getting around that until YouTube Music Key establishes a better foothold. So, if you're an audiophile, it's a hard sell.

That said, not everything's on Spotify. Taylor Swift? The Beatles? They have a huge collection of music, but not everything.

In my experience at house parties the usual music trend goes something like:

* Queue up a bunch of music or turn on Pandora before the party starts.
* Party is going, music is good.
* Someone wants to request a song.
* Pandora can't automatic request, Spotify doesn't have the track, go to Youtube.
* Suddenly you're on YouTube, people make another song request, and the party transitions to using YouTube as it's audio source.

Also, at least for me, I really struggle with just how much... stuff... there is in Spotify. I just want to listen to some songs that come to mind, but I feel inundated by the amount of information presented to me by their UI. I wanted to make something simpler that focused on my needs.

In the end, I'm just trying to provide alternatives not necessarily competitors. I frequently use extensions and find them easier to open and work with than a third-party program or a tab. I have lots of tabs always open (17 right now) and it's easy to lose track of my music. I always know where Streamus is at. :)  I'll try it when I'm not on mobile.

Are you able to skip ads? An ad before every song just seems excessive.

I guess it's probably better than basic Spotify, but Taylor Swift and anyone is available on Spotify if you add it yourself. You can even stream it from your devices.

Also, dude, I hope you sell this to Google or something. Currently ads do not play. That may be forced to change at some point, of course, but AdBlock would prevent users from encountering them. Furthermore, Plug.DJ does not show YouTube ads on their videos and they've got 1.5 mil+ in funding and employee 9 people, so I have to believe there's something I'm not understanding about the ad process. Don't be so sure, sometimes larger sites let things go until they are big enough to worry about.  1.5MM is a lot, but not to YouTube/Google.

Do you have a license to stream mp3?  What codecs do you use?  Or do you merely tunnel the track and thereby avoid that?  I haven't checked it out yet...on Firefox...but are you showing the vids or only the music?  

edit: just the music I saw below
 The whole video is loaded on a persistent background page inside of an HTML5 &lt;video&gt; element. I'm trying to abide by YouTube's TOS as best I can, but if I put the video in the foreground then the music would stop every time you close it.

I had a working prototype for showing the video in the foreground by piping a base64 encoded representation of each frame from the background page to the foreground and rendering it in a canvas element, but, due to some bugs in Google Chrome's implementation of transitionable objects (i.e. pointers) I wasn't able to achieve 60 FPS and abandoned it for now. 

I have some other clever solutions for the problem, but would prefer to cross that bridge when I need to rather than earlier. :)  Well, I don't know that you necessarily want video anyway.  I think what you're doing is pretty cool...best of luck to you.  You're doing a great thing by answering every question in the post too ;)

If you have any questions about the legal/business side of things I can really help you out with that, especially as they relate to streaming media.  I have done a lot of research and have practical experience in this exact field.  (for free, btw...just offering).
 Just found this extension today, and I've been using it all morning. So far, I've yet to encounter an ad's audio playing before songs. Is it skipping them somehow? It's skipping them the same way that adblock does. It's not, actually, skipping them in the same way.

Chrome Extensions don't have a referrer ([by design, I asked Google](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?can=2&amp;start=0&amp;num=100&amp;q=&amp;colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Iteration%20ReleaseBlock%20Cr%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified&amp;groupby=&amp;sort=&amp;id=429556)). Referrers are sent by website to tell other websites who they are.

Chrome extensions can set their referrer to whatever they want. So, I thought it would be best to set Streamus' Referrer to YouTube since that's what content I'm streaming. 

For whatever reason, that results in no ads being shown.  That is the exact transition of music listening at a party. Used to be what happened to me, but now with the Spotify remote, I keep my laptop in the bedroom, then Airplay it to my Airport hooked up with TOSLINK. What happens now is someone digs behind my stereo and unplugs my TOSLINK because they thought they could plug their iPhone in.

The great thing is that if you kill the person who brought the party to a stop, the rest of the party-goers will help you dispose of the body and also provide an alibi. Your parties sound... interesting. I think the biggest thing being that there is so much you can't get anywhere else.

I can stream all the video game soundtracks I want on this! It's fantastic. I totally agree with the youtube-party thing you're trying to point out here. I often found myself putting music at house parties and having to switch between different tabs of youtube videos in order to play something right after a song is finished, so from this point of view this extension is great. 

However, I wanted to point this out but I see you're quite aware that the quality of youtube videos is not excelent for all the songs you'd like to listen, so that might be the downside of your extension. I'm an audiophile myself and I always choose Grooveshark when listening to music because 95% of the songs I listen to are always in 320kb+ (or sound great). Maybe you could add a little filter that arranges the songs in the order of their quality or filters out the poor-quality songs.

Overall:

PRO: The idea is great, plenty of content and great, simple interface.
CON: Quality-wise, not that effective but that's not your fault. larger audios base, plus no youtube comments garbage, nice layout? At least that was what I liked. Also not everyone lives in America. Shocking right? No ads in the free version This is seriously the coolest extension I never knew I needed. Great work, man.  :D Appreciate it. Thanks for using it.  Of course. Is there a feature where I could type in an already-existing youtube playlist and have it transferred to a Streamus playlist? That would be awesome.  [You sure can.](http://i.imgur.com/SfgIa1l.png)

* Open up the playlists navigation drawer by clicking the hamburger icon in the upper-right corner.

* Click the button at the bottom of the drawer 'Create Playlist'

* Copy/Paste a YouTube URL into the second input provided. It will indicate that the URL has been parsed successfully and change the Playlist's title.

* Click 'Create'

It'll take a second to import the playlist (loads the songs in increments of 50), but then you'll have it.

You can also paste a Playlist URL into the search bar to see all the individual songs in the playlist and add them individually.  So cool, incredibly smart design and planning, you've got all of your bases completely covered man. Congratulations on the success you're going to have with this [Thanks! \^_^ I hope so](http://i.imgur.com/treE2Ce.gif) I can't say I have any gripes with the service. Lovely job with it. I have a huge respect for your dedication to this to the point where it loses you money. That said, I wouldn't mind if you decided to monetize this a little by putting an ad inside the popover.

One thing I can suggest is adding some sort of social capabilities. Sharing a playlist with a friend would be a cool dynamic. I refuse to monetize the application for myself without giving back to content creators. I don't own the songs on YouTube and don't have a means of getting them money (yet). 

My ideas for potentially making money in the future will focus on concepts such as [YouTube Fan Funding](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6052077). If I can get people tipping content creators and take a percent of the tips then I would find that OK. 

You can definitely share playlists (I even attached one at the end of my post) albeit not with friends on Streamus itself -- URLs would have to be sent through Reddit, FB, or what have you.

My grandiose vision would be to have something similar to Twitch.TV meets Plug.DJ. Radio stations where people can tune in to music being picked by another person, or you can invite your friends to listen to music with you together, etc.. but that's a long ways off :)  &gt;I refuse to monetize the application for myself without giving back to content creators. I don't own the songs on YouTube and don't have a means of getting them money (yet). 

Look at this guy with his ethical practices and shit! You must be new to the music world :P

Keep up the good work, man! Put up a donation page OP! I think that's fair. We'd be happy to contribute.

EDIT: [Here](https://streamus.com/#donate) it is. Something pretty close to this exists.

[https://www.patreon.com/](https://www.patreon.com/) Thanks. I've bookmarked it and will look at it more closely when I can catch my breath. :)  When you do, i'll totally support. You should delete that post, if it's an original idea.  It's the Internet... ideas aren't original. It's all in execution. Twitch.TV already knows its a decent idea, [they're trying to move into that sector themselves](http://blog.twitch.tv/2015/01/twitch-brings-music-to-broadcasters/), but I'm not sold on their implementation.

As it stands, I don't have the man-power to make it happen right now. If someone beats me to the punch with my exact idea then I'll happily innovate off of them.

My code's open-source already as it is. If people want to try and rip off Streamus they can try their best. Competition is good! &gt;It's the Internet... ideas aren't original. It's all in execution. 

You get it man. Every time a "redundant" product is released and commenters scream "why would i want this vs [insert product]" I get frustrated. Sometimes it's just the implementation or the UI or the ease of use. I wish you success.  :) Thanks. I try to be realistic about situations when possible.  Question for you, ever thought about a system where you can have a playlist running and have people collaborate it on what plays next and so on?  but then when it runs out of music in the playlist it switches to a larger one so that it just doesnt repeat the same 4 or 5 songs and then when people add music back into the open playlist, it switches back to that?   

Basically a form of an office jukebox where people can throw in any youtube song they want and have it played in some sort of queue. mypartiq.com Too few people get this.  I have people come to me with grand ideas all the time and think they just need some technical help to get it going and want me to sign an NDA to protect their awesome idea.  I have yet to see one of those where the idea was truly novel.  It's all about putting in the hard work to make it real.

As for monetization, you should really talk to our pal Mayhem next time he's back in town about ways to support yourself while not compromising your ethics.

(And in case you don't recognize the username, I'm the one who caused the chaos at the NYE party.  Sorry about your tie, and thanks for hanging out, even if I don't remember much of it.) It sounds like turntable.fm Hmm, you should add a feature where users can *opt-in* to advertisements for the purpose of funding you and your software.

Hell, I opt-in to seeing advertisements on Reddit (Adblock Plus) because I want to support the site. I even get little ads that say "Thanks for not using Adblock!) every once and awhile. When you give people the opportunity to support you as opposed to forcing it on them, a ton of people will choose to do so. As an artist. Thank you. I don't know about the logistics of it all, but we have to use Artist-Agregators to get our music on Spotify, Google Music, and Sony Unlimited.  You might also just get donors for users.  Some folks don't with good product, but you seem to have the necessary charisma. That *was* [turntable.fm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turntable.fm). Was great while it lasted. Yeah, also a "Poke" feature. Can you make something like this in the form of a FireFox add-on? There's [FireTube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firetube/) for Firefox which I've heard decent things about, but haven't played with myself.

The last time I looked at FF they weren't offering the right tools to make Streamus happen, but they might've advanced since then. I'll try to take a second look sometime soon. It's definitely not a simple port though. Streamus makes heavy use of Chrome's APIs. All that FireTube does is play audio from YouTube and let you download it. Ahhh, gross. Streamus doesn't do the downloading side of things because it seems kind of shady / there are a ton of services that provide that.

I'm still not 100% about pulling up the little UI window in FF, but I'll check. There may be hope. :)  PUHLEASE do something in Firefox...Firetube sucks. FireTube sucks, please do it for Firefox! I LOVE IT!!!

Could you possibly put in support for sound cloud and/or local files? Also support for existing youtube playlists would be cool.

Also, your super awesome for using material design :D

(EDIT: I see you already have support for existing playlists) YAY! :D

[SoundCloud response here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/2sypcn/seven_months_ago_i_showed_rmusic_my_software/cnu54yn)

Local files will be easier once I support SoundCloud. Support one API = hard. Supporting 2 APIs = really hard. Supporting 3+ APIs = easy.

And yeah :D I really love Material Design. I've never done design before. I just read Google's documentation for a good long while and tried my best to emulate it in an extension. I think it worked out pretty well!  Can you provide me a link? And, where do you suggest someone whos a web designer start if he wants to get into building web apps. I know html and css, but I have no idea how to even start building something like this.

I mean, could you walk me through a bit of the dev process? Like, what steps, tools and languages did you use to begin a project like this. * [Material Design documentation](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)

Uhhhm, you read a lot :)

* https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted

I started with an idea. I then read up on how extensions worked. I wrote out some basics in plain JavaScript with no server, all information stored locally on my PC in localStorage. I then wanted to be able to see stuff on another computer. So, I built a server in C# (but you could do NodeJS or other options), and set it up on AWS so I could talk to it.

All of that started to make the code get complicated. Too much for vanilla JavaScript, so I had to learn a framework. I chose to learn [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) + [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/) which helped cut down on a lot of the repetitive, boiler plate code necessary to make more complex things.

From there, I wanted to improve the UI which required getting better at CSS. To help with CSS, you use a pre-processor. I chose [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)

Just a lot of reading, looking at other people's projects, etc.. 

You can actually see most of my transition through GitHub:

* [Original Project, SongBuzz!](https://github.com/MeoMix/SongBuzz/commits/master?page=5)
* [Streamus - version 1](https://github.com/MeoMix/Streamus/commits/master?page=8)
* [And now](https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/) That seems like a hell lot of work!
I really appreciate your work. It is a great plugin, I will definitely share with my friends. Thanks for your dedication!

Oh and..
What exactly do you need the server for? Just curious ;) Will this work with Chromecast?  Not quite yet, unfortunately.

https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/issues/106

It is on my radar though. I have a Chromecast device, but I rarely stream music to it. Need to do a lot of reading to learn how to do it, or find another developer super interested in supporting it.  Maybe it would be possible to send the video url to the YouTube receiver, so you wouldn't need to worry about making a custom one. Gotcha, well it looks good so far. I rarely stream music to my Chromecast either but knew that YouTube worked for it.  Keep up the good work though!  I pretty much only listen to music via Google Play and Youtube on Chromecast. It goes from my chromebook/phone to the chromecast on the big TV, which sends it via optical to the fancy home stereo, where I  listen to it on a proper set of speakers. Not exactly an audiophile's dream, but a damn bit better than the laptop speakers.

I installed Streamus and it looks awesome and seems to be working great. I'm listening to your sample playlist now. But until you get the chromecast working I'm afraid I won't get much use out of it. Unless I'm missing some other way to get the music from my chromebook to my stereo?

Great job on the app, though! Everything seems to work so far, nice design, looking forward to checking out the radio feature. Haven't used it yet, BUT:

In Germany, most music is blocked due to some "copyright" crap. We can circumvent this by using proxy add-ons, but it's quite a hassle. So if something like that is integrated, I might even make the jump from Firefox to Chrome. I don't think it's possible to integrate this into Streamus without violating YouTube's Terms of Service. :( Sorry.  I'm fairly sure only playing back audio of YouTube videos is in breach too, the video must accompany the audio. Get a VPN. Much easier. Try hola extension in chrome. Let's you pick a country (proxy) very easily and it works great. Hey,

Last time I saw you posting on Reddit, I installed Streamus instantly and it's pretty much my favourite and most used Chrome extension! Really is brilliant and I love it! Can't think of anything I'd want changed though, it's perfect for me :D!

Keep it up! :D Awesome! Thank you for using Streamus, your support makes it possible :)  Awesome, awesome stuff, Sean!

I'd like to pay the favor and offer you my services as a composer &amp; sound designer in case you need them for eg. some visibility video for Streamus. Free of charge!
www.soundcloud.com/Artifex28 That could be really helpful! Can you send me an e-mail, admin at streamus dot com. Anything else will get lost in the Reddit hype train.  I don't have work off and I am in America :( :( I'm sorry. I'm working on this today if that makes you feel any better? :D  Haha yeah I guess so. This is def cooler than my job though. I'm gonna download this ext when I get home though just to support you. Keep plugging away. add a scrobble to last.fm feature and i'm in It's on my TODO list! Added it to the FAQ of the post.  Just ended my spotify subscription Now that's what I like to hear :D!! Not many people quit their jobs to pursue their passion.  I hope you know how big your achievement is!  Congratulations and props! Thank you!! :) It was a big jump, but working myself to death had to be done on my own terms rather than a companies. :)  How are you monotized, if at all? Are you just surviving on donations at this point? I am not monetized.  Donations barely cover server costs, if that.

I contract 10-12 hours a week for my old employer which is enough to pay for rent/food. I live cheaply, don't own a car or have a S/O. I compliment you as well, but I must say I'm confused.  You aren't making any money off this so how are you supporting yourself? How can you quit your job for this, yet have no plans for monetization? What is in it for you? It's not greedy to make money off of a good service. This is awesome. May I just ask, how did you learn to code? I've always wanted to learn it but I don't know where to start. Of course you can ask.

I attended college from 15-20 and got my BS in Computer Science. I had an internship at the end doing some 'real world' programming. However, I didn't know JavaScript until after college. I moved to California after graduating and was lucky enough to find a programming job upon arrival.

They needed a rockstar JavaScript developer and thought I would fit the part given enough time. So, I hit the books and started reading and doing some smaller projects for fun to build up my skills.

I've worked at that company ever since. Four years full-time and now as a contractor. I started tinkering with Streamus after work after about 2 years of working there.  I can't help but notice that you're based in SLO on your github page. Beautiful place to be :) (I am currently at studying Cal Poly). I have started using your extension. Awesome job. The way it resembles google's designs makes me crave an android app. Any plans there? Brilliant man. First time hearing about this too.

Will give feedback after some time using it, but the first impression is great, everything is simple and clear. The radio function is intuitive and the explanation of the page confirmed my assumption.

EDIT: Just one question. Does it load only the audio, ie. is it using less bandwidth at the same time?

EDIT 2: And it makes a little pop-up when the songs starts showing the song name. Ooh, beautiful. 

EDIT 3: Haha, gratz on getting to front page. Seems you will get all the feedback you need! Definitely deserve it! The radio function could be a bit more intuitive. Sometimes people don't realize they have to skip to the end of their playlist to see new tracks. I'd like to show the "upcoming songs" faded out and non-interactive when radio mode is on.  Would also really like to know if it is loading the video or only the audio, I know music doesnt use much but I'm not going to swich music players if this one is more inefficient. kygo is amazing, i trust you already Also, I know it's against your beliefs, but if you were to make a Donations page, I think it would explode.  https://streamus.com/#donate 

There's this... it goes to cover server costs. I've never actually broken even on those costs, though, so it's certainly not blowing up. :p  When it isnt actively running, will it be contributing to chrome already being a power/memory suck? Its a fantastic extension idea, Im fooling around with it now, but thats my primary concern  So, I'll address this in a couple of points.

* Streamus does continue to run even when not active. While it is technically possible to program in a way which unloads it, it was not possible to do so when I first started to code it and I haven't had a chance to try and figure out what all would need to unload it.

* There exists a bug in Google Chrome right now which causes Chrome Extensions to use an excessive amount of memory: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=441500. However, it's a known issue and they're actively working to resolve it.

So, that said, in an ideal world Streamus would not be using more memory than an open YouTube tab. If you run it for a long time, constantly opening the UI, and never full shutdown Chrome or restart your PC, then it may start to take up more memory. You can fix that by going to chrome-extension://, unchecking enabled and re-checking enabled to clear the memory. That'll reset it back down to normal values. Thanks for the detailed reply! I'll have to play around with it.  The ability to push whatever is streaming or in the playlist to chromecast would be great..  Just so you know, Firefox extensions with the new ffox sdk and the Safari Eco system make it possible to have one code base for all 3. You can completely avoid the hassle of using xul and more with the new Firefox stuff

Let me know if you have questions. Hey bro, I have Chrome in spanish and I see it's not fully translated yet. I don't know much about coding but if you want I could help you translate it. Looks awesome, definitely be using it a lot. Any chance of this becoming an android app? Maybe, but not for a while. A lot of the most popular YouTube apps on mobile disappeared in December and I'm waiting to see what happens in that space before really considering it. Firefox pleaseeee &lt;3 Honestly I think I speak for everybody, but if you want to throw an ad at the bottom to start making money off this I'd be totally cool with it. You deserve it, streamus is great! http://www.tomsguide.fr/article/Chrome-extensions,5-159-3.html

in french, you're in a "top 40 must have extension", in a  well known hard/software forum,

just discovered it, that's fucking great, makes me think of radio.blog.club from like... 12 years back ! :D Fuck yeah! That's awesome to hear. It's also been featured on [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/24/streamus-turns-chrome-into-a-fast-free-youtube-powered-spotify-alternative/) and other popular US places in the past :)  I remember using this and seeing this when it first got published. Can't believe it's been so long already! Thanks man Me either, man. Time flies. You're welcome :)  I love using streamus and I'm so happy I discovered it from your last post! No big requests here (just one more +1 for last.fm integration) but just wanted to say thank you!  Any chance of this coming to Firefox? :) Awesome extension man! Love the UI, fits right in with the whole material design Android has at the moment. Ultimately would love Firefox support, but I'm sure you have much more pressing things going on right now, got a donation coming your way :) Keep it up! firefox pls Firefox? D:  wtf this is perfect

Just curious, how do you make money on this? is there like a youtube like payment system for extentions where google pays? Great extension! I love its purpose! AND ITS SO USEFUL!

I want to pose two suggestions. I have very little coding experience so I have no idea how difficult these two suggestions will be to implement. Please forgive me.

1. I am aware you are able to assign shortcuts. I feel like pausing and un-pausing is not used commonly enough to a justify their own shortcut. Not giving it a shortcut is inconvenient when we want to pause/un-pause, so giving it a shortcut is also over kill. What I want to suggest is a double-click feature on the icon to pause/un-pause. And a triple-click to shuffle.

2. Another feature should be detecting a secondary audio stream from chrome and then muting itself respectively. Obviously I do not want it detect an audio stream outside chrome as I can see this maybe hell to implement. i.e I have Streamus running and then suddenly I want to watch a youtube video, streamus will pause itself. Then maybe un-pause itself when I stop/pause the youtube video. (This feature should be toggle-able.)

Again, I lack the time and the know-how to create this. These are just some ideas that someone with more skill can tackle ;). I feel like these are some reasonable/useful features.

Edit: After reading over it seems like I am saying, 'I want this! Someone spend their time and energy for me!. Please believe me when I say that, I feel like these suggestions would be useful for everyone. Dude you should apply to Google. This extension is so polished, easy to use and the look feels like it was already build into Chrome. I turned down their recruiter... and Imgur... and Beatport.. and a few others. I like working on my own stuff.  Integrate it with chrome-cast. https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/issues/106 It's on the TODO list!  What should we do if we want to make a donation to the cause? There's a link on the main page to donate via paypal.
https://streamus.com/#donate Very cool, could you share more of your playlist? Really love these kinda chill music. https://share.streamus.com/playlist/1e70d6e843da/meos_music Sorry I am on mobile right now but you should add a play/pause/forward/back buttons on the browser so I dont have to switch tabs to change songs. If this already does exist then thats fuckin awesome! So does it? If it does ill get it right when I get off of work The context menus seems very nice and all, but it would be nice if you could turn it off, so you can keep your context menu size to the minimum :)
(Don'n know if you already did that, just my first thought when i saw the description)
But great iniative, if I wasn't so addicted to Spotify, i would totally use your extension! Besides, most of the best remixes isn't on Spotify You can fully control what Streamus injects into your browser:

* http://i.imgur.com/Nyz8gLh.png

Just flip 'em to off and no more context menu injection. :) 

Sorry I can't convert you! Think of Streamus when you want to listen to a remix.  If the link to a song gets removed or taken down, could there be a way to remember the songs that were saved once? Even if its just saving the titles to a text file locally or something? It'll stay in your playlist and the image won't load for the song. Title should still be there. YouTube will throw an error if you try to play it. That work? :)  Yea definitely!   :] One more thing, OP you get it. KISS.

Simple is easy. Simple hits hard. Simple Works.  Simple is also doable by 1 person... which helps. :p :)  Thank you very much for making Streamus. I use it every day at work and at home. The recent design change looks good. I love the keyboard shortcuts, it makes it so much more useful/convenient. 

One problem I have a lot is that I can't think of any music to listen to. It would be great if you added something that would let you see suggestions or recommendations or what is popular. This could work well as the default when you click the search icon, since it is now just a blank space. Otherwise I have to go back to Pandora or Songza when I can't think of anything. I guess I'm just saying I wish there were a better way to explore new songs.

Another thing that could be improved is when I remove the current song from the stream, it will often appear again right a way or after a couple. I would prefer that the song didn't come back again, since I already removed it once. 

One last thing I can think of is that sometime I don't like the songs that come up in radio mode. Maybe if the search area (or similar) would show a list of songs that will come up and I can remove them before they start playing. Or similarly if I could tell it to add x number of songs to the list (without have to skip through them all manually and then going back) and then edit the list beforehand, instead of on a song by song basis. This last suggestion probably isn't very helpful, but it might help you think of something to add.

Thanks again for your hard work and for leaving your job for this. I remember seeing you on /r/materialdesign! Awesome design and great program! Love it.  Love Streamus. Was super sad over that API issue a few months ago, but I have definitely been recommending this to my friends. You and me both regarding the YouTube API fiasco. I did take some steps to reduce the # of queries I was sending to their API. Happily sitting at just 4% of quota now a days :)  Are you hiring? I'd make a great secretary. Fetching you coffee, women, cocaine... whatever you need sir. sorry if someone else has mentioned it but my only concern is the content creators - what do they get? Somewhat tengential -- but I saw you quit your job. How do you (or developers in general), make money off of a free chrome extension? A man (woman)'s gotta eat, right? Especially with sushi and sake [Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/1UGitSW.png)

Don't like this? Message me! This is awesome. Just wanted you to know I use streamus pretty often, I went through my pandora bookmark list and added all of my favorites to a playlist and it's really awesome. I'd love to see some sort of "my pandora playlist" option that ties in.. Either way.. Awesome plugin!  How are you supporting yourself?  If everything is free and open source.... I don't get it.  Must be rich, if I left my job I would have 1 before I consider flipping burgers, and 2 months I would have to consider sucking cock. I saved every penny for about 4 years to save up enough of a nest egg to not have to worry too much. I don't own a car, I don't have a S/O, and I don't have any debt. Just took a lot of work and planning!  Do you have support for Apple TV or Chrome cast? Chromecast support is on the TODO list, but nothing at the moment.  [deleted] I didn't quit my job for Reddit. I quit my job because money wasn't making me happy and following my passion does.  This is the best extension I currently have. Thank you!

Any plans to integrate chromecast support? +1000 And thank you for using it :D

Yep: https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/issues/106 Chromecast sometime! No idea when.  This is pretty awesome, I was literally listening to music from Youtube when I read this. I love the simplicity and neatness of it.
 This is fantastic. You have done a wonderful job. Good on you for quitting your job and dedicating your working time on it! Hope to support you when you decide to monetise this. Help to pay artists so they can go on a hike and get sushi too https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/2sypcn/seven_months_ago_i_showed_rmusic_my_software/cnu41h8 How are you planning on covering perfomance rights/royalties etc? https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/2sypcn/seven_months_ago_i_showed_rmusic_my_software/cnu41h8 I love it a lot. Thanks for the extension.

Pardon my ignorance but I'm just curious as to how developing this makes you money at all since it's for free.  It doesn't make me any money. I do some contracting work on the side to pay for rent/food and just work on this in the rest of my time because I enjoy it.  Thanks so much! I love this app. Im from Austria, so if you are interested in translating your app to German, get in touch! (Some parts are already in German, just not all of them) I would so do this for free, because your app is just absolutely amazing. Dont know what I would do without it. You are one of the people who make this internet a better place by using your skills to do something amazing which a lot of people profit from.  Hey hey. Can you e-mail me, please? admin@streamus.com and mention German translation. I've cleaned up my locale's file and am looking at coordinating updates to the translations ASAP.  You quit your job? Has Google gifted you youtube or something? Do you own the rights to millions of artists songs?

If not, I fail to see what you hope to do to make a living this way? Because the guys holding the value are other people. Yeah I don't see this existing for very long due to that reason. Selling the it may be one way. But surely Google will not like if someone else makes big money by tapping into their service. Its an open source project, not much to sell.

He is most likely comfortable with living off donations and his savings.
also the odd job (freelance) here and there. Yeppers, you're correct.  He already said he's not making money off this, he's living off savings, but basically, idk what his future is in being able to live, since this costs him money I didn't go into this hoping to make a living off of it. I just wanted to work on something I enjoyed doing for as long as I could. I'm still doing a little bit of contracting work to cover rent/food, just not making the kind of money I was as a salaried developer.  I'm curious as well.  I mean, I fail to see the benefit of working full time on this app and quitting your job.  I've had projects before myself, and all my free time was devoted to it.  Should I find a project that would support me I'd give quitting a shot as well.

But there is no financial support being offered by this project.  Why quit your job?  Surely the coding is not that intense to require it?

I guess I'm just the type to "play it safe", and keep my job but spend every other moment on the project.  [deleted] Music has had a profound impact on my life and it can shape a lot of emotions. It's unacceptable if there are people unhappy in this world because they don't have access to songs which would cheer them up. I think I can fix that problem, so I'm trying.

More money wasn't making me happy, but working on passion projects is. If it sells, it sells, but I could be doing a lot more to try and sell it if I wanted. I've turned down VC funding in the past.  But where's fox support? :( Heh, as mentioned above, I'm not 100% sure that FF supports the same sort of mini-overlay that Chrome does, at least last time I checked.

Also, [having a user count that wasn't trending down wouldn't hurt...](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Usage_share_of_web_browsers_%28Source_StatCounter%29.svg)  Man, as long as chrome creates 74 processes for it's browser, I aint touching it. how about IE? That doesn't merit a response. Surprisingly... http://www.windowscentral.com/microsofts-spartan-browser-windows-10-reportedly-supports-chrome-extensions &gt; how about IE? /s

FTFY Not entirely, many people enjoy their choons in a work environment... http://www.windowscentral.com/microsofts-spartan-browser-windows-10-reportedly-supports-chrome-extensions

Not actually quite such a joke... Nice one! Did you know... http://www.windowscentral.com/microsofts-spartan-browser-windows-10-reportedly-supports-chrome-extensions ? Heh, would you believe? http://www.windowscentral.com/microsofts-spartan-browser-windows-10-reportedly-supports-chrome-extensions Top kek http://www.windowscentral.com/microsofts-spartan-browser-windows-10-reportedly-supports-chrome-extensions I just recently wrote a script to convert Spotify playlists into lists of YouTube links... so yeah --

[Wicks playlist HTML](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1094010/Reddit/wicks.html) Okay, this is the only way I can listen to it. Thank you very much! It's YOU! Fuck yeah man. I've been listening to this playlist all year and telling everyone I know about it. You're great. Keep on keepin on with the music. These are some favs of mine if you're interested/they fit:

 *Humbly bows in thanks* and yes! I'll check them out thanks for the hook-up! *nods respectfully* *Vibrates rapidly*

**Edit** Okay, so I made that joke before I actually clicked on the link then I realized that I too have been following the Wicks playlist all year! 

*Vibrates gently in thanks* [rapidly](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view5/4515857/fembot-head-explodes-o.gif) Oh it's you. I keep getting notifications that your playlist keeps updating. Nice work. I've been listening to it since you last posted about it on here! Thanks for the great playlist! Super impressive that you actually spent the time putting together 50 hours of only good stuff. God damn it!! I just realized that I used to listen to this guy's playlist all time and now I found him here xD. Is there a word for being both disappointed and impressed?

*Edit: I, Wootery, hereby lay claim to the word "improinted".* Fuck Ah yes, the English language's equivalent to the 'x' variable.  Flabbergasted i also have been a long-time spotify follower of wicks playlist. keep it up! [It's you!](http://youtu.be/rfMC2aVhYuo?t=36s) This is the type of stuff I would love to see more of in this sub.  Can someone explain what a 'deep cut' and a 'prime cut' are in context of this post?

I'm trying to decipher the headline and I just get 'I have put together a list of music I like, across all genres'? A "prime cut" is a well-known or popular song by an artist or from a genre, while a "deep cut" is a much lesser-known hidden gem type song. I've definitely heard deep cut used here and there, but I think its possible OP just extrapolated prime cut from that. Not only is OP creating kickass playlists, now he's also creating new words. What a man. Tasty steak. Flying right into your holes at the speed of sound. I'm hungry I'll take two. Nice work! Have saved it. Cheers :) Just opened this up to find "It Feels Alright" by Washed Out. Bravo. I used to listen to this song every Friday on my drive home from work. I would imagine that I'm Peter Gibbons just not giving a fuck about anything at all. You just made me miss living in San Diego. Thanks OP! I saw washed out at firefly this year, with a good deal of pot brownies in me. One of the best experiences ever for me. Even better, they were followed immediately by my favorite band, Broken Bells.  This sounds amazing. The only thing better would be to have a couch in the vicinity lol Paracosm is terribly under-appreciated. That album hits me right in the feels. I could not agree more! Another album that I haven't heard anyone talk about is the Clean Bandit album. Other than their single nobody seems to give a shit in the states. If you haven't seen it yet, Weightless has an official music video that's just what you would expect from Ernest. It's amazing.  No matter what's going on in my life, Washed Out brings me to a better place. Gosh no problem.. that song is such a wonderful opening to that album. It's like the sound of turning the first page of the most beautiful book ever or something. Happy nostalgia to you :) The word "Majestic" comes to mind. GMAA Version

Edit: I've added a ton of playlists to my reply below, have a look!

Edit 2: If you're having trouble finding these, copy the HTTP link into Spotify's search bar and hit enter! Dude I know this thread isn't about you but you have some of the best playlists on Spotify I've ever come across. 

You have label discographies for obscure labels, playlists for genres and so much more. It's like you're a music devouring robot. 

Post your profile, or more playlists! You deserve way more followers. Awww :) thanks man! I'm on mobile right now but watch this space. I'll share some more stuff.

Again, only some of the multitude on my profile.

And last but not least, [the 100,000 subscriber party](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/28ykm7/empws_100000_subscriber_playlist_party_plus_some/) I threw on /r/electronicmusic that has a TON of my playlists for you to look through. Never delete your Spotify account. Seriously. I agree. It seems like all those times I've said to myself, "save this track" "Dont forget this name(repeat it a bunch...still forget)" "Oh this artist rocks, I'll find them after this game"...looks like you nailed it. My procrastination for assembling playlists, is mighty. This assembly of playlist, is legendary.  The much deserved follow is in place. For everyone that somehow can't open the web player, here's how you find this guy in the application:

- In the search bar, type in: "spotify:user:121005385" (without the quotation marks).
- Done. i was also just able to search "121005385" and he popped up. Oh fuck, you've assembled and organized everything that matters. ...ok that dose it I'm downloading this thing just to understand what you people are on about. Not just for that acidjazz playlist. No way.  It's a great service. I wish they'd charge me a bit more so they could pay artists more though! As an artist, Spotify is the publishing service that makes me the most money, so I am ok with their payrate! I would be all for it.   I listened to Spotify for 55k minutes last year.   I would happily pay more then I did.  Amazing Started your Breakbeat playlist. First track is Hybrid. You're awesome, dude. Loving your Electro-Swing playlist! YO EVERYONE CHECK OUT HIS SLEEP IS COMMERCIAL PLAYLIST

^^Just ^^do ^^it!

Also, I just realised that you have a Dub Techno playlist. I'll definitely listen later. My kinda guy! Nice selection man, and im only scratching the surface. Thank you for saving me 72 hours of my life searching for this stuff on my own.  have you got the link for these to use in the application? Copy the HTTP link into the search bar and hit enter my friend. I'm a newbie at looking up other users. When I navigate to your profile, it says you have 375 playlists but I can only view the first 50 in alphabetical order. Do you know why that is?

Thanks Because Spotify is dumb as shit. 

It used to be by what was popular but not it's by name, which is annoying. I don't know why they changed it.

Can I help you find something?  Thanks very much for responding. I would love to check out your piano playlist, if I could trouble you to send it to me. My user name is redacted. I have my own public Classical playlist but only if you're interested.

 If you copy the link up there that says Piano and copy it into Spotify's search bar and hit enter it will pop up! Thanks! I got to it! The "Dirty Paws" song I'm 95% sure is supposed to be the one in the video below:

http://youtu.be/mCHUw7ACS8o That one isn't my playlist but one I found on here a while ago.  Damn I'm loving the piano playlist. Always have been a sucker for some peaceful piano songs on shuffle. This shit is like a delicious toasted meatball sub for my ears hahahahhaa eat it up Spotify URI - for those interested.

LPT - Just take the web URL and replace all forward slashes with colons and "https://play.spotify.com" becomes just "spotify:". I just pasted the web URL into spotify and it worked. Yep, you don't need the URI anymore. They've made it so you can just paste the URL in the search bar and it comes up.  I did not know this. Thanks guys. Is this the Wicks playlist that you've published before? I have been listening to it regularly and enjoying your updates. Thanks for being so diligent about keeping it fresh! Is this playlist designed to be listened to in this specific order, or is it meant to be shuffled? Listening to ordered things in the correct order matters to me probably more than it should All those fantastic Queen albums, with all those amazing tracks....and you pick "We Will Rock You"???  I agree. I think a good prime cut Queen pick would be "You're My Best Friend" Twenty One Pilots covers a bunch a genres in each song their album vessel is one of my all time favorites. I can listen to it again and again without getting tired of it. they're SO GOOD but for some reason aren't known by everyone in the world yet Seen them live twice. They put on an incredible live performance. Their lyrics sound like a 2edgy4me 14 year old, but otherwise they're pretty good. Not my fave, but I can respect it for someone who's not super into lyrics like me  I absolutely love them live- saw them 2 years ago in Dallas and immediately loved them  Sidenote: Where are some good venues in Dallas? Moving there from up north in a few months.  Don't really know any, sorry! I just happened to visit a friend and went to a music festival with them there.  Oh nice! Which fest?  Their lyrics are awesome. My girlfriend loves them, as she really identifies with a lot of the themes. I mean they're literally taken from Tyler's high school diary so they legitimately are written by a teenager.. Nothing against the band, they're just "deep" rather than lyrical portraits. I like a song that can paint a picture of a time and place and emotion that matches the sound from behind. 21P just don't do it for me. My wife loves them, though. She also likes the Killers and pop music though..  There's my dilemma, I want them to get huge because they're amazing and deserve it. But I don't want them to get big because I like seeing them in a small venue (selfish, I know). I've watched them become pretty popular around me in the last six months, so there's that. 

Unfortunately, it's probably just the bias you gain when you discover a new band... been following them for about 2 years now. Local radio station started playing them and the whole city adored them almost immediately so no they have become pretty popular but not as popular as they should be Their first album is pretty good, I gave it a listen after I heard songs from vessel a few months back. Can't wait to see them live. They are incredible live. It's really quite an experience. And yeah, their first album is nothing to write home about, but vessel is a game changer. In case anybody uses Google Music, I've put this together on there [here](https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXyn-ij88eTAPIjm2_9lJ1X7_GjDHCeM14_cm1HBBt5l52_U8mfdX7r9wS5qgA-taYQsXcU_aD8Pnv7qDHvMW4dLc71GaqQ==)

I still have about 100 songs left to add, but most of it is done.  I don't listen to 99% of this music and I've been jamming to it all day.  I highly recommend EVERY song here.

EDIT: Done.  There were like 15 or so songs that Google Play Music didn't have, but otherwise it's all there.  I also removed a couple double entries on the playlist. &gt;My goal is to cover every genre



Are you including country/foreign music in there as well? I'm asking because when people say every genre, they usually exclude a whole lot from what they mean as every genre. There's also no metal.  I assume OP is a one of those "I like all types of  music, except country and metal" people. There's also no Jazz, Classical, Latin, Punk, Reggae, Country... This is basically folk rock, classic rock, indie rock, hip hop, with a little bit of soul and blues. That's not to say that it's not a good list - I love a lot of the tunes in here, it's got great breadth, and I haven't heard of many of them - but it's not as wide-encompassing as I was expecting for a 50 hour playlist that advertises covering all genres. It's like the lady in the 'Bob's Country Bunker' scene in **Blues Brothers**:

"We've got both kinds of music here, Country *and* Western!" Damn, that really is missing a lot.  It's strange to claim to be covering every genre and be missing major things like Jazz and Punk. To be missing Jazz, punk, country,prog and metal is pretty weak at covering all genres. Yeah, I totally feel you. I'm not even expecting 'underground' or 'obscure' stuff, but no Davis, Coltrane, Monk, or Parker? No Bach, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky? No Ramones, Sex Pistols, X, Fugazi, or Talking Heads? Yeah, those are huge cultural touchstones and it's really glaring when an supposedly all-encompassing list doesn't have something as fundamental as John Coltrane or Talking Heads.  Hopefully OP's scanning the comments and trying to further his own library. I find it a boring 50 hours with out the latin punk and reggae.....and just dumping some Bob or some Clash wouldn't be helping, also no glam......how can have no TRex. This far from all genre he does have TRex in there Is there really no metal in there? I haven't started playing it yet, but that would be total bullshit since there are a lot of different types of metal too. There's an Alcest track, but my guess is it's from their shoegaze period.  Not to say I don't love that, but I wouldn't call it metal by any means.  The next closest thing is Van Halen.  metal can't be beautiful  ^^^^^/s Damn, that's a small /s. I'm one of those people. But it's just because I haven't heard anything from those genres that I like. Everything I've heard sounds the same. Recommend me some things Oh geez, well metal has a lot of variety within itself.  I'll give you a track from some of the bigger genres to see what, if any, you like.  Top to bottom is more accessible to less accessible, in my opinion.  Most of these tracks are what got me into the respective genres.

 I didnt see much classical or showtune music as well. Or maybe  I wasnt looking hard enough. I would love to see some of those on the list There is a shitload of stuff that is missing.  In my opinion while the songs flow well together and there is a whole bunch of great material, this is basically "Inoffensive white music and some Smokey Robinson to not be racist - the playlist."

I get the same thing from guys who listen to like 200 types of rock and early 90s rap and think they're genre masters.  Its like the guy from Bubba Gump listing off the millions of rock and indie genres he's in to.

If you dig deep enough, there are like 500 "genres" in techno, and that is a REALLY specific genre to begin with!  Music is complicated. Symphony No. 7......you have a new follower!! I've i started listening a few hours ago and i'm having fun. I've got my headphones on while working on a presentation at work, and it's making my day fly by. Thanks for having great taste in music, I'm learning about alot of songs/artists I've never listened to or never really have given a chance. If I'm helping a work day go faster, that its truly the greatest thing I've ever done, thanks! I'm a little surprised there is no David Byrne or The Talking Heads on your list. He would fit really nicely. Once in a Lifetime makes a great addition to anything. I would go with This Must Be The Place! The "Stop Making Sense"-Performance is just outstanding: http://youtu.be/E9aN93S8nl8


 For sure, I never get sick of this song.  Love the instrumental on this recording.   I'm more of a "Life During Wartime" man myself, but the agree with the sentiment wholeheartedly. It hurts my balls every time a website says "Not available in your country."


Nevertheless, all love goes to OP for taking his time setting all of this up. Needs more 2chainz [deleted] Deerhunter getting some well earned (though belated) rep A couple of possibly stupid questions as I am embarrassingly behind the times with spotify.  Do I have to be a paying user to access this?  And how do I find this playlist on my mobile app?  My work computer blocks spotify :(. You don't need to pay, although there is a premium option. You can log in through facebook or make an account. If you save the playlist it will be there on your mobile and laptop, if you just want to find it you can search the name of the playlist! Thank you kind Sir or Ma'am This is semi related but can anyone help a brother with a Chromebook out here? I just got a Toshiba 2 Chromebook yesterday (really good btw) and tried to log into spotify but the web player didn't work, error was I needed flash to run spotify web player, tried to download flash and said the Chromebook was up to date with flash.  
  
Tried to download an app or extension for spotify but they just lead to the web player opening in browser so I'm getting stuck. If someone could help I'd really appreciate it cause I wanna listen to some of these beezer playlists! Cheers. If you use adblock it could be blocking the web player. You need to disable adblock for spotify.
 boom time This thread inspired me to share my 14hr+ (and continually growing) playlist with the world.

[The Aristocratic Baller's Playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/treklightgear/playlist/0izWFmMe24wFYGyT4WVMQC)

It began as a playlist that we could play at our kickball and softball games here in Boulder, CO and it's original title is "Music To Be Played While Drinking And Playing Sports".  Let it be known though, this is no Jock Jams - it spans everything from funky soul to the blues to outlaw county and everything in between.  It's not intended to played in order so hit shuffle for best effect.  A few songs would definitely be considered explicit so take this as your warning if you decide to play it on your speakers at work.   

I'll start a new post in this sub if this comment gets some attention (or not!), but I figured this would be a good place to share.

I'll continue to add to it, so follow it if you like it, and let me know what you think! hi hey What's up? Just sittin. You? just thinkin' about stuff Whatcha thinking about? Oh you know, stuffs and things and things and stuffs Is there a way to find it on the mobile app? Or will I have to go through the browser? search "wicks" or my name "Brennan McDowell" &gt;with deep cuts and prime cuts

Can someone explain wtf that means? Prime cut is the single, the song everyone knows and loves already. They can be overplayed but, regardless of this, still showcase the artist's best work. These are the hits.

Deep cut is the track that can also be amazing but was not the single, did not get radio play, and may not well known outside of those who are already big fans. More like a hidden gem. Captain Beefheart? You win. Love some BJL and the Honeybears Thanks for this! I've been listening to wicks for about a year now, it's a little overwhelming to be honest, but I really appreciate your efforts! http://open.spotify.com/user/dr.lequack/playlist/6bphMWJBjcC7WUmoNTCRxd

This is a playlist I'm adding to. Barely at 3 hours.  3 tracks in and I'm loving it. Thanks. Ops, you da real MVP.  Aw my band made it! Thanks! This playlist is crazy. What band are you in! do you suggest we shuffle or listen in order? did you try to make the playlist move along in a structured way or it makes no damn difference?  It's ordered specifically, but shuffle shouldn't be too jarring. or look around and dive in where you get feels! I've been listening to your playlist for about a year, since you last posted this on Reddit.  "Wicks" is one of my favorite go-to sources for finding new music.  Great job, man.   thanks /u/MentalSewage! I was  sad at first when I thought it would only be on Spotify :) No worries, I was bored at work so spent all day copy/pasting this list.

I think there were like 15 or so songs that Google Play didn't have available though. Great stuff. I'm a boring middle aged English guy, and     although I used to be so in love with music when I was younger, I've kinda let my life get in the way of that love.
Your playlist has forced me to listen to a load of stuff that I'd normally not even know existed. I'm really, really enjoying it. 
I'm going to outsource my 'musical taste' function to you.
Good work mate. Now its a [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLknuiOt8_GfYGqnvvYV4lMQ7BDTC_eTfd
).
Youtube sources from /u/akx.
Took me a bit but I finally figured out the youtube API.
This [repo](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/test-youtube-api) was very helpful.
 If anyone can do this for Rdio I'm forever grateful. Edit: [This guy did it better](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/2ruju6/ive_put_together_a_fifty_hour_spotify_playlist_of/cnkfxpm), I guess mine only had the first 200! I didn't realize there was more than 200 on OPs version.

I'm on it, chief! 
There's this nifty tool that I used to transfer all of my playlists when I switched from Spotify to Rdio, [Respin](http://resp.in/).

Here's the playlist: [Beautiful](https://www.rdio.com/people/chrscblls/playlists/12494700/Beautiful/)

Disclaimer, there were a few songs from the original playlist that Rdio didn't have in their library

* I Ni Sogoma by Dinosaur Feathers
* Fast Animals by The Strokes
* Unhooked Generation by Freda Payne
* Sugarfoot by Black Joe Lewis
* A Banda do Ze Pretinho
* The Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair by Led Zepelin This is a pretty extensive list, so I was surprised to see some of my favorites were not on it! A few recommendations:

Radiohead - Everything In Its Right Place (or anything really)

Massive Attack - Teardrop

Portishead - Roads

Keep up the good work! Nice. I was expecting 50 hours of Never Gonna Give You Up As an american, I'm loving that La Fouine is listed, AND its my favorite song.  Apparently I have good taste in foreign music...  Not so much American apparently...

You might check out Louise Attaque for a french variant to your folk rock.  I haven't seen it in here. hi Any rib eye or rump roast cuts? I'm hungry. nice, thank you! My favourite for a long time has been this compilation of music from Entourage http://open.spotify.com/user/dalys/playlist/0WZSGAsUr9LcReZiD2N0gM

Entourage had some great music in it, so I once scraped all the songs from HBO's website and ended up with hundreds of song names.. didn't know what to do with it. Some time later it occurred to me that someone before me must have done it already, and here it is. At least I got a bit of programming practice. Well I know what I'm listening to all day. Thanks!! Looking forward to all of it.  Since we're sharing playlists here thought I'd put mine in.

335 classic songs (22hr 54mins) from the 90s downwards.
http://open.spotify.com/user/11148139253/playlist/6I5dHxSpKOZK0WMCV3xWsn Thank you! I've done playlists like this from time to time, but never this good or this comprehensive. I know it takes forever to try to put together, so thanks for sharing! Let me leave you with this from Vonnegut: 

If I should ever die, God forbid, let this be my epitaph: THE ONLY PROOF HE NEEDED FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD WAS MUSIC. I have a very similar playlist I've built over the past couple of years. Please give it a listen. 

http://open.spotify.com/user/siralexflores/playlist/3di2VoagVz7jkWJLWwMhnV If we are all sharing our playlists I guess I will throw my hat in the ring. I often add full albums and am too lazy to choose the song order. So listen with shuffle turned on.

* [Winter] (http://open.spotify.com/user/kira_dune/playlist/4ptBuXX9Zkzi1AWSonOhMh)

* [Pop songs] (http://open.spotify.com/user/kira_dune/playlist/7wl6iNQJMvGbzubrWMMAPG)

* [Folk Revival] (http://open.spotify.com/user/kira_dune/playlist/6R8qFhM9fz1wH7HDy6RnH2)

* [Summer] (http://open.spotify.com/user/kira_dune/playlist/3ik8B8khvha1AzCxDOGhah)

* [Japan] (http://open.spotify.com/user/kira_dune/playlist/7dwSZUk0Y3db3Cq9G5rnv6)

* [Romantic] (http://open.spotify.com/user/kira_dune/playlist/2O24UH2XR9GFOhFZzFses0) Unbelievable effort, thank you for the music. Came in expecting some bogus tracks, noticed the eclectic selection and left pleased.

Add me on lastfm if you have it!  http://www.last.fm/user/CompSimpCarl Man, I put this shit on shuffle and it's the best road trippin' music! Seems interesting - I'll take a look at this when I can... But I must admit to having some sincere doubts about the "all genre" claim. wicks is amazing. I have been listening to it since you posted it last time a year or so ago. I have discovered so many wonderful tracks and artists from just putting it on random and letting it play. Thank you so much for creating it and advertising it here on Reddit! I know this is terrible of me but I hate how it isn't alphabetical So glad to see King Tuff on here! Kyle is my buddy and I'm a huge fan of his music. I'm gonna show him this.  I love Spotify and I love reddit &amp; you have merged the two for M3! I loveth you. happy to see FKA twigs - Two Weeks on here.  That song is awesome! I looked at your play list and clicked random songs to test how much i liked it....i haven't found one bad song.  You've just gained a spotify follower sir. You should throw in "I'm in love with the coco!" just to throw people off.. lol. Otherwise amazing playlist man. I'm trying to download every song on it and it's easily going to take 4 hours Wow dude we need to be friends right meow. The fact that you have "I Just Threw Out The Love Of My Dreams" makes me absolutely confident in this playlist. Gonna listen ASAP. (IJTOTLOMD is a fucking legendary song by the way) That might be my favorite weezer song. So solid. I'm not sure how deep you've gone in to the Weezer rabbit hole, but come to allthingsweezer.com if you want more of the like. I'd say that 5 of my top 20 Weezer songs were never officially released I checked it out, I clicked on 10 random songs throughout the list, and they ALL sounded like completely generic hipster indie music (my least favorite music in the world, it all sounds exactly the same). 

That was completely underwhelming because you said "ALL GENRES!"

Haha, yeah right. No metal? Da fuck, dude. Is there anyway this could be imported to Youtube? 

There are a significant number of people in the world where US streaming services do not extend to. Nevertheless, we still like our music. *puppy face* 

India, for example. ^^I'm ^^gonna ^^sneak ^^in ^^here ^^and ^^say ^^that ^^Spotify ^^is ^^Swedish, ^^not ^^American.

 Damn 'muricans and there stealing of our glorious streaming services. lemme save your life ... use Spotflux as a Proxy, and it works everwhere. That's why I included the tracklist. I realize it's tedious but paste any one of the names on that list in youtube and you'll pull it up. Not a playlist, but for some maybe the best option. Someone should write some code that searches the track list on YouTube and auto populates them into a playlist. I have no idea how to do that and have no idea if it's  easy, but reddit has worked its magic before so I figured I'd try to inspire someone. For all our foreign friends! Thank you for putting such effort into this, the world is a better place now. Stay awesome  I love, love, love your varied taste in music &lt;3 I love how you're trying to get people into being more open minded about music. You ROCK! thank you so much, musics like one of the top 3 things in life, i live with it, so i'm glad to share :) thanks! have a sweet day! You too! If I may ask, what are the other top things?  Food and love Amazing. I just gave the links to a few people in my office and they all love it too. Seriously, great job.

A couple of my recommended additions or just something to listen to:


[The Smiths- There is a Light That Never Goes Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-cD4oLk_D0)

[Led Zepplin- When the Levee Breaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NaQZojWi6U)

[Grizzly Bear- Ready, Able](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrGVa4lBEEA)

[Santigold- This isn't our Parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvVZi47gAqU)

[Banks- Waiting Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaI5JCxOCdw) Ugh. Not at all what it's billed as.  Thanks for the work, but no thanks.  Wonderful. Always looking to listen to new good tunes So glad to provide some, have a good one I'm just now listening to the first song and got pretty excited when I scrolled down the list to see the Flamingos. I wanted to hug you just for that. Thanks for making this playlist! I love you &lt;3 I love you too! Did a quick scan. +10 points for Megapuss. That is all. Nice list Thanks for this, and the discussion you opened up. I have been floundering around Spotify, trying to find good playlists. 

There is nothing better than sharing music The energy from this playlist is amazing! Thanks for sharing Holy shit. 

wicks. 

As i live and listen. Your playlist is top notch. Been following it all year, poaching my selects and building some lists off of that. 

Feel free to jump into my lists as well. 

https://play.spotify.com/user/bryandempler
 Dude I listen to Wicks every freaking day! thanks so much for your incredible work! I've found so many amazing artists from it! hey that is *so* cool to hear, i hope to keep it enjoyable, thank you very much-- Super rad (though I do wish Spotify let people add a little description about their playlists). 

Here's one I made with 11 hours of all excellent cover songs. I add new ones in batches every couple weeks.

Cheers! Loving the Wicks!  Digging the For Emma string version.   Also a fan of this playlist.  
Some of my fave music. 

http://open.spotify.com/user/billraney/playlist/2RnZ8FzWgn5XtrYdIQaVPD Thank you OP. I am listening to this on my 15 hour flight to Taiwan. Very good! It all feels right.... I'm so glad to see The Big Ship on this list. Great list. Wow. Great playlist. Thanks man! Read the description and was like meh..prob bunch of shit in here. Then read the track list and saw literally every genre and multiple favorites of mine. Definitely gonna put this on for my morning drives to work. Good job! Fan-fuckin'-tastic, 2totwo! Using this on Google Play Music, thank you so much!!  this is awesome OP!  I've been in bed sick all day, and this just made me so happy. Awesome playlist! Thanks for posting.  \#SixAlbumsAndAMovie This isn't the darkest timeline, yay! *dankest No Sorry.  It's okay. Wait, is there a movie? It's a Community reference. Ah.  darn. I think there's actually a Plastic Beach "movie" if you haven't seen it.

Edit: Community is also great imo, zombie and 8-bit Chevy Chase were just phenomenal. Plastic Beach was originally a project called "Carousel", which was going to be a movie before Albarn and Hewlett decided to pare it back a bit and just release an album. You can hear it in the various demos and tracks for PB: a lot of them contain instrumental bits that would sound at home in a score (Orchestral Intro), and the lyrical content clearly echoes some of the tropes of songs from musicals (setting-establishment [Welcome to the Plastic Beach/White Flag, Melancholy Hill, Cloud of Unknowing], character-establishment [Rhinestone Eyes, Sweepstakes]), much more so than Demon Days. 

I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a Gorillaz movie before all was said and done. [The Phase 4 look so far](http://imgur.com/GWACtYa.jpg)
This awesome collage was created by  /user/chrews be sure to give him a big hand! The hype train has left the station. CHOO CHOO OH SHIT, WE'RE GOING IN HOT!
Edit: I guess you can say we're...

*Coming up on the overload.*

...I'll see myself out. *mic drop*
*glares from everybody create an almost palpable cloud of hate* 1 ticket, please. May I still board said train? There's another one arriving shortly. That's actually not the Phase 4 2D. Right, forgot to mention that. We're really on edge over at  /r/gorillaz waiting for these Haha, no biggie, but I figured I'd add a mention here in the bigger thread. Plus the two photos posted today share the same background. Jamie's working on a group piece that's being edited on a computer. you can see the LCDs in the image!
 I keep seeing Gorilla2 Phase  4. 2gorilla4me How many times? 3 Definitely not Phase 4 2-D. That was from a while ago What even happened in Phase 3? I feel like we never got enough of a storyline, as sparse as the other phases were. Yeah we didn't get a music video for Rhine stone eyes and then we got that video sponsored by a shoe company  I don't like Noodle's new look t-t AND Modest Mouse? I've died and gone back to college...
 Modest Mouse too? Holy shit.  Dude they already released a single and everything where have you been? They already released 2 singles, where have you been?

He really sounds like he is talking in my head. It always gives me the chills.  Del the Funkee Homo Sapien is an amazing rapper. As a kid I was always scared shitless when this line came in You can thank fantastic production techniques for that, i think it's fuckin awesome.  ^^^ C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!!!!! ^^^ I still can't follow exactly what Del's talking about, but that verse gives me chills. I always thought he was just describing the power of music, with Del "being" music in the song. Like I always took the first line to be saying that by Russel playing the drums (under each snare) Del, as music incarnate, has been freed (out of my cage) and can do his thing.  And what he does as music is heal (don't be scared, good at repairs).  

I think this is reinforced by Del's other verse.  For instance, "Rhythm - You have it or you don't that's a fallacy - I'm in them - Every sprouting tree - Every child of peace - Every cloud and sea".  Kinda seems to me like he is saying that music is a unifying force.

 awesome concise analysis You're kind of right. In the band backstory Russel is possessed by the spirits of his former gang members who died in a drive by. The ghost in the music video is those spirits literally leaving Russels head to rap to him.  Honestly always thought this song had something to do with herion. Sunshine in a bag is a synonym for herion, and that first verse sounds like it's describing it pretty well. Throw that in with the rest of the chorus and the general feel of the song and I'd have to disagree with you, though you make a good point. IMO:




The verse speaks about the subconcious of the mind, hence *finally someone let me out of my cage* tells of your persona hidden whitin yourself, thats why he is counting no age, his abstract persona does not mind of something like that, but more of that in a minute.





*Naw you couldnt be there* 




is the tipical response that  a person gets  when that little voice inside of our heads starts talking, is not someone else who is inside of me or is it?





*naw you shouldn't be scared - I'm good at repairs - and I'm under each snare!* 




you should not try and fear for the thoughts that wonder in your mind, because it is these, that help you reason and understand the troubles of your life, also help you get with the beat. Makes sense since drummer players ussually play instinctively, subconciously, when you paly the drumms (snare) your not thinking but feeling the beat. therefore using your subconcious.





*Intangible; bet you didn't think so I command you to* 
Here he orders you to view things from another perspective and apreciate all that your mind can offer 




*panoramic view- look, I'll make it all manageble.* 
the subconcious helps you understand and make a desicion: 
*Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews. Chicks and dudes, who you really think is kickin' tunes?!* 




*Bitch, are you gettin' down in a picture tube?*
Picture tube is a television, and he is questioning wether you are going along the program society has placed in front of you




*Like you lit the fuse! You think it's fictional? Mystical? Maybe. Spiritual.*
You believe you started this thoughts? you did not, is not your imagination (fictional) is not something mistical but it is spiritual in nature





*Hero who appears to you to clear your views when you're too crazy.* 
When things are just too much for you to understand, it is your mind that helps you clear things, by the way of reason and understanding.




*Lifeless: to know the definition for what life is.* 
Here he tells you that you will not understand life until indeed you have died, a bit dark, but if you study esoterism and spiritualism, death is just another step in the process of ascencion.





*Priceless: to you because I put you on the hype shit. You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke; you're psychic among those possess you with one go!* 
This to you is priceless, not because you understand the hidden meaning, but because is what everyone is listening (hype) however those who are in a higher state of Conscience, will be spychic among those who posses you or in other words, are in charge. 





Gorillaz uses alot of hidden esoteric meanings into their songs, much like tool, their music is pricesless art and will endure the end of time, the reason why you can listen to it after so many years, is because subconciously your mind can catch these meanings even tho your concious mind does not understand it.  Love your explanations!
Differ only on this one:

&gt; Lifeless: to know the definition for what life is. Here he tells you that you will not understand life until indeed you have died, a bit dark, but if you study esoterism and spiritualism, death is just another step in the process of ascencion.


To *know the definition of life* is to inherently not *understand* life. To understand life, you have live it and question your knowledge.  If you *know* the definition of life, you have given up the pursuit of knowledge &amp; living life: lifeless.

The soul and the spillage The cup that runneth ova Retoin of da Oguh!!!  Close your eyes and see when there aint no light I knew that I would now DO0, dodo do doo,doo^^feel ^^good Gorillaz were hugely influential on my taste in music growing up. s/t dropped when I was 13, *Demon Days* when I was 17. I love those records so much. God it's so common to see how much of an influence Demon Days was for everyone.  I will defend that album as my #1 till the day I die.  This news makes me feel all tingly. I'm excited. Plastic Beach was incredible. Demon Days is of course a masterpiece. Even as experimental and weird as Gorillaz was, I still love it. As far as I'm concerned they only make quality music I liked a lot of songs in the D-sides album. It gave me one of my favorite gorillaz songs, Hong Kong. Amazing song Those first words.

Looooooooord, here me now... Junk boats and English boys.  Crashing out in super marts Electric fences and guns You heard the live version at Manchester? One of the few instances where I like listening to live vs studio. Yes! I had heard that version before. I didn't know if that was the one I'd listened too but it is. I just love his voice.

Have you heard his cover of The XX? [Gorillaz - Cover of The XX's "Crystalized"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CrahuW5fsc) If the voice is what does it for you, in the off chance that you aren't in the know, check out Damon Albarn's solo album. So fucking good. I listen to the self-titled album all the time. It came out when I was in 6th grade and I've loved them ever since. Every piece of theirs has hit a new chord for me. Incredibly excited for this news. Everyone always goes gaga over Demon Days(for good reason), but the first album is still my favourite.  The self titled wasn't that weird when it was released. Down tempo was probably at its peak at that point. Gorillaszhas always been amazing at portraying the cutting edge of pop with each album.  Am I the only one who didn't like PLastic Beach? I think it was just a massive departure in style and it threw me off. I loved Demon Days so much though, fantastic album.  I didn't like it initially, but to me, if their original album was the starting point stylistically, Demon Days took off in one direction from that. I see Plastic Beach as being the same distance in almost the opposite direction, which was jarring when I first heard it.

It's still not my favourite album, and I can't blame you if you find my explanation wanky and unsatisfying. I wanted The Fall to be another Plastic Beach level masterpiece, but it sure wasn't. The Fall wasn't really a full-on album. It was a concept album Damon made on an iPad while on tour. It's more of a side thing. With his iPad? *Fuck.* I guess I'm the asshole, then It was pretty fucking good for that tiny of a side-thing. I'm pretty sure it was over a two week span.  It was like 1 song a day for whatever city he visited. With an iPad, on a fucking tour bus. I think some people missed the concept of the Fall. It was very much an accidental album. But I actually really like the Fall. It's got some really cool sounds.  Yeah, it sort of was to Plastic Beach what G-sides and D-sides were to Gorillaz and Demon Days respctively, no?   Kind of. Both of the B-Sides albums were compilations of the B-Side tracks released with singles, but the Fall was all original songs. Take it how it is. It just seemed like a fun thing to do and he released it. I remember for the longest time I thought Laika Comes Home was a legitimate album before I figured out it was just a collection of B sides and shit.  I was already having a good day but this made my night!  Can you dig it like a spigot? My guess is yes you can like, can I kick it? wicked Who couldn't like Doom over a Gorillaz track?  the villain on a gorilla jawn? Something has started today All Caps when you spell the man's name.  How do people not know this by now? Because even his colleagues don't capitalize it. It looks really clunky and out of place whenever people type it and seems to me the only reason people do it is to show off that they're a fan. My favorite Gorillaz song! That makes this announcement all the more real, somehow. Liquor shot if you happy and you know it, as you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet, flowin'. Liquor shot, if youre happy and you know it as you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flow it Hope u brought yo spare tweetas

Mcs sound like cheereleaders Does Phase 4 mean we're finally going to get a movie as well? I've been waiting for that since I was 11.
This is still amazing news. I was so bummed thinking The Fall was the last album. The movie would be perfect.   Firing up some DELTRON 3030 in preparation and the autttommmattoorrr He's on the planet Earth and he's gonna stop the war of the worlds. Were Del, Kid Koala, or Automator involved since the first album? I believe they were only a part of the first album. Demon Days was produced by Danger Mouse.  Thank goodness. I heard they were going extinct. I hope elephants and tigers bounce back as well. I'm looking forward for some new species to evolve out of those innovative sons of bitches.  If people evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys ? Because fire is coming out of their heads. The mountain, called monkey, has spoken! Cause theyre caught up with the conflict between their brain and their tail. OH MY GOD DUUDE. ITS A LOGIC LOOP! IT GOES IN CIRCLE AND CIRCLES IT GOES IN CIRCLES AND CIRCLES MONKEY WHY? MONKEY WHY?

[............](http://d1w7nqlfxfj094.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/homer-simpson-bush-gif.gif) *random birdo appears* &lt;3 If Americans evolved from the Brits, then why are there still Brits? &gt; evolved

Haha [Tigers are making a comeback actually](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/12/121228-tigers-big-cats-animals-science-conservation-asia/) I know! I'm hoping they concentrate on their outfield this year. They have a solid infield but the errors last year killed their momentum. Ausmus knows what he's doing. I'm sure he'll setup the ol' Detroit Tigers for success next season.   This is awesome news of course but is anyone really surprised? I mean that's pretty much been their pattern right?

First big album Gorillaz was in 2000, Next was Demon Days in 2005, then Plastic Beach in 2010, Then The Fall (hesitant to count this one as it was composed as a side project during their tour), so it only makes sense that the next one would come out five years later right?  Well, after The Fall came out, Damon and Jamie had a falling out, and It appeared that we wouldn't get anything from the pair again. Even after they made up, it was still unclear if they would make another album together. If new project is produced by danger mouse I will *literally* cry I'd literally weep with happiness if another Del feature happens. Even more if another DOOM feature happens!

Who else do you think would fit well? They always have the most random features (Super Furry Animals, DOOM, Snoop, De La Soul, Bobby Womack, Little Dragon) but they all work so fucking well. All aboard the hype train! Setting off from the Plastic Beach! (Don't question the physics)

 IT'S A SEA TRAIN No, a Ghost Train. Everything leading up to Gorillaz was such a Blur Song 2 on repeat  Fun fact: It's called Song 2 because Blur was making fun of the fact that most American singles on the radio were the second track of the albums they came from. They made a song imitating their view of the songs that plauged American radio stations that all sounded the same. As it turns out, it became their most popular song.  Is Song 2 really more popular than Coffee and TV?  In America, by far. PARK LIFE Tragically obscure in North America.  American Blur fan here. Americans will recognize "Song 2" (more commonly known as "the woohoo song"), most will not have any idea who Blur is. Fans of Gorillaz should try 13 by Blur. The album tracks are deep, spacey and possibly their finest work.  Yeah I love this album! So many good tracks, and quite trippy.

I also really enjoyed The Great Escape. But they will know a gorillaz song, so when you tell them it's the same guy from "the woohoo song," their minds explode. &gt; /r/gorillaz
it was the good the bad and the queen Wow. I never made that connection. Crazy I never noticed that one. http://i.imgur.com/omauEx8.jpg

Calvin and Hobbes mashup I doodled in illustrator senior year....my aunt cleaned it up and printed it on a t shirt  Im so about to get a tattoo of this If you do...SEND ME A PIC! That's be freakin awesome! If you want I can send you the original doodle, it looks crappy, like I said t aunt fixed it up. She's a graphic designer Finally someone let them out of their cage! Time for us is somethin', cuz we're countin' our age. =( Please please please please PLEASE have Dan the Automator involved Apparently there was an album after Plastic Beach. Not sure how I missed that. A kind-of album. More of a side project.   It was to Plastic Beach as G-sides was to Gorillaz or D-sides to Demon Days, a side thing. This is probably a coincidence but The Gorillaz were my little brother's favorite band. He passed away two years ago to the day. He had always wanted to see them live but never got to.. Crazy that this was announced today.  Sorry for your loss. Maybe you should consider going in honor? I'm best friends with my brother and this is our favorite band. I can't image what you went through, but I feel like this comment resonates with me in a certain way enough to post this... definitely go to a show in his honor if you're ever able to! I'm so fucking happy right now I could stub my toe on a coffee table made of legos and it still wouldn't ruin my mood  You just went full super Saiyan dude  you're invincible  Agreed... I'm laid out in bed with a torn muscle in my neck, yet somehow this is a great day! Be cool if Del collab'd on the new album.  http://www.wonderingsound.com/hieroglyphics-del-funky-homosapien-souls-mischief-tajai-interview-ferguson-damon-albarn-death-grips/

"Del: Yeah, Ive been out with Damon Albarn. I talked to him on the bus, and he was like  the Gorillaz stuff was almost accidental, so he was like, basically, What if we really did it on purpose, what could we come up with? Hes a cool dude. We were on the bus chatting or whatever, behind stage, before the show. We really like each other, so he was like, Yeah, lets try to hook up and do some stuff. So yeah, thats a big possibility."
 That was the first thing that popped into my head too. I'm hoping Del and Automator both get in on this. Those two working together can do no wrong.  Possibly an unpopular opinion, but Melancholy Hill was my favorite. Always excited to see new music from bands I grew up with. Not close to an unpopular opinion, but yes - Melancholy Hill is a brilliant song. I'm happy, feeling glad!  As much as I want Blur to make a new album, I know they want to pull a RATM move and perform their greatest hits instead of making new tracks. Gorillaz though, they cover a wide range of genres, it`s expected they release new material. Don't stop. Get it, get it. Holyyy FUCK YES! I am excited.  [Here's the working version of the link if OP's didn't work for you](http://pitchfork.com/news/58282-gorillaz-creator-jamie-hewllet-confirms-groups-return-on-instagram/).  So HYPED! Now this is good news! YAY Aww yiss... Wow, that is surreal. I literally just woke up an hour ago from a dream that they'd released a new music video. http://i.imgur.com/t3vdt2h.gif?gifm Creator confirms group return... on instagram. I look forward to grooving So warm, so fuzzy, so happy. Coming on to the overload YES. Love me some Gorillaz. Fantastic artists.  Fuck yes When they referred to the fall being the last album.... C'mon that hardly counts
 Had no idea they went somewhere This is fantastic news. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH OH MY GOD Now this really "Feel Good Inc."  Fuck yes!! Finally! Man I'm so ready. ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN Yeayesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!$@&amp;#+$&amp;@+#+!!!!!!!!! I first read this as, "Godzillas are back."
Sorry Japan [Nice](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-movie-image-031.jpg) i hope they go back to a sound more like they did in demon days rather than plastic beach and the fall it is mostly that they are lacking in vocals i miss with there later stuff. Excuse me while I go lose my shit. Here's hoping for another Demon Days rather than The Fall. Allow me to make this child-like in nature:

Gorillaz, you have them or you don't. 

That's a fallacy.  Hewlett's been tied up with the return of Tank Girl for the past year or so (my book from the kickstarter arrived today!), but I'm glad he's returning to this.  There was a tank girl reboot? Yep. It was a kickstarter last year. Ended up going WELL over the funding too. Hopefully this means more. I think the most important thing about the first two albums was that they each had a really strong Hip Hop producer behind them. I hope they get someone strong to do some work on the next one. I was just not interested in Plastic Beach at all, personally.


How about Run the Jewels? No I wonder what they'd sound like if it were produced by flying lotus. A Flying Lotus/Captain Murphy collab would literally be perfect Even though I love RTJ, I don't think their style would quite match up with the Gorillaz. If Killer Mike and/or El-P show up on a Gorillaz track it might just be amazing. I would love to listen to that track if it ever released. Saw them in Denver last night.  
So. Fucking. Good.  This band has become my all-time favourite band. I'm not just saying that. I pride myself on having a large music vocabulary ranging from classical to jazz to rap to oldies to soul and folk, but the Gorillaz themselves are so great because of the variety of amazing sounds they can make, while keeping their own uniqueness.
Favourite Songs: November Has Come, To Binge, Melancholy Hill

*Keep looking out on the day of another dream,* folks *When you can't get what you want, but you can get me* /r/iamverysmart FINALLY, SOMEONE LET THEM OUT OF THEIR CAGE.  Please tour. Please tour. Please tour. This news made me all giddy inside.  Yes. I had a shit day today. [BUT THIS IS TOTALLY WICKED!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TiWg7L0NJYU) Does your username ever work? Fuck yea! What are the best songs by the Gorillaz?

The ones I know I like are: "Feel Good, Inc", "Melancholy Hill", "Dare", "Clint Eastwood", and (to a lesser extent) "19-2000" Some other cool ones are Superfast Jellyfish, Pirate Jet, Punk, Latin Simone (the spanish version, the english version on D-sides isn't so great), and check out the entire Laika Come Home album.

And yes, Empire Ants fuckin rules. Superfast Jellyfish and Pirate Jet are two of my favourite songs to come from Plastic Beach. Some really good jams are "M1-A1", "November Has Come", "Bobby in Phoenix", "Empire Ants", and "Dirty Harry". Listen to them now. "Empire Ants" featuring Little Dragon (on their Plastic Beach album), "Tomorrow Comes Today", "Don't Get Lost in Heaven" which transitions into "Demon Days" as well as "Dirty Harry" are good too. Left hand Suzuki method and m1a1.. You Missed El Manana and Spitting Out The Demons. yay He really let you down. Better just give up. I think you got those two jokes turned around. Do you feel like they deserted you? Did it make you cry? Did he say goodbye? It was all a lie. Total eclipse of the heart.... wait!.... awww shit

~Rick Astley Oh geez, you're right. I thought I was on /r/funny for a moment! You really think people would do that? Just lie on the internet? It's on the Internet so it must be true.  It is.  Totally happened to this guy I work with once.  True story. The sarcasm is strong in this one It wasn't even remotely funny. Is this what this sub has become?  Lame jokes that are barely relevant to music in any way? This horse has been beaten to death shortly after the internet was created.  It was? It wasn't very funny then.

Also, is it even legal to sell a copied cassette? you wouldn't copy a cassette Well, we used to, but that was last century, so.... Try millenar I guess for the same reason I bought the LP, for shits and giggles. I wonder if it was an original cassette that was overwritten My all time favorite Rick Roll will forever be the 2008 Macys day Parade. Mostly because I saw it live and nobody seemed to understand what was happening. [shit quality video](http://youtu.be/9i7B5aHafc0) but the first I found  My favorite has to be the time I got Rick Rolled by a bar band. Mid set they broke into a rock cover of it. Once the mainstream media gets a hold of a meme, it's no longer cool or funny. It's like your parents liking the same things you do as a teenager. [Explained by this graphic](http://i.imgur.com/9tE01dK.jpg?1) That's a great graphic. Example 1:  Harlem Shake.  Fastest rise and decline. Actually, i think it skipped right to death from "clever remashes". I think it's actually pretty awesome.  The dude had practically no spotlight anymore, then the meme blew up and next thing you know, he's on the Macy's Day Parade. Pretty cool if you ask me That was the day the Rickroll died.  It did go out with all the pomp and circumstance it deserved, but it made me just a little sad to see the Rickroll go. It died HARD when Rick Astley appeared at the Macy's Thanksgiving parade and "Rick Rolled" himself - the toupee and whole execution failed, total.gross.fail. 


 ...yes?  You do realize that's the video they're talking about, right? Holy shit was it really that long ago that Rick rolling was a thing?  it lasted forever though.

It was still somewhat of a thing when I joined reddit Took me a few to realize it was a video of a tv monitor... for the genre of video types - if there is one - this is was very well done. Wow, I am getting really down into the weeds with my critiques. I remember seeing that live and cracking the hell up. That may have been the best Rickroll ever. I'm not gonna click any link in this thread. [Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQoA_wjmE9w) i almost believed you too!!
 That was quite good  http://imgur.com/9zO3mPM ha look at this mother fucker I found at a thrift store It's round, so it actually will roll! Before Daft Punk's album Random Access Memories came out, there was apparently a leak of the album available for torrent. When I went to download it and listen to it, it was 12 tracks of Avicii's levels.... Lol kind of reminded me of that  Reminds me when weezers new album was supposed to leak and some guy just filled it with random pictures and 3 songs we already had Oh man, you got rickrobbed. but shit it was 99 cents! I'm hella happy. that's a bargain, bitch. Walk in the club like "What up? I got a big *Rick*" 
 He actually says "cock", not "dick". Now, that's a rooster, son. What's he doin' with that large rooster?! I couldn't help but hear this in Mel Blancs iconic voice.  &gt; Now, that's - I say - that's a rooster, son. What's he fixin' to do with that large rooster?!

I have I feeling I know what that video is. I like to clear my cache and relive the present every once in a while.  The URL looks fucking familiar.  When I see a purple link to a video and I haven't seen videos related to the topic at hand I always assume it's either Rick Astley or the wheelchair scene from Mac and Me. Someone should dub the song over that video and troll people with links to it I have returned with bullet holes in my chest. Yes, it was a Rick Roll. :( &gt;watch?v=dQw

 I recognize that It's burnt into our memory. speak for yourselves ;) I can't believe I actually fell for this. I am way too stoned. I just watched the whole thing for the first time. I am not ashamed. I love the back flip guy  Oh fuck you, not falling for this one.
 Wasn't he amazing? Especially in slo-mo off the wall. Idk what was up withy the wierd head twitch though  It's a great video, really. :)  I love this song, so I appreciate a proper rickroll, it's always a pleasant surprise.  I just realized I've heard the first few seconds hundreds of times but I've never heard the ending.

What is it like? It's like falliing in love in the 80's. The clothing is questionable but the enthusiasm is unmistakable. I knew what is was going to be, but I am stoned, so I just wanted to giggle and groove I'm not stoned, saw the preview, still went for it... I fell for it and I wasn't stoned.

I bet you even have [/r/sexwithdogs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/2sqcrr/i_got_reverse_rickrolled/) purple you sick fuck. risky click. ^I ^don't ^know ^why ^I ^clicked ^it  Joke didn't work out well for me. That link is blue because you linked it with https:// I guess?

I also have /r/sexwithdogs purpled. # WHY IS THAT LINK PURPLE AAARGH! First time I've ever watched the whole music video all the way through  since I have been rick rolled before it's already purple lol You mahderfahcker  Thank you youtube ads!  i never learn.

I am a robit.
 It's probably a bad sign when you start letting yourself get rick rolled just for the nostalgia. Joke or not I actually like that song. It's a good song. [Me too](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ4kBr7bF80) One of my biggest fears are songs in reverse. I don't know why, it just creeps me out. I think you've discovered the Anti-Rickroll. You may be immune to getting Rickrolled while it remains in your possession. [Well in that case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPYZpwSpKmA). My friend Rick-Rolled himself during a podcast we were recording. He found a soundboard to play random special effects during the show. He pressed random ones to see what they were and he ended up Rick rolling himself. [Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/XxNWAQD.png)

 Thats rerickulous. Sounds like something Scooby Doo would say You bought a cassette tape?  What year is it? I actually got Rick Astley on LP for free when I was shopping for used things in a recycle place. Don't blame Rick. *He'd* never let you down. ITT 80's nostalgia circlejerk, and I love it.  My room mates and I were on mushrooms once, and were hanging out on the stoop of a condemned house. There was a box of cassette tapes in it, and one was the cassette you speak of. I had no clue who Rick was at the time, and my room mate took the cassette.. I learned who Rick was the following day, and the following week, and the following month... I bought that same Rick Astley album on cassette from a record store. Initially as a gag, but then loved it! Together Forever, Don't Say Goodbye, Whenever You Need Somebody are great tracks! /r/dadjokes You bought a cassette?  What year is it? You know the game and you're NOT gonna play it. OP confirmed -- Astley is a liar. I'm calling bullshit, there's no way you have a cassette player! You underestimate the power of the hipster, my friend.  Wouldn't a hipster have a turntable and the vinyl version of that album? Amateurs. Get back to me when you're rocking 8-track or reel-to-reel. Hell yes! 8-track for life! pff fucking conformist. 

Rick astley musical box or gtfo.  Can confirm - have both turntable and vinyl. I have one hooked to my ZX spectrum.  Yup, cassettes are coming back. I know a few local artists putting stuff out on cassette.  They're cheap and they're odd. I think Guardians of the Galaxy did them a huge favor. Probably sick of hearing it. OP(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) So basically he was telling the truth when he said he was Never Gonna Give You Up I bet he ran around and hurt you dickrolled
 I bought the real cassette and made copies of just NGGYU on both sides...was bored and no girlfriend. Now i have some 90 minute cassettes full of that song on A&amp;B sides.  yay Are you sure it was the album that the track was on? The "new" Rick Roll for those who haven't seen it. No music involved but well done. http://youtu.be/uxsWjeiQ76s This feels as though it originated as a shower thought, i.e what if someone bought Rick Astley's Greatest Hits that didn't have Never Gonna Give You Up, and then the OP just decided to say it actually happened. Wouldn't reverse rickrolled be when you are expecting something weak and pop-culturey but instead get something strong and original?

To me getting reverse rickrolled would be enjoying star wars 7. i just rickrolled myself on purpose. i liked it.  #RupertsFault I bet he even ran around... what is rick ross was really rick astley in disguise? would he say, "everyday i am hustlin' cause i'm never gonna give you up"? The Dropkick Murphys went out to Wisconsin to campaign against Scott Walker during the whole anti-union debacle a few years ago...  They sold t-shirts to in support of Wisconsin unions with the lyrics to Take 'Em Down printed on the back.  They played anti-Scott Walker rallies.

Why the fuck would he use their music? 

Edit:  Unless it's a deliberate fuck you to the band... Which it probably is!   Fair enough.  (Or a dumb intern.) Or a very clever intern.  Or that.   Or this.  [What's this?] ( http://media.tumblr.com/01e912760b4e2301c1f44a18a26b84f2/tumblr_inline_mn8m89fhxM1qz4rgp.gif) I'm sure one will be thrown under the bus regardless. Born in the USA stills gets played at political rallies despite it's other lyrics.  shipped me off to a foreign land to go and kill the yellow man, I was born in the USA It's really catchy, but people forget songs have meaning sometimes. It's, in a way, a grudgingly nihilistic song that is very critical of both America &amp; blind patriotism. I'd love to have seen Obama use that song amid all the birther nonsense. The chorus playing while a blown-up image of his birth certificate is projected behind him, that would've been great. Because honestly, where else is it really relevant in a political sense that you were indeed born in the USA? It's generally a requirement. I think only presidents have to have been born in the US or like McCain as a naturalized citizen. You've heard the other lyrics though? It's pretty damn anti-american, well anti-US govt anyways. Should be fortunate son at all the rallies, still in sigon as any vote for war is cast. It probably is a fuck you to the band. Plus, the band typically has no decision in these matters. Most of the time, the band can raise holy hell, but it's the record label that controls the rights. If the music is cleared properly, they can't do much more than whine.  Same reason Paul Ryan loves Rage Against the Machine Possibly because he just likes the music regardless of their ideology? Not everything in life has to regard politics and ideology. I'm not going to boycott listening to someone because they show communist tendencies. That's immature and shallow. I love Green Day. Their political views are angsty teenager idealistic shit. I still love American Idiot. Precisely. I love Childish Gambino and Rise Against, but I'd never have a political conversation with them because of their views. Honest question: Are Rise Against considered radical lefties in the US? Really, Dropkick Murphys aren't a recognizable enough name? We have to go with the vague and generic "Celtic punk band?" 

Edit: Look guys, I'm sure there are plenty of people who didn't know who Dropkick Murphys were until reading this story. I don't need each and every one of you to reply to me telling me about how you just found out who these guys are. The point is that this is the music subreddit, and the band name would be more appreciated than some no information filler. Hell, the post about this in the Politics thread names the politician AND the band.  That's honestly the only reason I clicked the link. I was curious who this nameless, presumably obscure Celtic punk band who isn't the Dropkick Murphys is. When I saw it was in fact the Dropkick Murphys I said "Oh" and exited the article.  It's quite possible the vague term "Celtic punk band" was used to generate curiosity (and therefore pageviews). So it's used as some sort of bait for clicks? You might say so, yeah. Some also use that technique to feed the buzz. Well, there are 10 reasons why it actually works. Maybe you'd like to see them? Is one of them going to surprise me? I like surprises. You won't believe what #1 is. So make sure you click all the way through the slide show.   Holy shit! It's even says it's happening right here in the town I'm in! How have I not heard about it?! You were too busy looking at twelve unbelievable cat stories. Wait, sorry. Unbelievably *touching* cat stories. Unbelievably touching cat stories who *saved their owners' lives*.

... at Iowa State University. Nope, it's going to disappoint you and ruin the rest of your day. Governors hate them! They honey-clicked us! No!  But we were honey-clicking them!   Maybe we can start calling these sorts of article baitclick. because like you click the bait. Wait though, remember that this is actually an Irish daily.  I'm American, so I don't know how popular DM is in Ireland but I wouldn't assume their global fame matches their regional renown. 

I imagine that in Ireland they have Irish punk bands that are, you know, Irish? This is it. To be honest, DM aren't massive here. Unsurprisingly, we have our music so we don't need to listen to that kind of a crap, crass pastiche.

Ah, low blow. Only messin like.

But still, they're not huge here. I love them, but I would've described them as a Boston punk band if anything.  Yeah, I reckon they'd be a fun band to see live, if you got absolutely steaming first. That song in The Departed gets you going. It's great to play in the car if you're on your way to the bar with your boys getting ready for a wild night, but it's one of my least favorites in general. They put on a great live show. Highly recommended! Paganviews? Hey, Flogging Molly is also a big deal. Bigger, IMO. I dunno. I can't think of a Flgging Molly song that came close to the popularity of Shipping Up to Boston Shipping Up to Boston is the most popular Celtic punk song around. However in general I'd say Flogging Molly is more popular than The  Dropkick Murphys  At least better if not bigger. Well, it could have been flogging molly Could have been Flogging Molly, but I was hoping to learn of a new Celtic Punk band. The Pogues  Have you heard Tuatha De Danaan? Celtic hard rock/metal from Brazil.  In the same vein, Scott Walker isn't a pretty well known Republican governor by now? He's also decidedly anti-union which pretty much automatically puts him on the Shitlist for them... Well, yes. The Murphys released a special track to raise funds for the union folks when they were in a fight with Walker. I suspect he is trolling them. Which, politics aside, is awesome. A sitting politician trolling a band that did everything they could to support his recall. Walker just pays his license fees and keeps playing their music.... Troll.  Most people outside the US. Right? That's what bugged me the most about this whole ordeal. At first I thought it was gonna be Flogging Molly having a row with someone.  Agreed. And to add an extra level to it, Massachusetts just elected a Republican governor, though, being from Massachusetts and all, he's very middle of the road. My first thought was "Well it's probably not the Murphys, because Charlie Baker shouldn't inspire "literal hatred."  They don't hate MA's governor, they hate Paul Walker. Scott*

I don't *think* they hate a dead dude That's actually pretty funny so I'm not going to correct it. 

I wonder how they feel about Vin Diesel? They're a Boston punk band that identifies by their Irish roots. I don't think I've ever heard them referred to as Celtic. They are the Southiest band to ever Southie, they are Irish American, Working Class, Bruins fans.. They certainly seem to think so: http://www.dropkickmurphys.com/ I have always referred to them, the Pogues, Flatfoot 56 and to an extent Flogging Molly as celtpunk.  Honestly, this is certainly just an opinion, but I would say Drunken Lullabies was Flogging Mollys "punk" album. They're kinda their own thing. &gt;They're kinda their own thing 

Isn't that punk? Oh now you've done it. Now this thread is a "X is/is not punk" argument. Ready for some dismissive condescension alternating with profanity and personal attacks? You're right though X is not punk. They totally sold out. Never heard of them. If you're being serious, [you're in for a treat](http://grooveshark.com/#!/dropkickmurphys). Best drinking music ever. Alestorm is a very close 3rd (as Dropkick Murphy's and Flogging Molly tie for first). I love Alestorm. I just love the fact that a group of guys got together and one guy said "Let's make a metal band" and all the other guys were like "Fuck yeah" and the first guy said "and let's only sing about piratey shit" and the other guys were like "FUCK YEAH". And they're awesome at it.

[Alestorm - Shipwrecked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDOFzu-6MD4) I actually like Flogging Molly a little bit more than Dropkick, they have so many awesome songs like:

[Don't Shut Em Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOiLVo8yIJE)

[What's Left of the Flag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDgkFPIStxI)

[Drunken Lullabies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89NjEeHku8o)

[Devil's Dance Floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPaz0p2dpEk)

[Seven Deadly Sins ^\(Edit)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6-dO3Oq6G0)

[Tobacco Island! How did I forget this one? ^\(Edit)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uCOrLJ_rQQ)


However, Dropkick's got a lot of fantastic songs too, like:

[Shipping Up to Boston; everyone's favorite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-64CaD8GXw)

[The Green Fields of France, which brings a tear to my eye if I think about it too much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_G4eq9Fudc)

[The State of Massachusetts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzF0hHb7xMc&amp;list=PLB201292D0F9BAB89)

[~~Drink and Fight~~ (Edit: Not actually them, apparently)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5KqEQvgYyk)

[The Spicy McHaggis Jig ^\(Edit)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZN3weW1udE)

[Barroom Hero ^\(Edit)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mii1a6FKB28)

Alestorm's just straight up fun:

[Keelhauled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta-Z_psXODw)

[Shipwrecked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggyC0FOzqHM)

(You're obviously familiar with these, The links are for the three people on the planet who aren't) No Barroom Hero or Spicy McHaggis Jig? Im a big fan of [Kiss Me I'm Shitfaced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YOEO7jtIs4) Admittedly, I do prefer Flogging Molly slightly more because they have more variety in their music. Dropkick Murphy's have great songs but many of them are too similar sounding for me to get really really into them- though I appreciate their lyrics and covers. Alestorm is purely 100% for kicks and giggles and pints. Where's [Kiss Me I'm Shitfaced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YOEO7jtIs4) ???  Anyone who can get me to lose my shit while drinking to a song called "Death Throes of the terror Squid" gets my vote. Try [this](http://youtu.be/cXy6JHYa5Ks) on for size I think we can all agree that [Barroom Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpIVk2AY3sw) is a great drinking song regardless if you're Irish or not.  The Tossers are better.  Neither have I. The article is published in an Irish newspaper and anyone here suggesting that a semi-famous punk band from Boston might not be internationally worldwide immediately recognized by every person in the universe is getting downvoted. 

Shit subreddit is shit.

 I've never heard of the Dropkick Murphys. If you've seen The Departed then you've heard em. Why in the world would you be downvoted for this?! I've never heard of them either... I'm Irish and have never heard of them &gt;  Dropkick Murphy's

Well, even you got their name wrong, so... maybe? My mistake, that is my inner Umphrey's McGee fan surfacing. Thanks for letting me know.  Ken Casey of the Murphys, a Democrat, also stumped for Massachusetts' new Republican governor, and they played at an inauguration event for him, [for context](http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2015/01/06/dropkick-murphys-will-play-charlie-baker-event-friday-because-course-they-will/4ZGqzjxWvjwMPlsmyOlq0H/story.html). They are solidly pro-Union, however, which is probably where a lot of the literal hate comes from. A Republican from Massachusetts is far more left than a Democrat from most other places. Wait....this seriously happened? Color me surprised. Exactly, the point is that this guy is politically anathema to the band, they aren't exactly subtle in their support of organized labor.

Here is at least one example from Sing Loud, Sing Proud: Which Side are You On?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVMZUwFFJCc&amp;index=3&amp;list=PL4lVd8L3ra0G2ZMq0i90BDKbgZpY9LMx7 Not a Dropkick original, that's a tune from the Gilded Age :) which we apparently are reviving :( It's Massachusetts. Everything can make sense one day and then the next day nothing makes sense. I prefer it that way. Keeps things fresh. Of course I may or may not be over simplifying things...but I gotta run now... buying three shovels and six snow tubes. No, Irish newspaper whose website I have never visited and likely never will again, I don't want to download your app before I even read the article.  I literally hate their website Bruce Springsteen feels the same way about Chris Christie.  
   Edit: http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/09/the-sad-vulnerability-of-chris-christies-bruce-springsteen-birthday-tweet/380671/
 &gt;it's a death trap

&gt;It's a suicide rap

Definitely about New Jersey  The entire song is about wanting to *leave* Jersey! Don't take the bridge if Christie is still governor, though. As a Jersey native I agree. The last line is pure gold I mean seriously, I don't understand why every person of Irish descent regardless of ideology feels the need to love the Murphs. They're a punk band- the polar opposite of conservatism. Not only that, but the original Irish immigrants were entirely lower class and only rose up once they were unionized, so it's awfully ironic how an ancestral Irishman could be anti-union. You know the old saying, teach a man to fish and then steal his fish.  I've always heard, "Give a man a fish, he owes you a fish. Teach a man to fish and he owes you a lot more." No the old saying goes:  Give a man a fish, and he owes you a fish plus interest.  Give ~~a~~ everyone in the community a fish, then group the ones who have no intention of paying you back, sell that group's debt as a AAA rated investment vehicle to some sucker while assuring him that the risk is properly diversified.   You were lucky to have such an enlightened upbringing. My dad's advice stopped at "Don't be a fucking asshole" Shit man, this is America! how the fuck are you supposed to make money with that life lesson? You forgot to tell your mates to place bets on the AAA rated investments going badly, so they can get loads of fish. Teach a man to fish so that someday he can gut the education budget so no future generation can get fish for themselves. That somehow seems a little different from how I remember it. Teach a man to fish but charge $20,000 a year to do so? Don't forget the fish center fee. And the mandatory fish insurance. Also a fish plan while they're learning to fish. Fishs One thing about Irish Americans is there are quite a lot of us.  Urban, working class, and trade union membership are characteristics of one segment.  But I live in a rural area, which is heavily Irish. I can say that those of Irish descent I know are conservative, religious, farmers and business owners. This is the audience Scott Walker is trying to appeal to.  Politicians usually have an excellent grasp of demographics and psychographics of their constituencies, or they don't stay in office too long. You must not have heard about Johnny Ramone. Being punk does not necessarily mean you are the polar opposite of being conservative. I'm pretty sure the Misfits are all conservatives as well.  Not all punk is the polar opposite of conservatism. A heck of a lot of punk is right wing.  It's kinda like how every Irish-American feels the need to be a fan of the ND Fighting Irish  Perhaps they just like the tunes.  Punk rock is definitely not literally the polar opposite of conservatism.  ESPECIALLY not the punk rock which claims roots in Oi!  Oh no, are we gonna start debating the meaning of punk. This discussion always leads nowhere It's anti-authoritative music. There. Done. What do you call Jewish supremacist punk music calling for violent action?

*Oi gevalt...* What do you call Jewish Supremacist punk music which is greater than the sum of its violent parts?  Oi Gestalt. What do you call Jewish Supremacist punk music that is played when no other selection is made? Oi Default. Why would someone who likes the dropkick Murphys be anti union? 

Signed an irishman who dislikes their music.  good point.

signed: an irishman who is a bit mystified by any Irish trad/punk combo that isn't named The Pogues punk music is often pro-union, working class, skinhead OI OI OI.

politicians are usually pretty clueless though. My favorite instance of musicians' disgust with their song usage:

&gt;Artist: Gretchen Peters

&gt;Song: "Independence Day"

&gt;Controversy: Peters wrote the 1993 country hit, recorded by Martina McBride and used during Sarah Palin's introduction at a rally. Peters lashed out at the campaign, saying "The fact that the McCain/Palin campaign is using a song about an abused woman as a rallying cry for their Vice Presidential candidate, a woman who would ban abortion even in cases of rape and incest, is beyond irony. They are co-opting the song, completely overlooking the context and message, and using it to promote a candidate who would set women's rights back decades."

&gt;Result: Peters is taking the matter into her own hands: She's donating all of the election season royalties of the song to Planned Parenthood and is encouraging people to make similar donations under the name "Sarah Palin."

In defense of Republicans, they probably don't have as many musical choices to play at their events.  You can only use Cat Scratch Fever so many times.   Naw they can also use Meatloaf, Kid Rock, and the country genre. Not even the entire country genre. Probably safest to just say Toby Keith.  Toby Keith has actually endorsed Obama in both elections.  &gt; Toby Keith

[Toby's not even a 100% safe bet for a conservative message.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Keith#Political_beliefs)

Best to stick with the Motor City Madman. &gt;and the country genre.

I doubt Willie Nelson would be pleased with any republican using his music. [deleted] We could jam to the Ramones, Meatloaf, Megadeth, uh... Do not a long list off the top of my head but pretty distinguished It's really only Johnny Ramone that was a republican and he didn't write any songs anyway.

 In Ramones only Johnny was republican, Dee Dee wrote Bozo goes to pitchburg about Regan  Alice Cooper? Oh yeah, forgot about the Godfather of Shock Rock. [deleted] This reminds me of the time Paul Ryan said Rage Against the Machine was one of his favorite bands.  They sent him a letter to the effect that "you *are* the machine that we rage against." Was it really "they," or was it just Tom Morello? I have a DKM shirt that was produced as a fundraiser for pro-Union protests against Walker that feature the words "TAKE EM DOWN" on the front. Very ambiguous political statement, I can see how walker could make this mistake. /s Still not as funny as Paul Ryan saying he is a huge Rage Against the Machine fan.  Do these guys even try to interpret the lyrics? Not defending anything about Paul Ryan, but it is definitely possible to like music without listening/assigning a lot of weight to the lyrics.  Or even agreeing with them. I listen to music that has themes I don't necessarily agree with, but I still enjoy the music  I listen to Suicide Silence but im not planning on bludgeoning you until "the doctors wont be able to recognize your FUCKING FACE" Well is that the message of the music, or the lyrics?  
If it's the message, that's an oddly specific message to send to people. Right?

I'm a big fan of Lennon's imagine, but I'm not a fucking marxist. 

Do you not understand how this is possible dropkick murphys and reddit?  

 Right, but you wouldn't play that to pump yourself up before engaging in a firefight on a mission in Fallujah or something. Or maybe you would I dunno. I mean, yeah, it doesn't have the beat to be a pump up song, but the dropkick murphys certainly do.  Imagine you painted a picture symbolising your hatred of conservatism, and then a Conservative party adopted a symbol from the picture as their logo. You'd feel like they were misusing your art, right? That's the same thing. They make music expressing their political views, and then a politician whom they vehemently oppose goes ahead and uses their music to symbolise his identity. It's not a crime, it's not even *technically* immoral, but it does leave a bad taste in the mouth. It's like when British Airways used 'London Calling' by The Clash in their adverts for the London Olympics - the song in no way expresses love or longing for London. This.

I generally disagree with RATM's political views (they do have some good points, though), yet I love their music.

I also like As I Lay Dying and For Today (christian metal bands) although I'm an agnostic leaning towards atheism.
 I, too, am an As I Lay Dying fan, but I don't support Tim Lambesis' views on hiring a contract killer to murder your wife. Certain Christian values confuse me. and, i mean, i've met plenty of contract killers who hate AILD, so it goes both ways For those who don't know:  

["Paul Ryan Is the Embodiment of the Machine Our Music Rages Against"](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tom-morello-paul-ryan-is-the-embodiment-of-the-machine-our-music-rages-against-20120816) - Tom Morello I don't think Paul Ryan gives a fuck what Tom M says.   Maybe not personally, but he likely chose it politically to look cool to the 90's kids who are now mid 30's voters.  If that was his tack, then he definately cares what Tom Morello ~~thinks~~ says. Tom Morello is fucking idiot who makes excellent music.  A fucking idiot with a degree from Harvard. I think he's a close relative of Jomo Kenyatta, which might have helped his Harvard application.

I'm very much a leftist but I can't take RATM seriously.  However, their songs are great when you are exercising or angrily assembling IKEA furniture. Ah yes, the guy who rails against capitalism and wealth but lives in a gated community. A lot of fratty types in the 90s *loved* RATM and seemed oblivious to their politics. I don't know Paul Ryan's life story, but he strikes me as someone who was a fratty type in the 90s. Huge rage fan. Don't agree with any of there lyrics.  The song he was using was written by Woody Guthrie. How culturally ignorant is this union-busting governor that he would even consider using a song by Guthrie?  Saw Arlo a couple of years back, very good gig. He was touring playing his dad's music. He was telling us a story, and started playing Alice's Restaurant to accompany. And when he realised, he started fucking with us, and went back to his dad's music. Well played, sir. Huh? Looks at his shirts, he loves iron-y

I hate myself for this one Lol Woody Guthrie is literally a socialist.  "I ain't a communist, but I been in the red all my life."
-Woody Guthrie Celtic folk musicians to The Drop Kick Murphies: "Stop using our name, we literally hate you."

(I like the DKMs.  But I really wouldn't call it Celtic.) &gt; But I really wouldn't call it Celtic

It's barely music. Bagpipes and screaming. More like an Irish call to battle.  I don't understand why they put on an Irish accent. It's fucking painful when you know they're American. Don't think they have an accent, you really mean flogging molly than the singer is Irish  I unsubscribed from /r/politics to escape the republican hate circlejerk... I love how in the comments section of the article itself everyone agrees with what the Dropkick Murphys did, while everyone here on reddit seems to be be bitching (as usual.)

The Dropkick Murphys dislike Walker because he's anti-union. They, on the other hand, are pro-union. So that's probably a reason why they don't want him using their music.

It has absolutely nothing to do with being a "whiny liberal." You asshats, it's called standing up for what you believe in.  All I can focus on is 

&gt;Dropkick Murphys have effectively sent a cease and desist warning

I lol'd. Have fun bringing that to court. "But, we told him to stop on Twitter!"  This really confused me because the other headline was "Dropkick Murphys ask Scott Walker to stop using their music" and i was really confused because i thought they meant Scott Walker the musician, figured he was doing bad covers or something... All I thought when saw the post title:  Hate is a terrible poison to society that must be challenged... Oh unless it's a republican, it's okay to hate them. reddit logic. This happens every election season and it always amuses me. 

I was amused when Paul Ryan said RATM was one of his favorite bands, apparently he's never actually *listened* to the lyrics. Or the zillions (including Ronald Reagan) who never paid attention to the lyrics of "Born in the USA." Didn't Bruce come out and say something about that when it was happening?

I know Mellencamp told someone that they couldn't use Pink Houses. The Coug is a pretty cool guy  "We can't even right now" I tend to notice Republicans coming under fire for using music and getting backlash from the artists. Are there any cases where this has happened with Dems?

Side note, my favorite mention of music likes by a politician is Paul Ryan's love for RATM. Just assuming from the name "Celtic Punk band" Its the Dropkick Murphys  The funny thing about the article is that I am fully aware of who the Dropkick Murphy's are, but had no clue who Scott Walker was. Why couldn't they just put "Dropkick Murphys" in the title instead of doing the whole fucking click-bait thing? God damn I hate that. I subscribe to this sub for the music. Not the politics. 
Also, you could have just said dropkick Murphy's. They aren't some obscure hipster band anymore. I don't get it....

 Deluded. Don't forget "Elizabeth Warren says N" ---jerking it, jerking it Better than figuratively hating him I guess. [deleted] Last DM show I took my wife and I went to (in FL) I jokingly said, "The only bad thing about this show are all the people here from Boston." Being a Yankees fan, it is hard to see that much 'Sawks' gear in one place. That said, was a great show and we had a blast we the rest of the crowd. from boston, can confirm Boys on the docks! He used a band's music against it's will? That's so punk. I immediately thought, hmm this must be the Dropkick Murphy's but figured the governor was from Massachusetts At least they don't figuratively hate him. Can someone please ELI5 why everyone hates Walker? I don't follow politics close enough.  My favorite dropkick murphys song

http://youtu.be/_ZN3weW1udE Go right to hate. Wow.  The idea that one should only listen to music by artists whose political views match your own is absurd.  When an artist demands ideological purity of his fans, he is turning his art into little more than political propaganda.  

 There's a difference between listening to a song and using it at a campaign event. - /u/charitullius Rage Against The Machine complained when Paul Ryan said he listened to them. They said he stood for everything they were against... If your main ideological foe is Paul fucking Ryan, you need a new perspective on the world. They're allowed to complain, sure, but I don't think they'd try and sue him or anything to get him to stop. He stands for a lot of what their music is against, though, and I don't think they were saying "HE IS ENEMY NUMBER 1" so much as "This guy's views contradict what we write music for". "We literally hate him."  And that's their right as much as it's his right to literally enjoy their music, so long as it's not for his own gain, I agree. They allow their music to be licensed... So others can use it. That's on them.  The funny thing is, they didn't even write the song - Woody Guthrie did. It's very safe to say Woodie would be even more pissed about a republican using it. Agreed, but since Woody assigned his rights to BMI and Dropkick assigned theirs to ASCAP, none of them actually have shit to say about it (legally), as long as someone bought a license. Haha yea, but you think if you're using it for such a high profile occasion you'd actually try to talk to the artist.  This shit has happened for at  least the past two election cycles and while it's not really damaging to the candidate it isn't exactly helpful.  Silly wealthy bastards assuming money can buy everything. Well, when the artist sells it, then yes, money does buy everything. It's ridiculous for artists to want to maximize their profit by selling the rights to their work, and then complain when it gets sold to someone they don't like.  
And I agree, it doesn't hurt the candidate at all.
 Ofc money buys the song if the fucking artist sold it in the first place.... Wisconsinite here. Walker is not here to help you. He borrowed money so he could give us a tax break. It makes him look good. It turned out to be about 13.00 a month. Woo hoo. I'll be living in Madison soon and my brother currently is working right around Madison. It was really interesting to see all of the activism in Madison to oust Walker, so I was pretty surprised when Walker won again (Though that probably was also due to Burke being such a poor candidate). A very libertarian friend of mine always talks about how Wisconsin was spending way too much money before Walker and Walker has had to do the unfavorable thing of cutting back on a lot of things in order to have a positive impact on the economy. I guess what I'm trying to say is that all over Madison and on Reddit I see nothing but hatred for Walker. Is he doing anything right? Walker took down the public unions. He convinced a lot of people that teachers and the like are the reason the state had budget issues. He has a lot of loyal followers that don't care for Democrats. They don't like public employees anymore either.  Yeah I definitely don't agree with how he handled public unions and I totally see the opposition to that. But you said he tried to blame teachers for the budget problems, but what was the real source of the budget problems in your opinion? (Sorry I know this is random its just hard to find discussion about Wisconsin politics around where I am haha) It's law the budget needs to be balanced.  He sold it as "we're broke". He did not campaign on this. He famously "dropped the bomb" a month after taking office. No compromise.  No Working With Democrats. Boom! done. He prefers a divide and conquer strategy.  100% correct. I'm also in Wisconsin. Walker does not give one shit about you.  Scott Walker is a hero! Fuck teachers unions. Hero Walker 2016! Well thought out comment. Very succinct.  There are pills you can take for whatever's wrong with you. Most people agree, that's why he got re-elected 3 times. ITT: people who think you need to agree with the message of the music to enjoy it or consider yourself a fan.  Again, no. Listening is one thing, illegally using for one's own gain is another. If Scott Walker's iPod is nothing but Springsteen, James Taylor, Dropkick Murphys, Rage Against The Machine, and Common, that's fine. But if he uses music to support himself from a band that did not give permission, is clearly opposed to him, and did not receive the compensation they're legally supposed to, that's another thing altogether. I'd be making the same fuss if Obama used a Ted Nugent song to introduce himself (though that would be equally confusing to me). Where does it say that he used it illegally? &gt; But if he uses music to support himself from a band that did not give permission, is clearly opposed to him, and did not receive the compensation they're legally supposed to, that's another thing altogether. 

See here's the thing.  He doesn't NEED their permission.  His campaign or the venue that he's at pay ASCAP a fee for what's called a performance license.  That license says you pay X amount per song that you play at a live setting, which is then disbursed to the artists.  Same as the licensing that a radio station does.  The artist doesn't get a choice in whether or not their music is played unless they never licensed the songs to ASCAP (which they had to since their music is played on the radio).  This is the same thing that happened with the Sarah Palin campaign when she came out to 'Barracuda', Heart told her to stop, she told them to go fuck.  The artist has no legal standing here. That wasn't my understanding of how it works, though if it is, then I just disagree with the way things work. Reddit is the most far right-wing conservative leaning social media website on the Internet. They get angry about anything that goes against reddit's republican circlejerk.
 Jan was the middle Brady child no one wanted to hear any shit from. Relevant username. They're not Celtic. They're white trash from Boston.  They're "Celtic" through their appreciation for traditional Celtic music, and infusing it into rock music. With that said, it is mainly mandolins and bag pipes, so calling them "Celtic" *is* a bit of a stretch. Nevertheless they're referred to that way. 

I've no comment on the white trash statement. I'm not too familiar with how each member was raised.  Celtic is the genre, not their place of birth. Doesn't make it accurate. You're completely right, the band aren't Celtic themselves. They play Celtic rock music. Doesn't matter where they come from. &gt;white trash

hardly.  They are of working class origin, but white trash specifically refers to people from rural areas.

In other news, feel free to fuck off. Boston Irish trash?    

The band sucks Cromwell's nuts is the point. Thats just like, your opinion man It's a musical genre you edgy teenager

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_punk I know I've seen the Murphys a few times.   

When I was a teenager, a long time ago.  Why do Republican politicians always try to use the songs of artists who clearly do not align with their values? Because you should only ever do business with people who agree with your politics 100% right?  We should in fact all quiz bands about their opinion on the UN before we buy albums, which is functionally what the politicians are doing on a larger scale when they license the music.

Do you want a pluralistic society where we all can live and work together despite our differences or do you want all out war between the blue tribe and the red tribe. Probably because conservative musicians are much less likely to speak publicly about their political views. That's one quick way to be burned at the stake and end your career. Hollywood's the same way. It's a reverse of the McCarthy-era blacklists, really.  Because Ted Nugent songs suck. Because Ted Nugent sucks Because Ted Nugent sucks I don't think they have much of a choice. There's only 20 or so pop-country artists they can pick from if they're going for value-consistency.
 Because not everyone likes country music. Cluelessness.  Like about half the people in this thread, I didn't bother to read the shitty clickbait article, but if this was like the last time something like this happened, it's not what it appears to be on the surface.

Last time I remember this happening, The Silversun Pickups got bent out-of-shape because Mitt Romney's campaign was using their music as background filler before/after Romney's campaign appearances.  Romney's campaign wasn't using their songs as a backdrop for his speeches or introductions, they were using them as Muzak when nothing important was happening.  That's probably exactly what's happening here

I appreciate that musicians, like everyone, have strong opinions about politics.  I think they should express their views, just as everyone should, because that's engaging the political system and trying to make a change.  More people need to do that.  My only issue with the complaints of some of these bands is that it sometimes strikes me as less of a "we disagree with you" and more of a "you're fucking terrible and don't deserve music/art," which I find to be hateful and dehumanizing.  It's like all the rhetoric about civility goes right out the window as soon as the target is someone on 'the right.'

I can understand why *RaTM*, who had a very strong political message, would make a very public objection.  I am seriously puzzled about why bands who don't make politicized music want to inject politics into their music.  The country is evenly divided politically.  When you tell almost 50% of the country they don't deserve your music, you're cutting your own throat.  Why would you turn away 50% of the potential market for your music? Dropkick Murphy's have strongly political music as well. I think the problem isn't the content of the lyrics so much as the fact that most of the time when I'm someplace where Dropkick Murphy's are being played it's in a place where there are a lot of loud, intoxicated people.  I could make the same case for why fratboys in the 90s like RaTM.  If no one is really paying attention to your lyrics because they just want to jam out to your boss-ass riffs or because the (only) big reason people listen to your music is to get drunk, be loud and obnoxious, and have a good time, is your music really political? because no one wants to listen to ted nugent So True, poignant comment! And to elaborate your point, supporting facts:

The 2004 Bush campaign used the Orleans song "Still The One", until John Hall declared they never approved it, &amp; still John McCain used it in his presidential campaign, until repeated desist request.
Mitch Romney  used "Panic Switch" by Silver Sun Pickups  ceast &amp;desist
Sarah Palin  Heart's song "Barracuda"  ceast-and-desist order.
Michele Bachman  Tom Petty's "American Girl" -cease &amp; desist
Newt Gingrich  sued by cowriter for use of "Eye of the Tiger"
+ Add More if you can find them, and I'm sure you can...

The GOP party has largely had to resort to relying on the conservative country music industry now! Yeah, the cease and desist letters mean nothing. The campaigns have their ASCAP licenses, so they can legally play the music whenever they want, no matter if the bands approve. 

**Politically**, they don't continue to use them because they don't want it to be a story, but they don't have to stop using them.

Source: first hand experience. 
 Well Tom did tell us not to waste our toime on him. We were just voices inside his yed You people are good people He was catching things and eating their insuuooieeeds &gt;You don't even have the balls to call your bandmates and tell them you're not going to record or do anything Blink-related. You have your manager do it. Everyone should know what the story is with him and it's been years with it. **When we did get back together after my plane crash, we only got back together, I don't know, maybe because I almost died. But he didn't even listen to mixes or masterings from that record. He didn't even care about it.**

Wow. "This isn't just 'goodbye'. This is 'I can't stand you.'" I remember Tom's line from some banter on The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show:


" We really love each other, we are the best of friends. Fuck, Mark, Travis... you guys mean a lot to me man."


:( What a difference 15 years can make =\ Things change.  People change.

I barely even talk to my best friend from 15 years ago.  
 I doubt you work with the same best friend for 20 years either. :(

On a positive note, maybe we can get some more +44 out of this. Doubtful, based on what Mark and Travis said in the interview, but it would certainly make this all much more palatable to me, being a huge fan of +44. Never really liked AVA as much. I appreciated both AVA and +44 but loved +44 more. It took a lot longer time for me to get into AVA, where as I fell in love with the pop electronic from +44 after the first time listening to the record. I hope this leads to more +44. +44 really is fantastic  I'd rather get more boxcar but that won't happen either.  That would require Travis and Tom to speak to each other. I was incredibly lucky to see Boxcar in a small 1,000 capacity venue when they toured for that record. They played every song and even jammed a little.

Also, Taking Back Sunday, The Used and H20 opened for them. Super cool show fuck. you.  I know right? That's a decade old wet dream right there Fucking love +44 never woulda thought When Your Heart Stops Beating would relate to the current situation again. Lol the song he was quoting is about this exact situation the first time it happened haha so strange that this is happening again. never would have predicted this when i woke up this morning  "And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay. The charade, it wont last..." "I listen to you talk but talk is cheap, and my mouth is filled with blood from trying not to speak." this really puts more context into the parts of Neighborhoods that sounded like they came straight out of Angels and Airwaves tracks Seriously, no tracks with Tom on them sounded like Blink. That album felt like half AvA and half +44. 0% Blink The EP they released a while later was a lot closer to what I expected a matured Blink 182 to sound like. Dogs Eating Dogs and Disaster are two great songs. Neighborhoods was disappointing to me and I was so excited to see what the next thing would sound like after that EP. It's a shame. Comletely agree. I didn't really care for Neighborhoods, except a couple tracks. Absolutely loved every song on Dogs Eating Dogs. I was really excited for an album that would build off the energy of Dogs. This is a sad day indeed. hey Wishing Well was my shit and MH4.18.2011 (nice that mark subtly pointed out that the album was all done through email correspondence [ Mark Hoppus April 18, 2011] ) That line fucking crushed me.  Why does Tom not appreciate Blink? I feel like if they talked in person and got everything out in the open that would at least resolve some things even if it doesn't keep them together. I'm just taking a stab in the dark, but I think it's because Blink-182 conflicts with the way he's living his life now (his ideals have changed and it's noticeable based on the songs he sings/writes). He seems to want to promote AvA more than Blink-182. Travis said it himself in the interview - Tom only seemed to stick around for the money and that money is funding AvA. Now that it looks like AvA could be self-sustaining on the level that Tom wants it at, he doesn't really have to focus on Blink-182 activities. Again, this is just a guess! I would say that is part of it. I feel like, maybe, he wanted to make more out of himself than that "punk" kid with the nasal Barbra Streisand voice. I think he wanted to make a band that sounded epic that showed his true talents. Wanted to ditch the dick jokes and teenage dream and become an adult by having his music become more mature.

I feel he could have easily accomplished this without being a total dick. He could have even grown with Blink.

I mean, Blink-182's self album was exactly that. I remember not being a fan of the self-titled album when it first came out because it was so different from the first ones. I think "Take off your pants and jacket" was the first album I ever bought with my own money actually. 

It wasn't until I was a couple years older that I was able to go back and appreciate that album.  "Down" is one of my favorite tracks from them. That whole album is pretty great actually but I totally see why you'd get into later. "I guess this is growing up " haw haw. Puns, Not Now. That self titled is my favorite, actually. *Neighborhoods* is very enjoyable to me too. I understand how different the sound is for both of them, and I don't want to say that it's a more mature sound because it makes their older stuff sound childish, which it's not, but the newer sound is definitely different and pleasing to me emotionally. That album has been in my life for 11 years and I've loved every single day since then.  I feel like that's had to have happened at least once since the first hiatus and comeback. Everyone obviously ideally would want the Blink-182 made of Mark, Tom and Travis playing together again, but since Tom has had such a history of being flakey and disinterested and would rather do his own projects, I think it's best for everyone to let him do what he wants, and let Travis and Mark keep making music. Tom DeLonge doesn't appreciate Blink-182 anymore for the same reason the people who loved his band in high school feel they no longer love Blink-182: they all wrongfully believe they've outgrown the band. The difference is that Mr. DeLonge has an obligation to Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker as their bandmate. He should have been honest from the moment he felt his heart wasn't in it. Don't bullshit your fans and tell them how excited you are about Blink stuff. Don't make all the management teams and attorneys and promoters and everyone else in the Blink business machine wait for you to shit or get off the pot. But most of all, he should never have led Hoppus and Barker on about things that involve the band.

They've waited two years to record. Two years is a solid album cycle. If Tom DeLonge had half the excitement about Blink that he has about Angels or his other projects, we might be talking about them going to the studio to record the follow-up to an album released in 2013. I'm 30 and I like Blink even more today than I did in junior high and high school.

Their music holds a special place in my heart. And it's pretty cool to continue to listen and be able to relate, albeit in totally different ways, from when I played them non-stop in my formative years. I'm almost 30 and work professionally as a scientist, and I *still* love listening to the Mark Tom and Travis show (and frankly never liked AvA). Its fun music, influenced so much that came after them, and is also strongly nostalgic. And poop jokes are still funny. If you've started taking yourself so seriously that you don't find poop jokes funny, you are lying to yourself. That's not to say don't do more serous stuff, but come on. Making millions of dollars telling a stadium of screaming fans that dog semen is the leading cause of bad breath? There's something uniquely awesome about that. "WHO LIKES THE SKIPPY?????"  

Edit: [For the uninformed, my favorite live album of all time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR-eOphGSKQ) WHO LIKES THE SKIPPY PEANUT BUTTER? Alright, this song's really hard to play. It's really hard for Tom. So I'd appreciate it if you don't listen to me for the next two and a half minutes.

...my god, that entire album is just burned into my head verbatim.  HEY the song's not done! It's time for the bass-guitar solo. 
  
.. Oxygen to the stage please. We need oxygen and oral sex on the stage. Alright here it goes 1 2 3 4 (2 second bass solo) Tom has sex with guys! They played at the first music festival i ever went to when i was 15. I'll love their early stuff til i die. It's like I'm fifteen again.  Coming home from high school trying to figure out just how bad an "indefinite hiatus" is. I think it's worse this time.  They're sick of him and the way they came out publicly says a lot about how little they want to work with him any longer.  He's also almost 40 now, so unless he decides to make a massive personal change in his life, he's probably not growing up anymore. I guess it'll happen once again, he'll turn into a friend. Someone who neither understands nor sticks to the master plan.   But everybody's gone, he's been doing this for too long. well I guess Tom's not growing up Dammit :( That emotionally hurt me to read all that Nobody like you when your 43, and still act like you're in freshman year... Although Mark's response does reek of "If Tom comes back and say's 'I hear you guys loud and clear. I'm ready to quit being a dick and make a real commitment to this band that I cherish and made my career.' I'll take him back" It's likely for good. Hoppus completely dodged the last question but I don't think they want to go through that bullshit again

edit: for good not god Maybe Hoppus and Barker can make another +44 album. Mark said something a while back about wanting to do it again when the time was right. Maybe that's now. When Your Heart Stops Beating is one of my favourite albums of all time.  I wouldn't say he dodged the question at all. Read the answer, he's tired of having to apologize to all of the people who were working on getting blink to record and tour. That he shouldn't have to be embarrassed like that. That's a pretty definitive "no" to me.  True. He doesn't say no straight up, but if you read between the lines he basically says, "fuck no" I interpreted his answer as "I guess, maybe, if Tom were to grow the fuck up" [deleted] I just found my Livejournal post from that day.  God I was such a mess.   Please share I remember not knowing what the hell hiatus meant Fuck. Almost 10 years to the day.  I'd say it's as bad as Cream. They'll hate each other for 20 years and then do a slightly desperate reunion concert in their 60s.  Me too. I was crushed the day I read that Blink was done. :( Now I feel like I'm repeating that. I felt calm after reading Tom's remarks about how he never left Blink and stuff, but deep down, you know he was the sole problem.

EDIT: Before others say anything, I know the statement about Tom came first, then Tom's comeback, but honestly, it starts to become obvious when two out of the three are willing to still promote Blink-182. You know what it is, a lot of these people are just now jumping on the "we hate Tom" bandwagon, like I've been hating Tom since like 1995. I'm old school hating Tom guy alright 

*edit: Thanks for the gold star, friend. Pay attention you fuc--BOOBIES!  Aw man this reference makes me sad :( Oh shit, hey let's all say some dirty words, everybody say fuck, everybody say shit, everyone say dick, everyone say Mark's an asshole "We really love each other, we are the best of friends. Fuck, Mark, Travis... you guys mean a lot to me man."


:( [Um...](http://i.imgur.com/P2vkwAS.gif) [All I want after all of this.](http://24.media.tumblr.com/8704ddbeddb95bedc3d9f7e12a5af065/tumblr_mrfnynmKHl1ql11nao1_500.gif) so fucking sad

... so fucking sad This is so perfect.  Didn't even need to click. This sums up the entire day so far for me. My thought was "why has someone submitted an article that is years old........wait....oh.....Oh no....oh tom....tom tom tom.....what have you done." Did anyone else find this interview really refreshing? It's just straight up brutal honesty. I really respect that I found it refreshing too. Hardly any punches were pulled, aside from Travis politely biting his tongue a few times. It was honest and straightforward, and I liked that.

What I did find was uncomfortable, was that it had to come to this. When two members of a 3 person band have to go to Rolling Stone to basically say "yes, the other guy's out" rather than issue a press release from the band itself stating that someone's leaving that means it's really really hit a low point for the personal *and* professional relationship between the three of them, and that makes me a bit sad. I couldn't agree with you more. When I was reading this I kept thinking about how long this band has been together, how many years they have spent side by side, travelling the world as friends and brothers essentially yet here we are in 2015 and they are communicating to each other through their management and through magazine interviews. It really is fucked  I think everyone is over looking the fact that Matt Skiba is standing in for him for now.

I do not enjoy the situation more than the rest of you but he is literally THE BEST REPLACEMENT.

I do not think they should record/release an album under the name "Blink-182" but a Mark/Matt/Travis album would be RIDICULOUS.

I for one, am psyched.


On another note, If Tom does not want to do it anymore than good riddance. But he did do it in a shitty way. Seriously. OPs title had me totally torn. On one hand it sucks tom had to be such a douche, but then my second favorite band from the era picks up the slack? Can't even be mad Matt Skiba is an awesome vocalist too! Shit, I'd listen to "The Mark, Matt and Travis Show".  I saw Alkaline headline for Blink way back when. My two favorite bands. I am fucking psyched. Because you left out "Trio" I endured two songs of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHp7t_ILYks) before realizing... I'm eagerly waiting the Musink Festival so I can watch videos of Matt playing Blink songs. I, too, would be overjoyed if they recorded an album together.  I haven't liked any of Blinks new music since they reunited. Tom's voice just didn't fit the band anymore, it's become too whiney from AVA.

I look forward to how their music sounds with Matt Skiba playing festivals with the band. I doubt he'll become a permanent member and I hope he doesn't (I prefer alkaline trios music nowadays). Not a permanent member but like I said I would love for those three to put out an album (even if it is a one-off) Alkaline Trio is kind of in a limbo nowadays anyway.

I was lucky enough to talk with Dan Andriano last April. Though the situation is nowhere near as hostile as what Blink is going through, the Alkaline Trio is in a weird place right now as well. Dan, Matt, and Derek are all working on their own projects nowadays. Dan with the Emergency Room, Derek has been doing solo stuff as well as stuff with Gaslight Anthem and a number of more metal/hardcore bands and Matt with The Sekrets and The HELL.

Matt is competent and can easily fill in for Tom during a tour. Hell, he could even do an album or two with Blink. But he is in a weird twilight period of his career. He won't be looking to sign up to be in another band right now. He is in his own AVA stage, doing lots of his own projects right now anyway. And I think he still really appreciates Alkaline Trio, and would not jeopardize that by joining Blink on a semi-permanent basis. Is there any footage (YouTube perhaps?) of Matt Skiba singing Blink songs? I'm extremely excited to hear Matt sing Blink songs!  I haven't liked the last couple Alkaline Trio albums and didn't really care for Neighborhoods. I dunno though, this idea intrigues me. I'm not a Blink-182 fan (I was when I was about 13) but I read the article and the part about Matt Skiba standing in made me go: "Whaaaaaaat?!" 

While I haven't bought one of their albums since "Crimson" I sincerely love Alkaline Trio as an essential part of my life starting at age 15 (I'm 29). I still listen to "Crimson" and everything that came before it regularly. 

Matt standing in with Blink-182 is so strange to me. I assume he's doing it because he's friends with Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker, as opposed to some kind of musical connection (as I said, I did not listen to anything by Blink-182 post "Enema of the State", so I will believe you if you say their music got less juvenile after that).

But it still seems so odd. Matt's such a weirdo... I guess this is growing up? :-( thats my favorite song man

I was on a show last year and had a BLAST. Never would have thought that it was so bad ... Makes me feel really weird, realizing that it was just that, a show. Showbusiness is JUST. THAT. A show, and a business. I guess all this time they were just *staying together for the fans*. irony is that Tom wrote that song  Tom and Mark both did. Im pretty sure both sets of their parents are divorced. Well hey, I enjoyed it this time. Will you remember this night. 20 years now lost.  *staying in it for the money* Today has been insane. I want off the Mr. Bones Wild Ride NO ONE GETS OFF MR BONES WILD RIDE I am legitimately spooked rn Matt Skiba though! Right? I want to hear Skiba sing some Blink! [deleted] meh. I've had friendships end in such a way that if managers were an option I'd have been hearing it from them. Just a certain kind of person really. Ditto... Had some friends who we literally held eachother up in our toughest times, just end contact and don't hear from them for years. Thats when I stopped giving a shit about making new friends and just hang out with my dog. &gt; Where's my dog

&gt; 'Cause friends are such a drag People get busy, dude! After school ends and you start life, things just change. You get caught up with growing up and all the little things you gotta do to live. It doesn't mean we've forgotten about you,  the memories are always there,  but we're just busy and prolly really tired from work. My Facebook is full of old friends I wish I had time to see. Well, I guess, this is growing up. man, they could've at least wrote "Man Overboard Pt 2" for him "No, It Isn't" by +44 is pretty much that. Only way darker. This makes me sad. It's mom and dad all over again. That made me sad.  Your sadness made me sad. I remember watching them on Conan back in the day and Hoppus and Delonge came out looking all fucked up like they had been in a fight.  [Here's the only video I could find of the incident](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4ha3y_blink-182-first-date-live-on-conan_music).  Poor, poor Tom.

 It really is sad that Delonge has been that much of a dick that Hoppus &amp; Barker have had to go public with all this now. I really worshiped these guys growing up, so it's pretty much heartbreaking to hear that the relationship between them has soured this bad. I'll still support Hoppus and Barker as much as I can but Delonge, man you fucked up here dude.  Tom has always been a bit of a douche. He's the one that shows up hammered on stage for blink shows and it was always tolerated obviously. I want more blink but I'm glad they're done indulging him.  Honestly devastated been my favourite band since i was 7 years old back in the 90's, fair play to Mark and Travis exposing tom, it clears up how the band broke up 10 years ago and now it explains why the past 2 years have been quiet Ah, another 7 y/o 90s fan of blink. Found them out during enema of the state. Summer 1999 was awesome.  I remember a friend showing me that cd cover in 6th grade at the bus stop.  I was a fan of blink ever since then. The summer of '99 was the best summer of my life.

Jesus that sounds sad to say out loud. So can (+44) be a thing again please? *No It Isn't* Part 2? I loved that song. It should be called "Yeah, it wasn't" I wanna hear everyone scream
'fuck you Tom, we fucking hate you,
you gunna burn in hell and die a horrible firery death
cause we think you're a stupid piece of shit!'

-mark hoppus  Came here to say just that, honestly I loved the +44 album way more than the last Blink album. That was one of the few albums that i loved every track on. +44 and Boxcar Racer were very fun projects to listen to in the absence of Blink, I'm all for it! Boxcar was during blinks existence. It was the fucking best. I want more Boxcar Racer. I don't think we'll ever get more Boxcar Racer. They seem to forget that Travis was part of Boxcar Racer and I doubt Travis wants in on it ever again I remember reading something Tom said that basically Boxcar was just a creative outlet for him, since he wanted to do things that he couldn't in blink. He used Travis so that he didn't have to pay a studio drummer. So it was pretty much Tom. I love boxcar, regardless. Especially "Elevator". All three of them are in it so its just like its a blink song. "Shit, fuck, I made a mistake. I thought I needed a break. 
The truth is I'm such a dick. It's broken and can't be fixed"
 ... I'm so JADED, calculated, Wrooonnnngg.... I bet you're sad, this was the best time we ever had.  Oh no, it happened again. Goddamn, this is so perfect. God dammit, I've always been a firm defender in Tom DeLonge. I grew up idolizing him. I went out and started a punk band solely because of Blink. Tom DeLonge was my hero. I've always supported AVA. But god dammit he's being a real douche about this whole thing. Its real hard to defend him. Having your childhood split up once was devasting, but now twice? Come on Tom...quit being a douche. Try growing up with Billy Corgan as your favorite musician. What a douche bag. &gt; Try growing up with Billy Corgan as your favorite musician. What a douche bag.

Not often I actually laugh out loud but this response was hilarious to me. I'm a huge SP fan and I sort of just brush Corgan's insanity aside. I was at an Appleseed Cast show last week where one of the members told the crowd a story about how his friend brought thousands of bouncy balls to a smashing pumpkins show in kansas city I think. This pissed off Corgan so much that he walked off stage and didn't go back to that city for years. When smashing pumpkins finally came back, this said person brought  bouncy balls again. He bounced one straight at Corgan from 60+ feet away and nailed him right between the eyes. Corgan then walked off stage, again. Oh yeah this thread was about blink 182. oops Some guy told his story about meeting Billy during Billy's AMA last month and how Billy went from this guy's hero to a total dick.

&gt; Personal experience. Here's the story of how I met Billy, my ultimate idol, and thereafter learned he is a bit of a douche. I doubt Billy will remember, but if he could he would corroborate. It's a few days before Machina drops, and I skip class to wait in line at the Miami Beach Speck's (record store) where the Pumpkins are doing a free show for the first 100 or so people. Show is scheduled for 1pm or so, and I am in line at 5am. I sit on the floor with a couple of other people just me, my blanket and a guitar.for the next five hours or so, I play all of Siamese Dream, most of Mellon Collie and some other favorites, like Starla (acoustic, no less). By the time several hundred people are there, we have quite a show going on, and I'm getting everybody in the mood to hear the real thing.  I wasn't just a Pumpkins fan, I was an absolute fanatic. Siamese Dream spoke to me like no other music has and to tell the truth, like no other music has since.  There's lots in there for a 15-year old kid, and Billy Corgan was my Hero. 
&gt; 
&gt; The show begins and it's quite intimate. Audience sits on the floor of the record store and Billy, James Iha and some other dude (or girl? Not D'arcy) on the bass stand on the floor about three feet in front of us. All acoustic. They play about 45 minutes and I am in complete earphoria. Then Billy says "let's play Pumpkins trivia! Who here knows how to play guitar?" Tons of people throw their hands up. I stick up my hand holding my guitar pick (emblazoned with the SP heart that I hand carved and painted). Billy picks two girls and me. We stand up and walk a few feet to where he is and I lean over to him and say, "my lifelong dream is to play Mayonaise with you." He looks at me, gives a mean chuckle and says "yeah, like that's ever gonna happen." Nasty. I look a little shocked at how callous he was (not that I really expected him to say, "let's do it!"). I look at James and he shrugs his shoulders as if to say "I feel you...sorry dude..." 
&gt; 
&gt; Pumpkins Trivia begins. Billy asks blonde bimbo #1: "what city are we in?"..."Miami?" "Alright, she gets one point!" To Girl 2: "what's your name?" ... "Jessica..." (Or something similar) "Ok, you get one point!" To me: "what was the name of my first band and why?" I respond: "the Marked because both you and the guy you formed the group with have birth marks." "Ok, one point for you..." now to Bimbo 1, "who's your favorite band?"....to girl 2: "do you have a boyfriend?" To me: "when's my birthday?" I knew it was sometime around St. Patrick's day, so I said that.  "Nope. That's not a day. Thanks for playing! And then he turns to the pretty bimbo blonde and says "do you play guitar?" She shrugs and says "I dunno..." "Well, do you want to learn?" "Ok..." And he then gives her the guitar he played the show with. The band members sign it, but for some reason when James goes to sign it he puts his hand in his chest to stop him. It's pretty clear to everyone there that Billy just behaved like an ass, particularly to everyone that sang along to our many hours of pumpkins prior to the show. 
&gt; 
&gt; Then James does a classy thing, he goes over to Billy and says "can I give him my amp pedal?" Billy just looks away without answering. James Iha then gives me his green pedal and a bunch of SP guitar picks, and as he's doing it, he says in a hushed tone, "sorry, dude..."
&gt; 
&gt; I left the show a bid sad but it wasn't until I was walking to the bus stop when one of the dads that was there with his kid told me that he went after the show to have his copy of the cd signed, and told Billy "hey, that kid was out there with his guitar playing your songs all day--he's a true fan, you did him wrong, man." Billy responded "yeah, well, we can't all be winners."
&gt; 
&gt; I later found out the blonde that got the guitar didn't even like the band. She was just there with a friend. I also found out that she pawned the guitar pretty shortly after the show. 
&gt; 
&gt; Throughout the years, I mused over this story and realized that it's a sad day when you meet your hero. I mean, James was so beaten down he couldn't even give me his own amp pedal!! He had to ask Billy for permission! The whole "Pumpkins Trivia" thing was already pretty egocentric. But the fact that he brushed off a true fan in such a dismissive manner in favor of an underage blonde girl pissed me off quite a bit. 
&gt; 
&gt; Then I heard him on Howard Stern (this morning and previously), and you can tell he's still pretty much a dick and sees making music as a business. On Howard Stern today he said in no uncertain terms that making music is a business first and other bands are competition. Billy's idol was Kurt Cobain. I like the irony that his idol broke his heart by taking his girlfriend (Courtney Love). 
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I just enjoy the music (little of which is any good since Mellon Collie) and will likely take a look at the new album. However, I no longer look up to the dude and instead rather pity him. Still clinging to the band name, when the name is all that is left of the group. Cheers. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2os94f/i_am_billy_corgan_of_the_smashing_pumpkins_and/cmqbsb7?context=3 If you're gonna post that, you should also point out the followup to it with the recording/transcript that showed it didn't go down nearly as badly as that guy made it sound.
 Alkaline trio fan here, excited for the idea of Mr. Skiba being in anything! If Tom was as driven for blink as he is for AVA, I honestly believe blink could have reinvented themselves like they did in 2003.  One of the greatest moments of my life was at a show with an old band I was part of, where we had the opportunity to open up for Angels and Airwaves. Tom, being a huge influential person in my life in regards to music, made this night memorable. We were all lucky enough to meet the band and hang out/chat with all of them, including Tom. He was way nice to all of us and offered us whatever we wanted from the food/drinks/snacks backstage specifically for AVA before doors even opened. We all had an awesome time hanging out. 

I remember him grabbing an acoustic guitar and singing about having sex with our bass players mom. He took time to take pictures, sign autographs, and even talk with us about music. We gave him a cd of ours and a shirt and he put the shirt on right then and there.

For a musician with as big of name as he has, he never once made any of us feel as though he was superior or had a huge ego. He was a really down to earth guy and I really appreciated the way he made all of us feel as equals. It's hard to believe that this side of the story is the complete truth. I'd love to know more of Tom's story.

TL;DR: Met Tom, really cool, genuinely nice guy. Think there's much more to this story. I think nice people can be mean  I think knowing somebody for 20 years vs knowing somebody for 2 hours gives you a very different picture of their character and personality. My mom is super nice to all of her friends. Doesn't mean I'd ever want to live with her again. People just end up having a public face and a private face, I can imagine being famous amplifies the rift between them 1000x. And mean people can be fake I think this *is* the story. Tom is in his new found element in AVA, blink has essentially been dead for 11 years. It's his own fault for strolling back into it after Travis's plane crash. Please let this result in the return of +44. Enema of the State was the second CD I ever owned.  I was in the fourth grade and didn't understand half of the things they were talking about, but I loved it. In my teenage years, their songs helped me get through quite a few rough patches.  When they broke up it felt like a little part of me was lost, because I never got to see them live.    A few years later, I saw AvA with a few of my friends, I didn't really care for them but I got the ticket for free and wanted to see Say Anything, who was the opener.  The entire AvA set all I could think about was how much Tom had changed, he was almost unrecognizable.  I could never grasp how in such a short time he became a completely different person.  Fast forward a few years and my parents surprised my sister and I with Blink reunion tickets.   I had never been so excited for a show, even though I had moved past pop punk and gotten more into Harcore/Metal.  As they started, I immediately realized it seemed a bit off.  The crowd was so hyped, as well as Mark and Travis, but Tom just seemed to kind of stand there.  It was as if all of his passion was gone.  The set was great, but you could tell that he was not into it.  From that day I knew Blink would never be the same, you can't play Dammit while being lethargic and slowly moving like you are on the moon.    As much as I loved finally seeing them, it was like the final nail in the coffin for that band, in my eyes. 

TL;DR Listened to Blink my whole life, finally saw them live at their reunion tour.  Tom ruined it by acting like a depressed astronaut. [Man Overboard seems like the perfect song to listen to right now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u38TqU5rAyk)

I was one of those teens that grew up with this band and began my journey through rock music starting with this band.  I went to the record store with my aunt in Fall of 1999 and managed to buy *Enema of the State* with my allowance money when she was off looking at Spice Girl records with my girl cousin. I grabbed it from the cashier and shoved it down in my shirt, tucked my long sleeve shirt in and put my hands into my hooded sweatshirt pouch to keep it from flopping around. My mom wouldn't have let me listen to it if she saw the Parental Advisory Warning and definitely not since a porn star was on the album cover. I listened to that album over and over again and it meant more to me throughout my teen years than any other album or music that I had owned and/or heard along with their eponymous album from 2003. Those two albums in particular along with *The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show* were the soundtracks to my childhood. 

Everything about the band and their music was in tune with my childhood. My friends and I were all into the Tony Hawk video games and that got us into skateboarding and dressing like skateboarders sort of like Blink would. We would all have our skate shoes and then pick up tees and other shit from Pac Sun to get that Blink look even though most of us could barely skate and were just posers. My friends and I used to tag up our binders, lockers, and bathroom stalls with all sorts of shit but always were sure to tag them with *Blink-182* with pens or whiteout pens. We used to have sleepovers and listen to *Enema of the State* over and over until it was around midnight and then we would watch music videos on MTV and would always catch Blink videos because they were always in rotation. We all were naturally curious about girls at the time and so we sought out movies like American Pie where Blink had a cameo during [that scene where Nadia goes over Jim's and his buddies are relaying her stripping on webcam to the whole school while Blink's song Mutt plays over the scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRZOlJBaUAY) That scene and those days with my friends were about as "Blink" as it could get, really. Just a bunch of young boys taping each other doing stupid shit at each other's houses, running in and out of each other's houses and through yards in our neighborhoods, looking at naked girls, listening to the pop-punk music that was "in" during those years, and then watching a movie like American Pie that perfectly encapsulated what it was like to be a suburban American teenager at the turn of the millenium. 

Today feels like the end of my childhood.  Have you heard "No it isnt" by +44? That was their Man Overboard for Tom a decade ago  A decade ago was 2005. Jesus fuck that seemed like yesterday. What am I doing with my life. Dude, this is exactly what my childhood was. Let's hope its not over.  Stay Together for the Kids plays quietly in the background. I've always loved Blink-182 because of Mark,hes an awesome song writer and it really shows in +44, I enjoy Blink-182 and I hope they find success with or without Tom. He just tweeted this and deleted it:

http://i.imgur.com/opIETjF.png Probably only because Travis refused to travel via plane (understandable). 

 Even if any of Toms BS is true, Can you blame Travis? I would never fucking board a plane again. Not many people survive shit like that. Surprised this isn't getting more coverage. The screen shot shows it posted for 30 minutes and it has like 3 favourites and 3 retweets??? It's obviously fake. 

Edit: Looks like it's actually real but the screen shot posted did look fake.  Well Tom is a douche, not exactly surprising It always annoyed me so much when Tom started promoting the shit out of AVA on Blink's Facebook page Tom seemed indifferent about the reunion since the day they announced it.  I remember Mark and Travis being so excited and Tom just kinda standing there.  I doesn't come as a surprise, but damn it all it certainly hurts.   I really hope this means there'll be more +44 now. I actually enjoyed them. Dammit. I love Blink-182. I figure after the reunion, they made up their differences and continued with both Blink and side projects. Not only did this interview confirm my worse fears, but it's almost like it didn't even improve! While the whole AVA thing in Neighborhoods bothered me, I didn't let it get in the way that Blink was back! I am still waiting on the documentary, which now is ruined in my opinion, I don't even want to know. Now I'm worried that the next album won't ever be heard, which I rather hear a true Blink album where they are brothers again, not in it because Blink brings in cash or for the sake of the band's business (which I know at least Travis and Mark aren't for that, at least). 

I feel like the whole reunion was a lie now. I wanted Blink to come back, but not like this. :( Wow, I'm not going to lie, I'm a bit surprised to hear that Matt is playing with them for Musink.  I'd really like to hear that set.  I'm a huge AK3 fan so I'm interested to see how that works out and if maybe Matt plays with them more.   Yeah this is shitty, but them being together with Tom and NOT being happy would be shittier. Sure they'd be making albums, but the songs would probably be pretty hollow, like some of the more recent blink releases. If they do end up getting a temporary / permanent guitarist / singer to replace Tom that might end up giving blink a whole new life! Think of how fresh that could be! Granted that they choose someone who is fit for the job. Personally, I like the Alkaline Trio, but I don't think their vocalists style would mesh super well with the blink's style. Like, a few live shows with him would be solid, maybe even a live album or dvd, but in the end, I'd like to see a NEW artist replace Tom. That way blink wouldn't end up becoming another soulless super-group that pumps out radio hits that end up fading into obscurity before the album even drops. In my ideal world I would say they should get the vocalist from Snowing to join! But... that of course probably would never happen in a million years, but just imagine! So sorry, it's over.... Four year lurker, first time poster here- only to say Blink was my first infatuation with a band ever at 9 years old. This makes me sad, guys. Tom DeLonge is the Bono of pop-punk. Unless there are some massive personal problems Tom has with Mark and Travis I don't understand why he would want to soil his legacy like this. I get it if he just wants to take a different path in life, that happens, but dude just say that and the fans would be cool with it. 

Why would you want to damage what you've made your name on? It's not like he's ever going to do anything more successful than his Blink heydays. 

The only reason why you would do that is there is something Mark and Travis have done that pisses you off so much you can't stand to be around them or be connected to them. But as far as I know no such personal reason exists.  I'm not even mad at Tom, just kinda disappointed. He obviously has issues he needs to figure out and I wish him the best. I feel sorry for Mark and Trav for having to put up with it when all they want to do is make music. I've listened to these guys for most of my life and I just want them to be happy. I don't feel sorry for Tom. He's just a money hungry dick. He's a self-absorbed dick. The fact that he left blink the same way he did back in 2005 shows even more how much he hasn't changed. Fuck him. Haha! This is awesome. Have fun funding AVA now, Tom! he will still earn heaps of money from blink... Royalties yes, but as stated the big money comes from touring! I went and saw them at a casino in Oklahoma, weren't even on tour, they just came out and played 2 nights. Can't imagine how much they got just for those few shows. They came out to Aus for close to 2mil I think. &gt; Why Blink even got back together in the first place is questionable.

Good point. this will prob get buried but, I met Tom backstage at a Angels show that got cancelled once right after he left blink the first time. Was a awesome guy, we were shooting the shit, he opened up to me about why he left, I never told anyone about this but he seemed really honest about it, saying that he just had a kid and all and the band was pissed that he wanted to have more time with the family while all the band wanted was to tour constantly. It sounded legit and honest. Dude even offered me a beer.  After reading this story I am having second thoughts and think he might just be crazy. Lol. Who knows, food for thought. He's opened up about that numerous times after they broke up 10 years ago. He basically said "I can't be on the road, I need to be at home and fix things with my family". Weeks later, he launched his US tour with AvA. I want to believe that he does all these things for his family, but today just goes to show he does things for himself. Mark was once quoted saying (im paraphrasing from memory)  "this is what we do for a living, we all have families to feed. We tour 3 months a year to make money and stay at home with our families for 9months, that's as good as it gets". Tom uses it as a front. He wants to be recognized as this incredible musician that changed music. He's compared himself to the Beatles , radiohead etc... And while (to me personally ) blink 182 did change the music scene and break barriers, no album will ever erase the fact that tom is associated with dick and poop jokes "I wanna fuck a dog in the ass" lyrics etc.. Understandably he wants to grow up, but his ego has gotten the best of him and he's completely forgotten who he is, even the people he became enormously famous with. I'm butthurt. There are two sides to every story, remember that. Nice try, Tom. The end of an era. Honestly, the Blink era ended so long ago :(  however, them getting back together allowed me to see them live once  I've been a huge fan all of my life (18 now) but I've never got to see them live. Now I never will see the actual Blink :( Ive never seen Prince live but damn i want to so badly Saw him recently, too. He's incredibly talented and was fun to see, but he refuses to play any of the good stuff anymore, due to his altered moral code :( Same. I actually had tickets back in 2011 but had to sell them because I was flat broke.  That decision is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. :( It wouldn't have been worth it. I saw them live a few years ago, and they just seemed tired of their songs, and not really into what they were doing. As a HUGE Blink fan, I was way disappointed. During the reunion tour they did in 09 I think it was, they sounded great, at least when they played in Atlanta. I remember it making me and my friends so happy that all the grudges had been placed aside... or so we had thought.  Same! I got really into them about 2 years before the first split. Absolutely devastated.

 Skip forward a few years and I'm not into them as much anymore but they get back together and tour Australia, so as an adult I felt it was my duty to go see them for the kid me that missed out. 

They didn't fail to blow me away and were as funny as I imagined them to be. 99% of their set were the old albums. They knew what the people wanted. Personally I thought Neighborhoods was a terrible album, with the exception of Up All Night. I thought Up All Night was awful. I love Natives because it's the closest thing to vintage Blink on the album. After Midnight is great too.  I also enjoyed Hearts All Gone. That reminded me of old Blink, and Natives as you said.  I liked the album every day I workout my back at the gym I listen to it. Wishing Well kinda reminded me of old blink too I don't know why but it just does. I feel I'm the only one that really liked this album. Not my favorite blink album at all. Not even close. But I still really like it a lot. I think it gets unfair hate because of how humped up it was when we all realized they're back making an album.  I liked it.  Natives is my favorite Blink song (alongside Ghost on the Dance Floor) and Neighborhoods is one of my all-time favorite albums. The Dogs Eating Dogs EP was great too. Shame this had to happen... I was really excited about where their songwriting was headed. Up All Night is such a jam Everything after "Snake Charmer" wasn't that good I'll give you that. But those first 5 songs are great. Snake Charmer is one of my all time favorite blink songs. Yeah that ended about 10 years ago bud Ended a while ago. Seriously, there are so many [Uncle Ricos](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EJUSe8OmLjQ/TlGwcovg9HI/AAAAAAAAAhI/nbRSsEhhUJA/s1600/NapDynamite_132Pyxurz.jpg) in this thread. 

&gt; My Childhood is over. 

How old are you? I was born in 92 and Blink wasn't a big part of my childhood. Only people with really old siblings listened to them. You would have to be close to 30 for your childhood to be over, in which case it's been over. You're childhood has been over for a few years now, you're an adult now.   Haha you are right. I am 29. Only one thing comes to mind now.
http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t249/jstewholymoly/1236385692459_f.jpg +44 sucked ass. I remember Honda Civic Tour where blink 182 and MCR were advertised as equals but MCR was treated like an opening act and Blink played almost twice as long.  Really? The show I went to for that tour had them both playing about an hour or so. MCR was a far better performance, but I still came for the blink.  It was 30min for Matt and Kim, 50 for MCR and 90 for Blink for me. I feel like if he did this in person, this whole thing wouldn't even be even close to as big of a deal, Blink 182 would just go on without him. Unfortunately, he had to be a dick about it and that's what gets me the most. I don't think there would've been any problem if he'd just straight up told them "I've moved on guys, sorry."

But it's all this wishy-washy bullshit and the whole "I don't even have the balls to call you myself" stuff that really pissed them off.  

Can you imagine trying to get in touch with someone you've known for 20 years and having to talk to their "management"?  That's beyond insulting at that point.   I know what I'm gonna listen to tomorrow all day. Some fucking Blink. They were one of my favorites growing up. This is a sad day.  I'm glad these guys come out about it this way, it was pretty obvious this was going on in the band that they had to cover for him for such a long time. Nothing they said surprised me at all and only confirmed what everyone else could see. Tom clearly isn't into blink 182 anymore and has been holding it hostage amongst Mark and Travis like a douchebag. He puts no effort into it at all, holds everything up and then only cares about A&amp;A. It was relieving to hear Travis say that Blink 182 is for when he needs the money.  

Im glad they called him out on his shit and hopefully force him and his attitude to fuck off so Mark and Travis can progress with Blink 182 and move forward. If anyone think it's a dick move for Mark and Travis to do this, remember that this exact same thing happened 10 years ago, and clearly hasn't changed at all. it has only gotten worse as Mark and Travis want to move forward but cant. 

As for the many people excited about seeing more +44, why? why not bring what +44 is into blink 182 now. Why should they have to continue on as another band again. find new bandmates and completely change up Blink 182 for what they want it to be. +44 should be releasing music as Blink 182 and move on from allowing Tom to have is spot open for himself again. I'd love to see Blink 182 tour with other artists filling Tom's place, it would be refreshing.     &gt; As for the many people excited about seeing more +44, why? why not bring what +44 is into blink 182 now.

Legal shit. Tom is 'on hiatus' so technically still part of the band and he probably owns part of the name. They could just switch the name to +44, get another guitarist vocalist (Skiba) and play Blink &amp; +44 stuff + new songs.  This. I'm glad someone bothered reading the interview!!

Blink are gonna be better than ever now that Tom is gone.

Long live Blink!! I would love to hear an album written by Mark, Travis, and Matt Skiba. That sounds awesome. I wish I could see them live. I don't think the current way we construct a building is prepared for the queef that would be born inside me  I got the chance to meet Matt a few years ago at a show in Providence, he was so fucking cool to all his fans Seeing Alk3 in person is on my bucket list. From Here to Infirmary is still my favorite cd of all time. Just perfect. 

I hoped he was a nice guy, I just don't want to think bad about Alkaline Trio I guess. Did you manage to get an autograph?  Yeah, actually we did. It was my second time seeing them, I brought my sister who is just as big of a fan, he actually remembered me (the shows were only about 6 months apart in the same city, and I'm 6'5) he was having a great time with everyone outside the tour bus and he ended up signing a record for my sister, and talked with us for quite a while (he was embarrassed at first because he asked if we were dating). I also talked briefly with Dan. 

This was my second time meeting them, the first time was much more in passing, but still very pleasant. I'm sure I have a picture somewhere on one of my old Razor phones.  That's awesome,and really sounds like what I'd like my interaction with them to be like.. it gives me a lot of hope that I won't look like a dork/stalker when I do finally get a chance to meet them What's your age again? It almost soothes my soul that this is the most noteworthy Tom Delonge will ever again be. Except that AVA just had a very successful release..... By AVA standards, yes. You won't be seeing any of their singles chart. "successful" 

How so?  Seeing as how reddit sometimes manages to outdo itself in various ways, I would love it if somehow this post consistently stayed around long enough for the band members to see it and the rest of the comments were basically all the reasons why we all loved (or still love) Blink-182 growing up. 

The fans are the sole reason for everything Blink-182 has successfully accomplished and it would be nice if they, especially Tom, could fully see the impact of their music, even if it's just to let them know how grateful we are for everything throughout the years. Hell, if it somehow at least kept all band members are friendly terms regardless of the outcome of the bands existence itself, that's good enough because Blink-182 truly showcased friendship, fun and love better than most other artists ever have and for that we will always be thankful no matter what. 

I doubt all this can happen but I can still dream. All Blink-182 could do when writing and playing songs was dream and look at what they accomplished with all their combined effort. 

Thanks Blink-182, and of course the fans, for helping create so many cherished unforgettable memories we wouldn't trade for the world. First concert I ever went to with my best friend, at the time, Mark. I consider it one of the top 10 best/happiest days of my life.  They played at the then Arrowhead Pond.  They came out with a giant stage prop of the word "FUCK" completely on fire.  It was awesome.  Dammit I'm actually pretty excited. I always liked the songs Mark sang more anyways. I always had the picture in my head that Mark and Travis were the fun ones, while Tom was a little too heavy. Alkaline Trio and Blink were my favorite bands as a young'n so to see them collaborate is pretty damn sweet. Ah Tom DeLonge,  the Crispin Glover of pop punk.  Can't say I didn't see it coming, I saw the last show they played on England before their 2004 split and you could feel the tension on the stage. It was like Tom was going out of his way to perform poorly, then I saw them again at Leed festival this year and it was the same story. Matt fucking Skiba though... Tom Delonge has since tweeted (and deleted) [this!](http://imgur.com/Xb3rxNC) This is *very* likely fake. If not, it was probably only because Travis refused to travel by plane... which is absolutely understandable.  The sad part is the Rolling Stone comments are actually insightful and they're having an actual discussion about it.  On Reddit it's nothing but retards quoting songs or posting gifs trying to be funny and get karma.   So sad.  I remember when Tom would come over to watch movies when he was friends with my little sister-in-law or when I would run into him when he worked at the mall in Poway in the SOMA days when they were working on their first two albums and despite the piercings and his insistence that he was going to be a big rock star he seem like a genuinely nice guy.  The stories since then have painted one of paranoia and ego. &gt;his insistence that he was going to be a big rock star ...  The stories since then have painted one of paranoia and ego.

Well it appears to me ego was part of the equation before anyone else had even heard of them.
 It felt more like selfconfidence at the time but looking back I can see your point. It was total grandiosity.  I wouldn't go that far.  There is a line between being self-assured and confident in order to use it as motivation which if left unchecked with the addition of success, yes men, hyper jealous and semi paranoid GF now wife (I think they are still together) you get this.  Again, these are just assumptions on my part based on my limited contact with him back in the early days and I will readily admit that I was overly protective of my little sister-in-law and would have thought the same about any guy that was trying to get with her. It may be serious paranoia. Isn't he big into conspiracies and stuff?  Just a little lol. Haha I'm pretty sure his "ohgosh the aliens are comin to git me" is a tad more than just a little haha  STORIES! GO! Nothing much as I was away at school for most of the time and only went to SD/Poway on the weekends ( I wasn't married yet just BF/GF) and got along with the in-laws enough to where I would come stay at their place all the time.  I remember only meeting Mark once or twice at the house as he already had a GF and spent mostly of his time with her.  I was first introduced to Tom when he came over to the house and had a cardboard cutout of a banana (I think it was a banana) and was asking if my GF's sister was home.  She wasn't and I thought he had left but I swear I caught him on the side of the house trying to see if she was in her room but I can't be sure it was him running away or the other guy that was known to come by as well.  Anyway there were a few times where I would run into him when we would go play tennis at the tennis club where I think he worked the front desk and then later when they had either just released or were about to release their first CD but he was still working at the mall (GNC I think).  He was always nice to her parents even though as the time went on his look went from normal HS kid to punk which to my mother in-law was not crazy about and would often make comments as she is very conservative.  He was never rude but soon after the first or second album came out and he hooked up with his GF later wife I saw less and less of him and was told it was due to the fact that his GF didn't like him hanging around with my GF's sister.  I think I have a couple picks of him at the house but they are on film (what's that right!) and will have to look in storage for them.  I have some of Travis B from back then too but it was before he was ever with Blink and was from an after party when he was with the Aquabats or played a gig with the AB I think. That's crazy! Yeah, travis was in the aquabats and I don't think blink knew about travis at the time...it's insane you just happened to know both of them before they knew each other! I used to be young and hip at one time and was really into SKA and they were one of the band that played locally that we liked.   If you ever get a chance to see them perform live, do it. It will blow your mind. Saw them perform live in Las Vegas at the last Vegoose music festival in 2007. A magical two days of these guys, muse, atmosphere, rage against the machine, daft punk, queens of the stone age.... much more I've forgotten. Ah! I was there! It was fucking awesome! You forgot The Shins and M.I.A.!

Probably the best concert experience I've ever had.  [What the fuck. Are you talking about.  All them?  All that?](http://i1.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_z-WN24rdA/UtBCaAwP4BI/AAAAAAAAELA/fdQw7E03osg/s1600/tina-fey-glasses-gif.gif?resize=500%2C277) Yup. 2007 was the last year for Vegoose, though. Sorry buddy. They went out with a bang, though  Christ that sounds like the greatest festival lineup ever. Were they staggered so you could see every single group? Wow. Killer line-up! For real. Those are some of my favorite bands right there. I've always wanted to see QOTSA, Muse, and Rage. To wipe them all out with one festival? With my luck, they'd all be playing at the same time.  I once left a wedding early to see the Queens. Totally worth it.  Your own wedding. Saw them tripping on gel tabs at Bonnaroo one of the best experiences in my life. He sang half the show with a bucket on his head then took the bucket off put it on top the mic and played a drum solo on it that sounded ammmmmmmmmaaazing.  I saw him live FOR FREE in San Francisco at the Blue Grass Festivle in 2013 it was amazing, It was so unexpected too I saw them live in the pouring rain this summer at Riot Fest in Chicago. Amazing. The rain just fueled them. [This is the only picture I could find of the show online](http://i.imgur.com/ahBBEt5.jpg).

I was about 20 or 30 feet back from where the photographer was in this picture. Best band I've seen live by far. That night at Riot Fest was, and probably will always be, the greatest night of my fucking life.  Was also there. What a crazy day.  I never thought I would ever see Gogol Bordello, Offspring, Slayer, and lose my virginity all in the same night. That's gonna be hard to top.  One of my tops as well. Went right from Gogol to The Offspring. We worked our way up to about 5 people from the front.  You say summer, but as I recall it was like 40 and raining during their performance. Which made it all the more fucking awesome. I was a few people from the barricade and the energy was phenomenal. 10/10 would experience again. Muddy shoes and all.  Hahaha. I had to throw out my shoes. I went to an army surplus store the day before and got long underwear and a beanies cause I was just visiting Chicago and had no cold weather stuff. I made it to the very last song of Slayer with only muddy shoes. Then in front of a lot of people bit it hard in front of the mud by the games. I got up, mud running down my whole side, and threw my arms up like I stuck the landing to the cheers of everyone around me. I tried to wash mine in a hotel shower. No dice. Spent some time without shoes like a total festy. Thank god for KMart.  I must have been right in front of you during this set. Hahaha were you that middle aged lady who looked like she was about to die and spent the whole time trying to keep space around her. I'm always surprised how many older people show up for Gogol Bordello shows (at RiotFest and other venues as well). It was such a fun night.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrvNcSGF2Y

Even if it was freezing with the rain.
 I still have mud on my boots from that show. They opened with "Not a Crime" and just escalated from there. Also, IIRC, there was a pile of trashed equipment in the middle of the stage that kept growing throughout the set. This was the most face-melting set of my life. Those kids pulled out the Ukranian flag. And honestly, the mud and the rain and the cold made it all the more exciting for me. It made that whole shitty day completely worth it. Oh, RiotFest. I can't wait for next years!  &gt; Start Wearing Purple for the encore, and I was right up front singing my head off. Damn near sung my mustache off my face.

Best show I have ever seen live. So much energy for every song. I would love to see them again. Start wearing purple was when the crowd went batshit crazy.  Hey hey hey-

(all:) NAH NAH NAH NAH!  I was late to a concert they were opening for and only got to see their last song. I believe it was this song that they played but it was an awesome performance

They were opening for System of a Down, my absolute favorite band. All-in-all it was an awesome night, wish I could have made it on time to see more Gogol Bordello I saw them open for System in Seattle back in 2011! saw them open for system as well! Shoreline Saw them on the moon. i saw them, and then i scattered the pieces I saw them live and it didnt blow my mind. but the show was pretty high energy and cool. the tickets were cheap and a bunch of friends were going and I recently watched Everything Is Illuminated which was enough by itself to sell me. I saw them in Sheffield about a month ago.  The crowd were not as enthusiastic as the band hoped, it seemed so there was some swearing at the crowd and that didn't go down very well.

It felt like it was not their best gig ever and that made me sad. I saw them open for Primus in Brooklyn a few years ago, dope ass show! [Big in Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Pk4mlxY2row#t=2764s). primus sucks Gogol Bordello covering Tom Waits was a dream come true. Just The Right Bullets was awesome.  Whoa! I was at that show. One of the best shows I've ever seen. Pretty sure I was there with you guys.  I too was at that show. Astronauts man. Astronauts. Saw them in Jersey, do not regret going at all. They were one of the most high energy performances i've ever seen! Seem 'em twice in DC. Best show(s) you'll ever see.  9:30 Club in DC two weeks ago. I saw them live from the first row once. I was soaked with beer from the crowd, Eugene threw red wine over me, I was sore all over and lost my voice...it was one of the best shows I have ever been to xD They know how to party! I saw them in 2008 and I left the show covered in 80% other people's sweat and missing a shoe. Agreed. Seen them 7 times now, each one was different and totally worth it.

Best show was in Boulder, least impressive (still GREAT) was in Monterey, CA. See them in a setting with a roof, if you can. They'll blow it off and the extra intensity is worth it. Saw them in Finsbury Park, blew me away and I didn't know who they were at the time. I did soon after! i was there as well! everyone was like EUGH another band, give us RAGE! they start up ! ohh it was amazing

do you remember when he dismantled the drum kit, and threw it into the pit, then had it brought up, and stood on it, and crowd surfed for the next song via a wireless mic? 

 Saw them at a free show in San Francisco a few years ago. It was a huge awesome concert. Saw them at Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland a couple years ago with GZA. They were amazing, played Alcohol for their encore, it was beautiful and heart-wrenching.

GZA was alright. It's hard for his music to be bad, but he wasn't in good form.
 I wish they played more shows in my area :( When I saw them the lead singer came out chugging a bottle of vodka. It was an amazing show. I just saw them last week at Terminal 5 for the first time! They were incredible. I saw them for the first time in 2005 at the Warped Tour in Salt Lake City. They were absolutely the highlight (well, them and Billy Idol) for me. They were really unknown then and had a small audience. I stood in the front and had freakin blast. Afterwards they signed autographs from their booth and told stories about the origin of this song. I've been to well over 100 (135 by last count) concerts and my experience with them was one of my more awesome concert moments.  Saw them in DC just a few weeks ago, my face melted from the awesomeness. I saw them live at the LowLands festival in the Netherlands last summer. It was very awesome and I had [one of these](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81XlIzyO15L._UX385_.jpg) while I didn't even knew this song, which made it even more awesome!

edit: it's a cheap ugly wig They opened for QOTSA in Denver at red rocks, I had never heard of them before. Although I can't say I LOVE their music... I was thoroughly entertained by there performance, very energetic! I saw them at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, NJ. It was amazing. I saw them perform when I was like 12, and I am so mad, because I wish I had been older and able to appreciate how awesome they are. Saw them 3 times last year once at the start of the year once at a festival and once on my birthday. I'd definitely go see them again in a heartbeat. Saw them at Finsbury Park, London, supporting at the Rage Against the Machine victory gig. Utterly magnificent. I saw them live in NYC one New Year's Eve. It was one of the best shows I've ever scene. Truly a great group of people.  Saw them live this last fall at Riot Fest in Chicago. I had never heard them before, but after hearing them my gf and I took down the name in our phones and downloaded some of their music after. If you ever get a chance to see them live, definitely do it if you like any bands like Modest Mouse, Frank Zappa, etc. Best show I have ever been to.  Can confirm. Saw them when they came to Minneapolis in Aug, 2013. They sounded amazing. When they played this song it was fucking **nuts**. The energy in the crowd was insane. "I know you since you were a-twenty...I WAS TWAUNTY!" Been listening ever since I saw WristCutters. But dude, In the similar videos...Piebald. I just found something fucking awesome!  Wristcutters is such a cool movie.  Piebald!

"We are the only friends that we have" is way up there on my list of albums that throw me into a complete reverie trance. Be it the stage of life I was in when I heard it, or the stage of my life that I recollect from its lyrics, or whatever... I just love that album. It's simple and straightforward, but I can't put a finger on just what it is that makes it so great.

Gee I hope we're talking about the same Piebald... Hey! You're part of it!

 I wish they'd make a comeback.  Was at the "we are the only friends" album release party at the Palladium with Thursday.  Pieblald is such a fun band Thursday is also awesome. Saw them open for Minus the Bear many moons ago. Excellent concert. One of my favorite albums of all time.  They needed more exposure.  No one I know has heard of them.   &gt; I can't put a finger on just what it is that makes it so great

It's fun music. It's upbeat and makes you move.  Man. When you relate songs or even full albums to a period of your life, you know it's good.  Wait, were they actually in that movie? I was just about to comment that they really reminded me of that song haha No, but one of the characters was based on frontman Eugene Htz and their "demo tape" was actually a Gogol Bordello song.


Htz did star in "Everything Is Illuminated" though (one of my favorite movies, his performance is hilarious), and [the rest of Gogol Bordello makes a cameo appearance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id15tjDK3K0).
 Have you read the book? It's most excellent read! Oh, okay. I knew the music sounded familiar at least haha. Thanks for the info! I found them through Wristcutters too! I love that movie. I just wish i could get my friends to like it too.  [JMU... Duuuuukkeeeesss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJkVkFeFqnw)

Ninja Edit: "Start Wearing Purple" is a tradition with our Marching Band (Largest in the nation) at JMU. 

[Here is a video of our kickass pep band playing it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuSW283kxio) damn that was actually really tight Brilliantly done.  Scrolled down just to see this. Dukes. So awesome making this rock in the convo. I didn't realize this is where it originated. I love how they play this before basketball games. Fucking greatness. I would have stuck with band longer if we had played this at football and basketball games. That is fantastic. I don't know what it is about marching bands that give me goosebumps when they absolutely nail something. Yessss go Dukes!! Not sure if it's the echo, but percussion needs to be tighter. I know I loved messing around during parts of shows, but it could be cleaner. That was awesome :D Fuckin tight! I would be jumpin around everywhere ... we beat tech [I love Gogol but I really wish other songs of theirs would make the front page](http://imgur.com/op5gh9u) link to other songs? American Wedding https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4ORIIT-W80&amp;index=6&amp;list=AL94UKMTqg-9BokcqPmEmsqQho54Zo1rQK Where is vodka?  Where is marinated herring?  Weird, that's usually the first thing I say when I wake up in the morning. This is my favorite Gogol song. First time I saw them live (at Webster Hall in NYC), Eugene did a few songs, just him and his acoustic guitar. He completely forgot the lyrics to this song (might have had something to do with the two bottles of wine he had drunk on stage by that point), but it was still fantastic! [Immigraniada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKpgb2WrGo0) also [Through The Roof 'n' Underground.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKaSsyvxZE) Through the roof is so amazing. It was absolutely phenomenal in Wristcutters, although it helped that the one guy was basically portraying Gogol's singer. That was Gogol's singer. The dude who electrocuted himself, right? Nah, it's a guy named Shea Whigham. Partly based on Eugene from Gogol, tho.   *We're coming rougher every time*...   This is my favorite video of them live and kicking ass.

[Think locally, fuck globally.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbgC3qw_OlM) That one is great indeed. I also very much like [Not A Crime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StZwrbKHnG4). My favorite https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3SUPPeuRdU [Alcohol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fmZCve025Q)

My favourite. It's a slower song and pretty easy to listen to, even if you're not a punk rocker. My personal favorite: "[Wonderlust King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3SUPPeuRdU)"

"And presidents, and billionaires, and generals, they'll never know. They'll never know what I have owned, what I have owned. I am a wonderlust king!" Has to be one of the most emotional moments in all of music for me.

 The whole song is extremely quotable. This and Not a Crime are my personal favorites. If we're talking about quotable Gogol songs, I will always have a soft spot for Ultimate:

    If we are here not to do
    What you and I wanna do
    And go forever crazy with it
    Why the hell we are even here Is there a single song of theirs that isn't quotable? Not a crime is phenomenal New history of-DADADADADADADADADADADADADADADOH! DADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADAOH

FTFY! Heh. Eugene was my roommate when he wrote this song. He was practicing it day and night and it starting taking real shape quickly; I came in his room where he stood, lyrics pasted to the wall, strumming and singing away:

Me:  "Hey I like this. Double chorus, nice." 

Eug: Laughing maniacally. "It's fucking CRU-CIAL! DOUBLE CHORUS! It's gonna KILL! The DOUBLE CHORUS MAN--ALL THE BEST SONGS HAVE THEM!"

Anecdote aside, I posted mainly to say that Eugene would agree with you that WK is one of his best songs, he was quite proud of it. 


 Here's a starter.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=AL94UKMTqg-9BokcqPmEmsqQho54Zo1rQK I love the performance of [Tribal Connection at Reading Festival in 2010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7llerROMqg).

I've seen them live well over 10 times, loved each and every time I've seen them! [We Rise Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU-uzWUzE40) is one of my favorites. No one has linked my two favorite songs by Gogol, so.

[Dogs were barking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ykKXdcHooM)

[Mishto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8BLPJOZ1sU) [Universes Collide]( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sARzPzKhViY) This is my favorite now, because of seeing it preformed live. It's a great song, but the energy of the crowd during the performance was something I had never experienced before. Also my second time crowd-surfing. [Oh No](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzBpkkM3qP8) is my favorite song of theirs, and I never see it get much mention. Heres my fAvorite by them. Or Sally. Or occurrence on the the border... Or Mi Companjera http://youtu.be/grKaSsyvxZE Repost, got it, my bad. :&lt; Nah it's all good, it was less about you and more about how only hits make it to the top of /r/music  Dude Kyle, doesn't that make sense though? I mean the hits are what people want. For someone like you, you can just listen to your favorite jams but for someone that has not heard the music before, don't you think that a hit would be a pretty good starting point? You're not the only one who's seen Everything is Illuminated. My first time seeing it here bud, it's alright. NPR Music Tiny Desk Concerts-Gogol Bordello- Alcohol http://youtu.be/dtEeOtzh_VM ... should really get more attention imo. Ari Shapiro just posted a video saying it was his all time favorite performance on the show I saw them on Dec. 27, and it was fucking amazing. I haven't been to a show with so much energy from both the performers and the crowd in long time.

They played Start Wearing Purple for the encore, and I was right up front singing my head off.  Damn near sung my mustache off my face. I was there!! Front row, stage right. 9:30 club, right? Awesome show! Such a great song. Found about Gogol Bordello, and this song, in [*Everything is Illuminated*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVQly3hqPMY). The lead singer, Eugene Htz, also debuted his acting career in that movie. So of course the whole band is featured. Yes it's his seeing eye bitch Did you repose? Yeah, I reposed.  Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. If you like this, then you'll love Leningrad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-CnWwbeetE I've seen this song posted on reddit many times and I love it. I tried to find other Leningrad that I liked and didn't find much that was very similar to this song. Are there other songs like this I'm missing and/or other bands that sound like this? Every time either one of these songs are posted the other is linked in the comments but I WANT MORE!  Dukes Duuukkeeesss Everything is Illuminated is one oh my favorite movies and features this music and the author of this song. If I was given the chance to get trashed and party with a band, Gogol Bordello has always, since the first day I saw them, been my first choice by a few orders of magnitude.

Ska might be dead, but the gleeful merriment of Gogol Bordello carries on the torch of "music that is merry yet not utterly mindless and self absorbed" in my head.  If you ever get a chance to see these kids live, do it.  I have never in my entire life seen such a happy and euphoric crowd. Never heard of this band before last Saturday. A friend invited me to their show and I'm instantly a fan.

Sooo much energy in their live show. That's a common scenario. Lead singer stole a bunch of money from the rest of the band. So punk of him. Look up the lawsuit So are they still together? Do they just ignore that and keep touring? Pretty Gypsy of him though.  Yep, googled it, thought something wasn't quite right with the arrogance of the singer when seeing them one time. Thanks for the heads up.

 Just saw them in Philly for New Year's Eve. Absolutely amazing. I was there as well and that show was amazing. Gogol played for almost 2 hours and kept their energy high throughout. Man Man should get more mention on the interwebs. They are phenomenal. They were here?! Where at?  Electric Factory! Man Man opened. Great show. Eugene Hutz was awesome in Everything Illuminated. " Many girls want to be carnal with me... because I'm such a premium dancer!" "Please do not be distressed. This is only the driver's seeing-eye bitch." Gogol Bordello will forever hold the top spot for live act I'd put Foxy Shazam up there, at least for recent acts.  Rob Zombie is pretty high up there. Saw him with Manson. Poor guy couldn't hold a candle to Rob. Yeah it was Mayhem 2013 for me. Man he blew us all away, and it was my first concert to boot. Just saw them at terminal 5! Great show with man man opening.  You think you're ready for all things miserable, dark and wild, but one night in Bushwick you find yourself at the upstairs hovel inhabited by these people and there's something off about the whole experience. It's not the languid hovering around a couch, it's not the dark environment or the slight smell of mold. 
It could be the companions who dragged you here. A red-haired strung-out bass player who looks at your girlfriend with hungry eyes and carries a weight of sadness around him, who lives in his van, who doesn't really interact with you despite the fact that you've shared plenty of space. Or it could be your musician girlfriend who has self-admitted to reckless endangering behavior. 

None of it feels like a party. None of it feels like the pleasant or hedonistic experience you've seen advertised. It all feels a bit beyond hedonism and more like a wasting disease. You can't even bear the sight of the four people huddled on the couch, mostly non-communicative. And you get yourself out of there, but it doesn't save anyone like you hope it would and you end up with your girlfriend in an ER months later as she suffers withdrawals and lies the whole time about how she's having an asthma attack despite her strange refusal to have blood taken for tests the doctor thinks are important. 

There is a dark dark underbelly to the world.  Alot of fucking fun. The lead singer of gogo got on top of a giant drum and crowd surfed atop of it while singing and banging on said drum Saw them open for System in Vancouver, 2010.  Amazing show - just blinding colors everywhere on the stage, great sound considering the music, everyone was having a great time.  Was almost better than System.... The lead singer has a very interesting background. He was born in Chernobyl and was forced to flee when the thing went up.  I saw the title of this post and the chorus immediately started playing in my head haha. I first heard this song on a Warped Tour mix CD I got with my tickets when I was like.. 13 or some shit like that.


I never really listened to any other songs they have, but now I'm gonna have to. :) Thanks for the post! System of a Down meets Frank Zappa. All my friends love this band, I don't know what it is, I just can't get into it. Well that's a genre I've never hear before. Reminds me a bit of Kaizers Orchestra! Boy the last album was awful.  A few good tracks, not THAT awful after all. I heard this song on some movie with Elijah Woods in it. Something about Russia and sunflowers and his grandfather or something. But I loved it and played it for my rock history class.

EDIT: Ukraine, not Russia. Also, the movie is "Everything is illuminated' http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0404030/

credit to /u/LeFromageQc &gt; Something about ~~Russia~~Ukraine

FTFY

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0404030/ Saw them for my birthday last year in Houston. The band is all about the fans and interaction is pivotal to them. I was lucky enough to be front row and got handshakes from the majority of the members. Sincere ones, not that bullshit graze touch. Eye. Contact. And a real "thank you for coming." All time favorite performing group.  With all the comments of how great of a live band they are, my favorite memory from the show was how Eugene came out with a bottle of red wine and drank half, and poured half all over himself before beginning the show. It was also about 11am. Was excellent. I went to a show, front row.. Half the bottle ended up on me. 

I got puller over on the way home. Immediately pulled out of the car because I not only reeked of it, but had half a red/purple shirt. I tried to explain I had not been drinking, but had a Punk Rock Romani pour wine all over me (Honestly, I was drinking but stopped in case this happened). Anyway, passed sobriety test and breathalyzer. 

10/10 would do it again because its a great show and that just added to the lore. "Punk Rock Romani" is one of the greatest things I've read in a long time. I've seen the name Gogol Bordello around for years but somehow never took the time to listen. I'm now catching up on all those wasted years. This is awesome.

 Gogol Bordello used to get into fights on stage with another great band, World/Inferno Friendship Society.  

[Another good one from Gogol Bordello - Huliganjetta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHEgbPD3Tw4&amp;index=2&amp;list=RD0JKyvP4pVLc)


 Jack came first. Your tattoos....they're gonna fade  It's one of their weaker songs, in my opinion. They have a lot of great songs. This one is just easy to remember the lyrics, and it's pretty fun and catchy, so it's more accessible.  And the video looks like a traveling circus afterparty Good song but doesn't it somewhat strike you as repetitive? 

I'm a huge Gogol Bordello fan so please don't wreck my anus. Gogol Bordello was the very first concert I attended. They set the bar for me! Amazing! Good Lord that song is terrible  You should try some [Die Antwoord](http://youtu.be/AIXUgtNC4Kc) then. I like them. I really don't like this music. My first rock show. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f468tPT6oCQ i love this song. Last time I saw them they played it as an encore and he just kept playing until they turned the lights on, and they he played some more I couldn't believe it   Ah thanks, it's been awhile. [deleted] I saw them a couple of years ago for a Halloween show with everyone in costume and it was surreal.  A guy dressed as Cookie monster leaped from the balcony and broke his ankle and had to be carried out and the band never stopped.  A truly great Ukrainian band. You have no idea how long I have been trying to find this guys music, came across it once when I was 16, tries to look it up again some years later with no luck, much thanks! We used to make our pledges listen to this.... Holy shit! I just randomly started listening to this again today.  Cosmic connection. lol My dad got me one of their albums a few years ago for a birthday, and I'd never heard of them up to that point. Dudes got some awesome taste for a man approaching 60. was this song ever feature on Futurama, or other show? I heard this song on some movie with elijah woods in it: something about russia + sunflowers and his grandfather or something. but I loved it and played it for my rock history class I need some red wine now Man I haven't heard this song since 6th grade when my purple-obsessed algebra teacher would always play this. We step together, through the weather.... One of the best shows I've been to. Party!!! http://youtu.be/yXU5zUHA1Ak Start wearing purple is catchy but not my favorite. Sam him live in Chicago. Small venue. SUPER AMAZING SHOW. Saw them in Dixon Ill. during Gentlemen of the Road Tour 2012. Awesome concert at an awesome festival. This is the song that got me into Gogol Bordello years ago... I've seen this bad play at Red Rocks, The Filmore Detroit, and Orion Festival and they are hands THE BEST live band I've seen. So energetic. Seeing this song live is one of the most incredible, and memorable experiences I will ever have. They go absolutely insane and repeat the chorous for a good 15 minutes. The lead singer was drinking red wine by the bottle and was going crazy! I saw them at a festival (virgin free fest 07) and the entire crowd was so into it, jumping up and down and everything. It was surreal Gogol Bordello is very similar to Leningrad. If you like this, you might like www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-CnWwbeetE. There's a local punk band where I live that loves to perform this song live. They started a ritual where everyone picked up a chair and lifted it up and down to the beat of the song. I was there one night when a chair broke a light bulb, so awesome. I love these guys but this song ALWAYS gets posted... Why not one of their many other awesome songs? Even though I like this song, it is probably one of my least favorite from them. I can't listen to this without thinking of my first love (broke up a month ago). He loves Gogol Bordello. I did too. In fact, what's funny is he'll probably click this post while surfing reddit, upvote, and maybe even save it. Still hard not to crack a smile when I hear it, and then I remember and start crying. Then I realize I'm crying to gypsy music and I get this funny mixture of nauseated and chagrined. 

Ow... I heard that song, bought the album, and it SUCKS. 

If the drummers bf wasn't famous no one would care about this band.  Ezra Koenig's wet dream I can straight up hear Paul Simon melodies in some VW songs.

Not to say they aren't great in their own right, it's just funny to note the influence. Credit where credit's due, Paul Simon got many of those sounds from African artists. I see it as similar to how everyone influenced by Elvis really owes a debt to the black blues and R&amp;B artists whose sounds he popularized in white America. If you read James Brown's memoir, Elvis was heavily influenced by James Brown, according to James Brown. Especially since Ezra had his own little collaboration with a couple of African artists. To be accurate, the song does not feature Chevy Chase. Only the video. Next you'll be telling me that the song "Red Red Wine" *isn't* by Bob Marley.  UB shitting me? Bob Marley, the famous headphone and stereo manufacturer?  I think you mean Professor Dre?  Everyone knows UB40 wrote that song.

*edited for sarcasm. I know you're being sarcastic, but just so people know:  [The Man singing it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeJ55sUacPM)   [UB40](http://youtu.be/-T2MIGuA8p4). I have to admire him for singing and chewing gum at the same time. Apparently not:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3OquI-nzrs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqRJ6WenGM4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSFwR1Gheu8

Plus I've come across several people in real life who thought it was by Bob Marley as well. Similarly Don't Worry Be Happy is frequently mistaken to be a Bob Marley song. In fact, I just searched it and the second link on google is a youtube upload attributed to Marley! You mean "don't worry be happy"  that was definitely Bob Marley &gt;&lt; You're telling me there is more than one dreadlocked black guy who sings major-key songs about being positive? I would also not classify this song as "80's rock" as its genre either. It was filed under "world music" when it was released. I am pretty sure Chevy Chase does the bass solo.

Can you prove he doesn't? I'm sure with enough effort he can, until then, Chevy Chase did indeed do the solo, and there is also a teapot floating in space between Mars and Earth.  Well we did send a chimp into space during the testing stages, and they love a good tea party.  [indeed they do!](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-e0l8NwaxXAM/UMtqiwTVuSI/AAAAAAAAADY/FHMjKtPkcKg/s1600/TEA+PARTY.+2jpg.jpg) Chevy was no bassist, but was a drummer at least through his Bard College days. 

We went to college with Chevy and before we ever thought of the idea of Steely Dan we used to do pickup dates with Chevy on drums. He was a very good drummer. -Donald Fagen I don't know the source here (probably the album liner), but [wikipedia says you're wrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can_Call_Me_Al).

[This interview](http://forbassplayersonly.com/interview-bakithi-kumalo/) backs up that Bakithi Kumalo did the bass solo.

EDIT: I'm sort of perplexed that I've listed two sources showing that Chevy Chase had no part in the bass solo of this song, yet /u/thesmiths86's comment continues to get overwhelmingly upvoted. Found Proof That He Did. He recorded it in an Arizona Studio with Paul on their way to Graceland.

Proof: http://imgur.com/7O08cxp &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232; Goodnight Ned.  Such a good film. In the VH-1 Special for this album Bakithi Kumalo explains that he asked Paul if he could add something to the song because it was his birthday.  He played Paul the solo and he liked it but said it needed something else.  Then Paul had the idea to play it back again but backwards and that is what we hear on the album. I can't find a video of it but it was VH-1's "Graceland" episode of "Classic Albums".

Edit: [Found it!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGz10IWKQKI#t=174) The bass solo is reversed in the song. Then he had to learn the backward version for live shows.  I loved that song when I was a kid; and I've recently discovered that whole album (Graceland) is fantastic! Graceland is one of the best pop albums of all time. it is an album I'd recommend that any person listen to a few times regardless of their musical tastes. You should listen to Rhythm of the Saints directly afterwards. Could you describe Rhythm of the Saints for me? Graceland has been my favorite album for years. I'd love to listen to something else like Graceland. I'll probably read about it on Wikipedia before you get to this but oh well. The simplest way to describe Rhythm of the Saints is; Graceland is to African music as Rhythm of the Saints is to South American music.

They're both very, very good but whichever one you hear first will be your favorite. If you want some recommendations to get into Rhythm of the Saints, The Coast, Spirit Voices, Born At The Right Time and The Obvious Child are my absolute favourites. It's a great album, more 'soothing' than Graceland but there are a few songs I still can't quite sink my teeth into yet. That's not hyperbole.  Great album to put on to do housework to, road trip on, anything; makes you feel good every time.  Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes.. gimme a break, how good is that song?  The Myth of Fingerprints, name any song on Graceland and it'll either make your ass move or make you think.  Or both at the same time. Boy In the Bubble is perfect.  "Losing love, is like a window to your heart, everybody sees you're blown apart, every body feels the wind blow."  His lyrics are so good.   I agree. It was also very controversial at the time of its release. Why was it controversial? Parts were recorded in South Africa which was still under apartheid.

http://www.nme.com/news/paul-simon/63494

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceland_(album)#Controversy

http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/19/paul-simon-graceland-acclaim-outrage http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceland_%28album%29#Controversy I watched a bit of a documentary about it once, Paul Simon traveled to Africa and met a lot of artists there. IIRC, a lot of studios didn't want to work with his new friends and a lot of other people felt he was profiting off of "stolen" music.  He kind of made everyone mad, which was too bad because he was doing something amazing. That doc is on Netflix last time I checked. And would highly recommend it to anyone who likes music history.  That "stolen music" controversy was just for one song on the album, "The Myth of the Fingerprints." We studied this in my World Music class in college.  There were also issues with how the African artists were paid.  At least at first, Simon sort of took them to the cleaners, paying them studio fees but being a bit underhanded with other money that came in by appropriating their music and not crediting them with it.  But it was an important anti-aprtheid success. There shouldn't be scare quotes around stolen.  He outright stole at least one of the songs.  

http://www.stereogum.com/9106/david_byrne_does_paul_simon_the_worlds_biggest_pri/video/ I think a lot of this part of the controversy came later. The big deal was that South Africa, where parts of the album were recorded, was still under Apartheid. 

The world was a very different place, so the surprising embrace of this music was a huge story. 

The concept seems silly, almost quaint now. 

But it has aged remarkably well. It's still one of the best albums of all time, IMHO.  Also, ask [Los Lobos](http://www.stereogum.com/9106/david_byrne_does_paul_simon_the_worlds_biggest_pri/video/) about that. He also ripped off Los Lobos and I know first hand those guys are very decent likable people and great musicians. It disappoints me because I always liked Paul Simon's songwriting from Simon and Garfunkle days.
http://ultimateclassicrock.com/los-lobos-steve-berlin-labels-paul-simon-a-jerk-alleges-graceland-snub/ If you watch his "recent" (~2 years ago?) interview on Jimmy Fallon's show, you can tell he's an asshole.

Doesn't really ruin the music for me personally though.

I guess this video could be nicknamed "two assholes in a pink box." &gt;Doesn't really ruin the music for me personally though.

Sadly, it's true. If the artist's being an asshole ruined music for me, my library would be much, much smaller. Paul Simon is a fucking lyrical and musical genius in my book. I'll cut him a little slack for being temperamental. 99.99999% of all successful artists are tempermental assholes with serious mental health issues.  But...then again, that percentage holds true for the rest of the planet's population as well.   Two dicks in a pink box *FTFY* I grew up listening to Graceland and I can't imagine my life without it! You're lucky to discover it! Me too man. It's special to me.  'losing love 
Is like a window in your heart 
Everybody sees you're blown apart 
Everybody sees the wind blow ' As if I didn't know that,
As if I didn't know my own bed; 
As if I'd never noticed 
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead. Theres a girl in new york city who calls herself the human trampoline.  She means we're bouncing into Graceland  The Boy in the Bubble is one of my favorites as well and the whole feel of the album is amazing and very different from his other work I'm happy for you...growing up in Africa [late 80's to 90's] the entire Graceland Album was used at all sought of occasions. So naturally I knew all the words to the songs and the order of the songs. Fast forward to mid 2000's going on a road-trip with my friends family The Boy In The Bubble comes on and I started singing with great enthusiasm, his dad looks at me in great disbelief. I earned a lot cool points with that family. Graceland and Clapton's Pilgrim are my dad and I bonding albums. Graceland is about a man and his son on a road trip, at least in one reading, right? Sing *ta* *na* *na*, *ta* *na* *na* yeah. There was a TV series called "Classic Albums", which covers the creation of a number of, strangely enough, classic albums. Graceland was one of the first albums they examined.

I'm at work, so I can't really make sure, but I believe [this is the first part of that episode.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koDKOX_H_gk) Me too man Yes. Yes it is. :) I sometimes listen to that album and it reminds me of my childhood. We listened to a LOT of music when I was a kid, but my sister and I always requested "The Al song! Can we listen to the Al song? And Graceland!" Fun fact. The second half of the bass solo is just the first half played backwards. Save yourself some time trying to learn it.

Edit: To clarify, it's the recording of the first half, played backwards.

Edit2: Also, it's still freaking great. God, I've spent so many hours trying to match the feel of that line; how did I never figure this out?! The bass player on Graceland, Bakithi Kumalo, is a beast. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqJV1waDzfM @ 3:45 My band cover this. Bass player nails this. No idea how. I just sing.  See, it's like, well, if you held up a mirror to the bass solo...a sound mirror...and then looked at it forwards and backwards...look at it with your ears, not your eyes...that's what they did. But without a mirror. With a tape recorder or something. [9] A sound mirror - a parrot? How Can The Bass Solo Be Real If The Sound Mirror Isn't Real Yup, I found that out on Graceland documentary on Netflix. I'm just beginning to learn how to play and if the solo towards the end is not the most impressive fucking bass line I've ever heard... More of a fill than a solo, it's really just a descending/ascending scale run.  Another fun fact: Chevy Chase is an excellent piano player and formed a band with the guys from Steely Dan, before they were Steely Dan. Came here to say this. Up vote for music production trivia. Hopefully this guy Paul will get a chance to work with Kanye so he can get noticed. Only the cool kids like Art Garfunkle BRIGHT EYEEEES BURNING LIKE FIRE Garfunkel and Oates. 

The best of both duos. Not sure what's up with the downvotes, their song about technical virginity was clearly the melding of "Man Eater" and "The Boxer" that we all needed to hear. It's so amazing when two perfect musical constellations combine like that. Chevy Chase dropping his drink through the 'table' which turns out to be a drum stand gets me every single damn time! Never noticed that either. The look of disappointment from Paul Simon when Chevy Chase starts to 'sing' is hilarious every single time as well. Then he does it with the flute too. He just didn't learn.  never noticed that before - thanks!

 While I love this song - my favourite version of it has to be the live version (Zimbabwe)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqrKejQTynk

Everyone looks so happy and enthusiastic, it's incredibly infectious his little dance moves are adorkable.  This song always reminds me of my dad's old yellow Datsun. He had a graceland tape that always seemed to be on. 

(like this: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/1974-1977_Datsun_120Y_(B210)_sedan_02.jpg) My brother had a turquoise 120Y. Kiwi? Now that is a fine car to listen to [graceland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fS_7Yp0hY) in. You might like the song Yellow Datsun by Neva Dinova http://youtu.be/VRp9PSTKh_4 Good ol 120Y. My personal favorite is when they play this at University of Florida basketball games. The student section gets crazy into it.

[Link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejXrg3nTRxU) Slightly better quality. (We don't sound that bad, I swear) 

[Link](http://youtu.be/6pec3eCudAM) Thanks for sharing. Makes me want to go to a Univ of Fla basketball game just to hear them play it live. Vh1 loved this video.   It was brilliant in its time. random factoid from paul simon's wikipedia Random made up factoid from old rateyourmusic thread Random factoid about the relationship between Paul Simon and Chevy Chase I think people forget how huge Chevy Chase was back in the day. I know, he absolutely towers over Paul Simon. A few years ago, Chevy returned to Six Flags Magic Mountain to shoot something, and some of the guys that were there when Vacation was shot had a picture of them with Chevy.  They asked Chevy if he remembered taking the picture, and he said something to the effect of "Guys, to be honest I don't really remember anything from the early 1980's." (Source: a personal conversation with one of the engineers at Six Flags who was there).

So that is the context for me saying that even Chevy might not remember how huge he was back in the day.

But to put it in perspective for those who weren't around in the 80's, he was *big*.  Not Steve Guttenberg big, but big nonetheless. This whole album is golden.  I thought the part where he dropped the horn through the table top was the funniest thing I had ever seen when I was a kid He first dropped a small glass of water, and then later it was the penny whistle. Graceland is one of the greatest albums ever created. love the song, but I will admit that I've always had a little crush on Chevy...since way back in SNL days of the 70's. He's dreamy to me...cute, funny The stories from many cast members paints him as an insufferable pain in the ass to work with.  The cast members of... basically every single thing he's ever worked on. When Joel McHale did an AMA someone asked him about this and his response was "Chevy is.....Chevy." to be fair, though, Chevy's own AMA went over pretty well with most Redditors - http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2op1go/chevy_chase_on_ama_and_i_dont_like_it/

 That's actually a really great AMA. Thank you for sharing. I briefed that to read what his response to the "Chevy is a dick" rumor.  

I like Chevy in his roles, but the rumors about him being a pompous ass on set maybe true.   Just too many groups of people for there to be a hate on Chevy conspiracy. 

Some of the original SNL cast, Kevin Smith, the actor from community to name a few   I agree with you, that's why I was kind of surprised that he did the AMA and that it seemed to go over well.  Everything I'd read before that seemed to suggest that he's pompous.  Much the same way that I always read that Michael Jordan is a jerk in real life, so I'd be surprised if an AMA came along where he was all bubbly and chatty and everyone loved him. Right.  There was also something about the "....I became famous before him" in reference to the John Belushi feud.  I like that he said what he was thinking, to a point, but idk it reads like he still has issues with it and the AMA comment seemed tacky.    that's a bummer Sometimes genius breeds asshole-ness.  Assholes exist regardless of genius. And genius exists regardless of assholery. Sometimes the two mix. Streets ahead? @1:58 Chevy puts his drink through the bongo holder. Still cracks me up.  Graceland is my personal #1 album of all time. Paul Simon is just one of a kind really.  My favorite singer/songwriter We play this at every college party. It's our jam. How is this video making onto r/music? Every time I try to post a music video it's removed and I'm told videos aren't allowed. If you have to ask, you're streets behind. Apparently it just needs to be popular. The third verse is actually so poignant and powerful:


&gt;A man walks down the street

&gt;It's a street in a strange world

&gt;Maybe it's the Third World

&gt;Maybe it's his *first time around*

 Paul's lyrics are poetry. My favorite line from "Graceland":

&gt; She comes back to tell me she's gone

&gt; As if I didn't know that

&gt; As if I didn't know my own bed

Something about that just kills me. The imagery here of the half-empty bed, the way he shows us without telling, the vocal melody over the music. I don't know why, it makes me so emotional.  You forgot the next lines. "As if I never noticed, the way she brushed her hair from her forehead." So simple, candid, and yet powerful.  He'll, just put all the lines from that song here. They're all brilliant. I found this really good analysis of the song if you're interested: http://youtu.be/GqQ_umy1lYQ

I could quote, from memory, pretty much every line from this album. 
 I don't get it. It's a play on words. Guy's in an unfamiliar place, and Simon first uses the "first world/third world" analogy to mean he's in an impoverished country. Then he switches the meaning to say, "it's the first world because he's experiencing it for the first time." 

We're moving from an impersonal focus on an area's poverty, using sort of outdated academic terms, to a personal focus on how meaningful it is to experience a place for the first time.

The next lines are: 

&gt;He doesn't speak the language

&gt;He holds no currency

&gt;He is a foreign man

&gt;He is surrounded by the sound, the sound

&gt;of cattle in the marketplace

&gt;Scatterlings and orphanages

&gt;He looks around, around

&gt;He sees angels in the architecture

&gt;Spinning in infinity

&gt;He says Amen! and Hallelujah!

He begins the song as this malcontent, grumpy dude looking to regain meaning in his life. Once he ends up stranded in this very foreign place, he's able to look around, see with new eyes, and recognize the beauty there. It's the third world, but it's his first time around.  I was singing this to my fiance the other day in the grocery store. Good tune! This song puts me in SUCHHHHHH a good mood. Fuck yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is the best music video ever made.  The fretless bass played by Bakithi Kumalo  on that entire album is so fricking amazing. To show you where my mind was in the 80's, all I can remember about this video is when Weird Al showed it on AL-TV and claimed it was Paul Simon doing a parody of his song "You Can Call Me Paul." Would Paul Simon do an AMA? That would be so cool.  My Grandparents used to own a houseboat. Most of my family lives within a short distance if the Mississippi and as a young kid my parents would take my sister and I to see them for dinner on the houseboat. I can distinctly remember the bubbling and smoke and engine noises when my grandpa (Papa, for me) would back the boat out of the marina and onto the river. My grandma (Oma) would have the same CD playing every time we went out on the river. I don't remember most of the other songs, but the first song was Call Me All, and I smile every time I hear this song. The bass solo gets me every time, even though it's just there for a few seconds. The last track on the CD was Isn't She Lovely by Stevie Wonder, and whenever either of those two songs start playing I can't help but tear up and think of Oma and Papa dancing and bringing us out on the river. Don't know who this Paul Simon guy is, but Chevy Chase just launched him into stardom. Bass solo (at 3:44) is palindromic.  It reverses at the midpoint and plays backwards back to the beginning.  It can't actually be played on bass; the second half is a studio construct. In the summer of 1987, I was 11 and my parents and I took a roadtrip from the SF Bay Area to Denver, CO.  We listened to Graceland on cassette the whole way there and the whole way back, at my insistence.

Remember how cool MTV used to be? I met Bakithi Kumalo back in November for a class he did in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Super cool and down to earth guy and a phenomenal bass player.

  Back in the 80s this must have put you on the biggest karma train ever. It'd be like "Taylor Swift - Blank Space [2015] ft. Neil deGrasse Tyson, Patrick Stewart, Elon Musk, and Emma Watson w/ special appearance by Weird Al" Can't wait until Kanye discovers Paul Simon. Graceland - the best album ever made. Suck it Kanye Does no one else remember this as a white room?  When did it turn pink?  Pink was 80s white.  I don't know what that means
 Pastels were super popular. oh.  I understand.  When I watched this video in the 80's I would have bet my left foot that room was plain white.  It now appears pink. I am wondering if anyone else remembers it being white.  I remember it being white.  If, before today, I had been asked to describe this video, the room would have been white.

I can only think it has something to do with the *feel* of the song itself.  It has a very crisp and clean white room feel to it somehow.  I can't explain it. See Miami Vice. Everyone did so much coke in the 80's their eyes were permanently bloodshot; gave a pale pink sheen to everything.

Also explains the popularity of Steve Gutenberg during that time. I like Boy in the Bubble, Graceland and I know What I know better but this is a great song too, love it when it comes on during nights out. Diamonds On the Soles of Her Shoes is my favorite.
 Same. I love the alternate/stripped down version on the re-issue. I love this song, glad to see reddit does too. You won't be walking down the aisel you will be boogieing... This an interesting look/listen into the origins of the musical ideas behind many of the songs on the album:

http://www.kleptones.com/blog/2012/06/28/hectic-city-15-paths-to-graceland/#.VK1bE5_n_qA Calling /u/andywarwheels (Betty) IT'S OUR SONG!   Watching this I wonder if there's a subtle jab at Art Garfunkel here. Paul runs around doing all the heavy lifting, playing all the instruments, while the tall singer just goofs around soaking up attention. we were all so innocent back then  I learned about this song at a [Beardyman set](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMVgYGu_mY). One of my favorites now. Paul Simon was what I listened to growing up. I still have a few of his albums. Just puts you in a good mood. I just heard this song yesterday on the radio and was like hell yeah why don't I own this. Kodachrome is another fav of mine and is featured in the Chevy chase movie "Cops and Robinsons" Pokemon? I've always loved this video, and looking back... Chevy Chase looks like a giant compared to Paul. 1:50 [Andy Kaufman-style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-wUe5aEwHM&amp;t=71) voice hydration Great album, and funny music video.  I have never seen it before! This is my bar jukebox song, because of my name :) Love this album, favorite has to be Gumboots I used to be obsessed with Chevy Chase when I was little and I would wait all day for this video to come on.  Just a great song and video. Simple and excellent. Thanks for sharing  Relevant: http://youtu.be/Dw9hjeQhDMY this sub. Dat bass solo. Deep cut I remember this music video from my childhood. It's weird, it's one of a handful of memories I have from my early years (I loved this song as young child) and although I completely forgot that the guy with Paul Simon was Chevy Chase and that for some reason I pictured in my memory Paul Simon as bald and with glasses - that red drum - that freaking red drum - was EXACTLY how I remembered it since I last saw this video when I was maybe 4 years old. Shape, size and color. What a trippy &amp; nostalgic experience. This little guy should thank Chevy Chase, hes going to be famous after this I always loved this song and wondered about the Chevy Chase thing in the music video (no interweb to fill in the blanks) So classic. Reminds me of when I was a wee lad. It's worth noting: Chevy was only in the video and not on the song. 
That said, a lot of 80s kids who didn't know Chase or Simon at the time of this hit thought that he Chevy was Paul Simon. this was the lockeroom victory song when i played football in 2006
 I love this song.. glad to see reddit does too Thanks. Now this will be stuck in my head for a month. I do love it though. My whole life I have loved this entire album.

This song never made sense to me. The video makes even less.

None of the songs made any sense to me, I just memorized all the words. But it's still so good! Something I've always wondered... it's a great song, and the video looks like it was fun, but how much coke did they all really do that day?  that bass solo is amazing  who tf is chevy chase???!??! this is why i love paul simon for shining light on unknown artists This song was playing in the waiting room just before I was born. This entire Paul Simon album (Graceland) is very good for a road trip.  This is my jam The rest of the album is really enjoyable too.  Such a cheerful song about alcoholism.  [Ratatat redid the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw9hjeQhDMY)... on drugs, I think. I adore this song.  Anytime I hear this song I am instantly reminded of riding in an Oldsmobile Tornado with my Grandfather and being allowed to put the tape in the cassette player. It was a big deal for a little kid. I'm 27 now.  Pierce is a "B." There were some serious contenders but Chevy Chase officially wins the award for absolutely not aging like a fine wine.  Ah yes, the annual You Can Call Me Al submission.
 Not a fan of the video, but I love the song. It was also the go-to parade song for my college marching band, and brings back fond memories :) A classic! 

It also reminds me of the new popular song "Cheerleader" in some way. If you don't own Graceland, you need to go out and get it immediately.  This is an album everyone needs to own.

Two songs I love the album:

Homeless - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT6mlW8NlCU

The Boy In The Bubble - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy5T6s25XK4

Leave it Paul Simon to have a Top 40 hit with a zydeco song. I've always loved this song. I loved it as a kid because it was so bouncy and I thought the call me Al was funny. As an adult I identify way too much with the themes of the lyrics. It is so bouncy for how kind of sad the lyrics are.  Man, Paul Simon truly DGAF. When I first heard it I thought the lyrics were ; "You can call me out" I swear, this vid makes the front page like once a month I recall seeing an intreview where Simon said he was not pleasedwith the video because it had nothing to do with the song. He's right and I can't watch it now without thinking the same thing. This is the song that got me into Fleet Foxes. Their [SNL performance](http://vimeo.com/53104416) can make the hair on your neck stand up. ^^ This one's the best. Josh Tillman aka Father John Misty joined the band after the studio version was made, so you only get him with the live performances. He's drumming and doing backup vocals. His voice at the end is lucid and haunting.  he also left the band. T_T

his own music is great, but i really wish he stayed... He didn't really leave the band. As far as I know, they're just on hiatus.

EDIT: I guess he did leave the band. My b  [Tillman left the band.](http://pitchfork.com/news/45163-j-tillman-leaves-fleet-foxes-other-members-form-new-band-poor-moon/)

I met Robin and his brother at a Grizzly Bear show, nicest bunch of people you'll ever meet. Met his Dad (his whole family and Skye's family were there too) at their last show in Portland, super nice guy. 
 This is the most indie American thing I've ever read  Holy shit Grizzly Bear and Fleet Foxes? That must have been an absolutely phenomenal show. They're in hiatus because Robin went back to college. i remember there being tons of articles in 2012 when he left. here's [one](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleet-foxes-drummer-leaves-band-20120120) of them. I've been in love with this band for so long, but I've never heard any live performances. Thank you for sharing, this was amazing! Then [you're in for a treat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_ckRaL9w-k&amp;list=PL3AC7BDA653F996CD) [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1tbX_NJn98) is also a really cool live performance by them. That video is what got me into Fleet Foxes after only really knowing Grown Ocean.  A truly amazing band they are.   Oh kill me now. This gig was 20mins from where I lived back then, nooooooo. I saw them open for Arcade Fire and they were just as good, if not better. Honestly one of the most flawless live bands I've ever seen. Just incredible execution  Holy shit, that would have been an incredible evening.  Broken social scene &gt; Fleet Foxes &gt; Arcade Fire. I'll never forget it.  Jesus Christ, now THAT is a concert lineup. I'd hand over money to be there without a second's hesitation. I would genuinely consider donating an organ to go to that ACL 2011? Yep :)  Awesome, I was there too.   [Dude...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1tbX_NJn98)

EDIT: Added their [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VreBO1EGpRc) La Blogoteque performance Love this version.  It's forever in my YouTube favorites. That acappela introduction to Blue Ridge Mountains makes me shiver every single time DUDE A wild rabbit appears Same here, and I didn't realize there was so much hair in this band This song just got me into this band. I listened to half the song on youtube just now and am now just waiting to find a good time to listen to their discography. I heard this a few years ago and downloaded the discog and was sorely disappointed in the rest of it.  I might take another listen, on account of me maybe expecting something as haunting as this song.   Really?  Sun Giant EP and self-titled LP are perfect imo.  Hopelessness Blues was just okay, but those first 2 are phenomenal. Yeah, i dunno why, i think it was just too much harmonizing with their voices.  After a bit all the songs sounded the same to me.   After listening to mykonos again though my interest has been piqued once again. I may have to dig out the ol external hard drive and give those albums another chance.  It's nice to have a perfect example of the word harmony.  Something they rarely see at SNL.   Wow, thank you! This was the exact performance that got me into the band. I hadn't seen it since watching it live. I've been a huge fan of them ever since that moment. There's a live version of "Oliver James" somewhere on YouTube and the entire audience is so intensely silent you could hear a pin drop. It's amazing. Woah! Great performance, thanks for posting!  that was really great Where did these guys go? It's time for another album! Fleet Foxes and Beirut and Beach House, please release new music. From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_Foxes)

"On 15 June 2013, an image of a home recording set-upincluding a Macbook Air, microphone and guitarwas posted on the Fleet Foxes Facebook page with the caption "Step one". On 16 June 2013, an image of a broken mandolin with the caption "Step two" was posted. These images have led to speculation that the group is working on a new project, possibly a third studio album. However, these posts have since been deleted. On April 23, 2014 Robin Pecknold posted to the band's Facebook page that he had moved to New York to get his undergraduate degree.

The note read as follows:

"For anyone who's curious, this is a short Fleet Foxes update - been a while! After the last round of touring, I decided to go back to school. I never got an undergraduate degree, and this felt like the right time to both see what that was about and to try something new after a while in the touring / recording lifestyle. I moved to New York and applied to Columbia, and I've mostly been doing that, but I'm working on songs and excited for whatever happens next musically, even if it's down the line. Hope all is well out there.

Best, Robin"" Stupid education Stoopid  slightly stoopid
 Robin posted that he went back to school and is studying in New York. He just scored his cousin's play there, though.  As the others said Robin's back at school, but is supposedly starting to write some new stuff.

In the meantime, go check out J. Tillman, their former drum. He records under the moniker Father John Misty and his new album is fantastic. Best new release I've heard in a while. FJM is really hitting a on something great. Just saw the opening show to his new tour in Felton, CA. He fucking murdered it. Dude is an incredible lyricist. 

"Bunch of 15 year olds made from dinosaur bones singing oh yea"  LOVE that one...."gonna leave things behind that won't decompose" 

"sure hope they make something useful out of me"  I didn't know his second LP was out already. Well...it's not officially. It leaked a few weeks ago. I've been into father john misty and fleet foxes for a bit now and I had no clue they were related in anyway I miss Beirut so much Sweet jesus, yes. All three of those bands are amazing. Let's hope new albums come soon. Their drummer just released the AOTY for 2015.

Father John Misty - I Love You, Honeybear I think Beirut is still busy touring Europe!

EDIT: Never mind. I just realized they're done with that one. Where the hell did they go?  I just saw Beirut in June! They played two new songs then,  so here's hoping for a full album :)  this and blue ridge mountains got me into this band My complaint is that only "Mykonos" seems to ever make the fronst page on /r/music 


Where's all the love for "White Winter Hymnal" or "Helplessness Blues" or my personal favorite, ["Bedouin Dress"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87TB7GlJ3ZA) I love the multiple parts of helplessness blues.  Fantastic song.  The album, and the themes behind it, are just incredible. The whole message of his growth as a person through that album makes me reflect a lot 

Edit: I even tried to write a paper about the album but my teacher wouldn't let me. I love talking about my thoughts about the album so if anyone wants to im game :) haha  I have a lot of thoughts on that album too, it's arguably my favourite record of the decade. I'd love to hear what you have to say about it if you're game. **The Shrine/An Argument - Fleet Foxes; Helplessness Blues**

IMO: One of the most impactful songs off a fantastic album.  
A song that is split into three stages. Three stages of a separation.
 
**Stage 1: The Shrine**
 
*"Sunlight over me no matter what I do  
Apples in the Summer are golden sweet"*
 
Immediately after the separation, he is determined to be happy. Apples seem to represent the concept of love; the love he shared with her was sweet, but he must now go through his days without her love. The apples are not gone, however. They are simply no longer shared with her or anyone else.
 
*"I'm not one to ever pray for mercy  
Or to wish on pennies in the fountain or the shrine"*

*"And I wonder what became of you  
 What became of you*

He wishes to be happy, yet he still occasionally places pennies on the shrine. By placing pennies on her shrine, he sometimes wonders what became of her life, although they are now lives apart.
 
**Stage 2: The Argument**
 
*"In the morning waking up to terrible sunlight
 When you talk you hardly even look in my eyes
 In the morning, in the morning*
 
*"In the doorway holding every letter that I wrote
 in the driveway pulling away putting on your coat*
 
The song picks up the tempo and practically blows up, expressing his frustration and anger.
He presents imagery of what he is going through; memories of the argument. The painful mornings he deals with every morning of every day the moment he wakes up, a sentiment very relatable and personal to me. The mornings truly are the most miserable times of the day while in grief. He then presents very direct and powerful imagery by recalling moments of the argument and her departure.
 
*"in the ocean washing off my name from your throat  
 in the morning, in the morning*
 
In anger, he wishes her memory wiped from his, and his memory wiped from hers.
 
**Stage 3: The Aftermath**
 
It isnt officially called The Aftermath, but it seems fitting to me.
 
The song quiets down immediately. The guitar plays while some ambient noise soothes the listener. Only, it isn't just ambient noise. It sounds, to me, like clay/ceramics/stones sliding against each other, almost as if falling apart. The Shrine, I believe. The perfect image he had of her, along with the thoughts fueled by emotions of anger and mourning are crumbling. I might be reading too much into this, but I think it was intentional.
 
*"Green apples hang from my green apple tree  
 They belong only to, only to me
 
And if i just stay awhile here staring at the sea  
And the waves break ever closer, ever near to me  
I will lay down in the sand and let the ocean lead  
Carry me to Innisfree like pollen on the breeze*
 
He feels a little lonely. He has his green apples, and he enjoys them, but he has no one to share them with.
Regardless, he does not long for a relationship. He now seems strangely content. Now he only longs for the ocean's waves to wash over him and carry him where they shall.
 
He wishes to be carried to Innisfree, where he can live a life of leisure free of his worries.
 
Innisfree is a fictional location in the poem Lake Isle of Innisfree by William Butler Yeats. In the poem, the speaker longs for a fictional utopia on the island of Innisfree, where he can escape his urban life and return to nature by growing beans and caring for beehives. 
Innisfree, to me, embodies all of our longings, our desires, what and where we aspire to be.
 
Anyway, that's my two bits. I was just going to say it's an awesome song but you knocked it out of the park! It's amazing the continuous theme of Innisfree and how that is idea of perfection and human growth and when he gets there, he will have all the answers. The beginning line strikes a chord with me in that he questions his own purpose and what he's bringing to the world. 

At the end of Shrine/ an argument, he washes away into the ocean, and the second to last song is grown ocean, which I think the connection there is cool :) there's a lot more to say but I'm on mobile  Yeah, I haven't heard it in about a year, but I remember loving the innisfree theme as well. "Just to be at Innisfree again/all of the sirens are driving me over the stern" deep bruh It is  I've been listening to "Someone You'd Admire" a dozen times a day for a while now, at the moment its probably my favorite Fleet Foxes' song. Aside from the fact that its really lovely, I just dig the lyrics, and the analysis of himself. Fleet Foxes have been a real help in hard times, and added flavor to good times. The Shrine / An Argument is something I've listened to multiple times recently. Love that song, sans the free form jazz solo at the end. Love that song, especially the free form jazz solo at the end. I love the intense, loud "sunlight over me no matter what I do" line near the beginning. I always get chills. That's 'the argument'  Absolutely! I will listen to a few seconds of that and change it when I realize the lyrics are over. I save that noise for The Mars Volta I actually like Your Protector quite a bit 

http://youtu.be/UzF0DwgXDrY Would you wait for me,
the other one,
would you wait for me?
 I love every song on that album, but Your Protector is my favorite. "Blu Spotted Tail" and "Meadowlark" deserve a look-in too. Let's just agree that all their songs are worth looking into Seriously, they are one of very few bands where I love every single song.  I can set my phone to shuffle and never have to touch it. Jesus Christ, if we are going to name all their good songs we might as well name all of the songs they ever did. Seriously Fleet Foxes is one of my top 5 bands and probably the only band I like in which I think every song is gold  Agreed. Their albums are so satisfying to listen all the way through.  Yes!! Helplessness Blues is such an incredible song!! White Winter Hymnal is my favorite from them, too bad it's pretty short. Play it on repeat, OR, just watch youtube covers of it.

There are dozens among dozens of covers for the song, and I love listening to them because they're all so slightly different yet beautiful. 


EDIT: Like holy shit, I've never heard this Korean A capella version before, but it's lovely. So many good ones out there!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzylLc3ci1I &gt; cover

I recorded this cover a while back: [https://soundcloud.com/mysonbison/mykonos?in=mysonbison/sets/covers] interesting take on it!  "White Winter Hymnal" and "Ragged wood" are my favorites. Ragged Wood is my favorite by them! So happy someone else loves it too Yay! It's such a great song.  I always want to play it on repeat. Ragged wood is the best highway driving song ever written  Oh my god. Bedouin Dress makes me so happy. Montezuma is amazing as well They are all great songs! The Shrine/An Argument and Sim Sala Bim got me hooked It's like I'm listening to myself right her.. YES haha, me too man. my fave fleet foxes jams. Most people's love for Fleet Foxes is totally superficial, man. I want people to notice The Shrine / An Arguments with that minute and a half long sweet cacophony.  It takes a true Philistine to hate that... plebeians... I was listening to the album in the car with my friends when driving home from thanksgiving one time, and my friend just audibly yelled "WHAT THE *FUCK* IS THIS SHIT?!" 


So I had to skip to the next song.  Well, I mean, honestly, that's a pretty reasonable initial reaction. It was mine too. It took me a few more times listening to the song before I gained a certain appreciation for it It's like an avant garde section in the middle of a tranquil album. Catches you off guard, but there's a lot of interesting things within it.  Or The Shrine an Argument. That one is my favourite just because of the different parts.  Blue ridge mountains is really good. Their songs in general portrays a story, and it's something I find interesting  Anthony Fantano described them as a very romantic (movement) band. I tend to agree Yup. YESSSS. Spotify introduced me to them via Blue Ridge Mountains (which are only an hours drive away from me, so I'm fond of them), and I've loved them since.  my favorite version of Blue Ridge Mountains: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1tbX_NJn98 Montezuma is also a really good song of theirs.  Fleet Foxes are great! Try Your protector by them That's the song that got me hooked I might be a little late, but for everyone that wants a different version of this song [here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebn0vD8zlV8). It's on their second EP, and it's more piano-ish btw, is it just me, or does the beginning of the second part of the song remind anyone else of CSN&amp;Y's Ohio? ha! I just posted that it does, before I saw your comment. at least I'm not only imagining it... (or maybe not *the only one* imagining it) ;) You're not crazy, that is absolutely CSN&amp;Y-esque we are hearing..

This band is great. They routinely play on my Iron &amp; Wine Pandora channel which is where I first heard of them. It does! When I heard these guys for the first time, I was also really into CSN&amp;Y We love Fleet Foxes! They rock! Are.....you........the avett brothers?   Every Fleet Foxes song is amazing.
