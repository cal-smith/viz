That basically means its one of those that is half way underground - almost a basement, but not quite. The back door was in the kitchen and led to the alley way, right next to a row of dumpsters.\n\nOne of the apartments I grew up in as a kid was mouse infested. So I knew something was up when heard the gnawing in the walls around the kitchen at night. I looked for droppings around the house but didn't notice any.\n\nI knew not to use poison, they end up dead in the walls or under a stove - they rot and smell, and you can't find them. So I purchased a few standard snapping mouse traps.  One night I heard a POP coming from the kitchen while in bed. Good news to me, but I waited until morning, since i was already dozing off.\n\nI got up, checked to traps. The first one I looked at - it wasn't there. I looked around, it was half way across the kitchen. I figure it must have snapped hard and flipped over there. No mouse,... but.... uhh.. wtf... There was... blood. Blood all over the wall where the trap was, and small globs on the floor. There was even a small bit of hair pinched in the trap. I guess it just narrowly escaped? I guess,... pretty fucking crazy though. Fuck, that mouse will probably die in the walls and stink up the place, I thought to myself.\n\nI kept hearing the gnawing, and once in a while I would hear scurrying about if I got up for a drink at night. I reset the traps. No more snaps though, not even one. Strange.\n\nNever mind, sucks, but just means I have to move the traps and change bait. Got another snap. This time no mouse, no blood, but the bait was gone. It was even gone on one that hadn't snapped. \n\nOne night I thought I heard noise in the living room, so I left powder on the floor between the kitchen and bedroom. Confirmed... the there was a lot of disturbed powder, the mice were definitely leaving the kitchen - probably in response to my cracking down on loose food items and steam cleaning things.\n\n\n**Act II**\n\nOne morning I got up early, it was still dark. I was groggy, but headed to the kitchen to make a coffee. I flipped on the light, and I thought I heard some rustling. I paused, and heard nothing. I kept walking into the kitchen, and as I approached the garbage can, it suddenly started shaking! It shook so hard, that it knocked over the broom leaning on the wall next to it, it freaked me out but, my immediate thought was I had hit the broom, and it shook the trash can. I thought the trash can was going to tip over. So i leaned into catch it.\n\nAs I leaned forward, a fucking BEAR with claws the size of,... bear claws,... jumped out of the trash can, toward my head (because that was the way out of the can). \n\n~~FuuuUUuuck! I jumped back, and I think I did one of those screams where you don't actually make a sound, you just kind of gasping in terror. It clumsily tumbled on the hardwood floor, it righted itself, and looked around. I screamed, and made sounds that I image Marsellus Wallace would never make. It slipped as it frantically tried to run on the hardwood floor, toward the back of the fridge. I fell backwards onto some boxes we had in the kitchen.~~ \n\nI head butted it, and punched it in the face mid-air, like a man! I wrestled it to the floor. When i landed I tried to stomp on it with my bare feet, but it ran away like a little bitch! [Actual photograph of the incident](http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~esf24/rous.jpg).\n\nIn reality, it was a large rat. Larger than a squirrel, maybe the size of a young horse cat.  It used the plastic bag to climb out - thats why it took so long, why it shook so much, giving me time to ~~freak out, and rationalize, and freak out again~~ man-up and prepare for battle.\n\n\n**Act III**\n\nFrom then on, I started putting the lid on the trash, with books on top to keep it down. I set up my laptop in the kitchen, with some motion sensor software, and I got video of it. \n\nConfirmed, lots of movement in and out of the kitchen.  I found out from the video it was just a single rat, big as hell, and it was moving freely into and out of the kitchen all night.\n\nIf I stayed up watching TV, I would see his big ass head come out from under the stove, I'd look and he'd duck away. Eventually though, he realized I wasn't coming for it. He stopped being scared of me, and thought he could walk around freely even when I was around. \n\nDouble FuuuuuckckckUcuckckck!\n\n\nTried rat traps, no good. The son of a bitch learned from the little ones he defeated. He also learned to avoid certain types of bait - I even experimented, by leaving bacon out in the open, no trap. He wouldn't take it. Its like this was an RPG and the bastard had leveled up and increased his INT by defeating lower level baddies.\n\nOne of the main problems, which I had noticed on video, is that the rat was incredibly cautious. When food was left out, it was interested, but it would sniff around it, even bump it to see if it triggered a trap, but usually it would just leave it. Asshole was smart, this was the Moriarty of rats. He had a mangled face and nose and ear - probably from the encounter mouse trap - I started calling him Scarface.\n\nI'm a fucking human, I have thumbs, we send people to the moon and landed on a comet, I can contemplate my own existence mother fucker, and the nature of the universe! I'm gonna beat this fucking rat! \n\n**Act IV**\n\nI tried some elaborate traps, some that were funny, and show how smart the bastard was. If this were a movie its where we would have a montage, but I'll skip them to tell what worked.\n\nI left food where I knew it would go often. In the trash with no lid. If I left the kinds of bait I used before, it left it alone. So I made new bait, and improved it over time. I slowly changed the formula until I made something so potent in oder, and Scarface trusted so much, that he would take from the floor or the garbage can without hesitation. \n\nThe final concoction was a mix of flour, bacon grease, peanut butter, peanuts, maple syrup, honey, sugar, and tiny bits of bacon and ground beef. Fuck, I wanted to eat it, it smelled delicious! I made a lot and kept it in the fridge, but I heated it up in the microwave before use to make the smell spread.\n\nFinally, the trap. I figured I would have one shot before Scarface would get wise and avoid the trash can. I put in a small amount of normal garbage. No liner, so it couldn't use it to climb out. I spread the bait it onto a paper towel, then twisted the towel tightly into a stick-like shape. I pressed it just a couple inches just below the rim of the can, across the opening, and I taped it to a thread also taped to the lid. I also put small amounts of bait around the can, leading to the rim, and to the bait.\n\nI setup the camera, and went to bed. In the morning, my girlfriend woke up to the can shaking all over the place. The lid was closed. Scarface was inside, flipping out. \n\nThe video revealed that Scarface almost didn't fall for it. He followed the trail to the rim, and sniffed at the bait, but then just circled the rim suspiciously. Probably because of the fact that were was no liner, he knew something was up. He climbed off the trash and back up several times. One of the times he poked his nose down to sniff the paper towel and he went too far, and slipped in - to his DOOM!\n\nWe called city rat control, which said they would come get it. I didn't want to release it because it would just come back, or go into someone else house. This isn't a wild animal, this is a disease spreading pest! They never came, the rats panic eventually stopped, and for whatever reason Scarface died in the can by the end of the day.

The regular, old-fashioned, cheap little mousetrap, Andy says, will usually catch the mouse in 24 to 48 hours. It will kill it 88% of the time. Other traps that aren't much more expensive have 100% lethality. Mice are easy to kill because mice, unlike rats, are incredibly inquisitive animals.\n\n**Andy Woolworth** They investigate anything that's new. Anything that's in their normal territory for the evening, and that's typically-- most people don't know this but most mice only stay within 10 feet of where they are, max. And oftentimes it's less than that. And they may investigate that area 30 times during the night. They're not just going out once.\n\n**Ira Glass** Well in a way what you're describing is almost the ideal animal to be caught.\n\n**Andy Woolworth** Exactly.\n\nSource: http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/311/transcript", "gilded": 0, "score": 5, "created": 1420329095.0},{"body": "So how did you kill them?
