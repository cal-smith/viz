One new antibiotic is nice but only goes so far.... a system that can repeatedly produce new antibiotics in a turn-key fashion is MUCH more useful.\n\nThe OP's article doesn't really explain well how this was found and why it falls into that turn-key repeatable class of operations, but I can fill that in.  The key thing to note is the fact that one of the authors of the Teixobactin paper is Slava Epstein.  Slava Epstein is someday going to get a Nobel prize.  This is because of the fact that he has solved the culture problem... the fact that most organisms won't grow in a petri dish.  \n\nThe way he did this is pretty cool:  He realized that it wasn't that they COULDN'T grow in the lab, it's that they WOULDN'T grow.  Bacteria, like most organisms, take cues from their environment: for example a bear doesn't intrinsically know when winter is coming, rather he sees the leaves change, and the birds flying south and from this data (that predominantly originates from other organisms) knows when it's time to get ready to hibernate.  Likewise, bacteria collect information from their environment in the form of soluble molecules, mostly produced by other micro-organisms, to know when it's a good bet for crucial biological processes such as cell-division... if they don't get those signals, then they don't divide.  Since the other organisms providing those signals do not exist in the otherwise sterile petri-dishes in a laboratory... they won't divide there.  \n\nSo, what Slava Epstein's lab did was that they collected bacterial cells from the soil, suspended them in a lump of agarose (basically gelatin) called a \"plug\", and then surrounded that agarose plug with a semi-permeable membrane which would not let cells through, but would let small molecules through, and then put the whole thing back into the soil that the bacteria were first removed from.  Because the small molecules of the environment can enter this agarose plug, the cells suspended there know to divide.  When the agarose plug is later retrieved there are colonies of bacteria growing there.... but this is just the beginning.  Each of these colonies is composed of many cells that are all descended from a single bacteria that would grow in the soil environment but not the lab.  Slava Epstein's people then collected cells from such a colony, those cells were then placed into two new agarose plugs.  One of those new plugs was placed back into the soil, and one into an incubator in the lab.  Of course the cells in the soil plug grow since they are getting whatever signalling molecules they need from whatever else is in the soil.  But there's a chance that the incubator cells will grow too... the reason is that the more you grow the cells, the more you select for UNCONDITIONAL growth.  That is, as the cells divide, mutations will naturally occur and eventually a mutation will occur that causes the cell to stop looking for whatever signal(s) it normally needs in the environment in order to unlock growth.  Some times this is a easy mutation to arise, and sometimes it takes many dozens of rounds of harvesting colonies from soil-agarose-plugs... but it's just a matter of time eventually evolution will work and the selective pressures created by this system will force an unconditional growth phenotype.  The final result is a previously ungrowable bacteria that is now domesticated and growable in the lab.  Once you have that, you can test it for the production of useful products such as antibiotics.  Want to test more products?  No big deal, just repeat he above system with more organisms... since there's a near unlimited and unique diversity of micro organisms in every single cubic foot of dirt, you'll basically never run out.\n\nOf course, in the long run, synthetic biology techniques that allow us to bypass messing with growing the source organisms for such products and just skip ahead to the products themselves by sequencing DNA from single cells and then synthesizing the interesting parts of that DNA that encode for products (called \"biosynthetic clusters\") and then expressing them in already convenient laboratory or industrial microorganisms.   But the bacteria domestication approach is still important for several reasons:  It proves the underlying thesis that the reason we had \"run out\" of antibiotics wasn't that there aren't more, but merely because we were only looking in same very small space over and over again.  Also, many of these interesting gene products, like antibiotics, must be synthesized from metabolic intermediates that are not universally in all bacteria.  That makes the domestication approach faster to produce products of interest in the short term.  However, in the next 10-15 years look to see the synthetic biology world creating chassis organisms with interchangeable metabolisms to address this. \n\nedit: Thank you for all the Gold kind strangers of the internet!", "gilded": 4, "score": 1860, "created": 1420666594.0},{"body": "I was initially intimidated by the length of this and figured my eyes would cross as soon as I got past the first few lines but this was excellent.

Why is conditional growth a naturally selected trait over unconditional growth?", "gilded": 0, "score": 50, "created": 1420673369.0},{"body": "EXCELLENT QUESTION!\n\nThe answer is embedded into two facts:\n\n* Bacteria live hand-to-mouth:  Things happen fast on the molecular and cellular levels, and bacteria are constantly balanced on a knife's edge of reaction to any of thousands of environmental stresses that can have life-or-death consequences for them if they don't react (such as by turning on genes in the nick of time) or react poorly (such as turning on the wrong genes).  (Most bacterial genes are turned off until the instant they are needed).  Similarly, almost all of them literally can't store enough energy and material to replicate inside their own volumes all at one time... they have to start replication before they have enough to finish it.  This bring us to:\n\n* Cell division is a risk for a bacteria:  Resources have to be diverted into copying DNA (a non-trivial metabolic cost in its own right) those resources would otherwise have been maintaining the machinery of the cell: replacing ribosomes, lipids, and proteins as they naturally degrade etc.  If mid-division, a cell's resources get critically low, the cell division will stall.  If this stall state persists too long, the cell may not be able to recover.  Even if it succeeds in dividing, both daughter cells end up splitting the remaining resources of the mother cell between them. If that resource pool is too small, one or both may die.  Further, while a bacteria is dividing, it's ability to cope with environmental dangers is often compromised.  For example the activity of it's own replication machinery might make it more apt to be taken over by a virus (which in some cases co-opt some of that machinery), or the activity of the DNA polymerase crossing a gene might hamper the competing activity of the RNA polymerase to cross that same gene and thus interrupt the just-in-time production of the gene's product.\n\nThe result is that cells which grow unconditionally on average are taking unnecessary risks.  If the cell can wait for a signal that indicates conditions are now, and will likely continue to be favorable, for reproduction then that risk is at least partially mitigated.  This is why the vast majority of bacteria don't grow unconditionally.  It should be pointed out, however, that this limits the niche that the bacteria can persist in to one where that signal exists and is a better than random indication of when it is safe to replicate... since that limitation also has its downsides, there are also some bacteria that do grow unconditionally.", "gilded": 0, "score": 161, "created": 1420676351.0},{"body": "Brilliant, thank you.", "gilded": 0, "score": 17, "created": 1420681476.0},{"body": "I feel like you can write movies about bacteria.

Autoimmunity occurs because the immune system's targeting mechanisms are failing to distinguish self from non-self for whatever reason. This does not happen instantaneously - these cells have to be \"educated\" against the affected tissue (in the case of MS, myelin sheaths). This part of the immune system includes a positive feedback loop, which means that the effect will be aggravated until the stimulus is gone. This works for normal pathogens - after all, you want your immune system to go all out when dealing with a virus or infectious bacterial species. However, the stimulus in the case of autoimmunity is the body itself, which means that the body will continually destroy itself.\n\nBut as I mentioned earlier, these cells are educated (or \"indoctrinated\" if you wish for a superior analogy) to attack the body's own cells by positive feedback signaling. There are naive populations of hematopoetic cells in your bone marrow (and other locations, but bone marrow is the best studied), but they too quickly become indoctrinated by the matured cells attacking the body. Thus, the solution is fairly simple. The naive cells are extracted from the patient and stored for later. All indoctrinated immune cells are destroyed via chemotherapy. The stored naive cells are transplanted back into the patient, where they are no longer primed for destroying the body's cells by errant immune cells, since those are all dead. Thus the immune system is repopulated.\n\nThe advantage of this therapy is that because it is autologous (same source), there is no need to find a matching donor and there is no risk of graft vs. host disease (GvHD). However, any therapy that kills off the entire immune system, however briefly, leaves the patient vulnerable to opportunistic infection. Additionally, because the \"old guard\" is gone, the immune system's memory may very well be gone with it if the memory cells have been killed, meaning that all the vaccinations and prior infections the patient had before chemotherapy may be rendered useless and re-vaccinating may be less efficient due to age or the stress endured by the body.

A stem-cell transplant, and as far as I can tell from the article, it is the exact same procedure described here.\n\nThe process was very arduous due to chemo sickness, and since the patients were housed nearby each other we learned that several of the patients died as a result of complications from being immuno-suppressed (they got infections).

I'm a second year medical student who has some prior experience with some of this stuff. I'm by no means an expert, but I'd love to lay some things out there for anyone who is interested!\n\n**How/why Does This Work:**\nVery briefly, there is a portion of your immune system that is termed the \"adaptive immune system.\" It is called this because it responds (\"adapts\") to infectious invaders in a way unique to each invader. For example, certain types defenses would be better to develop and use against a strep throat infection (IgA antibodies for the curious) vs others that would be better to use against a leprosy infection (CD8 cell-mediated cytotoxicity for the curious).\nYour adaptive immune system is the part of the immune system that orchestrates a unique response to each different foreign invader your body encounters, and very importantly, **it remembers how it responded**. By remembering how it responded to a certain invader in the past, the adaptive immune system makes sure to keep that type of response in \"stockpile\" so that if your body ever encounters that same invader again, your body can fight back really strongly from the get go. **This is why you generally don't get infected with the same pathogen more than once,** with some exceptions of course. This is also how vaccinations prevent/lower the intensity of future infection.\n\n*Why does this matter for autoimmune diseases like MS?*\nThe theory is that in autoimmune diseases, your adaptive immune system, for whatever reason, has developed a specific weapon against one of your normal tissues in your own body. Your adaptive immune system \"thinks\" it has a constant infection on its hands, and is trying to eliminate it. So really, your adaptive immune system has made a huge mistake and the patient has to deal with a terrible disease.  \n\n*Why does your adaptive immune system develop an immune response against your own tissue in the first place?*\nThere are several theories for this, but suffice to say that **something at some point in time pushed your adaptive immune system into an error in which it targets your own tissues. Because the adaptive immune system always remembers what it has targetted in the past, from the point of the error onwards, it will always recognize the targetted tissue as an enemy to destroy**\n\n*The effect of chemo and bone marrow transplant (BMT)*\nBasically, chemo drugs are used to **destroy the entirety of your immune system. This means that all \"memory\" of past infections and \"stockpiles\" of weapons uniquely crafted for each invader are destroyed because the cells that functioned as this memory/stockpile are destroyed.** This means that any \"memory\" your adaptive immune system had about targeting your tissues as an enemy is also gone! **So, just like many of you have aptly said, this can be conceptualized as an analogy of restarting your computer when its acting funky.** Now, this obviously has its own host of risks and things. For example, any \"memory\" of vaccinations or past infections has also been erased, so you need to completely re-immunize these patients. Additionally, during the process of the chemoablation therapy and subsequent BMT, the physician has basically made the patient have a non-existent immune system, which is for obvious reasons a very risky thing to do. **However, as many of these autoimmune diseases are so debilitating, many patients consider the risks to be well worth the potential rewards.**\n\n**Others Using this Therapy to Great Success:**\nSimilar to Dr. Nash in this article, Dr. Burt at Northwestern University's Division of Immunotherapy for Autoimmune Diseases (DIAD) in Chicago has made some really exciting progress in this field, and has treated patients of many different autoimmune diseases with this therapy.\nSome of the diseases being treated with this research: **MS, Crohn's Disease, Scleroderma, Lupus (SLE), Diabetes Mellitus Type I.** Website for the interested:\nhttp://www.stemcell-immunotherapy.org/index.html\n\n**Patient Perspective Success Stories:**\nhttp://www.stemcell-immunotherapy.org/pub_vid_edwin.html\n\nHope this was at all helpful to anyone who is curious about this stuff. Sorry that I was not \"very brief\" as I Initially stated I would be.\n\n**Edit for readers with MS or with loved ones with MS:** Dr. Richard Burt of DIAD at Northwestern University is currently performing a large scale Randomized Control Trial with this sort of procedure as a treatment for MS. I think is about 70% complete and the team is looking for more patients.

The system is indeed set-up a lot like a concentration cell battery.  The interior and exterior of the axon have different concentrations of various ions - particularly sodium and potassium.  This gradient is maintained because the membrane is relatively impermeable to these ions.  The ions can only cross the membrane through special channel proteins.  \n\nNow, the way the axon works is that it has special channel proteins that are voltage gated, which means they only open at certain voltages between the inside and the outside of the cell membrane.  The concentrations of the ions involved, and the particular voltage-sensitivities of these channels leads to a very unique behavior.  When a section of an axon reaches a certain critical voltage threshold, it triggers the opening of channels that increase the voltage even further, and this triggers further voltage gated channels ultimately causing a very specific, stereotyped response called an action potential.  \n\nYou can read about the details on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential), but the overall effect is as follows.  Once the action potential is triggered at one portion of the axon, the cell membrane activity at that section brings the next section of the axon to threshold, triggering the action potential there.  The action potential travels down the axon.  It does not travel backwards as there is a certain refractory period during which a triggered region cannot be triggered again (although, yes, if you trigger an action potential in the middle of an axon you get pulses going in both directions).   \n\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 2, "created": 1420854223.0},{"body": "Do carbon nanotubes get rejected?", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1420825756.0},{"body": "Most likely.

Kalan, Roger Mundry, Christophe Boesch\n\nAbstract:\n&gt;The extent to which animal vocalizations are referential has long been debated since it reflects on the evolution of language. Our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, has been shown to have functionally referential food calls in captivity but evidence for such capabilities in the wild is lacking. We investigated the context specificity and function of West African chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes verus, food calls in the wild using all day focal follows of adult males and females of one habituated group in the Ta\u00ef forest, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. We collected over 750 h of observation and analysed 379 food calls produced for five different food species and found that higher pitched calls were produced for a single fruit species. Additionally, within this species, chimpanzees modified calls according to tree size, whereby smaller trees elicited higher pitched calls. Our results suggest that chimpanzees subtly vary the acoustic structure of food calls with respect to food patch size for a putatively highly valued fruit species, and we propose that arousal alone cannot sufficiently explain the patterns observed. Further work is needed to determine whether variation in food call pitch can influence receiver foraging behaviour. However, in light of our results, we propose that understanding the information content encoded by acoustic variation in chimpanzee food calls requires receiver knowledge about the natural ecological context, specifically spatial memory of tree locations. Therefore, this study highlights the potential significance of feeding ecology in the evolution of flexibly modulated vocal communication.\n\nFound [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004643)", "gilded": 0, "score": 4, "created": 1421804475.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 74, "created": 1421777099.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 261, "created": 1421782593.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 33, "created": 1421792483.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 20, "created": 1421793986.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 14, "created": 1421794205.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 23, "created": 1421783187.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 78, "created": 1421779796.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 129, "created": 1421784227.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 40, "created": 1421787469.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 12, "created": 1421784835.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 70, "created": 1421784963.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 37, "created": 1421789058.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 51, "created": 1421786428.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 16, "created": 1421785139.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 17, "created": 1421785395.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 17, "created": 1421786609.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 5, "created": 1421793623.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 8, "created": 1421786755.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 10, "created": 1421785503.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1421785411.0},{"body": "&gt;about their favorite fruits and the trees where they can be found.\n\nThis strikes me as something that even birds probably communicate to each other.", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1421796550.0},{"body": "The infants also 'cry wolf' in order to hide food, as food is shared, and the little ones get the least.", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1421813285.0},{"body": "Soon we may decipher the chimpanzee's language and learn to talk with our primate cousins.", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1421821951.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 19, "created": 1421787696.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 46, "created": 1421791947.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 12, "created": 1421793446.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 4, "created": 1421793880.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 4, "created": 1421785416.0},{"body": "I'm not sure why this would be surprising.

Basically, EM radiation (that is, any light: radio waves, infrared, visible light, UV, X-rays, gamma rays) is composed of two oscillating fields. One of the fields is electric and the other is magnetic (which is why we call it EM radiation), and both of the fields are perpendicular to each other, [like so](https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/RadiationSafety/Graphics/elec_mag_field.gif). \n\nNow, polarization is fairly easy to understand. It's simply the direction of the fields. \n\n\"Normal\" light has the fields oriented at random angles. Imagine if you chucked 100 matches on the floor, and looked at which direction they were pointing in. Now, instead of matches, you can imagine that each match corresponds to either the magnetic or electric field of a single photon. You would see a similar sort of pattern if you measured the direction of polarization of unpolarized light. \n\nWith polarized light, the fields all behave in the same way. Linearly polarized light all points in the same direction. So, that's like looking at a bunch of matches that are all pointing North, say. \n\nCircularly polarized light is a bit different. In this case we'd have a bunch of matches all spinning either clockwise or counter-clockwise. \n\nYou can filter light by polarization too. This would be like dropping a bunch of matches on a barbecue grill like [this](http://static1.globein.org/sites/default/files/news-blogs-field-image/9-ethnic-grilling-recipes-you-wont-want-miss.jpg). Only matches that happen to be pointing in the same direction as the grill can pass through. If you were looking at light that was polarized in the perpendicular direction to your grill, no light would get through. If you turn the grill 90^^(o), all of the light would be able to pass through. \n\nWhen light reflects off something, it often becomes partially polarized. This is why we have polarized sunglasses. Light that reflects off a flat road tends to become polarized in a direction perpendicular to the road, so by choosing sunglasses which are polarized at 90^^o to this direction, we can reduce the glare from the road significantly. Next time you're out in the sun wearing polarized glasses, try turning your head 90^^o to the side, and try to see the difference in the brightness of the reflected light. Or alternatively you can do try the same thing with a computer screen, which also output polarized light. \n\n----\n\nProbably made a few mistakes here - I didn't bother to check through for any errors and it's been a while since I did anything to do with polarization, so I might have forgotten some things.

There's a concept known as the Pauli exclusion principle. If we are talking about a chemical \"bond\" in the literal sense, then it has to consist of an electron moving into a hybrid molecular orbital between the two nuclei, and the Mu electron cannot go into an orbital that is already filled with two electrons. This means it has to go into an antibonding orbital, which is typically higher in energy than the component atomic orbitals that make up a molecular orbital. (This is why antibonds don't usually form.)\n\nI can't imagine what is going on here, or why the Mu is only lower in energy if it is pinging between two Br atoms. I'm no longer in grad school, so I don't have journal access to Angewande Chemische, but I'd be interested in reading about this in more detail. \n\nEdit: I found a preview of the article, and the authors are making an isotope effect argument. With covalent bonds, we see the opposite kinetic effect, namely that heavier isotopes are more strongly bound, because they have a lower zero point energy in the energy well. With these vibrational \"bonds,\" it's as if they are claiming some sort of resonance stabilization from spreading the electron density. I really wish I could see the actual molecular orbital diagram proposed, though. This would click a lot better for me.\n\nEdit 2: Ok, I've read the entire article (thank you to a kind stranger!), and it seems that the key to what makes this sort of interaction special is found in the following diagram: http://imgur.com/7ufwdla\n\nNotice the blue dashed lines curving downward in every case? These are the total final energy states of the systems as they move from reactants to products. The bond would not form if any of these curved upward. However, what makes the fourth one special, the case with Mu, is that the actual potential energy wells of the products (red curves) is higher than that of the reactants. The reason that this type of bond forms is because the product species themselves *sit lower within their respective potential energy wells.* We both want to get down to where the water is, so you dig a 30 foot well, but only climb down halfway, while I dig a 20 foot well and go all the way to the bottom. I will find the water, if that analogy makes sense. In the simplest possible terms, the bond forms with Mu because the grey area in the middle shrinks even more than the red line increases, allowing the blue line to still drop lower at the right end. It's not a covalent bond because the electron isn't in a molecular orbital. It's not a mere van der Waals interaction (called \"bonds\" here, though I've never called it that before) because it isn't merely due to electrostatic stabilization. It's a quirk of particle physics temporarily preventing three species from physically dissociating, so yes, it seems to me that it is fair to call this \"a new type of chemical bond.\"\n\nEdit 3: A digitally named friend has uploaded the entire article for our benefit, in case anyone wants to give a different/better interpretation: http://imgur.com/a/1VVa0\n\nBeware that the pages are out of order.
