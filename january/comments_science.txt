Your submission has been removed as it does not include references to new, peer-reviewed research. Please feel free to post it in our sister subreddit /r/EverythingScience. It may. It also may not. Probably those who don't tie themselves too closely with either ideology. Which has better antibacterial properties for topical use, green tea extract, or honey? Dinosaurs destroy man. Dinosaurs create God. If you look carefull, you will see that all planets (expect gas giants) got those 2 hemispheres, even earth and "moon".
so they want to tell me that they all had a big Crash? Made in China is written on it somewhere.
Mark my words Actually using Green Tea Extract or just green tea scented? And if it does use extract, I wonder if the concentration is high enough to be effective. I dont know what it is but the research articles whch get posted on reddit seem a bit odd sometimes What is your opinion on how further understanding of proton decay can revolutionize understanding of Dark Matter? didnt know younger women wanted to fuck old people Do you any actual objections to the study or how it was carried out? And I really don't see what "the Swedish" have to do with anything? Makes sense, Male Genital Mutilation is traumatic.  Thanks, I want to kiss you on your face. Every scientific model is an approximation to reality.  The question is if the model is accurate enough to be useful.  For example, aerospace companies use computer models of airflow to design planes, and weather forecasters use computer models to make 5-day forecasts.

As computers have gotten more powerful, the climate models can get more detailed, and include more factors.  Also, research over time identifies these factors, how important they are, and the physics of how to model them.  We can't predict the exact shape of every iceberg that calves into the ocean, but we can estimate their total size from how fast the glaciers are flowing.  In that sense, models will always be incomplete, but they can be good enough.

Long term climate models are good enough to predict the temperature will rise, but there is a couple of degrees uncertainty how much they will rise by 2100.  And they can't predict what humans will do over the next 85 years.  If we go all renewable and stop burning fossils, the projected rise may slow down or stop. Thanks for the answer. I have been searching. I know we humans do harm to the earth but idk it just seems the earth has been going through phases and that we are only speeding up the processs.

That might be why the earth is so old and we humans are just a spec of dust. We continue to destroy it, it has to go into survival mode and the Earth destroys all human life and we have to reset and evolve all over again. What could go wrong? Sorry, your browser is not supported. I'm on latest android.  Can you provide a source for the survey? I'm interested.


I have a theory that sexual activity is not evenly distributed within a sexe and differs between the two sexes. I believe:

* sexual activity is more evenly distributed for women than for men
* a small fraction of men are far more sexually active then other men. 

It seems to make sense: women tend to be more demanding when accepting a partner, resulting in attractive men being able to get the largest share of women and activity.

Less attractive men will have trouble "getting some" and will as a result be less active *and* less picky..


Another explanation for the difference could be that more men have more homosexual encounters, regardless of their "preferred" sexe (sites and apps exist where men date and have secret appointments, or men go cruising parkings for just an encounter.). The rest of us do it with follicles I like this guy. Which studies? Wow! I grow hair too, does that make me a scientist? Useless study -.- Quote: "Dark Matter (DM) is an elusive form of matter which has been postulated to explain astronomical observations through its gravitational effects on stars and galaxies, gravitational lensing of light around these, and through its imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). "

this is actually wrong, (or at least bad told) Dark Matter has been invented to make the Mathematics fit the Observation-facts, they just needed a variable to make they Math fit with the Observations, so they made a new variable: Dark Matter, also then they growed those variable up so that at the end it Comes out that those Dark Matter is 98% of mass in universe so that theyr Formular finaly fits.
At the end this is not a proof for the existence of dark matter, just because they Need it to get a realistic result for theyr math.

 It is genital mutilation. What else would you call it? There is no reason to cut it off. The foreskin is the most sensitive part of the penis. Males lose sensitivity also because of the constant friction on the head of the penis without the protecting foreskin. It contributes to Erectile dysfunction in young men who experience it. The one benefit it does have is mothers like the look of a circumcised penis, so they feel like they're doing something good for their sons. Arugula. It must be all of the arugula. But its a walk in the park for females I didn't read anything about diet in the article.  I would guess that more conservatives eat what may be considered a traditional and somewhat unhealthy diet than liberals, most of whom seem to be interested in what the latest healthy food to eat is.  If you control for race I am guessing that this pattern is even more pronounced, as predominantly liberal impoverished minorities in the inner cities tend to have less access to healthy food choices. Good. Do we know anything about dark matter or dark energy? Besides their proposed existence to explain galactic star rotation. (Forgive my silly question, I am a layman) Well no shit. They can't just use the word dragon when it didn't have wings nor is it likely that it breathed fire. Its like they thought "How can we get people to pay attention to this?". Oh just add the word dragon, people like dragons! That's a lifestyle thing!! Friend and I were talking on the expansion of the universe just the other day.  He mentioned a thought,  so I'll ask. 

If we know that everything is expanding from a single point,  can't we track which direction things are moving.  And use that data (in reverse?) To find the direction of the single point it originated? 

The balloon analogy is common used to explain the expansion.  Not sure if that throws a gear in the thought.

Thanks!  Or as conservative blogs would put it:
**"CONFIRMED!!** OBAMACARE DEATH PANELS EXECUTING CHRISTIANS!"** Researchers at GIT re-discover the "lost" 1985 works of Wim van Eck?

Are the clocks running 30 years slow down in Dixie? What do they taste like?
