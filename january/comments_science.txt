How does the method that they grew the microbes with differ from the [other](http://schaechter.asmblog.org/schaechter/2014/12/the-great-plate-count-anomaly-that-is-no-more.html) article that was posted recently about changing the culture medium from Agar to another material? 

In the other article they changed the growth medium and found they could grow a much wider range of microbes. Is this completely different or related? From the paper:

&gt;Isolation and cultivation of producing strains
A sample of 1 g of soil sample collected from a grassy field in Maine was agitated vigorously in 10 ml of deionized H2O for 10 min. After letting the soil particulates settle for 10 min, the supernatant was diluted in molten SMS media (0.125 g casein, 0.1 g potato starch, 1 g casamino acids, 20 g bacto-agar in 1 litre of water) to achieve an average concentration of one cell per 20 l of medium. Then 20 l aliquots were then dispensed into the wells of an iChip. The iChip was placed in direct contact with the soil. After one month of incubation, the iChips were disassembled and individual colonies were streaked onto SMS agar to test for the ability to propagate outside the iChip and for colony purification.

They basically attempt to isolate single cells and let them form a small colony in their native soil, and then transfer those colonies to agar plates to try to establish more robust colonies. They still ultimately grow them on agar. You are missing what is truly novel about their technique (I think, my appologies if not). The iChip was placed in direct contact with soil and any nutrients or growth factors in the soil could permeate through a filter and "feed" the bacteria within the agar. 

The problem with using agar plates / petri dishes has nothing to do with the agar itself or the way it grows, but the carbon sources (food) and the growth factors (sort of like vitamins) that are added to the growth media not being able to support bacterial growth.

Sure they are still using agar as a medium for colonies to grow on, but they are putting these iChips back into their native environment so that the bacteria can grow using whatever nutrients are available there. The iChip serves as a barrier so that a single cell can grow within the well and form a homogeneous colony, and not be contaminated by any other bacteria.

Edit: The other cool, but maybe not novel, thing about the iChip is how they grow colonies from single cells so that you have homogeneous populations to study. The iChip has many very tiny wells within it that are isolated from each other. When they innoculate the chip, they dilute their sample containing bacteria out enough to that by chance each well will receive only one single bacteria. Some wells will have 2 and some will have none by random chance, but the majority will have one single cell. That single cell will then hopefully grow into a larger colony of the same bacteria. It's very difficult to do experiments on a single cell of bacteria, but when you have many cells in a colony you can really start working with it. Like discovering a novel compound that the bacteria produces.

Edit 2: Wow, thanks for the gold, cheers!! Great write-up. I didn't miss any of that, I only intended to give a quick response to the guy's question about the growth medium. This is great information though because you are right, this is the interesting part of their new isolation technique. Ahhh yes, it's clear you and others picked up on that after re-reading through the thread. Hope I wasn't condescening, I just wanted to restate what is truly novel about their technique.

I interviewed with one of Lewis's colleagues at Northeastern about 10 years ago and they showed me a crude beta version of this device. This version people would wear in their mouths in a retainer like device to grow unculturable mouth bacteria. Their whole group are powerhouses in Boston and are involved in everything. Every job I've had collaborates with him. I am so glad to see it paying off. I left academia for industry and I love it, but we need academia because they have the ability to try these really high risk / high payoff experiments that a company that has to report to investors just wont do. Keep funding science!! I read stuff like this and (almost) question my plan to go back for an MBA instead of a biochem Master's.

But I'm probably still better suited for a support role. Keep on inventing the future and I'll try to fund it!

 God knows research could use more funding. Interested in politics while you're at it? That's brilliant! Yeah, I can see how this could lead to a whole bunch of new antibiotics. Could you explain a little more, for those of us who don't?  The idea is that nature may have already designed a lot more antibiotics than we known about, but when you take some dirt and try to grow microorganisms from it using standard culture techniques, it may be insufficient to isolate the organisms that are making the antibiotics we are interested in.

Sometimes things grow better in culture when they are surrounded by other organisms, so isolating organisms and allowing them to grow in their natural environment first might create a critical mass that is able to survive in culture and be studied.  Oversimplifying a ton:

Lots of bacteria have trouble growing in standard lab environment. So in this case they figured out a way to gradually move bacteria from soil to lab environment with them still growing fine. Having bacteria grow fine in lab environment is pretty great if you are trying to study them.

Hope I didn't mess up something. Sounds about right. Consider also that we're merely looking to discover an antibiotic, not farm it from bacteria. Screen bacteria, analyze antibiotic, let chemists synthesize the compound. We're good at that! Well, not as good as nature, but... Nature is terrific at coming up with compounds that have antibiotic effects, and making tiny amounts of it that suffice on the scale of a cell.

We excel at taking that blueprint and making a couple tons of that compound at a time. sort of. Nature takes a long time useful but that process is more exhaustive than anything we could ever try.
Nature brute forces science.  Life... uhhhh..... finds a way. http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/41850/title/New-Antibiotic-from-Soil-Bacteria/

&gt;Teixobactin was isolated from a previously unknown Gram-negative bacterium that lives in soil and cannot be cultured in the lab using standard techniques. So the researchers applied an approach called Ichip, developed jointly by Lewis and Slava Epsteins lab, in which a soil sample is diluted with agar, and a single bacterial cell is suspended in a chamber surrounded with semi-permeable membrane. The researchers pack 96 such chambers into a single device, which they then place in soilallowing the bacteria access to nutrients and growth factors but not to escape. This cultivation approach is an innovative way to tap into the rich biodiversity that we are currently missing because only 1 percent of microorganisms can be cultured in the lab, said Wright.  This biodiversity is also hiding a lot of chemical diversity that may include other new antibiotics. 

&gt;This is a very clever technique, added Robert Austin, a physicist at Princeton University who studies the evolution of microbes and was not involved in the current study. The bacteriology community needs to get away from culturing bacteria on agar plates, because this will not lead to new antibiotics. Could someone explain why we are not able to grow these specimens in a lab?  I took a course in microbiology and I was unaware of this.  I am under the assumption that if a medium has the nutrient the microbe is looking for, it will grow.  What makes soil so unique that it cannot be replicated in a lab?

Edit: Thank you for the replies they were all very informative. The thing is we don't always know what nutrients an organism is looking for or in what quantity. Having TOO MUCH of something can actually inhibit growth of some bacteria, having the wrong salinity can inhibit growth, having the wrong pH can inhibit growth. Some bacteria may require small amounts of certain trace metals that wouldn't normally be found in tap water everywhere or in the media components. We also don't necessarily know it's preferred temperature for growth or how aerotolerant the organism is. Usually these scientist who go out trying to find bacteria will attempt o grow things in various sets of media that have are know to grow organisms found in whatever ecological niche they collected the sample from - and it's pretty likely a lot of work went into coming up with those mediums, messing around with compositions trying to isolate new bacteria can be tricky and often fruitless.  We've traditionally been pretty naive about how we grow microorganisms.  An air-exposed, flat, low surface area environment on top of an inert gel is a very non-natural environment.

In a mL of soil, there are going to be literally dozens, if not hundreds of microbiomes with varying levels of pH, oxygen, ion concentrations, porosity, etc.

The environment in a few cubic microns of soil might be an alien growth environment compared to one a few microns away.  It's like dropping a rabbit in the middle of the ocean or a tank full of nitrogen and wondering why it doesn't form a colony.

Also, it's becoming increasingly clear that many microbes are dependent on mutualistic interactions with other species.  If multiple independent species are sufficiently dependent on each other it may not even be possible to grow some of them in any reasonable pure culture.   "like dropping a rabbit in the middle of the ocean or a tank full of nitrogen and wondering why it doesn't form a colony" - a vivid image! So your saying there eco-systems are as complex as a rabbit's? 
 From their perspective, yes.  If you're two cubic microns, a sand grain might as well be a city. Growing bacteria ranges from very simple to very complex. There are many factors which are required for microbes to grow that we do not understand. As an example some bacteria may only grow in a symbiotic relationship with another organism or multiple organisms (biofilm) so growing them in pure culture and replicating its environment is next to impossible at this point.

We also don't understand why they don't grow well in labs as a negative result (culture dying) could be a result of many different things.  Trial and error with educated guesses are pretty much the best we can do at the this point and it is very time consuming.  

We also can't observe them like we do with macro life as they are so tiny. Not the best example but,  imagine trying to figure out from outer space what a panda needs to survive on earth.  Even now we are struggling to keep them from going extinct. Time for someone smart to tell us why this isn't as big of news as it sounds... Here's the paper: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14098.html

The important thing about this is the way the new antibiotic, Teixobactin, was found... One new antibiotic is nice but only goes so far.... a system that can repeatedly produce new antibiotics in a turn-key fashion is MUCH more useful.

The OP's article doesn't really explain well how this was found and why it falls into that turn-key repeatable class of operations, but I can fill that in.  The key thing to note is the fact that one of the authors of the Teixobactin paper is Slava Epstein.  Slava Epstein is someday going to get a Nobel prize.  This is because of the fact that he has solved the culture problem... the fact that most organisms won't grow in a petri dish.  

The way he did this is pretty cool:  He realized that it wasn't that they COULDN'T grow in the lab, it's that they WOULDN'T grow.  Bacteria, like most organisms, take cues from their environment: for example a bear doesn't intrinsically know when winter is coming, rather he sees the leaves change, and the birds flying south and from this data (that predominantly originates from other organisms) knows when it's time to get ready to hibernate.  Likewise, bacteria collect information from their environment in the form of soluble molecules, mostly produced by other micro-organisms, to know when it's a good bet for crucial biological processes such as cell-division... if they don't get those signals, then they don't divide.  Since the other organisms providing those signals do not exist in the otherwise sterile petri-dishes in a laboratory... they won't divide there.  

So, what Slava Epstein's lab did was that they collected bacterial cells from the soil, suspended them in a lump of agarose (basically gelatin) called a "plug", and then surrounded that agarose plug with a semi-permeable membrane which would not let cells through, but would let small molecules through, and then put the whole thing back into the soil that the bacteria were first removed from.  Because the small molecules of the environment can enter this agarose plug, the cells suspended there know to divide.  When the agarose plug is later retrieved there are colonies of bacteria growing there.... but this is just the beginning.  Each of these colonies is composed of many cells that are all descended from a single bacteria that would grow in the soil environment but not the lab.  Slava Epstein's people then collected cells from such a colony, those cells were then placed into two new agarose plugs.  One of those new plugs was placed back into the soil, and one into an incubator in the lab.  Of course the cells in the soil plug grow since they are getting whatever signalling molecules they need from whatever else is in the soil.  But there's a chance that the incubator cells will grow too... the reason is that the more you grow the cells, the more you select for UNCONDITIONAL growth.  That is, as the cells divide, mutations will naturally occur and eventually a mutation will occur that causes the cell to stop looking for whatever signal(s) it normally needs in the environment in order to unlock growth.  Some times this is a easy mutation to arise, and sometimes it takes many dozens of rounds of harvesting colonies from soil-agarose-plugs... but it's just a matter of time eventually evolution will work and the selective pressures created by this system will force an unconditional growth phenotype.  The final result is a previously ungrowable bacteria that is now domesticated and growable in the lab.  Once you have that, you can test it for the production of useful products such as antibiotics.  Want to test more products?  No big deal, just repeat he above system with more organisms... since there's a near unlimited and unique diversity of micro organisms in every single cubic foot of dirt, you'll basically never run out.

Of course, in the long run, synthetic biology techniques that allow us to bypass messing with growing the source organisms for such products and just skip ahead to the products themselves by sequencing DNA from single cells and then synthesizing the interesting parts of that DNA that encode for products (called "biosynthetic clusters") and then expressing them in already convenient laboratory or industrial microorganisms.   But the bacteria domestication approach is still important for several reasons:  It proves the underlying thesis that the reason we had "run out" of antibiotics wasn't that there aren't more, but merely because we were only looking in same very small space over and over again.  Also, many of these interesting gene products, like antibiotics, must be synthesized from metabolic intermediates that are not universally in all bacteria.  That makes the domestication approach faster to produce products of interest in the short term.  However, in the next 10-15 years look to see the synthetic biology world creating chassis organisms with interchangeable metabolisms to address this. 

edit: Thank you for all the Gold kind strangers of the internet! I was initially intimidated by the length of this and figured my eyes would cross as soon as I got past the first few lines but this was excellent. Superb way to break it all down. 

Do yourself a favor people and don't tl;dr this.  Why thank you, that's very kind of you to say. Seriously, really easy to understand. Science needs more people who can do what you just did. I got half way through before I tl;dr'd it, saw this post, and then went back and read the rest. Did not regret it. Great explanation. I have one question; why doesn't the unconditional growth mutation occur naturally and override the conditional growth genes? Why is conditional growth a naturally selected trait over unconditional growth? EXCELLENT QUESTION!

The answer is embedded into two facts:

* Bacteria live hand-to-mouth:  Things happen fast on the molecular and cellular levels, and bacteria are constantly balanced on a knife's edge of reaction to any of thousands of environmental stresses that can have life-or-death consequences for them if they don't react (such as by turning on genes in the nick of time) or react poorly (such as turning on the wrong genes).  (Most bacterial genes are turned off until the instant they are needed).  Similarly, almost all of them literally can't store enough energy and material to replicate inside their own volumes all at one time... they have to start replication before they have enough to finish it.  This bring us to:

* Cell division is a risk for a bacteria:  Resources have to be diverted into copying DNA (a non-trivial metabolic cost in its own right) those resources would otherwise have been maintaining the machinery of the cell: replacing ribosomes, lipids, and proteins as they naturally degrade etc.  If mid-division, a cell's resources get critically low, the cell division will stall.  If this stall state persists too long, the cell may not be able to recover.  Even if it succeeds in dividing, both daughter cells end up splitting the remaining resources of the mother cell between them. If that resource pool is too small, one or both may die.  Further, while a bacteria is dividing, it's ability to cope with environmental dangers is often compromised.  For example the activity of it's own replication machinery might make it more apt to be taken over by a virus (which in some cases co-opt some of that machinery), or the activity of the DNA polymerase crossing a gene might hamper the competing activity of the RNA polymerase to cross that same gene and thus interrupt the just-in-time production of the gene's product.

The result is that cells which grow unconditionally on average are taking unnecessary risks.  If the cell can wait for a signal that indicates conditions are now, and will likely continue to be favorable, for reproduction then that risk is at least partially mitigated.  This is why the vast majority of bacteria don't grow unconditionally.  It should be pointed out, however, that this limits the niche that the bacteria can persist in to one where that signal exists and is a better than random indication of when it is safe to replicate... since that limitation also has its downsides, there are also some bacteria that do grow unconditionally. Brilliant, thank you. I feel like you can write movies about bacteria.  And then the Clostridium said: "No, Bacillus, I branch off of the phylogenetic tree closer to the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) than you... that means I AM YOUR FATHER!"  

Sorry, I couldn't help myself.  But thank you. Maybe you should write the general story but leave the dialogue to others ;)

But you have done a great service with your post. Thanks a ton for making this digestible! Beautiful and elegant explanation. Thank you! Thanks for this, it makes it really easy to understand! "Chassis organisms" is a cute turn of phrase.

No offense, but I have to wonder if your prediction of synthetic biology ultimately overshadowing all of this work is somewhat influenced by your bias as a researcher in that field, though. I'll admit I do look through the synthetic biology lens. :-) I hope you know what a tremendous service you're providing by taking the time to write out and explain things like this. It's one of the things I love most about the Internet and more specifically about reddit--the incidental experts who emerge out of the woodwork when some esoteric matter is being discussed  This may be a long stretch, but is this method also viable to fix the problems that caused the Biosphere experiment to fail? The problem that caused the biosphere experiment to fail was ultimately that it was too big and complex:  Carbon rich soil + soil-bacterial oxidative respiration caused oxygen from the internal atmosphere to be tied up into CO2 which in turn got segregated into CaCO3 inside the concrete foundation and walls.  Once pollinators dies off other species became endangered.... Multiple independent climate zones, thousands of species... It was orders of magnitude too complex.  I'm amazed it worked as well as it did.

It all comes down to the fact that they designed their experiment from an ideologically driven top-down holistic approach rather than a bottom-up engineering approach.  (That is they were motivated by wanting to make certain environmentalist points about the importance of species diversity, multiple ecosystems working together, etc... this ultimately political desire caused good experimental design to take a back stage).  

If you wanted to do the Biosphere project right, then you would start with as simple a system as you could get to work, and then move upward in complexity:  For example: Just 3 species: Human, an Anaerobic bacteria, and an algae.Start by managing their growth and metabolisms artificially, and only allow for natural homeostasis to take over as you understand the dynamics of the system.  It's less dramatic, less flashy, less political... but better design.

But to answer your question, yes eventually you might want to use the Slava Epstein method to create carefully defined microbiological communities, including for applications in paraterraforming such as Biosphere2.

edit... removed typos. [deleted] I'm sorry about the bear info being wrong.  That is admitedly not my field.  Please do tell me how bears know about the coming change of the seasons.

You are however splitting hairs about "colony formation" rather than "unconditional growth".  Any macrocolony represents continuous growth in order to get to that point.  The mixed culture microcolonies represent conditional growth: that is they are growing insofar as they are providing one another with growth signals.  Eventually, as the cycle of collecting colonies in the Epstein procedure proceeds, one can transition to macrocolonies that are not associated with other organisms. Such a great post. Thank you. You are the 1% (probably .001%) of reddit. Gold when I get home. [deleted] Exactly what I got; this single antibiotic that was discovered won't cure everything, but it's more the *method* that is the breakthrough because now we know it can be used to discover huge amounts of new things that could be used as antibiotics  [deleted] So I'm ok to be excited about this is what I'm reading.  Exactly!  As someone with only BIO-101 level knowledge, I feel like I need the biologists of reddit to grant me permission to be enthused. Every time I see a headline and get giddy first comment is a shotgun to my balloon.  This is a nice change.  I didn't even bother reading the article, but have come straight to the comments.  

I'm now pretty excited, and have no idea why other than this is good, the methodology is good, and good things may come from this in the future. And now we'll leave, knowing progress is occurring! Good work everyone! Yay for progress! [deleted] Same, I love finding out things I didn't know that I didn't know about.  [deleted] [deleted] Microbiologist here! (I had to say it, probably the only time i'll get too!)

The method is definitely one of the most important points about this. The biggest concern with antibiotics right now is how quickly bacteria gain the ability to resist the new ones, while it becomes harder and harder to synthesize new ones to fight the now resistant bacteria. New methods of finding antibiotics will help in how quickly we can develop new drugs. 

That's not to say that Teixobactin won't be really helpful, it definitely will. Especially if it proves to be as effective as the article seems to hope it is against the more 'dangerous' bacteria that it mentions. Those are bacteria that are already difficult to deal with, so a new weapon against them now could buy patients suffering currently some relief and overall buy researchers more time to finding a more permanent solution.  most of the time in these kind of studies its really the new technique that raises the bar, not what they found out. I'm stunned Reddit actually agrees this is big news.  Virtually every other health discovery is debunked instantaneously on Reddit.   Because most health news is bogus. This isn't. Simple Or rather major breakthroughs tend to happen more gradually over time, and news articles tend to sensationalize things to be bigger than they are (I mean if we ever cure cancer, it most likely won't happen over night, we'll just get better and better at treating it over years).

From what I can with this though, it's a rare big breakthrough If this is as important as it looks, would the developemt team be in contention for a Nobel prize? 

Edit: typo While potentially super helpful, I don't think it is quite the fundamental change necessary to warrant a nobel prize..but hell, maybe a hundred new antibiotics are found and many diseases are wiped out, then yeah, sure. Right now, I think we would be happy if just one new class proved useful. Honestly, if this method can be reproduced by others, it's Nobel-worthy. Or at least worthy of a nomination. We haven't found a new way to discover antibiotics in 30 years, and antibiotic resistance is becoming a huge problem. This method (not the drug) could alleviate a huge portion of that problem.  The antibiotic is naturally produced by microbes in the soil.  It's not unreasonably to believe there is a plasmid, transposon, or some other mobile genetic elements that confer resistance to this antibiotic already floating in natural microbial communities.  Perhaps even the organism that is producing this antibiotic is producing the antitoxin for this compound.

As for now, this is great news as this is a new antibiotic for pathogens that affect us but life will always find a way. I just read (part) of the paper, and it seems that it won't follow the typical "producer hypothesis", where the producer of the antibiotic also requires to produce something to make it immune to the antibiotic, which can become mobilized.
The producer is a Gram-negative microbe and exports the molecule across the outer membrane, which Gram-positive microbes lack.  The drug is active against precursors of the cell wall, which the Gram-negative microbes do not have exposed.

Figure 3.e) http://www.nature.com/articles/nature14098.epdf Excellent, this will be great in the line of defense against MRSA and other pesky G+ pathogens that are communally acquired in hospital settings.

Daptomycin (or cubicin) is one of the last line of defense against MRSA now and some pathogens have already acquired resistance/tolerance to it.  Daptomycin also disrupts the cell membrane function so with this antibiotic, we'll have multiple choices to fight off some of these multidrug resistant pathogens. Layman here. Since this is a novel antibiotic that will presumably be patented and released via a single outlet, would it be possible to coordinate some sort of strict treatment guidelines for the drug to help lengthen its effective lifespan? 

E.G. "You can use this drug on humans only, in combination with other drugs only, as a last line of defense only, and only when the full course of prescription is used?" 

I would imagine most of those are going to be the intended use, but it seems that some kind of strong enforcement of these guidelines would ensure humanity receive the most benefit from what seems to be an extremely valuable discovery. Thank you!

I was wondering what conferred the antibiotic-producing organism resistance when (to paraphrase) "no bacteria will readily evolve resistance to this new molecule without serious evolution away from the current cell wall structure" that the articles are saying.

I guess I didn't put 2 and 2 together, because I know this information. That still doesn't rule out natural resistance out there.  

Both penicillin and lysozyme  have similar targets to this molecule and are produced by eukaryotic organisms that are innately immune to their effects.  In spite of that, bacteria have widespread defenses against these molecules in the form of beta-lactamase and various [lysozyme defenses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21146533).
 Which is good because antibiotic resistant bacteria is scary as shit.  Curious if any of these anti-bacterial benefits would make their way into or onto food grown in said soils and into the humans that eat the food. And if there are benefits to be had that way, I'm curious whether or not these benefits would be different from conventional to organic agriculture.

If a bacteria has the properties to kill C. dificil it may prove out to be beneficial bacteria.... eg. there might be an easier way to get the benefit from the bacteria - by eating them. 

Theories? [deleted] Well, it's the 1st new antibiotic in 30 years! Other than cefpiramide, imipenem, ofloxacin, mupirocin, aztreonam, cefoperazone, co-ticlarclav, ampicillin, cefixime, roxithromycin, sultamicillin, ciprofloaxin, rifaximin, azithromycin, flomoxef, isepamycin, midecamycin, rifapentine, teicoplanin, cefpodoxime, enrofloxacin, lomefloxacin, moxifloxacin, arbekacin, cefozidime, clarithromycin, cefdinir, cefatamet, cefpirome, cefprozil, ceftibuten, fleroxacin, loracarbef, piperacillin, rufloxacin, brodimoprim, dirithromycin, levofloxacin, nadifloxacin, panipenemn, sparfloxacin, quinupristin, dalopristin, linezolid, telithromycin, daptomycin, tigecycline, doripenem, telavancin, ceftaroline, fidaxomicin, bedaquiline, televancin, tedizolid, and dalbavancin...

Some of those are pretty derivative of each other but quite a few new classes in there too... You are right in that there have been a ton of derivative compounds made to combat resistance in the last 30 years, but in the last 20 there have only been 2 new drug classes that have actually been generated-daptomycin and linezolid.  Linezolid has a new structure but a tried and true mechanism of inhibition of protein synthesis-which we know resistance to can evolve significantly.  


Daptomycin is a much more novel mechanism of action and has seen less resistance, although some has been noted.  So that is a new drug class with a pretty neat mechanism.


Teixobactin appears to be a Lipid II modification antagonist with no protein binding affinity.  It has a novel chemical architecture and a mechanism of action that is more difficult to grow resistance to (likely) than a proteib-based target.  Vancomycin is similar in many ways, and has taken 30 years before resistance really mounted against it so.  These lipid precursors to cell wall components are potentially exciting targets because unlike bacterial proteins, they can not be easily modified to develop resistance by a single or a few point mutations.  Likely, they would require modification of the metabolic pathways involved in the construction of the lipids and the cell wall-which requires more lucky jumps in evolution than modifications to a single enzyme.  So I at least think this drug class is kind of neat.


That being said, the impact of this paper likely won't be the teixobactin, it will likely instead be the ability to screen secondary metabolites from non-culturable bacterial to screen for drug potential in a meaningful way.  As it stands, this particular technology will have finite abilities in high-throughput screening, but now that it is published there will large modifications to the general protocol to improve the types of activities selected for as well as the microbe-samples tested.

I'm not trying to be argumentative, just offer a different point of view (I know that your anti-propoganda point was by requesti!).  =)
 Oh absolutely, I'm sorry to downplay the results, they're very interesting. Thanks for your insight on it. I just thought the headline was a little overstating, but you're right on all counts. It is the first new class of antibiotic since 1987 according to the article. Yes, it is mentioned that offhandedly.  The title is more sensational and actually inaccurate. It's only effective against Gram-positive bacteria which isn't the world's most pressing anti-biotic resistance problem at the moment. However, if it's approved, cheap, and efficient, then it could help reduce the morbidity and prognosis of one of the most serious hospital acquired infections in c. difficile. I hope it can help with cdiff, but it's a tough little bastard to get rid of. It's spore-forming and produces two different nasty toxins. For cdiff specifically, the best possible future treatment may be fecal transplantation, which seems to work pretty well Fun fact! I believe C Difficile was so called because it was so hard to culture in the lab. I grew it in a lab this summer! We used specifically designed dishes and an anaerobic chamber. I can imagine how insanely hard it was for the first scientists who tried. As some one who has dealt with recurring c. diff infections, I really hope this will help. While studies show that fecal transplantation is effective, it's not well regulated yet and is usually used as a last resort type thing. I'd take one if they offered it though.  This is Reddit. If you actually want someone else's poop inside of you, just ask. You'll have a dozen PMs inside of five minutes. I believe the most effective method of clearing C.diff is to stop anti-biotic treatment, it tends to crop up when patients are on anti-biotics as that tends to wipe out all normal gut flora. Unfortunately that isn't always possible, so you have to develop drugs for it. 

A fecal transplant is given to those (usually) who's gut flora doesn't come back to normal, and as a result develops reoccurring infections. at the moment the fecal transplant is sort of performed as an enema - but they are developing a pill that is taken orally that would do the same job.   My c. diff resulted from broad spectrum antibiotics prescribed for a sinus infection. Unfortunately, it went undiagnosed for months because my doctor thought I was too young to have it. After over a year of sickness and a few relaspes, I'm now severely lactose intolerant and I take probiotics everyday. If I don't, I can feel myself becoming sick again within a week.  C. Diff is the nightmare bug that a large fraction of patients have in every hospital.  Cdif here, Cdif there....yikes. Although it means it could be useful against MRSA. Fair enough, but the article also says that this method can be used to discover lots of new antibiotics, many of which will likely help with what this one lacks.  There is the Gram-positive MRSA, which does pose a significant threat. C. difficile, MRSA, TB and S. pyogenes are all theoretically susceptible to this antibiotic so it's hardly useless.  Given that MRSA and TB are probably the two most dangerous and prevalent resistant bacterial species around right now, I would rather this be effective against gram positives. MRSA? VRE? C. diff? 

Pretty big issues right there. 

I think you would have a hard time arguing that either gram-negative or gram-positive is more pressing though. 

We need antibiotics for both classes and either one has potential to solve huge issues.  The article suggests it is also effective against TB Gram postives pose a threat. Staph, strep, c-diffs are all G+ and cause a whole lot of infections. While they this drug may not target the atypicals more ammo to fight common infections is certainly worth while.  Well, they tested it on Staphylococcus aureus (this is MRSA) or Mycobacterium tuberculosis (this causes tuberculosis) and found that they are susceptible to this new antibiotic. I'd say that's pretty significant. [Source](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14098.html) Clostridium difficile is also a gram positive; this one of the culprits behind IBS and Crohn's disease. Just a correction here; C. difficile doesn't cause Crohn's - it may worsen prognosis, but is absolutely not a "culprit behind" CD. You're right: Crohn's is as much of an immune response as anything [ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17438417).  Nevertheless, great discovery. Although I wonder what would happen if financial incentive was greater; one of the financial problems with discovering antibiotics is the fact that doctors won't prescribe them once they're discovered, as new ones will always be placed as 3rd line of treatment to prevent people from developing resistance to them, and then having nothing else to treat with - so it usually takes a decade for a new antibiotic to become commonly used. C. Diff is implicated in IBS and Crohn's?

I was under the impression C. Diff colitis was its own entity.  Yeh, ulcerative colitis-suffering pharma scientist here and I've never heard of any link  between C. Diff and Crohn's or ulcerative colitis. I guess it is possible that a C. Diff infection could function as an environmental trigger for latent or remissive IBD, but the same could be said for pretty much anything.  You are right about C. dif colitis [ref](http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/cdiff/Cdiff-patient.html). I just got so excited! A new antibiotic! I blame the media for whipping me up into a frenzy :) Damn. That's *great* news.

Seriously fuck MRSA [deleted] Because there are already new antibiotics being developed in clinical phase that do this and more.
Most notably, I encourage to look into compound named Brilacidin, which has just completed second phase 2 study (2b) with flying colors. Outclassing daptomycin in treatment of ABSSSI in efficacy and side effects. With a single dose regimen vs. 7 days required for daptomycin! It is also effective against gram negative and positive bacteria. There are actually a lot of new antibiotics being approved over the last few years.

Just because I am lazy here is one:
Linezolid - discovered in 1990, approved for clinical use in 2000. Both &lt;30 years
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linezolid [The article from Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14098.html). Apparently, clicking the link to the Nature article through the [NY Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/health/from-a-pile-of-dirt-hope-for-a-powerful-new-antibiotic.html?_r=0) gives you free access to the full paper. Now lets put in place some regulations that limit the distribution of this drug to humans, and not livestock. Frankly it should be limited to last-line-of-defence and not prescribed to patients at all; we must hold things like this in reserve. And make patient compliance a pre-condition. If you want to be allowed to use anti-biotics you should have to do so in a way that limits the chance of you helping it develop resistance. Supervised dosages, compulsary quarantine.  That would be super expensive. Most doctors at my hospital give a small dose, make sure patient reacts well to antibiotic, and send them on their way home with prescription. If we had to hospitalize every single patient on antibiotics, we would need a hella load of additional hospitals constructed. If we used this new antibiotic only as a last line of defense, I assume it would only be used for rare cases anyway. ie. the kinds that would probably require hospitalisation anyways.   We'll have to kill and burn everyone it is administered to, to make sure no resistant bacteria can survive. One of the biggest problems is poor sanitation in densely populated developing countries. Instead of building infrastructure to contain and treat wastewater to prevent infections, people in these areas use antibiotics as a first line of defense leading to their overuse. Some of the most dangerous antibiotic resistance bacteria come from India. [Source](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/trouble-with-antibiotics/) I have no idea what's going on with all this livestock talk in the comment section. What am I missing? As far as I understand, antibiotics are sometimes just mixed into livestock's food, as to a farmer it makes sense to give all your animals constant immunity to any bacterial infection, whether they are already sick or not. One of the worst cases of this I've heard is fish farms that basically use vast net baskets out in the ocean to contain thousands upon thousands of caught fish. If one fish gets a bacterial infection it will spread like wildfire, so the fish farms literally pump antibiotics into these parts of the ocean to keep all their livestock healthy. [[source/example](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/27/world/americas/27salmon.html)]

Obviously this can then cause massive problems due to providing an environment where it's advantageous for bacteria to be resistant to these antibiotics, and bam you can end up with bacterial infections that cannot be cured using any current medicine. [[source](http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm235649.htm)] Microbiology PhD student here... Seeing the headline made me immediately skeptical, and I figured this was blown out of proportion, but it actually sounds pretty promising.

Long story short, they were able to isolate a naturally-produced antibiotic from the soil that works similarly to a previously discovered antibiotic (vancomycin, which they mention in paper). The cool thing is that this compound is able to kill bacteria that have acquired vancomycin resistance, which is promising. 

This is still no silver bullet, though. It doesn't look like it's effective against Gram-negative bacteria, which comprise a bunch of pathogens. Against MRSA, though, this could be great. 

I'm sure resistance can and will crop up, but the exciting thing is we know enough to hopefully be more responsible implementing new antibiotics. They give the example that it took 30 years for clinical resistance to vancomycin to crop up, so with proper use this could last just as long if not longer. Which is awesome.

Microbes are crafty though, I don't really believe this search for new antibiotics will ever be able to end.  The most promising part of this paper is the method, not the drug. They found a way to screen un-culturable microbes for antibiotics, and in a fairly inexpensive/simple manner. The drug itself is just proof on concept--the method could lead to the discovery of untold numbers of new antibiotics. No, the search won't end, but this means we no longer have to confine our search to such a small area. Thank you for the comment on Gram-negative efficacy. Something we are desperately working on! It's pretty great that this compound has anti-tuberculer activity but we will have to see how it does in phase 1-3 trials.

As for resistance... We saw resistance to daptomycin in just a few years and since that is a hospital IV administered drug, it is safe to say that it has been used pretty responsibly. So resistance seems to be highly drug dependent - or more more specifically, resistance seems to be mechanism of action / target dependent.  Can you also explain how this is the "first new antibiotic in 30 years." There have been tons that have come out in the last 30 years. Many of them are in the same classes as previous ones. But I know for sure that there are some brand new classes.

Fidaxomicin for example is a brand new first-in-class treatment for c.diff that I have already seen used in the hospital for certain cases. Great/terrible news. Now people will think they have an argument for maintaining the levels of antibiotic use in animal farming. "If we can make new antibiotics, we don't have to worry about overusing the old ones." &gt; in animal farming.

And prescribing them to everyone who comes in with a runny nose. Over prescribing within doctor offices is certainly an issue but I learned in a university microbiology class that nearly 50% of world antibiotic use goes to animal husbandry uses.

This is a decent article about US use, though I suspect world use is similar: http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/antibiotic_agri.shtml Europe has far stricter legislation on antimicrobial use than the US - no use as growth enhancers in Europe for example.  Also important to consider the number of doses rather than overall weight used - a human weighs a lot less than a cow. Also most antibiotics used in animal husbandry are outdated for human use (like most tetracyclines or beta-lactam). Of course you still create gene-reservoirs for antibiotic-resistance and enable gene-transfers, but the pure weight of doses is not a really good indicator.
Nonetheless anitibiotics need to be more regulated and I completely agree with this direction.

e: As some of you have mentioned: I'm talking about EU regulations, should have made this more clear. I'm not an expert in antibiotic administration in the US. Of course there are still many  tetracyclines and beta-lactams prescribed for human use and I didn't mean to evaluate every single variation (which is quite a task). An excellent comparison of the human clinically important antimicrobials and veterinary clinically
important antimicrobials: http://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/i0204e/i0204e00.pdf

The general point that mostly "older" antibiotics are used still stands, but ,as I mentioned earlier, there is still a high risk for transferability. Fluorchinolones (use of enrofloxacin as prophylactic for chickens implicated in increasing resistance to ciproflaxin) are good examples for this and shows why there needs to be more research in this area. 

e2: and another review especially for tigecycline: http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Report/2013/07/WC500146814.pdf
But since DART we have stricter regulations, a slight decrease in antiobiotic use   and the use of "antimicrobials of last resort" is still heavily controlled (with a prescription  volume of just 1,2%).  Far as I know tetracyclines are still the first line for a number of infections.  We give tetracycline for basically any kid with a zit. Well, I had two tetracycline treatments for my cystic acne. Absolutely agree with more regulation needed.  I speak from personal experience that their misuse is rife within veterinary medicine, it seems human medicine is no different.  
Alongside that there must be enforcement of that legislation - if a doctor knowingly endangered the life of one patient their license to practice would be at risk; if they knowingly endanger the life of all humans by over/mis - prescribing antimicrobials the consequences should be the same.  

i would personally go as far as to outright ban the use of human-critical antimicrobials on any other species.  No animals life is worth the consequences of resistance.  There is a great deal of resistance to this idea in the veterinary community however.  Most veterinary practice is privately owned so there is some financial incentive to overprescribe - this must be regulated and zero (or very small) markups enforced for these drugs.

Also there must be greater public education of antimicrobial resistance - people have often vaguely heard of it but are unaware of how bad the situation already is, or how they may be contributing to it.   Beta-lactam? You mean penicillin? That's still the drug of choice for a lot of infections. We use it every day. This in particular is a symptom of doctors being sandwiched between a public that's ignorant of antibiotics and viral diseases, and an administration who blindly listens to the public's "satisfaction".  Even if they don't want to, doctors are forced to hand out antibiotics to patients with viral colds, otherwise the patients will complain to the administrative staff, who will punish the doctor for a low satisfaction rating.  And then of course the patients go and only take half the course of the antibiotics anyway.

So fixing this problem involves one of both of the impossible tasks of educating and training the public in a relatively technical subject, or taking the bureaucracy out of bureaucrats. Oh, no question.  My brother in law is a family practitioner in a small town.  He has a few regulars who come in every time theyre feeling off and demand that he prescribe something.  It drives him nuts that he cant tell them to just go home and get plenty of rest and fluids, but he cant risk irritating them and having word spread through the grapevine that hes irresponsible or lazy.  Publically available healthcare data is great, but there was some benefit to the time when doctors were treated as minor deities whose word was law. I've been wondering about this: is that grapevine really so powerful? Here in Ontario (Kitchener/Waterloo in particular), if you have a family doctor, you usually stay with them because it's so incredibly difficult to find a doctor accepting new patients. So it would seem that over here, doctors could say, "Look buddy, that doesn't help and I won't prescribe it". (My doctor has posters in her office explaining that antibiotics don't help often, so that suggests that at least she makes an effort to not over-prescribe.) Yes, unfortunately. I'm in a lot of Facebook groups that cater to mom's, breastfeeding, etc. There isn't a week that goes by that some crazed,mom goes,on and rants about Dr so and so suggesting vaccines or vitamin d drops and asks for suggestions of a new provider. 100+ comments later about Dr this and that who doesn't encourage vaccines or vitamins and the,mom feels,justified that she is doing the best for her child by switching to a chiropractor or something. As a medical professional I try to spread awareness and info, but some of those lawsuits don't listen and would rather take advice from someone who got their degree online than,from someone who went to school for 10+ years. Its a sad reality.  I've lost patients for refusing to prescribe antibiotics in a situation where they clearly weren't indicated.

One lady found somebody who would the next day and called our office to inform us of how stupid we were. As long as it's an antibiotic and not a vaccine, 'cause my homeopath said those aggravate my self-diagnosed autism and my gluten intolerance.  So shouldn't there be strict guidelines where new antibiotics such as this are only administered reactively and under hospital-controlled conditions where their development can be closely monitored? I'd certainly agree with that. However, drug company profit margins might say otherwise.  I think you're confusing profits with profit margins. So, every bacterial infection that requires a new antibiotic would require hospitalization? That might not be a feasible or sustainable idea.

A new antibiotic kills pathogens without detectable resistance

Cintia R. Felix1, K. Ashley Fetterman1, William P. Millett1, Anthony G. Nitti1, Ashley M. Zullo1, Chao Chen4 &amp; Kim Lewis4 Now if we can only figure out how to stop it's widespread misuse for "sinus infections", cold viruses, allergies, livestock, and other bogus reasons that make it become ineffective. Shit. I was just given a high dose prescription of amoxicillin for my sinus infection that I had been battling for about 2 weeks before I finally went to see the doctor... I thought that a sinus infection was a valid reason for antibiotics?  That depends on what you're infected with. If it's a viral infection, then no, they're useless. If it's a bacterial infection, then yeah, they're effective. Unfortunately without swabbing your sinuses and running a culture, it's difficult to tell until after you start taking the drugs. Basically, if you start feeling better within 24 hours, it was almost certainly a bacterial infection and antibiotics were the correct course of action. If you still feel just as crappy after a day or so, it's viral, and the drugs aren't going to end up helping. 

*That doesn't mean you should stop taking them.* I am not a doctor, and you should follow your doctor's instructions and always take your antibiotics for the full duration unless otherwise directed. Ah, well they took a swab to see if it was Strep and that came back negative so that's when they were like "Welp, antibiotics!"

I did feel better after taking them... my fever went away almost immediately as well as the white spots on my throat. And I didn't even feel nauseous once! surprising with amoxicillin and my weak ass stomach.  There are several variants of Strep. Only one shows up on the quick test they can do in the office. If the amoxicillin killed your fever immediately, you had a bacterial infection. ah okay, that makes sense.  &gt; *That doesn't mean you should stop taking them.* I am not a doctor, and you should follow your doctor's instructions and always take your antibiotics for the full duration unless otherwise directed.

Especially since this is likely to half-kill any bacteria that you may (unknowingly) be infected with, leaving the resistant ones. Edit: /u/foggyforests, this is in response to your post but I think it got lost in the shuffle!

It is. I've been sick for about a month and am on my 3rd antibiotic, augmentin, for a bad sinus infection. I am one of those people who are resistant to antibiotics like  azithromycin for secondary infections from upper respiratory infections. And there's a reason:

I'm a nurse. I've worked in hospitals 30+ years, exposed to every bug imaginable. I don't smoke, but I do have asthma. Despite the infection control precautions hospitals employ, to keep healthcare workers and other patients safe from passing infections to others, germs spread everywhere. But that's another topic for another day.

This breakthrough will be huge if it truly provides medication to treat TB, which at this point requires 6 months to a year or more of oral meds. C. diff is just an awful, awful infection that is not common in the general population but is common in debilitated people like nursing home residents and chronically ill hospital patients. Ironically, c. diff usually occurs after patients have been on antibiotics for other illnesses.

This  drug as mentioned in the article, will be battling big time illnesses, and it is bound to have some heavy side effects, despite the statement about mice not experiencing any. I think that will be the catch here. It may become a wonderfully curative drug, but then so is intravenous [vancomycin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin), which has some horrible side effects.

That's what I do as a nurse; I place [PICC lines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripherally_inserted_central_catheter) for people who have to go home on weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy (or take chemo or TPN etc). 

Sorry; I sort of got off track in response to you, foggyforests :). Just rest assured you're not the only one on a penicillin for sinus. It's miserable, and I feel your pain, but in a few days you should be feeling much better! 

 &gt;  I thought that a sinus infection was a valid reason for antibiotics?

A sinus infection is. Drews232 is talking about viral rhinitis/sinusitis deemed "sinus infections" because patients aren't satisfied unless the walk out with an antibiotic. These days, a lot of stupid policies have sorta strong-armed many physicians into caving and writing the script, even knowing it's viral.

Edit: although MOST sinus infections will clear without antibiotic if given the chance. Only those that don't are in need of meds.  Not to take away from Kim Lewis's group (who are great colleagues), but this title is really bothering me. It is not the first antibiotic discovered in the last 30 years. [Cubist Pharmaceuticals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubist_Pharmaceuticals) has discovered a few and brought 2 to market just this year! Cubicin was technically discovered in the 80s but was approved in 2003. 

I would also like to point out that discovery of an antibiotic is not the same thing as developing an approved drug. I am on a team that has discovered quite a few novel antibiotics just this year! It's just that those novel compounds tend to be really toxic and make crappy drugs, so they get shelved. But they are still novel antibiotics discovered. Kim Lewis's drug, on the other hand, looks pretty great but it still has to pass phase 1-3 trials. Many drugs that look great initially end up not being very safe. 

So I don't think by any measure you can say that this was the first new or even novel class of antibiotics discovered in 30 years. Even the Nature headline is sensationalist.  This isn't the first antibiotic to be discovered without measurable resistance and it probably won't be the last.   If this pans out this is the biggest news reddit will see or will have seen in it's whole existance. This is major. The threat of resistant bacteria is real and becoming more of an issue each year. 

This antibiotic can save millions of lives or at least make them better. 

As someone with Crohns I did a little dance after reading the article.  May I ask how this might affect Crohns? Most folks with crohns are on immunosuppressants that place them at risk for opportunistic infections.   Any neutropenic patient could really really benefit from this. Fantastic!!! Organ transplant here. This is very good news. Regular dude here. This is good news. Due to the disease I've taken a substantial amount of antibiotics in my life time. At this point almost any use of antibiotics causes me to get C-Diff even if use probiotics. Then to get rid of that I have to take vanxomiasin which is the strongest antibiotic available.

Having a new antibiotic that can beat resistant strained bacterial infections sounds great. Hyperbole much? THIS IS THE MOST NOTEWORTHY THING TO HAPPEN IN HUMAN HISTORY FROM 2005 TO YEAR INFINITY! As someone who had MRSA last year and is still at risk, I'll dance with you! I'm impressed by the antibiotic but what this article should really be about is the way to extract bacterias from the soil and keep them alive...  Now that is fascinating!  
Imagine how many new bacterias we will be able to study?!!  

I also hope that we learned our lesson and don't over-prescribe this new one. Antibiotics found in nature are the natural chemical warfare agents that microbes produce to kill each other when they can't get along as neighbors.  

The problem with isolating and producing them on a mass scale is that these chemical agents have existed in nature for a very long time, meaning some species have already grown adaptations to avoid or mitigate their effects.  Use one antibiotic too frequently and you just select for these resistant species to survive. 

You can modify and tweak the chemical structure of the antibiotic for efficacy, but this is only delaying the inevitable.  All of them will lose efficacy over time as evolution selects for more resistant pathogens.  These drugs aren't the drugs of the future, but a temporary stopgap measure until we can come up with something *really* effective.

Imagine friendly and harmless designer microbes that can reside in certain spaces of your body.  They're built from the ground up to be incredibly resistant to mutation (too much deviation in the genetic code and they kills themselves).  They don't irritate the immune system and they don't produce toxic effects in humans. Their sole job is to take up residence and prevent other microbes (the real bad guys) from setting in. 

One day in the far future an advanced humanity might inoculate themselves with several designer strains of helpful bacteria that colonize the human body and stay there for life, keeping the host safe from infection. [30 years vs. like 2](http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v7/n9/images/nrmicro2200-f1.jpg) its not a pretty picture is it? Can you explain exactly what I'm looking at? I'm having trouble understanding the graph Pencillin was introduced in the early 1940s.  Within about 2 years, bacterial resistance to penicillin was discovered.

Methicillin, a beta-lactam similar to penicillin, was introduced in about 1959.  Within about 2 years, bacterial resistance to methicillin was discovered (MRSA-I).  Then various other strains of Staph aureus that were resistant to methicillin were discovered later (MRSA-II &amp; III).

Bacteria kept developing resistance to other drugs, as seen at the VRSA point for instance on the graph which was when Staph aureus that is resistant to vancomycin, another antibiotic, was discovered. Ahhh okay, thank you, that really helps :)  The chart shows the timeline of when current antibiotics were introduced and when resistance developed.

You can see that only a few years after penicillin was introduced, resistance was already becoming an issue.

He's implying that it took 30 years to discover a new antibiotic, but resistance can develop within a couple years, which means that discovery of new drugs can't keep up with development of resistance.

Which is true, aside from the possibility put forward in this article of a new method to screen for natural antibiotic compounds, which would hopefully increase the rate of discovery of new antibiotics. Ahh okay thank you very much for helping explain that :)  Here is the actual article that contains the pic 

http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v7/n9/fig_tab/nrmicro2200_F1.html It's showing the year that penicillin and methicillin (two antibiotics), and how quickly resistance was first observed.

I.e.

Penicillin was developed in ~1941, and resistance appeared in ~1944.

Methicillin was developed in ~1959, and resistance appeared in ~1960. Basically it's just saying that there are more resistant versions of Staphylococcus aureus in recent years. The acronyms are saying "(insert drug name here) Resistant Staph Aureus". The increasing line is showing the increase in cases of resistance, I believe, although I'm not one hundred percent sure. The numbered lines on top could be showing the introduction and use of certain drugs. For example, penicillin is still used today whereas Methicillin is not (due to bad side effects as well as rapid resistance, in case you were interested). Hopefully that helped? I will agree that this graph is not as well labeled as it could be. I don't understand this chart. See my reply above. I was recently talking about the lack of new antibiotics with some colleagues. One pointed out that the major reason there haven't been development of new antibiotics, was not because of a lack of potential bacterial candidates from which antibiotics could be derived, but rather a lack of monetary incentive for big pharma to dedicate research hours to. In short, antibiotics are not the money makers that other drugs like statins, or anti hypertensive, or even sexual enhancement drugs are, so they aren't willing to work on them.

This article, seems to indicate otherwise. Regardless, another new, effective antibiotic is great news in my eyes. I just hope antibiotics are used as a very conservative drug as time goes by. I am shocked of how these are prescribed like they were aspirins by some (many?) doctors.. As the father of an organ transplant recipient, this almost brought tears. &gt;Dame Sally Davies, the governments Chief Medical Officer, said antibiotic resistant was as big a risk of terrorism; 

Really? How many people die from terrorism every year?  Never mind, I looked it up. They estimate [17,800 people die from terrorist attacks globally each year](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/04/state-17800-plus-people-killed-globally-in-terrorist-attacks-in-2013/). And, [1.5 million people die globally from just TB alone.](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/)

 Can anyone tell me what the fact this was discovered by a university rather than a company, means as far as mass production and patents go? Will the university let anyone make it? How does it normally work in these circumstances? I actually work at an antibiotics factory so it is of interest to me.  &gt;Dame Sally Davies, the governments Chief Medical Officer, said antibiotic resistant was as big a risk of terrorism

So, not much of a threat at all? Terrific news. I worked on the marketing for the last antibio the corporation I worked for developed and that was decades ago. Even then, everyone, even plebes like me, knew about the dire development of resistance. 

Amazing, huh, that people at my lowly level knew about this in the early 80s? It has been known to be a serious problem all of this time. Sometimes it is astounding how long it takes for problems to bubble up into the general consciousness. Now, can we please not destroy the effectiveness of this new drug by giving it to cattle so they will fatten up a little faster? I worked for Kim as a graduate student. This is awesome. Prior to this only two new classes of antibiotic have been developed in like 30 years.  Fecal matter transplant already cures C Diff with no side effects.   Link to the article via NYT: http://www.nature.com/articles/nature14098.epdf?referrer_access_token=53cXadysZlayJsjQ2HnOgdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PvwA6rMMnycnymQk5ZOpb5ktLjj6cTh7j_4Otw8h3aTLOme_4Mfg4226Q9Wqq63KtJLL1JHUmy-8bp_Yq1LHDp I hope medical science keeps this in their back pocket to treat people that are sick from bacteria that is resistant to other antibiotics.  I won't believe it does anything until it clears Phase 1, at the very lest.

Also, I can't imagine this would be delivered orally. That thing will get torn to shreds. This is a very shortsighted response to this paper.  The authors developed a new method for culturing previously unculturable bacteria, opening up the potential for many, many more antibiotic compounds to be discovered.  

In addition, the structure itself may not pan out, but it can inspire more medicinal chemistry, either through analog synthesis to improve its PK/PD properties, or mimicking some functionality present in this molecule elsewhere. Part of my frustration is that nobody is talking about the awesome methods they used to isolate the compound, only the compound itself. I completely agree with you - that specific molecule might die in phase 1, but the method of isolating it might change the way we do antibiotics.

Most news outlets / reddit posts / etc that I've seen just talk about how great this new antibiotic is, and I thought that, as scientists, we should be more speculative. What thing do you refer do in your last statement? He's probably referring to the molecular structure of the antibiotic (I don't know, have not read the article yet), stomachs are nasty acidic places that like to hydrolyze (literally break up the carbon-carbon bonds and insert water to keep them apart) organic molecules.  If you can't deliver an antibiotic orally because of this reason, you have to administer it via IV infusion.

edit: after reading the predictably content-free article I've found the [abstract of the paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14098.html)  There is a small diagram of the molecule on there, it is quite large and being a polypeptide (branched chain protein) has many places that would be vulnerable to nucleophillic attack (basically at each Nitrogen-Carbon bond), it may also be too large to diffuse effectively into the bloodstream, reducing its bioavailability and making it unable to be administered orally. Compared to something like [amoxicillin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin), which is much simpler and regularly administered orally, I would agree that it's likely that this will have to be an IV antibiotic. That's just speculation. Other oral antibiotics have tons of places for nucleophillic attack, but are fine. The big deal in pharmacodynamics is what the liver does to these things once it gets to it. Oral meds go through the liver first, then to the rest of the system. If the liver tags them for removal too quickly, it's as if they weren't even there. And you can't tell that just by looking at the molecule. Yes, it is just speculation, that's why I'm speaking in likelihoods. Yeah, but as /u/Science_Monster said, polypeptides get eaten by the stomach. In fact, i can't think of any protein that doesn't get eaten by the stomach. It doesn't matter what happens in the liver if all the amino acids just get absorbed.
 I seriously doubt it would survive the stomach and upper intestines. As an IV drug, sure, as long as it doesn't aggregate like crazy.

As for it being "just speculation," I think that the burden of proof lies on someone making the claim that it *would* survive the stomach, since part of digestion is the degradation of polypeptides just like this one. Yup, that's what I'm talking about. It's a polypeptide (with some modification), and it looks like it would get shredded in the digestive tract. I made another comment in this post about how teixobactin mechanism of action would also likely destroy all GI flora. It will most definitely be need to be IV.  That's a very good point.  You could just place it an enterically coated capsule, so that it wont dissolve in the stomach, but rather later on in the gut at a more favorable pH Peptide means protein; this molecule is not a protein. look at its structure, it's composed of amino acids.  It's a very low molecular weight polypeptide. I agree. It looks like it's a fairly big molecule, susceptible to hydrolysis and lacks of halogens (less lipophilia means it won't be absorbed from the intestines), so yes: I too **speculate** that as it is now this compound will have to be injected. Indeed, hundreds of thousands of variations will be made of this molecule, its pharmacophore identified and the bulky structure will be cut down to a skeleton that will hopefully be more potent than this massive arrangement of atoms. What makes you think this molecule won't last in the GI tract? If they are thinking of treating C diff with it, it had better have an oral formulation. [Peptide drugs generally don't, as far as I have seen.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2792531/) It's not really the drug that's the breakthrough here. Sure it's amazing but it's the process which is really the breakthrough. Additionally, which lucky chemist is going to attempt to synthesize that thing? Anybody know why they believe teixobactin is not susceptible to resistance?  I read an article that it's because teixobactin inhibits the development of a cell wall, which is fundamental to infectious bacteria so they can't mutate around this.  But I thought that's how penicillin worked as well? The reason they hope this is less prone to have bacteria develop resistance is based on an experiment they perform in the paper and the fact that teixo targets a cell wall component, as you mention.

In short, *Staph aureus* was grown in media containing the drug over many days and never developed resistance.

The targeting of the cell wall is hard to develop resistance against because it's not a protein and thus not directly coded for in a gene. This means that a point mutation or two in a protein isn't likely to delete an active site, like it might if the drug targeted a protein.

Instead, bacteria will need to evolve a protein that attacks the antibiotic, like the bacterial enzyme Beta-lactamase attacks the chemical structure of penicillin-like antibiotics.

If teixobactin is being secreted in nature by a microbe, it's likely other bacteria have evolved enzymes to stop it.

 Yes exactly. And because the mechanism of action is against the cell wall, the drug does not need to enter the cytoplasm in order to be efficacious. If that was required, like most antibiotics, then the bacteria could have mutations in efflux pumps which  then could pump out the antibiotics to protect itself. It's harder to protect against something that doesn't need to physically enter your cell in order to kill you.  Thanks for the explanation.  When you say that bacteria would have to "instead" evolve a protein that attacks the antibiotic itself the way bacteria have for penicillin and its ilk, doesn't that mean teixobactin no less susceptible to resistance than penicillin was? I think you're right on track. 

That said, penicillin had a damn good run that hasn't truly ended yet. It's possible to co-administer a drug that will inhibit the bacterial enzymes responsible for breaking down the antibiotic. This is why amoxicillin is sometimes administered with clavunlanic acid. Clavunlanic acid inhibits bacterial enzymes responsible for breaking down amoxicillin. That would be.. Augmentin or Clavavox. It's kind of bunk because everything can be evolved around, especially peptidoglycan inhibitors like this. Woo! Go science! 

I just really hope we use this new wave more sparingly. We use antibiotics far too liberally and this is a chance to start fresh.  Thank goodness.... We need more people working in this issue!!!  I'm really curious how this will interact with MRSA me too ivew had it 7 times over the past 5 years oh god that sucks, do you get in when your sick or is it just pop up at random? random i almost died when i got it on my face, it looked like i had a baseball surgically implanted It was actually extensively tested with S. aureus already in this paper and no resistant strains were found to develop. They also tested directly against MRSA (resistant S. aureus) and found high efficacy. From the original journal article in Nature:

&gt;An animal efficacy study was then performed in a mouse septicemia model. Mice were infected intraperitoneally with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) at a dose that leads to 90% of death. One hour post-infection, teixobactin was introduced i.v. at single doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg per kg. All treated animals survived (Fig. 4a), and in a subsequent experiment the PD50 (protective dose at which half of the animals survive) was determined to be 0.2 mg per kg, which compares favourably to the 2.75 mg per kg PD50 of vancomycin, the main antibiotic used to treat MRSA.

That is to say, they lethally infected mice with MRSA, and teixobactin cured it in all cases. Very good news.

That said, this drug is probably 4-5 years at minimum from clinical deployment, so don't expect it to be on shelves tomorrow. That's an interesting choice for a name. Teicho- comes from the ancient Greek "teichos" which means "wall" (specifically a defensive wall).  Pretty clever actually, as teixo is thought to act by inhibiting synthesis of peptidoglycan, a key precursor in bacterial cell walls (a feature that is notably absent from mammalian cells).  It appears that they've figured out how to get the thymus to regenerate, and therefore total nuking is possible: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24715454 .
 I appreciate that you took the time to ask the question, do the research and then answer your own question, you also might want to add this to your old comment. I was at first really confused by your comment and am glad I finished reading it all. Both his comment asking about this and his posting of the answer were next to each other for me.

 I just thought it was nice he posted it as a reply to the thread OP with a relevant source so it was easier for people to find. Can this be applied to AIDS patients? Wow. This may also have large implications in functionally eradicating the most common type of HIV, the M-tropic version in ~90% of patients. Because you could reintroduce the patients own Hematopoetic (blood producing) cells which they mentioned, except with them being modified to have the CCR5 co-receptor deletion (32) which is needed for HIV to attach and replicate.
That's my 2 cents. I think it's worth a study though.

[#CanIHAsPDF](http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2084840) free of this articles study.


Edit: This is a copy of a post I made before I saw you asked this when I refreshed the page.

Edit 2: Keep in mind a functional cure may not be a full cure because HIV often lies dormant in other types of cells ([latent reservoirs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency)). As far as we know not doing to much but it can pop back out. It may not fully cure it but it may keep it to very low levels possibly with no medication needed hypothetically. Side note: I did genetic testing last summer and discovered that I have two copies of the CCR5 mutation. I contacted Dr. Michael Verneris who has done research using both bone marrow and umbilical cord blood from donors with the mutation in treating patients with HIV. He encouraged me to register as a bone marrow donor, which I did, and said if I'm a match, I could potentially contribute substantially to medical research. Yay science! That's freaking awesome!!! Your are in like the 1% of people who have that great mutation! [deleted] We love them if they take what they have and contribute to others. [deleted] I believe this has already been done (sort of), though it was unintentional and only once. An HIV+ patient had cancer and needed a bone marrow transplant.  The donor had the CCR5 mutation, so in addition to being treated for cancer, the patient also got "cured" of HIV.

I forget the name but you could probably look it up. Yes, the [Berlin patient!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Berlin_Patient) It's an incredible story. Although somewhat reacently they have detected at least some HIV proteins in him again. But the virus is at least very well controlled. Some call it a functional cure. Yeah, that's why I put cure in quotes.  I imagine it has to do with the fact that late stage HIV can use CXCR4 in place of CCR5, but as far as I know this is much less effective.

Could also have to do with free virions that aren't infecting anything but are still there. Wasn't the patient widely called the "Berlin Patient"?  Would also work for a large number of auto-immune diseases like lupus, Crohn's, and colitis. This could be huge. I mean, you're essentially destroying and rebuilding the immune system. Complete rebuilds of things tends to fix them. Have you tried turning it off and on again? But in all seriousness, I work in IT and that fixes easily half of all problems. Biology is wildly more complex, but resetting a system seems a completely reasonable method to heal it. Just yesterday my husband was joking with me about needing a way to turn myself off and on again so my body could reset and my various ailments could heal. Maybe one day there'll be a way. Thymus regeneration? Or nuking of the immune system?

For the immune system bit, there's been a few cases where the immune systems have been destroyed in preparation for bone marrow transplant, and HIV has been elimited when the new bone marrow took. The most well known cases being [the Berlin patients](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Berlin_Patient).

The important thing with those cases is they happened to find a match with an allele that prevents the HIV virus from entering the immune cells. Thus slowly over time after the transplants the viral loads dropped to undetectable levels. Finding a match with that allele was completely by chance though (trying to find the interview). I love the Berlin patient's story. That guy is so incredibly lucky! His outlook was grim because he had **HIV and cancer**, the cancer being the reason for the bone marrow transplant.

Probably the luckiest patient in the history of the planet. I've met the Berlin patient, Timothy Ray Brown. I met him 2 years ago when he was doing a speaking tour to advocate for scientific advances in an HIV cure. I was having dinner at a table with Brown and PhD-level immunologists and the entire conversation was over my head. 

I asked how he supports himself financially. He said that since he moved to the US, he has been very poor and have struggled with housing. I believe he was homeless in San Francisco for a while.  Being the Berlin patient is a type of fame that informs his entire life. It's not like he walked away and led an everyday life. Some of the science community has embraced him as a hero and helps him financially. I was deeply moved and awestruck that he is devoting his life to championing the science that saved him. 

 We should see if Reddit can get him to do an AMA! How does one do this? Read up on the Berlin patient.  They took someone who had cancer and HIV.  Found a bone marrow donor who was also carrying the gene making them resistant to HIV, did chemo to nuke patients system, did transplant and the patient was cured of leukemia and HIV.  Much of the HIV work I've seen is based in the results of this. They would be very hesitant to do this for a HIV patient because of the risks involved.

HIV is really well controlled by the current standards of care. They are expensive lifetime regimens, but you'll live a full life expectancy.  A complete bone marrow transplant, on the other hand, is almost like giving yourself full blown AIDS immunosuppression for a few weeks and carries a substantial risk of death from infection. doesn't AIDS eventually start infecting brain cells? I'm sorry to hijack your post, but I am looking for help. I am a live-in caretaker for a woman with severe MS. She can no longer use her own hands, she can't swallow liquids that aren't honey thick, and she is paralyzed from the waist down. I would like to know what is possible in terms of getting her treatment if this study is promising. She is only 40, too young to die, but many people who have worked with her are surprised she's still alive. Is this something that would help her? Would it decrease her symptoms? Would she regain any abilities? 

Whoever could help would be a true blessing. Probably not, no. Once you have the holes in your myelin, improvement is very slow to non-existent. This would be much more promising with someone with non-relapsing/remitting but in the beginning of their decline.  I'm sad to hear this... Is there simply a point where someone is past hope? It's difficult to just give up on someone, I want to believe there's something that could still help her.  Do you happen to know what type of MS she has? RRMS (what I have) is very different than SP or PP.  I don not know, but I'll find out and let you know.  Funny. I've been working on this study but we've been blinded to the patient results so this is the first I've heard of the successes!!  /r/MultipleSclerosis might like a chat with you ...  I'm actually learning about MS as I go so I subbed there to lurk. I don't work with patients, I just get frozen cell samples, sometimes years old.  I know a few people with MS and none of them ever had Chemo, can someone explain what the purpose of chemo is for MS patients? The thought here is that MS is an autoimmune disease.  That is, your body starts fighting itself, due to something triggering your immune system at some point in your life.

By giving chemotherapy, you are trying to destroy the immune system, and then introduce the original stem cells back into circulation, to "try again," this time, hopefully not being exposed to the trigger than caused the malfunction which led to the autoimmune attack the first time. so they are trying to turn it off and back on again? Basically, yes. Will this not destroy the adaptive immunity as well? Yes, the immune system would have to "start over". All those childhood vaccinations would be gone. Yes and every single bacteria/virus/fungi you have ever encountered too :/ beats the alternative though I guess The good far outweighs the bad in this scenario.  But does it repair the damage? Some of the damage will repair itself now that the immune system is no longer constantly attacking it, but some of it will be permanent unfortunately. MS generally gets worse over time so the goal is to prevent as much future damage as possible.  Depends how gar the disease has progressed. 

For those like me with very minor damage this would effectively mean a cure. 

This would be a giant leap forward to repairing the damage The list of diseases that fall into that category is pretty low though, and many of those that do have vaccines which one would theoretically be able to retake. Not much of a downside really. Might cure some allergies too. &gt;The list of diseases that fall into that category is pretty low though

You would be very, very surprised at how many people have been subclinically infected with fungi. It's gigantic. Opportunistic mycotic infections are near the top of the list of nasty complications for HIV patients with a CD4 count below 400. 

Not only that, but many of the infections are just horrific. They don't have to decency to just cause a severe enough pneumonia to choke you to death. Ever seen a [subdermal chromomycosis infection](http://static.flickr.com/117/316661961_46c3af69ee_o.jpg) before? Kinda NSFW, no blood, just gross.  They aren't having their immune systems permanently disabled, just for a time (no longer than a cancer patient would).  Then they are being reset.  The reset immune system can handle those diseases, it will just take a short while for it to catch up and regain antibodies for them.  Having your immune system reset is very different from being immunocompromised. Does that mean they have to eat dirt again like they did when they were 3. Yeah but they can do it standing up instead of in a wheelchair. Your allergies are gone as well then? Allergies aren't always tied to the immune system but yes, most will be gone but they can resurface.  Could you elaborate on the first bit (not all allergies being tied to the immune system)? I'd love to know more about it. Yep, that's the case.  You have to be re-immunized for childhood diseases, including booster shots over a period of years.  

Source: I've had a similar procedure for lymphoma (where it is called an autologous stem cell transplant) Yes, this happens with stem cell transplants as part of cancer treatment as well. I had a stem cell transplant 7 years ago as treatment for Hodgkins Lymphoma. The process was:

1. Harvest stem cells

2. Chemo for two weeks

3. "Transplant": They put the harvested stem cells back into the bloodstream.

4. Wait while the harvested stem cells begin to grow enough to sustain life: 2 to 3 weeks. During which time:

* You aren't growing any of your own blood cells or immune cells
* I remained isolated
* After the first two weeks, I was on constant IV antiboitics for a week because of a blood infection
* I had two blood transfusions

After the reintroduced stem cells reestablished themselves, I had to have all my childhood shots again, and I got every single cold that went around, and even some that weren't going around for the next several years. Only in the last two years or so have I returned back to a normal one cold per year. And after all that, here you are! Congrats for making it through.  You'll have to reinstall a fresh operating system.  [deleted] More of a reformat.  A simple reboot would still preserve memory. Or even more accurately it's like removing and reinstalling your antivirus program because it started perceiving essential software as a threat.  There's no reinstallation though, more like you'd have to code it from scratch. You still have the software, you just have to build the virus database again. So you were stuck with McAfee in the first place. You will still have McAfee but hopefully won't go to the same sites that screwed up your computer originally. So biological memory is like RAM? It sounds more like permanent memory to me. Genes are non-volatile storage, surviving without power for thousands of years.

This is erasing the training of the immune system, which requires a living host.  It's a reboot. A power cycle, such as a reboot, does not save memory. A reboot blanks the memory, a reformat blanks the hdd. Still not technically true, but close enough. Err... no? Rebooting most definitely wipes out the memory. Reformatting wipes out storage. Not all memory is volatile :/ [deleted] the solution to everything Pretty much.  I've also heard of them trying to do this with bone marrow replacement

source: MS patient [deleted] "We're going to completely destroy your immune system" feels like a hard sell, but I suppose if I had MS I'd be more willing to entertain options like that. Is it known what the triggers are for the immune system to attack the body like that? That's not the hard part -- it's like a week of chemo.  You get real sick, but it's a week.  The hard part is rebuilding your bone marrow and immune system without dying from something else along the way.  Getting back to "somewhat normal" takes at least 6 months, and it's years before you have a chance of being 100% again.

Source: Had leukemia and they blew away my immune system &amp; bone marrow to start fresh. [relevant xkcd](http://xkcd.com/938/) I have ms. I'm in the hospital for it right now. It's a very hard sale and it's not even really an option for most people.   Ish? Mono, lyme disease, vitamin D deficiency,  genetic...lots of things have been seemingly shown to have a relation to MS. Where you live up to age 16 also appears to have a tracable effect on your chances of developing it. The HALT trial was on poor-prognosis MS patients. These are people for whom first line therapies have already failed and who are already experiencing MS related disability. 

And to answer your question: no not really. Part of this HALT trial involves research into that.  It's like if your antivirus software starts deleting System32 folder you get rid of your antivirus and get a new one that works. Except instead of antivirus system in the analogy, in real life it would be the antivirus system. So, could this (in theory) work for type 1 diabetes? By the time type 1 Diabetes fully kicks in and is realized, the Pancreas Beta cells are already destroyed unfortunately, therefore no insulin. Those cells don't regenerate as far as I've learned. Doctor that has performed this procedure (autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) here. The chemo wipes out the bone marrow, after which a fluid containing blood stem cells, extracted from the patient before the procedure, is administered. These stem cells then repopulate the bone with young, fresh and especially "naive" white blood cells. These cells don't know what to attack and have to learn everything again. 

A common theory about MS is that it occurs in people who have a certain predisposition, that encounter a certain infection during their lives. This infection resembles the structure of brain cells (well, the myelin to be correct) causing the body to make antibodies against both. The infection disappears, and all that remains is their bodies attacking themselves.

This procedure is not without risks: I have never in my life given more anti-emetics and morphine than during a transplantation. Since these patients don't have an immune system during the transplantation, they're also very susceptible to (uncommon and dangerous) infections. That's why they go into isolation as long as their white blood cells haven't recovered. Even after that period, they still remain very fragile, as their immune system has been completely reset. All vaccinations must be re-administered and common infections can run a severe course in the first months after transplantation.

But, most often, such a transplantation is a life saver (or extender) for people with lymfoma, certain kinds of leukemia, multiple myeloma, germinative cancers, etc...
I've seen the same procedure being used for Crohn's dissease as well, which is an inflammatory disease just like MS, so this doesn't come as a very big surprise to me. I'm currious about the long term results tough.  I have ms. Who do I talk to about this? I have ppms I knew a comment like this would come. This was a phase 2 trial, so it's not standard treatment. Also, I'm no neurologist, and wasn't involved in this trial, so I can't help you further. I just have some experience with the procedure they used, not the disease it's used for.

However, since this phase 2 trial was successful, a phase 3 trial will be next, and the treatment will be tested on a much bigger group of patients. So ask your neurologist if he/she knows any participating centers. There is also [ClinicalTrials.gov.](https://clinicaltrials.gov/)

Anyone who searches should be aware that although you may get a lot of hits, relatively few may be recruiting at any point in time, and they may not be recruiting in your area. Another option might be to look at the database of clinical trials at clinicaltrials.gov  rrms here....good luck I know you don't know me and I happened upon your comment while reading the rest of these but know that someone out there thought good thoughts about you today! My mom's got RRMS as well for over 10 years now. Stay strong, friend. From the article I gleamed this was only for relapse-remitting patients. Is this true or would this perhaps also work for secondary progressive patients. I ask because my father has the latter and I'd rather not forward this if it does not apply. Seperate research has been done on progressive patients as well, my father was part of such a research study back around 1997, I do not know the results of the study, but unfortunately it was not successful in my father's case.

EDIT: Article about research at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center my father was a part of:

http://quest.fhcrc.org/articles/2003/03/autoimmune.html It is sad to hear it was not successful for your father. You have my sympathy. [deleted] Not yet, this is still highly experimental.  I came into the comment section specifically looking for comments about Crohn's since that's what I have. I've been on Tysabri which is a medication normally used for people with MS and I've also heard of this type of procedure before. Do you know if this is something they're actively trying to research at the moment? I doubt it will be a while before anything like this is common, but I'll probably have my colon removed at some point this year so I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask about possible future treatments. It's been done and there are studies out of Penn at the very least that I know of as I was offered this treatment and declined because it had a high risk of mortality and a low chance of success. I believe the figure I was given by my doctor was that it was a less than 10% chance that it would have worked and was about a 50% chance I'd die. It might be effective. I wonder if Helminthic therapy would be beneficial post chemo to promote a healthy immune response. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_Therapy After treatment, is there improvement in the patient or does it just stop the progression. Is the damage to the myelin that has been done permanent, irreversible, and something that the brain cannot compensate for? Or can someone who has MS that has progressed to some extent hope for improvement from their current state after treatment? Two different issues

MS has more or less three different aspects of treatment
1) Stop the immune system from attacking the Myelin
2) Minimizing the impact of an attack (massive steroids during a relapse)
3) Dealing with the nerve damage from an attack

This pretty much deals with the first, what you are asking about is the third.  Actual Myelin/Nerve repair is a bit of a Holy Grail and I've heard a bit about it but nothing  meaningful.
 I don't think anything from this article applies, but there has been some signs of hope for repairing damage.
One thing I remember is a recent study for repairing damage by replacing the neurons directly with [stem cells.](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/20/brain-damage-nerve-cells-neurons)
Another I actually saw on reddit was that recently a medication seemed to suggest that the myelin sheaths could be [repaired.](http://www.news-medical.net/news/20141202/Ligand-indazole-chloride-improves-motor-function-study-shows.aspx) I assume the long term side effects of that chemo are expected to be horrendous? Yes and no.

Yes: there is an increased risk for secondary malignancies. That's why we keep these patients in follow-up for years, even decades (yes, the first stem cell transplantations date back to the seventies. Don't let anyone tell you stem cells are the new medical miracle).

No: almost all cancer treatments (radiotherapy, chemo) have this risk. There are other kinds of chemotherapy that have an even higher chance for developing secondary malignancies.

So it depends on what you compare it to. Horrendous when compared to total health? Absolutely, 100% yes. When compared to dying completely paralysed... Perhaps, that's something that has to be decided for every individual patient. Yeah, I have RRMS and it's mostly under control with Tecfidera.  My physical symptoms are fairly mild and manageable and so I look at things like this as "very cool but not for me..yet" I just got diagnosed with RRMS and I see it the other way, I want this now before I'm too disabled to really get any benefit from it other than not dieing. If my quality of life is already in the toilet I might as well just die instead of just freezing time in a disabled state. I'd like to ask a question, if you would be so kind. 

Over the years I've heard about and read about all sorts of, for lack of a better term, "miracle cures" such as this.  Why do these things never seem to reach the light of day for mainstream medicine?  I've met and known dozens of people with MS.  My cousin lost his life to the disease at just 19 years old.  Yet, not once had we ever heard about anything like this procedure.  

I'm not one of these fanatacists that will blame doctor's for my cousin dying so young but I would certainly like to think that someone along the way could have brought up this procedure for us to look into.   Before any type of treatment can be made widely available, it's efficacy and safety must be proved. This process occurs through the following phases and can take years or even decades:

* Phase I: Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects.

* Phase II: The drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety.

* Phase III: The drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely.

* Phase IV: Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. 

I'm not exactly sure what phase this trial was, but it is either I or II and although it looks promising the long term effects simply are not definitively known yet. This treatment is especially extreme, very expensive and taxing on the body. It would be highly irresponsible to start treating a large population of patients with something that has not been proven safe or effective yet. Like you mentioned, there is a high probability that this "miracle cure" doesn't pan out for whatever reason and if this is because of serious health side effects, you want to find that out before you give it to a bunch of people who are not in immediate life-threatening danger. Unfortunately this is just how science and medicine work and sometimes it seems pretty callous. Maybe you can take solace in the fact that others may not have to suffer the way your cousin did due to treatments like this one. Because newspapers jump over mice studies, that are sometimes up to a decade out from implementation. Any single stumbling block in the intervening stops it dead in its tracks.  In laymans terms, MS is an autoimmune disease where the immune system targets certain nervous tissues. Think rheumatoid arthritis. The idea behind this treatment is that chemo wipes out the patients immune system, sort of 'rebooting' it, such that the new immune system doesn't attack their nervous tissues. Chemo is to eliminate the immune system, not to treat the symptoms. &gt; Think arthritis

When most people think of arthritis, they think of osteoarthritis, which is not autoimmune in nature. Rheumatoid arthritis is, but it is significantly rarer than OA, so it would probably be a good idea to clarify. Ah, yeah, thanks! I think it was part of the therapy. "build a new immune system from the ground up" requires them to destroy the original immune system I guess. That's hardcore. Must have been scary for the patients knowing that this was experimental treatment.  It's experimental for MS, but is a not uncommon way of treating some types of cancer, so the major question was more about if it would be beneficial at all and less about the actual treatment Yeah, if you have MS, there's literally nothing scarier than facing that inevitable wasting death.  If it was me? Bring on the experimental treatment. Not a doctor, so take this with a grain of salt.

Chemo destroys fast replicating cells within the body by interfering with cellular reproduction. MS is caused (I think, based on reading) by damage caused by the immune system. The general idea of the treatment is to completely obliterate the immune system with chemo, and then use stem cells to rebuild it fresh.  It's the T-Cells (thymus-based antibodies) seeing a threat in the protective neuron sheath called myelin, and attacking it, causing electrical issues and misfires. So yeah, I guess they'd nuke the thymus. Does it grow back? 

Edit: Yes, yes it does. It appears that they've figured out how to get the thymus to regenerate, and therefore total nuking is possible: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24715454 . I am a 25 year old male with Hodgkin's lymphoma preparing to receive a stem cell transplant myself (I believe the procedure will be quite similar to the one descibred here). Its a wonder what good a nice "hard reset" can do for your body. Just hope one day we can make it more comfortable for the person. Chemo sucks balls.  Yeah but feeling terrible for a short time (comparatively) and going into full remission hopefully forever would totally be worth it in my books. This so what my mom decided. she's been sick for 13 Years and goes to.the hospital every month for a week. She has had a terrible time being sick, and at this point, she's decided getting even sicker for a few months and then getting into remission is much better than what she's doing now. If it kills her, then her suffering is finally over. shed die in the next year anyway. this is the best answer for her. Have MS, can confirm. hell even the chance at full remission and/or a halting of progression seems like its worth it right? Good luck! I'm sure you're in good hands  Good luck,  man.  Could this work for other autoimmune diseases or is it specific to MS? Groups have been thinking about applications to other autoimmune diseases with this technique, and potentially other disorders (ie GI disorders)

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25516648 Thank you for sharing these articles. As someone with crohn's, I'd happily go through chemo if it meant remission. I have ankylosing spondylitis(autoimmune disease), I wonder if this would work to cure it. Like crohns? Please be useful for crohns. I had four doses of high-dose chemo for Aplastic Anemia. It was part of a trial at Johns Hopkins about 15 years ago. My own cells came back on their own. It took a while, but I'm 100% back to normal. 

I'm glad to see this working with other diseases too. Chemo is hell, but it's better than the alternative. Dr Brodsky! Saved my mom, same deal. We've talked before i think. High dose cytoxan/cyclosporin. Brodsky was doing research on the same treatment for MS. I wonder how different the treatment in this article is.  That's really amazing. Thanks for sharing. Almost certainly, although the specific therapies may have to be changed depending on the exact nature of the disease. Autoimmunity occurs because the immune system's targeting mechanisms are failing to distinguish self from non-self for whatever reason. This does not happen instantaneously - these cells have to be "educated" against the affected tissue (in the case of MS, myelin sheaths). This part of the immune system includes a positive feedback loop, which means that the effect will be aggravated until the stimulus is gone. This works for normal pathogens - after all, you want your immune system to go all out when dealing with a virus or infectious bacterial species. However, the stimulus in the case of autoimmunity is the body itself, which means that the body will continually destroy itself.

But as I mentioned earlier, these cells are educated (or "indoctrinated" if you wish for a superior analogy) to attack the body's own cells by positive feedback signaling. There are naive populations of hematopoetic cells in your bone marrow (and other locations, but bone marrow is the best studied), but they too quickly become indoctrinated by the matured cells attacking the body. Thus, the solution is fairly simple. The naive cells are extracted from the patient and stored for later. All indoctrinated immune cells are destroyed via chemotherapy. The stored naive cells are transplanted back into the patient, where they are no longer primed for destroying the body's cells by errant immune cells, since those are all dead. Thus the immune system is repopulated.

The advantage of this therapy is that because it is autologous (same source), there is no need to find a matching donor and there is no risk of graft vs. host disease (GvHD). However, any therapy that kills off the entire immune system, however briefly, leaves the patient vulnerable to opportunistic infection. Additionally, because the "old guard" is gone, the immune system's memory may very well be gone with it if the memory cells have been killed, meaning that all the vaccinations and prior infections the patient had before chemotherapy may be rendered useless and re-vaccinating may be less efficient due to age or the stress endured by the body. Make no mistake: even though it uses rather advanced immunological and stem cell biological knowledge, this technique is a very blunt instrument. Research is being done to develop methods by which the immune memory can be preserved or replenished after therapy.  &gt;Research is being done to develop methods by which the immune memory can be preserved or replenished after therapy.

This seems counter-intuitive since the entire point of the procedure is to remove the immune system's memory and wipe the slate clean. If they could selective remove and preserve different aspects of the immune system's memory, then couldn't they also find ways to selective remove the undesired portions as well? Wouldn't this negate the entire need to wipe the slate clean? Possibly! Good thinking! I think a few autoimmune diseases use this technique A guy in my family has Chronic Inflammatory Demyleanating Polyneuropathy (no way I spelled all that right). I hope this leads to some good news for his condition! &gt; Chronic Inflammatory Demyleanating Polyneuropathy

Almost perfect. It's Demyelinating, but that's just a nit-pick. My daughter has this. This treatment works to put CIDP into remission. Please let your family member know about HSCT. if you want, there is a Facebook group for a specific trial in Chicago (northwestern university) being done by Dr Richard Burt. There is a lot of info there and of course people who have gone through HSCT. they are in remission. CIDP can be a nasty disease but there is hope! My sister had this procedure done when her stage 4, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma came back this year, and part of her treatment was chemo that destroyed her immune system.  From what I understand by what she reiterated to me from her oncologists is that this chemo treatment actually destroys bone marrow stem cells, which the sole purpose of these stem cells is to produce bone marrow.  Bone marrow of course, being the thing that allows for an immune system.

Before she started chemo, they gave her a drug that significantly increased her bone marrow stem cell production.  Then they essentially gave her a blood transfusion and filtered out these stem cells, since they are significantly larger than other cells.  They put them on ice and then she started chemo.  

When her chemo treatment was complete, they reintroduced her own stem cells back into her blood stream, and her body began producing bone marrow and white blood cells.  It's literally a new immune system.  

She has to get re-immunized for everything and for the first few weeks, her immune system was actually weaker than a new born baby's would be.  I jokingly implied that she should start eating her boogers.  Haha.

This procedure is fairly new I think, but it is absolutely incredible.  I'm also very happy to say that after chemo and radiation, she once again has no evidence of disease.

Fuck cancer.  What's the survival rate of getting the chemo? 22/24 so far. But who really knows what happened to the other two. Maybe they got superpowers.  &gt; Two patients who experienced grade 5 AEs [adverse effects] died. One death was related to MS progression more than 2 years after transplant... The second individual had preexisting asthma... she died more than 3 years after HCT from worsening asthma.

From /u/yetanothercfcgrunt 's comment above
 Patient with MS here. I've been on an interferon called avonex for 7 years, and have had great success. Link to medicine: http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-13453-9216/avonex-im/interferonbeta1a-injection/details. It's a once weekly injection, that basically gives your immune system something to attack. In this case, it is basically like giving yourself the flu for a 24 hour period. I'm not sure I would ever consider completely wiping out my immune system with chemo, it seems like that would have incredible dire consequences for your body long-term. There are lots of promising studies being done with stem-cell regeneration and other therapies. In the past couple years, there's also been a very large increase in medications available, especially by Biogen. Chemo seems like a last resort, and maybe it would be right for some people with really nowhere else to turn in terms of treatment.  Have you gotten to the oral medications? My mom's legs used to be covered in scar tissue from her Rebif, and she jumped onto the oral medication bandwagon as soon as trials opened. Now instead of an injector and a refrigerated bag of vials she just has a personal-notepad sized case with a few pills in it. And I can't even remember when her last relapse was. It is amazing how quickly the tide is turning on MS treatment. I was on avonex for a while. The episodes blasted right through it and the side effects were horrendous for me. We are all different.  If 20/24 is 0.833 and 21/24 is 0.875... where does the 86% figure come from? 19/22 and 20/22 round to 86% and 91%. The title and the article say 24 patients. Why are you using 22 for your calculations? Because 2 of them probably died.

edit: or they were just removed from the study for other reasons. That was not the answer I was looking for.. :l Oh :( You're right:

&gt;Two patients who experienced grade 5 AEs died. One death was related to MS progression more than 2 years after transplant; the patients condition had been stable until meeting the study end point owing to loss of neurologic function (increased EDSS score) at 1.6 years. No other cause for loss of neurologic function was identified. The second individual had preexisting asthma; although she was evaluated and approved by pulmonary medicine physicians for transplant, she died more than 3 years after HCT from worsening asthma. She had met the study end point earlier at 5 months after HCT owing to clinical relapse in the setting of aseptic meningitis after receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. If they died then certainly they would count against the "not in remission" and "definitely showing signs of the disease" groups, no? Would be like me shooting 10 rabbits, half of them dying, and then saying 5 out of 5 remaining rabbits didn't die. Unless they didn't die of cancer. These people had their immune systems destroyed, I would imagine they would be at incredible risk, not to mention any other conditions they may have had simultaneously while in the trial. Well they both died after the study ended. 

&gt;One death was related to MS progression more than 2 years after transplant; the patients condition had been stable until meeting the study end point owing to loss of neurologic function (increased EDSS score) at 1.6 years. 

&gt;The second individual had preexisting asthma; although she was evaluated and approved by pulmonary medicine physicians for transplant, she died more than 3 years after HCT from worsening asthma.

[From the study](http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2084840) By year 3, 1 subject died and 1 subject terminated the trial. That might be why they use 22 instead of 24. I'm sure this will never see the light of day on reddit and remain at the bottom of the comment section but... 

My mother has MS and it is so tough slowly watching her mobility/mind slip away from her.     

Imagine a 50 year old woman who can hardly walk let alone tie her flippin shoes. As a grown man this is one of the only reasons I cry at night. It's so tough having to explain to my child why "nanny" can't keep up like her other grandmother. 

Don't take the little things for granted people.   wife has MS, not primary progressive, and with her limited symptoms I'm not sure how keen she would be on nuking her system, even knowing it would help in the long. It's certainly interesting though and I guess if I was diagnosed with PP MS, I'd probably be more open to it before I started losing functionality. My uncle has progressive MS and is currently unable to move any part of his body but his head and tongue.  The end result of this disease is horrible. My mother has multiple sclerosis, and I never dreamed we would see the day that we would be even this close to a cure.

I can't describe how happy and hopeful I am for this. I'd temper your expectations unless she has relapsing-remitting MS. My mother has secondary progressive and as thrilled as I am that we're getting **somewhere** with MS, it hurts to know that most treatments, through the nature of clinical trials and the current inability to reverse the disease, are probably too late for many. My father had a version of this procedure done around 1997 in Seattle (I believe the researchers were with UW) at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to treat his Chronic-Progressive MS. They harvested stem cells from his bone marrow and then gave him high does chemo before reintroducing the stem cells back into his blood stream. A stem-cell transplant, and as far as I can tell from the article, it is the exact same procedure described here.

The process was very arduous due to chemo sickness, and since the patients were housed nearby each other we learned that several of the patients died as a result of complications from being immuno-suppressed (they got infections). As described in the article, insurance refused any coverage and my parents paid $145k out of pocket to try to save my dad from MS.

Now, I don't want to discourage anyone with MS, like many others I am hopeful that someday MS can be completely cured. In my father's case, after initially appearing to have had a halt in new symptoms and plaque sites, after several years his disease returned and progressed, eventually leaving him functionally a quadriplegic. He died in 2009 (12 years or so post procedure) from Leukemia that may have been brought on by the chemo treatments he received. In general, for a man with Chronic-Progressive MS, he lived longer than average with his diagnosis, but the stem-cell transplant did not cure him.

My point in relating this personal (and anecdotal story) is just to say that this procedure has been around at least a decade before this study, Also, this is a small study and over a short period of time. Hopefully with more research it can lead to an actual cure for MS, but don't forget, much more work probably needs to go into it for that to become a reality.

EDIT: Article about research at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center my father was a part of:

http://quest.fhcrc.org/articles/2003/03/autoimmune.html 29yr old male with RRMS here. These are amazing news i think. This may sound stupid, but even though I have benign MS symptoms (nubness and neuropathic pain almost all over my body, I still can do sports etc.), the symptoms, in a way i never thought of, destroyed my life by worsening my fine motoric skills and made it impossible for me to continue what I worked for my entire life (beeing a musician, playing guitar). I'm fine with what i got for now (I mean it's still life, greatest gift recieved ever) but I hope future therapies will bring relief for more people suffering.

I would consider reformating my immune system even though long term results are fairly unknow, but life is what happens right now. It's all that matters. I wish you all the best. My friends father has ms, and I've watched it ruin his life. No body wants to change their fathers diapers when he is barely 50. I wonder if the treatment is less likely to succeed when the patient is older. This treatment stops progression, but myelin regenerates very slowly, so recovery isn't great. Once MS stops being in the inflammatory phase (and goes into a progressive phase) the procedure does not work. Basically, you need to do this procedure before the nerves are completely destroyed. [Here's a good video with the doctor that does this procedure in the USA.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msYTOSo4jZo&amp;feature=channel) Or their wife's when she's in her 30's.  As someone who has recently been diagnosed with MS, this is really good news! February will be my sixth year diagnoseaversary (official diagnosis, it took about two and a half years to get).  I was on a daily shot for five years, a three times a week shot for about six months, and now am on an oral med.  My mind was blown when orals meds started coming out...and now there's this, which my doc brought up at my last appointment.  If I were living with this a couple decades ago, I'd be pretty much out of luck.  While I know that there's still a lot of unknown, hearing stuff that's so promising thus far gives me hope that in my lifetime, scientists will figure out how to make my body stop being an asshole to itself. Hi guys. I'm a second year medical student who has some prior experience with some of this stuff. I'm by no means an expert, but I'd love to lay some things out there for anyone who is interested!

**How/why Does This Work:**
Very briefly, there is a portion of your immune system that is termed the "adaptive immune system." It is called this because it responds ("adapts") to infectious invaders in a way unique to each invader. For example, certain types defenses would be better to develop and use against a strep throat infection (IgA antibodies for the curious) vs others that would be better to use against a leprosy infection (CD8 cell-mediated cytotoxicity for the curious).
Your adaptive immune system is the part of the immune system that orchestrates a unique response to each different foreign invader your body encounters, and very importantly, **it remembers how it responded**. By remembering how it responded to a certain invader in the past, the adaptive immune system makes sure to keep that type of response in "stockpile" so that if your body ever encounters that same invader again, your body can fight back really strongly from the get go. **This is why you generally don't get infected with the same pathogen more than once,** with some exceptions of course. This is also how vaccinations prevent/lower the intensity of future infection.

*Why does this matter for autoimmune diseases like MS?*
The theory is that in autoimmune diseases, your adaptive immune system, for whatever reason, has developed a specific weapon against one of your normal tissues in your own body. Your adaptive immune system "thinks" it has a constant infection on its hands, and is trying to eliminate it. So really, your adaptive immune system has made a huge mistake and the patient has to deal with a terrible disease.  

*Why does your adaptive immune system develop an immune response against your own tissue in the first place?*
There are several theories for this, but suffice to say that **something at some point in time pushed your adaptive immune system into an error in which it targets your own tissues. Because the adaptive immune system always remembers what it has targetted in the past, from the point of the error onwards, it will always recognize the targetted tissue as an enemy to destroy**

*The effect of chemo and bone marrow transplant (BMT)*
Basically, chemo drugs are used to **destroy the entirety of your immune system. This means that all "memory" of past infections and "stockpiles" of weapons uniquely crafted for each invader are destroyed because the cells that functioned as this memory/stockpile are destroyed.** This means that any "memory" your adaptive immune system had about targeting your tissues as an enemy is also gone! **So, just like many of you have aptly said, this can be conceptualized as an analogy of restarting your computer when its acting funky.** Now, this obviously has its own host of risks and things. For example, any "memory" of vaccinations or past infections has also been erased, so you need to completely re-immunize these patients. Additionally, during the process of the chemoablation therapy and subsequent BMT, the physician has basically made the patient have a non-existent immune system, which is for obvious reasons a very risky thing to do. **However, as many of these autoimmune diseases are so debilitating, many patients consider the risks to be well worth the potential rewards.**

**Others Using this Therapy to Great Success:**
Similar to Dr. Nash in this article, Dr. Burt at Northwestern University's Division of Immunotherapy for Autoimmune Diseases (DIAD) in Chicago has made some really exciting progress in this field, and has treated patients of many different autoimmune diseases with this therapy.
Some of the diseases being treated with this research: **MS, Crohn's Disease, Scleroderma, Lupus (SLE), Diabetes Mellitus Type I.** Website for the interested:
http://www.stemcell-immunotherapy.org/index.html

**Patient Perspective Success Stories:**
http://www.stemcell-immunotherapy.org/pub_vid_edwin.html

Hope this was at all helpful to anyone who is curious about this stuff. Sorry that I was not "very brief" as I Initially stated I would be.

**Edit for readers with MS or with loved ones with MS:** Dr. Richard Burt of DIAD at Northwestern University is currently performing a large scale Randomized Control Trial with this sort of procedure as a treatment for MS. I think is about 70% complete and the team is looking for more patients. Please look into it if you think you may at all be interested.
http://www.stemcell-immunotherapy.org/index.html I have a very rare auto immune disease called Scleroderma also known as Systemic Sclerosis.  Stem Cell transplants have been shown to have very good results for putting it into remission and I am considering having it done myself.  FIghting insurance is probably the hardest part of the process....next to destroying your immune system.  My SO received a similar treatment up here in Canada. Absolutely life saving. Treatment was free! I've recently been diagnosed with MS and I've been reading a ton about this procedure. They unfortunately are only testing it in disabled people and it hasn't been considered an approved therapeutic treatment yet. My ex was evaluated by a foremost specialist to participate in this trial. She went to the University of Washington to apply. She ultimately was turned down because they thought she was too far progressed already.  Glad to see the Reddit community pays attention to real breakthroughs like this.  How do you get "86%" and "91%" out of a group of 24??  So basically, doctors tried turning it off and on again to fix the problem. 

Jokes aside, that is amazing progress in the neuroscience field. I'm not MS but I was diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma when I was 17 and had what they called an "autologous bone marrow transplant" basically donated to myself.  That was 25 years ago and I have been cancer free ever since.  
I wonder how similar the processes are. Extremely similar. With MS some hospitals perform myeloblative and some non-myeloblative. I'm taking a stab and guessing that you would have received a myeloblative protocol where your immune system was wiped 100% and caused you to need to be revaccinated? 

They were doing this with MS patients but some doctors now think that myelo is unnecessarily strong and that non-myelo achieves the same results in a less dangerous manner. This has seen the treatment related mortality rate drop considerably.

Congratulations on being cancer free for such a long time! Hopefully these results will be replicated for autoimmune patients undergoing the same treatment. Some patients from the phase I trials are 15 years out and still in remission. Thought I'd share this news that came out today. Could be potentially big in the treatment for MS. 

http://www.cnbc.com/id/102320954 I understand the need for antimicrobial medications and reducing risks of infections when you destroy a patient's immune system like this. But is this permanent? Or does your immune system eventually bounce back to the same strength as before the procedure? This is great news! Could this theoretically also work for other diseases that are autoimmune in origin?  As someone with MS, this is fantastic.  This is awesome news.  I have a friend who will be happy to see this.  I'm donating my stem cells in two weeks. The guy who's getting them is blasting his defective bone marrow with chemo and radiation and my slick little cells are gonna slither on in there and rebuild. The craziest part? Hes a guy and from that day forward, he's going to have female blood. Now that's kind of cool, right? co-workers husband did this in Texas IIRC. Prior to treatment he was stuck in a wheelchair, but now gets around with the assistance of crutches.  Science for the motherfucking win on this one! So I guess they tried turning it off and on again...

but seriously though, it looks like promising results with a high success rate. I'd like to see similar procedures done for other nasty diseases (AIDS?) Huh, so until now,  they hadn't tried turning it off and on again? Is this good news or should I rather not get my hopes up?   As with most things medical, it's good news BUT don't get your hopes up. It's great news, but the treatment is very risky and miserable, so unless you have a very aggressive case of MS, it's unlikely you'd want to undergo HSCT. And at this point very progressive forms aren't good candidates for the treatment. It's old news. This is far from a panacea. It is def good news. But it comes with a cost. The likelyhood of cancer later in life. But all progress is good progress. We're all bound to die of cancer eventually with or without this treatment.

In any case, time will surely make this procedure safer if it's found to be effective. What about this makes cancer likely?  The same procedure is used to *treat* blood cancers. The meds or radiation used to treat cancers (better read as remission; see aside below) are cancer causing and the long term complication is developing cancer of a different kind due to the treatment. 

Aside: Nobody has ever been cured of cancer or treated. Eliminating cancer or receiving treatment for it is a statistical calculation based on what is most likely to survive if subjected to a lethal drug/radiation. In the simplest of terms. Is there more of you or the cancer?  If the disease is well localized then treatment methods can be selected that target the specific area with less collateral damage to the rest of the body and organ systems. Remission is just the ability/or inability of the diagnostic markers/methods to detect any further signs of the disease. 

Leaps and bounds have been made in detection and management both of MS and cancers. The question that needs to be asked and scrutinized is whether the form of MS that one is suffering from more dangerous to long term health and quality of life or the cancer that can potentially manifest in the future from such treatment. 

Edit: format [deleted] Bartlett 2016! paging Josh, Sam, CJ and Toby ! Need to make this happen. Bone marrow transplant is NOT a thing to do lightly  we know, Will Smith told us.
 Am I missing something here? If there are 24 patients, how can 86% be in remission:

21/24 is 87.5%
20/24 is 83.3%

wat... This is more confusing than my lit teacher's test curve. http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2rrphm/24_multiple_sclerosis_patients_had_their_immune/cniv3rt

That comment and the parent comments explain what happened fairly well. Wish my cousin was alive for this. I have ankylosing spondylitis(autoimmune disease), I wonder if this would work to cure it. Question.  So if we were to figure out a way to rebuild the immune system faster (days or weeks...not sure the feasibility of this) would we have a sure fire method to combat autoimmune disorders using this approach? No. First of all, it's not a 100% pure reset. A number of long-term plasma cells survive, and they're frequently still pathogenic.

Some autoimmune diseases respond extremely well to this. Other's don't. ha basically re-formatting your immune system. interesting approach for sure. The tried and true method of factory resetting always works! From phones to our immune system..  [deleted] or hookworm therapy For those curious about the 84% from 24. They were likely counting eligible participants. 24 started, X amount completed or were eligible to count at the end of the study, 84% of those did not relapse. They likely had some qualifiers like "Don't drink/do drugs/smoke that could bring on remissions" so they could control somewhat. If you did that you were disqualified from counting.  glad to hear 21.84 of the 24 patients show no signs of disease progression My sister had this done. It was 10+ years ago at the University of Drexel. She was one of the few that it worked for  She cant take the heat and doesn't have as much energy as before but other than she is in excellent health.

Neighbor had it done at a hospital around Chicago about 2 years ago. Same story. Those percentages don't make any sense...
 like, 91% of 24? That is 21.84. The love of my life has ms at age 26 I'm 23 she has been the surgery after surgery and steroid after steroid I hope this can help us in the features she is relapse remitting ms so she walks fine etc at the moment but I'm scared for our future  Pardon my ignorance, but what other applications could this have? Is cystic fibrosis a plausible candidate for similar treatment? Did the consumption of non-fruits and non-veggies also increase? Statistics 101: Metrics that don't support the hypothesis are excluded. I thought 101 was don't lead the surveyed to an answer. Or do. Depending on how you're paid. &gt; Or do. Depending on how you're paid.

Perhaps, but the real question is what do you think, how did that affect your family back in 2005 when your brother was wrongfully shot? Do you think that was fair, or would you have changed that terrible incident?
 Metrics that don't support the hypothesis might be excluded from the conclusion, but they are kept in the data tables attached to be examined by fully reading the study.  On a side note, such a fact would likely be of note in the conclusion.  This is not a political study it seems but research. i'd guess not, meats and dessert are probably already served at portions small enough that the kids eat nearly all of that stuff as it is.  Only cheaper filler foods, like say a side of potatoes or cup of fruit salad, would have any room available for the quantities consumed to increase.  These are economists with PhD's writing an essay for a peer-reviewed journal. 

The article summarizing this cannot go into the details of their methodology due to time, but I guarantee you that this was covered and answered during the peer-review process before it ever got published because it is the first question anybody would ask. 

As for their methodology...

&gt;researchers measured fruit and vegetable waste by standing next to the trash cans and recording the number of servings of fruits and vegetables that each student consumed or threw away. They also measured whether or not each student ate at least one serving of fruits or vegetables.

While I'm sure it has everything to do with kids eating more food, I sincerely doubt that there was an increase of meats &amp; sweets in the garbage cans at schools where lunch came before recess. I went to the [full article](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743514004599) and as far as I can tell from the methods section they *only* looked at servings of fruit eaten and thrown away. They did not report any data regarding the main course or dessert. Students threw away 20% less when creepy men rifle through their trash. That's why you have a control experiment. Asking the important questions. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] You should try and be more creative in how you present said fruits and veggies. As a note, I'm in high school right now and our cafeteria has like, zero fruits. I have pizza or whatnot. Super unhealthy, but I go home and have home made smoothies, or get food at a local store for dinner thats made right there. I also sometimes grab sushi from the food store nearby, love it. I know I'm unhealthy, but my lunch diet makes it look much worse than it actually is. I'm probably the one that gave your kids all types of desserts and snacks and candy instead. [deleted] Is it common in the US for recess to be in the afternoon?

Recess was always in the morning for me growing up. 1st-4th grade we had 15 minutes in the morning, 15 minutes right after lunch, and a half hour in the afternoon that ended about an hour before the end of the day. 5th Grade we lost the morning recess. 6th Grade+ was middle-school. What does middle-school have?

I know in the UK we never really change our standard. 15-20 minutes in the morning (about starting 10:30-11:00 usually), and about 45 minutes to an hour for Lunch. Lunch consists of eating and being allowed to roam the playground. 6th Formers (16-18) often get a Sixth Form Centre as well which will have a coffee machine, chairs, TV maybe etc.  This applies until University. In the US, from my experience, once you hit middle school, there is no more recess, that's an elementary exclusive thing. SC here, once we hit 6th grade we also lost our recess, and we only had 25 mins for lunch (through 1-12th grade I believe)! That's.. sad! I grew up in Italy, in high school (14-18) we had two 20 mins recesses in the morning and almost 2 hours at lunch (officially 50 mins for lunch and 50 for play). Primary school kids usually have half an hour for recess. And that felt like just about enough.  I'd be pissed if 50 minutes were tacked on to my school day at 16-18. I had stuff to do like sports, clubs, jobs, etc. [deleted] Not sure about OP, but I started school at 8 and got out at 3:15. No recess with an ~45 minute lunch. Yep, mine was 8 to 3:15, no recess past elementary school and a 25 minute lunch. Mine is 7:25 to 2:25 with no recess and a 25 minute lunch. Our schools suck. I think we started at 7:30 and ended at 3:30.  By the time I graduated I just did not want to go to college.  I just wanted to mellow out and just work part time for a little while. But...but...having only afternoon classes in college is the best 7:15 - 2:30 for me in Ohio.  How long were y'all at the school? Primary until 4.30pm, I went to a semi-private high school where we'd stay until, 6pm but most of the afternoon was 'study time', where we were supposed to do homework but most of the time we'd just kill time with our friends. 
I think most high schools actually end at 1 or 2pm, before lunch, but kids still get a recess in the morning.  [deleted] That's a lot better than our high school. We had 8 periods between 8am-3pm, 4 minutes between each class and a 30 minute lunch. It was a cram to get from class to class and we often had to carry multiple course materials due to the lack of time to go back to our lockers. This was my schedule, except we didn't have lockers It's important to note that in the US, school typically starts before 8 am. High school often starts at 7. School is finished between 2 and 3 o'clock.
 [deleted] gotta condition us muricans for the 40 year 8-5 grind yeah, and somehow we still end up with poorer outcomes Yeah.  You wonder why kids in America complain about school.

Because we wake up early to go (like most, but still puts a drain on you), we sit in about 5 classes for an hour and a half (some require 10 minute breaks halfway, but many of my teachers just stopped teaching for 10 minutes and you still had to stay in the classroom) and have like 5 minutes to get to classes on the other end of the school.

You feel like you're stuck there because they place these ridiculous constraints on you and punish you when you can't walk to the other end of the school, get your shit, walk to the other and and down a flight of stairs to your other class in 5 minutes with 100 other people trying to do the same in your way. Just do what I did! Carry all your books with you at all times, and develop horrible life-long spinal problems! yup, I remember when I was in middle school and weighed my backpack.  I was 75 pounds (33kg for the metrically inclined) and my backpack was 40 pounds (17kg).  3 or 4 minutes (can't quite remember anymore) in between classes meant no locker time, so all books at all times. At my middle school, we couldn't carry backpacks to each of our classes (1999-2001).  You end up carrying big trapper keepers that look like they could brain an Antelope to death.

(I was in middle school in 2001ish) The standard for schools in Texas right now and a lot of the US and 7 classes where you have ~50 minutes of sitting usually with a 30 minute lunch somewhere in the middle. You might or might not have PE - In my district, most kids have PE 6th, 7th, and 9th grade, or if they are into sports, are in sports classes 8th - 12th grades. In my area it was a kindergarten-only deal. They even ended up replacing recess with gym class even for kindergarteners after a parent sued the district over their kid getting hurt. You lived a nightmare... When recess ends, that's when most kids start hating school.

That, and WAY too much homework, which isn't tailored to the kid at ALL. We had recess up until high school, where we called it "break". Always one in the morning, and one in the afternoon, along with lunch. PS I'm in Canada.  Same for my high school in California!  I went to a small private catholic school that went through 8th grade. Anyone 5th through 8th that wanted to sign up played softball in a league during recess in the afternoon. One of the few things I loved about growing up in a rural area and having three separate softball fields. Growing up in Texas, we stopped having recess/playtime in 6th grade (10-11 years old). I think lunch was around 30-35 minutes? My middle and high school schedules changed a bunch throughout the years. We didn't have any on middle school (6-8). We did have a gym class though.  Growing up in New York, Elem. (5-11) had lunch for 25 mins and recess for 20, Jr. High (12-14) had a period of lunch for 42 mins, and if it was warm outside you could go play on the sports field of you wanted around halfway through the period. High School (15-17) had a 41 min lunch period where you can go to the library. As a senior, it used to be open campus so they could leave during lunch, but that was ended because the principal thought everybody was doing drugs. Weird.  How many schools were like this?

I grew up in a small town which housed our prek-4th grade in elementary school, 6-8 in middle school, and 9-12 in the high school.

We were bussed 10 minutes away to another town for 5th grade.
This has been and is still going on.

Because somehow that's reasonable.

It was the worst thing ever. Wow. Through elementary school we got 30 minutes after lunch and that was it.  This is amazing! I teach 2nd grade in Texas. We get 15 minutes right after lunch. :( It's sad really. I keep them moving with "brain breaks". I'm starting to think Australian school kids have it awesome. Morning recess, lunch and afternoon recess is where it is at we never had afternoon recess (in Sydney in the 90s) but our lunches were an hour long so we had time to play sport Our recess (little lunch) and lunch were pretty much the same thing but had different durations. From what I've been reading, it sounds like US recess and lunch are something different. Or am I not understanding?  I'm Australian, So I'm probably wrong, But I think in the US the "lunch" is the food and the "recess" is the break, So in Australia, Lunch and recess happen simultaneously because we go on break and eat food, But in the US, you have lunch (In the cafeteria) then you go on break (in the school yard).

I think the study is saying that you should send the kids out to play, then bring them in and feed them right before class starts again.

Either way the Australian system still works better, You tell the kids they've got 30 minutes in the morning ('play lunch' as we called it) and 1 hour around midday and they can spend that how they please, playing or eating in whatever order they want.

Otherwise you run into issues with kids who are diabetic or fasting having to sit out of play time because they haven't been able to have a snack before play. Canada here, we have the same system except once in high school we call it a break instead of recess. 
How are you suppose to have an after lunch smoke if they don't give you a break? Poor U.S. kids In Saskatchewan we had 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the afternoon for recess through 8th grade (elementary school). Lunch break was an hour, although most students walked home for lunch.

High school we no longer got recess per se but there was 10 minutes between each class to get your books and get to the next classroom. it depends the grade and probably the school. when I was in grade school we'd have recess in the morning for a while, no food just outdoor play time. Then we'd have lunch but it was also mix with a recess/free time sort of thing. as soon as you finished eating you could go out and play until all of lunch time was done. the whole time is supposed to be devoted to lunch but instead of making the kids who finished sit around and watch the other eat, they're allowed to go outside and play until lunch hour is over. This seems to suggest though that you should not allow this to happen as kids dont even eat much becuase they just want to go outside and play and neglect a good chunk of their foods.  We had several recesses or breaks.  I think they are specifically talking about the break you get with lunch.  If you eat before play then obviously kids aren't going to eat much or eat well and just play as soon as possible. They took away recess in 4th grade for us.  We had one 10 minute break a day (other than lunch) and they took it away "to prepare for middle school".

Bitch, let me enjoy my fucking wonder years, fuck your scholastic nonsense [deleted] [deleted] Do children only go to recess immediately after lunch?? When I was in school, recess was an allotted time completely independent of lunch. It feels like an easy solution. We had both. Recess, then lunch time + lunch recess [deleted] [deleted] At mine, there was X amount of time for lunch and X amount of time for recess.

Recess never depended on finishing lunch. In fact, i'm pretty sure we went back to the classroom, covered a subject or whatever we were doing that day, *then* went out for recess.

I've never heard of being able to go out to recess whenever you finished lunch, if that were the case at my school I just wouldn't eat or eat as quick/little as possible.

 At my school they did it in two blocks.  30 minutes to eat, 30 minutes to play.  When grades 1-3 were eating lunch, grades 4-6 were out playing.  Then we'd switch places after 30 minutes.

If you were finished eating, you couldn't leave the lunchroom.  You just had to wait for the bell.   [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Yep same here. Block time was an 1hr and 15 min though. Napping was also an option...not that anyone ever did. Offer nap time for kindergartners and no one wants it. Don't offer nap time to high schoolers and they'll sleep anyway. But still, how many are going to stay in and finish all of their food when their group of friends just finished their food and ran outside for earlier recess?  Exactly. Now it's just the slow eaters having to choose between lunch and recess. Problem not solved.  there is no solution thats just how it is when you're slow.   As an Australian that sounds really weird. Schools here (at least the ones I know of) have no set eat/play times, once the bell rings they were free to do whatever and students would just eat while they were out playing. 

 What even the really young ones? Doesn't it get messy? Do you not get kids who just don't eat? Many 5 year olds won't eat lunch if you don't plonk it in front of them and make them eat. In most primary schools (in Australia) it differs, but mainly recess is a short break, for approximately 10-20 minutes, whilst lunch is longer, up to 50 mins-an hour, with 10 minutes in class time of eating. 

Bins are everywhere throughout the school, but the 10 minute eat lunch in class thing really forces everyone to eat some sandwiches before playing.  never had an 'eat in' part of lunch, have been to a fair few Australian schools.  Looks like it's time to teach kids to sit around and talk to each other for five minutes while their classmates finish eating.

You know, that seems like something we should already be doing. At my elementary school, we were punished for being too loud at lunch. A lunch room full of 500 1st through 8th graders, and we were punished for not talking softly enough for the teachers' tables standards. First, if we could not maintain our conversations with basically a low whisper, we had our talking privelages completely revoked. If we talked after that, we then had our recess revoked. That school sucked.  Seriously why the fuck do teacher make students talk softly and bitch when they get too loud. Like calm the fuck down and let students socialize. It's not about creating a bunch of students that get along. This is about creating an environment you can control. What better way than to get the group to do the punishing of those who get out of line for you?

My grade school invested in a loudness alarm. Looked like a stop light that had a ear-piercing sound go off. Green was for the proper volume of chatting. The yellow light would turn on when we were getting a bit too loud and then at red, we'd get the light and sound at the same time.

The first time it went off none of us students knew what to do. It was very surreal to see the thing in action. And then again when the school's principal would come in and yell back at us for getting too loud. I know many adults that I wish had better volume control, let alone kids.

Socializing is fine, but some students like to converse by yelling at people three feet away from them. Aside from being disruptive, this leads to many headaches. I never went to a school where the teachers ate with the students, so I can't really comment.  We generally had a combined lunch/recess. There is also the issue of lining up to be served lunch, if they don't bring their own. I remember when I went to a fairly large school. Lunch was 40 minutes. When you finished eating, you could go out to recess. The problem was, the kids that were first line had plenty of time to eat, then go out and play for 1/2 hour. The kids that were last in line had 10 minutes to eat and get back to class.
The pro was that everyone had a chance to finish lunch.The con was not everyone got to go out and play. If the times were reversed and recess came first, everyone would have been able to play, and not been able to finish lunch. Serve lunch half way through recess then. Mine had set times for both.  The kids were to adapt to the schedule, not the other way around.  You get a half hour for lunch and a half hour for recess. Plus, running around is going to work up an appetite. Eating a full meal before you run around will make you sick, just like swimming. I can't think of one reason lunch first is a good idea. Maybe some good points to bring up to the school board. At my middle school, half the class had lunch first and half had recess first, then you switched. I hated having recess first because it meant either I had to keep my paper lunch bag on the dirty ground or, if I was buying, make a mad dash to the cafeteria after because if the lines got long, I'd have 5min to eat after finally getting my food. A 20min lunch break when over 100 kids have only 2 lines to get lunch isn't enough. Just be glad you had recess in middle school Im pretty sure in my elementary/middle school we had 30 minutes for lunch and no recess at all I see what you're saying about the sack lunch, but you have to line up for hot lunch either way, so I'm not entirely sure why that's an added problem. I went to school in Australia. We didn't distinguish between eating and play time. Recess referred to the short 15-20 min break around 11:00 and lunch was the hour long break between about 13:00 and 14:00. You eat and play when you want to during those times. I would always finish my lunch and never went home starving. I had recess after lunch. They wouldn't let me go until I had finished eating all of it. It blows my mind why they don't do recess before lunch. As a kid all of my recesses were after lunch, and if I ate my full lunch then my stomach would hurt and I wouldn't feel like doing anything at recess. If I didn't eat all of it (in a rush to go out or whatever), I'd be ravenous by the time I came back in.  I think in my 4th grade we had gym immediately after lunch and I would have the same problems with me stomach. I just ended up hating gym. Yep! That's like my schedule in 9th grade. One of my friends would regularly puke due to physical exertion after eating - she just quit eating lunch. Pretty terrible.  [deleted] It confuses me too. 

It breaks up the day *so* much better too - you get a couple of lessons, then a break, then a couple more, then lunch, then a couple more and then it's home time. Keeps you awake and interested all day, and gives an opportunity for morning snacks or breakfast and toilet breaks whilst being able to be restrictive with passes otherwise. Grew up with the 'recess first' model. The afternoon was the longest stretch, and seemed to drag on forever. It's also the hottest part of the day (Australia, btw), and you're tired.

This system incidentally is perfect for cutting afternoon classes (or 'wagging/jigging' as we used to call it). School becomes gloriously tolerable once you start with that. Trespassing with a slurpee in hand, seeking shade from the searing afternoon sun (trespass shade is the coolest), smoking to impress the gothic chicks, failing horribly at hackey sack with mates. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] This makes a lot of sense but I'd take recess at any point in the day.  I'm a long term sub in a Maryland school, the first grade class I have has no recess at all :(  And people are baffled by rising rates of childhood obesity and attention/behavioral problems. I know, there are many more factors at work, but we can't tell kids how important physical activity is for long-term health, and then deny them the chance to engage therein. Then they act up, and we discipline and overmedicate them. It's not their fault; they are just nios trying to release their wiggles Exactly, I've tried to work 'educational play centers' (centers with blocks, dry erase board, Legos, etc) into the end of the day but the official schedule for the day doesn't really allow it unless I skip something else.  Honestly I feel like a lot of the kids in the school  (pre-k through 5, only grade with recess 'center' time is pre-k.  The school doesn't have an outdoor area/playground) who are labeled with behavior problems just need an outlet for all their energy.  Kids age 5-10 sitting for 7 hours without a break is just asking for trouble.   I think that's the first time I've seen a Nacho Libre reference on reddit.   That's awful. Sitting in a chair for 8hr with no break. Smh Especially with the boundless energy of a first grader... And as a six/seven year old. Seriously? Who in the right mind thinks 7-8 hours of school with no break for a seven year old is a good idea? Sure, and starting high school an hour later would result in kids being better-rested, thereby improving academic performance, but if we did that, how would we punish them for being young? My school district, for my last year in high school, actually flipflopped the middle school and high school start times. IIRC, that made middle school start at 7:00 and high school start at 9:00. The high school kids (don't know about middle school kids) basically revolted. There were a bunch of protests. People were mad about not being able to pick up their siblings from school, or not being able to work at their job, etc etc. It seems like a good idea but a lot of people were mad. I didn't care, but I also only took 5 classes that year instead of the typical 6 because I got a high school credit for algebra in middle school and didn't need an extra elective (took an extra math class instead) so I got out early almost every day anyway. They switched the times back the following year. It also sucks for kids in sports. Either having to miss more school to get on the bus, or practices going later. My high school got out later than most, so there was times the other team was already at the tennis courts when we got out of school.  We've had some delays because of weather this past week and it's amazing how much of a difference starting at 9:00 instead of 7:00 makes.  I understand the frustration, but the mentality of having a six and a half to seven hour school day with brutally long classes with only a 20-25 minute break needs to end.  I can say this has easily been my most productive week in a long time.

I think high schools need to adopt the college approach.  A full load should only be five or six classes, not seven like mine is.  And we should start later and only have or two classes a day.  It might be hard for some to adapt, but I think this would also be a great way to start putting more research into the "flip the classroom" model where the teacher has you learn at home via the Internet and you use class time to practice what you've learned. Has this been proven, or would kids just stay up an hour later since they don't get home until an hour later each day?  I find it doubtful that you are going to trick teenagers into being better rested by starting school later. I've seen studies that say yes, it really matters. Also its not just about hours of sleep but natural sleep cycles. I think the real question is who's dropping them off at school when their parents have to be at work at the same time. The bus, a bike, their own two feet? As a(n american) society we have created this trend of living far as fuck from everything and being terrified of letting our appropriately aged children think or act for themselves in any meaningful way. I was raised solely by my mother, worked half an hour from my school and always dropped me off on her way to work. When we would occasionally have late starts (at 9 am), it was hard for her to delay her work schedule. I couldn't afford a car either and the bus system did not serve the area I lived in. Thankfully, I was able to carpool with another student some days. I don't think it's always fair to make the criticism you have asserted, nor to assume that kids cant think for themselves. However, I agree that the system we have created of living far away from grocery stores (creating food deserts), schools, and cultiral centers is very unfortunate. I wish I could walk or bike more often to run errands!
 At first I thought how interesting but after clicking the link and seeing

&gt;This one trick boosts fruit &amp; vegetable consumption 54%

No Lunch ladies hate him! You won't believe what this one weird trick will do to your child's hunger! Hunger is the best spice After much trial and error, the best way that I found to lose weight is to eat the less appetizing foods first while you're the hungriest.

Vegetables till you're full -&gt; proteins -&gt; carbohydrates last.

Hot water helps to slow down the meal for the signals to reach the brain, and by the time you reach the carbs, you're not really famished.

Edit: I should clarify that the protein that I eat is egg whites, beans (fiber) (use an electric pressure cooker), and very lean, low-fat cuts of meat.

&gt;"Protein takes more energy for you to digest than refined carbohydrates, and also gives your body a feeling of satiety, says Dr. Hauser.

&gt;Low-carb diets have been shown to help some people lose weight.

&gt; But over the long term, too much protein and too few carbohydrates may not be the healthiest plan.
&gt; 
&gt; This kind of eating pattern has been linked to an increased risk of developing osteoporosis.
&gt; 
&gt; Thats because digesting protein releases acids into the bloodstream.
&gt; 
&gt; The body neutralizes these acids with calciumwhich can be pulled from bone if necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; Eating too much protein also makes the kidneys work harder.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myfitnesspal.android&amp;hl=en Are carbs usually the most appealing? Maybe it's because I come from an Asian household, but usually rice comes up as the least appetizing out of all. [deleted] Yeah, but the first thing they will eat will be the meat, bread and desert. If they don't have time for green beans before hitting the slide, they don't care. This is a very confusing title for an australian. Recess is the little 15 minute break you get to eat a small amount of food/run around in the morning. Lunch, then follows at about 1ish in Australian schools and there is no restriction on when you eat during that ~40 minute lunch period. That's how it worked at my schools in America (I went to 3 elementary schools, 2 in WA and one in CA) but the way recess and lunch are arranged varies greatly around the country.  American. When I was in elementary school, recess was thirty minutes and the children were usually taken outside. We could spend it how we wished, but most ran and played and stuff. It was also in the afternoon. Recess disappeared around 4th or 5th grade for us, although I think it was at the teacher's discretion. Should have a break in the AM, around lunch, and PM. Sure, multiple recesses are good. The point about lunch recess is that it needs to come prior to the meal.  Don't they just eat 54% more? I actually find that exercise makes me crave heal their food. It's a vicious cycle when I skip working out.  At my school (I'm a senior in high school btw) it is "required" that you grab a vegtable or fruit to go along with your lunch. Because the lunch lady will literally yell at you if you don't, everyone just grabs it and literally throws it right into the trash immediately after. There is a less than 5 second period where the student is holding the fruit/vegetable  before it lands directly in a trash bin. The school now can say "Students have taken all the fruit and vegtables!" while leaving out the fact that over 90% of it (at least) is being thrown away. Just wanted to let you adults know where your tax dollars are going, we're throwing them away because of laws and requirements.  I find this whole recess and lunch thing fascinating. In my country we don't get lunch at school, you just get break, where you do what you want and bring packed lunch or buy something from the tuck shop. For what age? It's often like you said for 14-18 year olds in high school, but this recess and lunch stuff is for kids under 10 in elementary.  For any age, the only places that serve lunch to kids are nursery schools (pre-schools) Can we get a study saying a 45minute nap for high schoolers will increase productivity, please? What happened in this thread? yeah, it makes sense that kids, or anyone, would seeks fruit after exercise, because they will want something that is both filling and hydrating. Having recess after lunch just makes kids less likely to exercise in general. Seriously, who is trying to play a competitive game right after eating a full meal? This is common sense shit right here.
 [deleted] Kids are hungier after expending physical energy? Science!

And obviously the child physcology motivation part which i have no understanding of. [deleted] "Junk food companies *hate* him!"

I can't tell if that tagline was a tongue-in-cheek reference to all those stupid ads, or if someone thought that was actually a good way to lead off the article, but yeah, it made me wince. I work childcare and all I got to say is that kids are so impulsive that they would rather go and play than eat. This makes so much sense that schools who are concerned with what the kids are eating and DONT follow this kind of policy look very stupid indeed.  I wasn't aware American schools had so few recesses. In Finland there was 15 minutes of recess for every hour taught. So in a day we could have a total 1 hour to 1.5 hours of recess. (15 minutes at a time) And it was emphasized that this time was spent outside. Typically no more than 90 minutes of teaching was allowed in a row. I've heard that we Americans have been plumbing Finland for your educational secrets. I guess frequent recess is just too inconvenient because I've never heard of it amid proposed reforms over here. What good is this research if schools do not implement it. All of my teachers since middle school always give papers that say adolescents perform better if they wake up later in the morning, but since elementary to high school the school district makes us wake up earlier than before.  &gt; What good is this research if schools do not implement it. All of my teachers since middle school always give papers that say adolescents perform better if they wake up later in the morning, but since elementary to high school the school district makes us wake up earlier than before.

That's because extracurricular activities considered essential for college, etc. force districts to end the school day earlier for more daylight hours.  I don't need light to make Djibouti jokes. Studying a few schools for a few days doesn't seem like the best kind of study to be used to make a case for making changes to school schedule structures around the country.  I know it's a small study, but what's the alternative?

"Well, better sit here and do nothing, assuming that what we've got it optimal." I remember when i was in elementary school in grade 5 or so they switched recess from after lunch to before lunch and no one was active becuase we were too hungry.  Take this for what it's worth, but if I'm being lazy I eat food that tastes good, usually sweet stuff. 

But if I'm out running or something when I get back I want no-nonsense good food such as chicken and vegetables. It drives me nuts that so many schools are cutting down recess more and more, justifying it with reducing time wasters/fund drains and ignoring information like this. Breaks improve productivity--it's almost like schools are modeling themselves after US business models that encourage head-in-the-sand employee policies. 

I wish schools could be better empowered to use recess to their advantage, in ways like this study shows--improve nutrition, exercise, productivity, focus...  [deleted] This seems like a no-brainer, the chances of my daughter picking recess over finishing her vegetables is around 100%. It'd be nice if they brought recess back to school so this could be useful. WillyVanilly said-

&gt; "My daughter is constantly coming home both hungry and with a lunch she barely touched because her school lets kids go recess as soon as they're done eating. She eats a few bites of the food she likes the most and heads outside as soon as possible. Pretty ridiculous to let 1st graders decide between when the meal is done and when time to play begins."

My response- Your daughter's school probably thought that was a good idea, because it helps fight obesity. All schools are on this "healthy" kick, where they give them food that have no salt, sugar, or calories and are now trying to starve them to prevent them from being obese.

**I think WillyVanilly's comment should not have been deleted because it was not a joke, meme, or was off topic because the subject was both about recess and lunch. And was also a controversial topic.** &gt;and are now trying to starve them to prevent them from being obese

 Taking away the fat, salt, and sugar isn't starving them, the kids are starving themselves by throwing away millions of dollars worth of healthy food. The part about fat, salt, and sugar was separate from the starving them part. The starving part was about letting the kids decide when to go to recess, and kids will always choose recess instead of eating so they won't eat much.

They're making it look voluntary. "Eat your peas and then you can go play"...works at home, but with hundreds of kids at a time? Agreed, horrible idea. Fruits and veggies also have water in them, which makes them taste better if you are thirsty. Wait...schools have recess AFTER lunch? That just sounds so weird to me.  Seems like it would be common sense to have recess first (basically time to eat a snack), then lunch instead of the other way around. recess is near the end of the day over in murrica, never quite understood that shit because sitting still for a whole day is unnatural for a kid.

fortunately we have ritalin!(unless a more potent "ADD" drug is used now) In Australia we always have recess, around 10:30. Then lunch at 12:30. Bit weird to hear that you can have lunch before recess. I always thought it was odd to have kids running around after they eat.

Sometimes I would not fill up at lunch just so I would not get a cramp when I ran around at recess. So let me get this straight, kids get tired and hungry at recess (playing and such) and will eat more of everything when their later lunch in served. That is not astounding to me. 

I bet if they measured total calories it would show that more were consumed if recess were held prior to lunch. It is normal human behavior.

What would be cool is if the study showed that kids who have lunch after recess make better dietary choice, that would be amazing. But that is not what this study shows. Unless a kid is overweight, kids should not diet and should eat till they're full. Its just that kids should be eating healthy food till they're full. Overweight kids can't eat healthy food until their full too? I guess what byurocks means is that overweight kids will most likely overeat. It doesn't matter if food is considered heathy or not when you consume more calories than you need, because then you will gain weight. Now vegetables are on average less calorie dense than other foods, but still it's possible to overeat. Your point is valid, and OP wasnt off the page with it either. Knowing how many calories you want is not equivalent to dieting.  Teaching children healthy portions is important. school cannot know healthy portions because they do not know calorie expenditure of the kids, which differ significantly between children. There's definitely a healthy window though.  calorie expenditure is very different between a kid that constantly runs everywhere and one that prefers to spend his break sitting and reading a book. the window would have to be either very wide or run at expense of some group. You greatly overestimate the calories burned via exercise.  It would also be interesting to see how students performed in classes after lunch-&gt;recess vs recess-&gt;lunch. Were students distracted by hunger directly after recess, or lethargic directly after lunch? Are you for real? Do you do a lot of working out? The LAST thing I want to do after a somewhat intense workout is sit down and eat a bunch of heavy food. If I were offered this, I would almost certainly eat less overall. [deleted] Where'd you live? That's sorta depressing I grew up in central kentucky how long were your lunches? 20min in high school 35 in middle and elementary  wow in Australia our lunches are an 1 hour long Did you go to school in prison or something? [Here are a few tales from my old school.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1wzen4/whats_something_that_a_teacher_took_from_you_in/cf733su) That's sorta depressing Didn't you guys have fried chicken for recess?  That was in our blood. I went to school in Georgia. We never had recess either. How often we went outside to the playground depended on how the teacher was feeling that day. I always thought that this was normal practice so I never questioned it.  Where in ga?  Did you at least have PE? Kids, especially boys, need time to during the day to get their energy out. It's no wonder boys are doing worse in school these days, with school systems cutting back on recess.  My Catholic school did recess for K-2 only. It was 15 minutes. PE was 2x per week other than that. When I was in eighth grade we got a new pastor (head priest) and he made the principal give all grades recess, but the teachers didn't let us do anything fun like run so we just stood in our school parking lot (we couldn't go anywhere else)  for 10 minutes every day. 

 Way throw gender in there where it's completely unrelated to the topic. No, it's not unrelated. It's a fact that boys have a harder time sitting still and paying attention for long periods. This is exacerbated when they are denied recess. Recess is important for all kids, but a lack of physical activity affects boys more than girls.  I'm kind of interested, do you have a source on that? [Here's an article on the subject of what boys need in school](http://www.earlychildhoodnews.com/earlychildhood/article_view.aspx?ArticleID=414) with a section on physical activity and play time. Basically, male brains develop slower than female brains and play (which aids brain development) is more crucial for boys since it helps them overcome their genetic disadvantage. Take that away and boys have a much harder time keeping up in school.  &gt;  It's a fact

Do you have a source for this? (serious, I enjoy being able to understand gender differences without people going all "feminazi" about it) [Here's one article on the subject](http://www.earlychildhoodnews.com/earlychildhood/article_view.aspx?ArticleID=414). There are references at the bottom if you want to do some more reading. Basically, boys need more physical activity for a variety of reasons, mostly due to differences in brain chemistry and development.  Cool, thanks! I have a daughter, but if I ever have a boy I can fold this knowledge into my approach :-)  My mom's a teacher and I agree. After recess kids are tired enough to at least not disrupt the class. It's not just a matter of being tired and not disrupting class, play time is crucial for all kids, especially boys. Playing, especially in groups, aids both social skills and brain development. Since male brains develop slower than female brains, play time is even more crucial for males since it helps them overcome their genetic disadvantage. It's interesting stuff actually, and it's part of the reason why boys are doing worse in school these days.  Yes, that is true! Social skills are very important. As is playing. Video games have been shown to develop parts of the brain too I think, but nothing beats actively going out to play. Especially adventure or search games, which were my favorite when I was little. I hope they find a way to fix things so boys do better in school again.  &gt; Video games have been shown to develop parts of the brain too I think, but nothing beats actively going out to play. Especially adventure or search games, which were my favorite when I was little.

Yep. I don't want to sound like one of those old people, but I sort of feel bad for kids today. We had video games when I was a kid, but we didn't play them much. I didn't have my first console until I was in the fourth grade and I don't remember playing many games before that. There's nothing like getting a couple of the neighbor kids together, going into the woods and having a full day of exploration and adventure. I don't know if a lot of kids do this anymore. Of course I didn't grow up in an urban environment (where we lived was about halfway between suburb and rural) so maybe I'm a little biased. 

&gt; I hope they find a way to fix things so boys do better in school again.

We just need to get more men into elementary school teaching. It's about as simple as that, yet for some reason male elementary school teachers are disappearing. I never had one, my first male teacher was in 5th grade. Our current system was set up and is run by women, who don't seem to understand what boys need and would rather treat them as defective girls.  One theory on why male teachers are disappearing because they fear being accused of pedophilia or sexual harassment. That, and teachers don't always get the best salary in comparison to other positions. My first male teacher I had in fourth grade. Mainly math teachers were male ones for me, and they always taught most effectively (although I'm female) and were on top of that hilarious! I think kids should have a variety of teachers to prepare them for work in the future. They'll meet a lot of people they have to work with.   Everyone is asking for a source and I'm just sitting here thinking it's common sense. Better hurry before the retard police questions your sanity over a simple/legitimate observation.  I know, it doesn't take much observation to see that young boys have a greater need for physical activity than girls. I wonder if any of these people have spent time with young people. The differences are pretty clear, but I don't mind people being skeptical. 

edit: A lot of people will say the differences are a result of cultural expectations and biases, but that's nonsense as well. The same differences have been seen in apes. Male apes prefer more aggressive and physical play (they prefer toy cars, and other things that move and can be smashed) and female apes prefer more mellow, less physical and aggressive toys like dolls. Some people just refuse to accept that the differences between males and females extend beyond genitalia.  Pretty sure *all* little kids need exercise, end of story.

Edit: as in why would it matter in a pre-pubescent little body whether you're male or female with regards to exercise? Little kids need exercise regardless of their sex. Some need it more then others though. He is right, boys typically do have a harder time behaving and sitting still in class then girls. Don't be silly we're all equal in every way. Doubly equal in every way that supports my agenda. Yes, all kids need exercise. I even said that, if you look closely. But that's not the end of the story. Boys have a harder time sitting still and paying attention than girls to begin with, and losing recess makes it even worse. What part of this aren't you understanding?  The part where both genders aren't identical.  Which is why he said especially, there have been dozens of peer reviewed studies showing that boys do significantly worse than girls if they don't get enough recess and the gap is smaller if they get more. Whether this is societal or biological is another issue but that is a moot point here  "end of story" my opinion is the only opinion worth having, your facts can fuck off. 

Urgh. It's not really though - lack or removal of recess will affect young boys a lot worse than girls. Forgive me, I have no idea how things work in the US.

When you say you got no recess, what happened at lunch?

In the UK, in my area at least, we generally got 15 mins between the start of the day and lunch time. Then 1 hour for lunch time. 

In my younger years (before secondary school) lunch time was set out where the first half an hour was for people who got school provided food, the second half an hour was for people who came with their own food. I always had my own food, we were supposed to make our way into the canteen to eat it but I generally ignored that rule and snacked my way through lunch time.

Does lunchtime not count as 'recess' in the US? Or is it a similar system to what I've described.  In Elementary School (Grades 1-6) we had a 45 min lunch and gym class where we would get to play a few games for about 45min a day. 

In middle school (grades 7-9) we got a 35 minute lunch with a 15 minute "Snack Break" late afternoon. We had gym class but it really just consisted of doing sit ups, push ups and sometime dodge-ball but we had tests. Once, for a whole year, we literally didn't do anything but sit in a room. 

Highschool (Grade 10-12) a student had to sign up for gym and we only got 20min for lunch. But at that point it really didn't matter.

I guess since we had a gym class and they used that in place of recess but most of the time it was highly structured and was graded which is a little different. 

In answer to your question Lunch is separate from recess.  Our lunchtime in the US is sitting inside in a cafeteria. We had recess separately once or twice a week. I went to school in Germany until third grade where we had lunch recess, or recess and lunch outdoors.  Logistics.  Play-wash-eat = Nightmare. It ends up being the same - wash-eat-play-wash/water fountain.  [Direct link to the journal article](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2091305)

This was an observational cohort study, not a randomized controlled study.  As the journal article states:

&gt;Because this is an observational cohort without a control group, inferences about causal effects of HCST cannot be made. Definitive conclusions will require a randomized trial; however, this analysis provides the rationale, appropriate patient selection, and therapeutic approach for a randomized study.

Other limitations (as reported by the study) include the fact that many of the patients were compassionate use patients, so they did not directly follow the protocol.  Additionally, longer term data (&gt;4 years) was not available for many of the patients.

To summarize: This is a preliminary study with many limitations.  However, it is promising, and will lead in well to a larger, more controlled study that is being planned.  It is exciting news, but this doesn't mean we have cured MS.  It appears like it may be effective in treating some types of MS, but it is too early to tell.  More research is needed. Thanks for posting these limitations.  One thing I can't help but note is that these, unlike for many articles which reach the front page, are just limitations as opposed to trial ruining issues.  This certainly does hold promise.   Serious question: so is the goal here to determine if this is worth starting a randomized, controlled study in the future? I guess I wonder why they wouldn't *start* with such a trial, but I also don't know a lot about scientific medical trials.

I also wonder if more data on everyone who deals with relapse-remitting MS (or anything, really) would make these trials more authoritative, if we could better surmise a 'control group' of everyone else with the condition, because we're tracking their progress more? I get that that doesn't replace a RCT but just one of those "more data can help us" things. This was a compassionate use case meaning the patients weren't in good shape. Because of this fact the researchers/physicians were allowed to give these patients a bone marrow transplant in the hopes that it could essentially "reset" the immune system and rid the patients of their disease. It was a long shot but it worked (which is fantastic). 

That being said bone marrow transplants are risky procedures and you would never prescribe one unless you had a good reason to believe that it work. Why? Because the patient could die. Given that MS patients live close to a normal life expectancy it could be argued that such drastic, very experimental procedures aren't ethical since the risk:reward was heavily skewed toward the risk side of the spectrum. Since we know now this might actually work in patients (to be confirmed by a placebo-controlled clinical trial) that ratio is now skewed the other way. But if a bunch of patients died and no one had their MS cured we'd likely be crucifying these researchers/clinicians.  Those advocating this procedure claim that this non-myeoablative HSCT protocol is far safer than previously practiced forms of HSCT. Indeed, of the ~150 subjects in this study, none of them died. This indicates that the odds of death given the modern protocol are certainly less than 1-in-50, and may actually be 1-in-250 or better. We won't really know just how risky it really is until we start getting bigger numbers of participants under the new protocols, but with the current data it doesn't look like it's really all that bad.

*edit: 1-in-X odds of death, not odds of survival forgive me if I'm misunderstanding, but isn't a 1-in-50 survival rate better than a 1-in-250 rate? Did you perhaps mean the odds of death? Others may respond better, but this usually works this way because you need a high level of justification in order to ethically begin medically intervening with patients with serious diseases like MS. 

Small centers may have been attempting experimental treatments which gave us this data, but in order for an IRB to justify giving many people this intervention, there needs to be a number of people who believe it will work. True, and also funding. It may sound backward, but funding is hard to get without results to begin with. This is especially true because the trial used stem cells. The cost per patient was likely very high  And if it works it's not going to require a prescription for life so there's  the profitability issue. Maybe it would help explain why this is done first if you think about the control group. Suppose we didn't have this evidence that there's something possibly going on here with stem cell treatment. 

Would you support taking a group of patients with a serious condition like MS and giving them the control or sham treatment? What if you had to control for the possibility that wiping out the patients immune system was somehow the only responsible effect and not the implanted cells? Would you be comfortable taking a few hundred people and subjecting them to that without any knowledge or preliminary data supporting the fact that at least the experimental group receiving the transplant is likely to benefit, and thus improve the greater population of MS patients? 

In the same aspect is the following ethical question. Is it ethical to give a group of people ([sex industry workers in thailand or something](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_144)) an experimental vaccine to HIV and another group of people an injection of nothing while they still have the assumption of being vaccinated against HIV? Or would you rather just give a large group of people the vaccine first to see if it potentially did anything. If you look at how drugs are tested for any serious disease where the current treatment is better than nothing, they are given to a) patients who are not eligible for or have failed 'standard' treatments, b) given in addition to standard treatments to see if there's an incremental benefit over established survival times, and/or c) they are given instead of current drugs, but the control group is a so-called 'positive control', i.e., the control group is given the current standard treatment instead of nothing. Option c allows you to establish whether the new treatment is worse than the current treatment (in which case why bother) or non-inferior, i.e., about as good as standard (in which case some patients might benefit from having more options) or better than standard of care. You don't have to take people with serious illness and deprive them of treatment to establish whether a new treatment is worth pursuing.

Crossover trials, as mentioned by /u/istara, are also an option. Expense is a big part. Good scientists always do pilot experiments first to see if something is worth investing their time in. If you commit all of your resources to something that you have no idea about the success chance of, you could end up setting yourself back a lot of your grant funding. But if you start with lots of smaller sized experiments, can see invest your resources into the ones that show promise, so you aren't shooting an arrow into the dark. In order to be cleared to do studies on human subjects you need to do a lot of leg work from the beginning. Like A LOT of leg work. My buddy did research in a psychology department on perception, nothing intense at all. but they would re use the same flyer for multiple studies to get people to come out because even the flyer that said they were looking for people for a study had to be approved by the American Psychological Association.  Fuck, a friend of my family is dying from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis

Sadly it seems this will not help him. It's breaking my heart to see him get worse and worse every time I see him..
 My uncle lived with it for 28 years. Hopefully your friend doesnt dwindle, but lives. :)  I'm glad to hear your uncle lived with it for so long. My friend already lost the use of one arm and the other only has months. I don't think he expects to see 2016, but we are all hoping for the best. Cherish the time you have, don't mourn the time you don't. Yes, I agree. There can be room for both, however. Im not saying it was easy for him or the family, but there's still time with him, at the very least. Good luck. Cohort or not... I mean it's not like people with MS randomly become cured. Do you know why they didn't perform an RCT right off the bat? Seems like if you're messing around with expensive, possibly harmful, possibly very beneficial therapeutics like chemotherapy and stem cells you should do the best study you can straight away, especially given that they already seemed to use fairly high numbers.  Generally before planning and performing a RCT you need something called equipoise in the scientific community. This means a reasonable number of people think it will work and some won't. The IRB process and design is much more intense for an RCTs as well, so generally speaking almost any "new" treatment would not go straight to RCT. There's also the added benefit of multiple publications and meetings for the authors. Money probably played a part. Observational studies are cheaper to run than a complex RCT. The first studies of a new treatment (Phase 1/2) are always designed to establish safety and feasibility. Of course they are collecting data on how patients fare after treatment, but early phase trials usually don't enroll enough people to determine "success"-- they only enroll enough people to determine safety. Note that the paper being discussed here is an observational cohort study, *NOT* an early phase safety trial, but I wanted to answer your question of "why not go straight to the best trial design?".  

For more critical discussion about this particular paper, there is also an accompanying editorial in JAMA. (subscriber only) Hard to blind chemotherapy I guess? I dunno this is an observational study and not my forte'. A *lot* of different labs and research facilities collaborated on HALT (similar project). I worked on the project doing functional T-cell assays and we did use control groups.But that was easy, I just have to go downstairs to get some healthy donor cells from the deep freeze. That's very true. It's like sex. There are no double blind trials on sexual effects. Would a similar treatment benefit those with lupus? I have lupus so I'd like to know. As someone who has a mother dealing with MS, it's so heartening to see progress being made. She was diagnosed 12 years ago and they caught it extremely early, so while she's still starting to have some issues (notably memory/cognitive), this type of stuff brings a lot of hope to the situation. I'm really praying that they find a cure in my lifetime, even if it doesn't help my mother.  You can't do controls in a bone marrow transplant.  It's risky enough as it is to do the procedure.  I don't think this is a full bone marrow transplant.  It looks like they do the low dose chemo to weaken them, and then do the HSC infusion.  I'm not sure how that effect it.

From their [study design](http://www.stemcell-immunotherapy.com/pdfs/MIST_Design.pdf), it looks like in their RCT trial, the control will be just standard treatments.  However, I don't have a very large immuno background (I'm primarily biomaterials), and I could be misreading something. [deleted] What about the study that involved using radiation to kill the patient's immune system, how viable is that as an option versus an entire stem cell transplant?  Your immune system in generated in the bone marrow. You blast it away with radiation or chem to get rid of the cells that are generating these bad immune cells. Then you replace it with hematopoietic stem cells (previously harvested from the patients) to rebuild the bone marrow. This new bone marrow when eventually produce new immune cells/immune system, hopefully reseting the autoimmune component in the process. Thank you  TLDR I'm someone with RRMS, the relapse remitting kind, which if you have to choose one of the four kinds to have (many clinics would now call it 3 kinds), that's the one you want to have. 

Most people have RRMS, and that's what this treatment addresses. There is still no way to treat the more aggressive forms of the disease.

There are a lot of promising ideas on the horizon, and if stem cells aren't the magic bullet, then nanotechnology may come in down the road and be the solution. Of course neither of those things may pan out, but I'd bet on it and lots of smart, rich people have invested a lot of their money in them panning out.

The thing with MS is research is a race against the clock, at least for me. 50% of people are in a wheelchair after 10 years from diagnosis. At the moment, I'm fine, but things can change rapidly. This is not a cure. Wayyyyy more research is needed, especially research outside of pharmaceutical trials looking for more barely effective $70,000/yr. drugs. My mom has RRMS. She's been diagnosed for about 16 years and is really starting to begin the decline right now,less balanced, tired easier etc. I get so excited when I read articles like this and then I realize that with how long the process of getting approved takes it'll probably be useless for her. 

It's weird to read such great news with a tinge of sadness.  My dad died of MS about five years ago. Every time I read things like this, i can't decide how to feel about it. It's a happiness tinged with a deep regret. Happy that someone else hopefully isn't going to be going through it while upset that you don't get to benefit from it. Some resentment mixed in there, why don't they have to go through what you're going through? A quirk of time gives them everything and takes it from you. 

Then shame for feeling like that.  That's a pretty good description of the mixture, really. It's normal to feel like that. My mom lost her fight with MS about a month and a half ago. Seeing this absolutely breaks my heart, but at the same time it makes me hopeful that some day soon, no one else will have to watch that happen to their loved one. I lost mine 2 years ago and I feel the same way. It's not easy. I'm so sorry for your loss. MS is a really awful disease and I really hope that they can figure out how to stop the late stages of the disease.  I couldn't have put it any better myself. I read these studies and get so excited to think that my mother (RRMS) could be put on these treatments and recover! But then I realize that by the time the treatments and drugs are released to the wider public that it will most likely be too late for her. I can only hold on to the hope that if and when I'm diagnosed with MS that these treatments can help me preserve myself for my children. I know that would make my mother happier than if she herself were well. My mom has had RRMS for 18 years and it's progressively harder and harder for her to do things. These articles feel SO great to read and it feels even better to read the comment section because I don't feel so alone. Sometimes you think you're the only child who has a parent with MS, but then I see that other people my age know how it feels to get stared at when you're pushing her wheelchair, or understand what an episode means. Anyways, long comment but I'm very excited for the future! This is what gets me too.  I know a few people that have it that will likely only benefit from this later on in life after their MS has progressed to a much worse stage. My mom has progressive. Was crazy seeing her go from walking to permanently wheelchair bound within ~4 years. I'm just glad she never let it affect her positivity and active lifestyle. She goes out and does shit more than I do. That's awesome to hear that she is not letting it stop her. My mom has been hit pretty hard with it, within the last three years she's gone from full blown active. To barely functional at some times, on a good day she's using a cane and trying. On a bad day, she can barely even get out of bet let alone manage to do anything on her own, and some days she can barely see. I know if I was in her situation I would have given up quite a long time ago. But I think part of why she tries to stay strong is for her grandchildren (my kids). It's just crazy all the effects it has on your body at once. And seeing her husband helping her out, well I've got a ton of respect for him, especially considering that he also has several health issues of his own going on at the moment.

~ She doesn't live with or near us, she actually lives about 100 miles away. But this spring we're planning on helping her and her husband relocate a lot closer. Seeing as how my brother and his family as well as my family live within 5 miles of each other. And it makes things quite a bit more convenient and easier to handle instead of having drive like a daemon, because she's having a bad day. Don't get my wrong, I love my mother to pieces. But being closer to several family members will make things easier for all everyone. Yeah, it can affect a lot more than just your legs and ability to get around, that's for sure. We have accrued a lot of amenities around the house over the years to help her be independent. She has an electronic wheelchair that can do all sorts of adjustments to help her get comfortable. Our pool is designed for her (no deep end, exercise bar installed), she has a railing on the side of the bed to help her get in/out of it (still needs help on days when it's worse), a raised toilet seat attachment, a seat in the shower, and a ramp van. I give a ton of credit to my dad as well for sticking by her side and doing all he can to assist her. I know it certainly hasn't been easy for him, but it takes a real fucking man to do that.

 
If your family can find a way to afford it, I highly recommend the van. Being able to take herself places is hugely beneficial for morale and maintaining one's independence. You can get them with hand controls for the gas/brake and a "suicide knob" that lets you turn the wheel completely with one hand. However, the best thing my mom ever did was get a (real) service dog and become involved with the service dog community. They're wonderful animals that love nothing more than to serve their person and make them happy. The wait can be long, like 2 years or so, but it's absolutely worth it. They can open/close doors, help you get out of bed, make the bed, recognize and retrieve a host of specific items that you request, pick up things you drop, provide emotional support, and so much more. Definitely check out what reputable organizations are in your area and get in contact with them. It will make a world of difference, I promise. I know how you feel, my dad has lost most of his balance and had a series of mini strokes 2 years ago that made it all worse, his sight is going and we know he will be blind eventually and that kills him to know, he also hates the idea of a wheel chair. He used to do a radio show but after the strokes his voice isnt the same, he did crafts for awhile but lost feeling in his right hand. He also lives a state away alone with is dog. It really sucks not being able to help him, he is only 46 [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] My wife has RRMS and I'm pretty positive that statistic false. More like 20%.  My mother has MS. I'm not sure which kind it is, she's never told me. Seeing what it's done to her is sad.

She's had it for around 18 years now, from around the time I was born. She's always had shaky hands, and she hasn't been very active for as long as I can remember, but her proper decline didn't really start until a few years ago.

Back in elementary school, she was still able to walk around without trouble. She could easily drive around and get to my school without having any issues. She had a wheelchair, but it was clearly more of a 'just in case' thing, since she never used it or even seemed to need it.

Probably.. six years ago now, was when it started really showing.

Her shaking went from a really light one, probably around a millimeter movement, to what's now easily a centimeter and a half on a good day. She can barely light her own smokes these days and has my stepfather roll them for her.

She can barely walk even with a walker now. This is extremely recent. Her mobility has been declining through the past six years, but it's only been really bad for the past two. When she walks around with a walker now, there's still a good chance she'll fall. Her legs will give out, and she'll just kneel down.

All that is sad. But the saddest part is seeing how she deals with it.

Whenever she does fall, she tries to get up for a few seconds. Then she stops, and usually lays down on the floor. I have to insist that I should help her before she'll let me. She'd rather lay there and try to regain enough strength to stand back up. It's heartbreaking every time it happens. She still refuses to use the wheelchair unless her legs basically don't work that day. My stepfather says he thinks the rapid decline is due to her not scheduling when she takes her drugs anymore, and basically takes them when she feels like taking them, which probably leads to mixing some drugs that shouldn't be mixed, but whenever she's confronted with that, she'll claim that that's not it. I don't know, I don't live with her. I'm only there once in a while.

She doesn't really leave the house anymore either.

Sorry if this got depressing, but I just needed to get this off my chest. Seeing her MS develop has been one of the saddest things I've seen, and I've experienced it throughout my teen years. Fuck MS. I have MS and I ended up with 3 bottles of the same meds that I had just forgotten to take. I'll forget. And it's not the normal forget; it's like my intention to get up to take my meds completely goes out of my head. 

I fall all the time too. I just give into the fall and lay there until I can get my footing, letting the cats think I'm doing it for them. 

I don't leave the house much either, which can make you depressed. Getting up in the morning and getting dressed, when I can, has been really good therapy. 

I'm sorry you have to see your Mums like this and the pain it causes you. Just love and help her the best way you can. I know you're sad. She's sad too and probably feels a bit of guilt. I know I did at the time.

If you ever need anything please PM me. 

Oh yeah, Fuck MS.  I think I'll be fine. It was good to just vent about it. I can't imagine what it must feel like to actually have to live with it. What you've explained sounds pretty much exactly like my mom. I know for a fact that she feels guilty about it, even though I try to reassure her. She keeps apologizing for not being able to do things even though I make it clear that she doesn't need to, because I understand that she physically can't.

Thank you so much for your offer, but I don't necessarily feel the need to talk much more about it. I can't really think of anything else to say. The same goes for you, though. If you need to talk, go ahead and PM me. Considering the percentage of all MS patients with R+R MS is estimated at around 85%, it's easy to see why it's targeted by drug companies.  It must be difficult for people with primary progressive or secondary progressive to know that the most likely way they will get a treatment is for one made for R+R MS to happen to work for them too.   I wouldn't be so quick to rule out this treatment for the other forms of MS.  Is Alemtuzumab any good? Lemtrada (the commercial name) is very new to the market. It's been approved by the FDA, so it's passed plenty of trials, but it's really impossible to say if it will be the thing that everyone transitions to or if it will turn out to be more deflated hype. Really hoping that it is in fact a marked improvement from older generation drugs. Even if it's merely equal to existing drugs, the treatment modality of sitting down for infusions three to five days a year for two years is way better than shooting yourself up 3x a day for the rest of your life.

The efficacy looks outstanding.  I'd want it if I had MS. compared to interferon its a like an 80%  ARR reduction on Rebif according to CAMMS223  and Care MS 1 (if i knew how to grammar)
 Yeh sorry reading what you have said the extension studies have yet to justify the efficacy of transitioning paitients from other treatments Where are you getting the 50% in a wheel chair after 10 years stat? I'm pretty sure that is way higher than it actually is. The numbers are really all over the place, but the 10 years thing was something I was told when I was initially diagnosed, but that was based on the time periods when diagnosis was generally later and the CRAB drugs didn't exist.

 My mom has RRMS and there's a good chance (judging from family history) that I'll develop it as well. Research like this makes me hopeful for the future. If you really wanted to know (I can understand why you wouldn't), you can go to the neurologist and they can certainly do a LP to test your spinal fluid. 5-10% of people don't show abnormalities in their CSF, so you could also fall into that category. 

One of my friend's mother has RRMS. Luckily, my friend and her two sisters all have made it through their mid-twenties and early thirties, symptom-free. I wish you the best of luck as well! :) Thanks for the suggestion. I was unaware of any reliable per-symptom testing. Ignorance is bliss, however, so I think I'll hold off for a few more years. I have spent a lot of time with MS patients. Diagnosis is usually multi-variable, including MRIs, bloodwork, symptoms, etc. For the purposes of this conversation I double checked, and genetic testing is an option. 

I'm actually in the midst of raising money for our Walk MS event that's upcoming!

Ignorance *is* bliss, I'll agree. Good luck! I'll keep my fingers crossed for you! In case you weren't already aware your heightened risk can be significantly reduced/negated by taking Vitamin D every day. Source? I also have a first cousin who developed MS after he came back from Iraq.

My neurologist, who's working at the forefront of research, says there's a 2% chance of passing it on to your kid if you're the father and a 5% chance if you're the mother. Possibly something to do with mitochondria, but nobody really knows. My mother (being also a nurse) had made sure to mention multiple times that there's only a 2%-3% chance of passing it on. Still, my mother, her father, her aunt, her grandmother, and my father's aunts and grandmother all had MS so the heredity is strong. There's a quickly growing contingency of MS sufferers who are loudly proclaiming that this absolutely is indeed the cure, and they're working themselves up into a frenzy to get into one of the overseas clinics offering the treatment.

http://themscure.blogspot.com/ Aren't there drugs now for the relapsing kind?  I feel like I saw an ad for them on Hulu recently. There's tons of drugs for RRMS.  There are, but they're only preventative, and no one really knows why they work, just that they do. On top of that, all but one are injections. It's much, much better than nothing, but it could be worlds better. There are at least two oral drugs on the market now, tecfidera and gilenya.  I was in the original clinical trials for Copaxone. Yes drugs for RRMS exist but none of them are quick easy fixes. Its not like chooong between advil and tylenol for a hangover. I personally found the fear of the unknown a lot less scary than the side effects of some medications. Your mileage may vary.  &gt;I'm someone with RRMS, the relapse remitting kind, which if you have to choose one of the four kinds to have (many clinics would now call it 3 kinds), that's the one you want to have.

Personally, I'd prefer Benign MS to RR, and might be lucky enough to have that (~11 years since initial diagnosis, EDSS &lt; 2 for the past 10 years (first attack was pretty bad, was partially paralyzed for a while)). Was put on Rebif immediately after diagnosis, so that probably helped as well. I was in a stem-cell Phase 3 study for treating Crohn's disease... the study was horribly designed with self-reported symptoms.  (Hint: if you said your symptoms improved even if you were on the placebo you got the chance to move onto the next round where you'd again get the chance to get stem cells.  So of course everyone says they noticed some improvement just to get the opportunity to get something that works, and it invalidated the whole study.) Did you see any improvement brother? Might I ask how Phase 3 went? 

I have ulcerative colitis and just had a J pouch installed, so I guess it doesn't really matter. I just hope that someday UC, MS, and Crohn's Disease will become a thing of the past, so no one else will ever have to deal with this bullshit. The stem cell treatment I was on was for Prochymal.  They take stem cells from donors ~~and wash them over and over until there are no proteins left to cause an immune response.~~  I didn't see improvement, unfortunately, and we had reasons to believe I wasn't in the placebo control group (subtle hints in IV fluid and preparation, initial response to the infusion).  Last I heard they cancelled the study because of too many false-positives - likely because it was designed so poorly as to encourage people to say they felt better even if they were in the control group.

However, it seems to work well for graft vs host disease. Thank you for your response. I'm surprised the FDA would allow such an awful trial to be conducted. I thought they were pretty strict on trial design and reporting for a drug like that. I have to assume phase 2 had somewhat promising data to move forward.  [deleted] I'll defer to you; it's been many years since I was involved with it; sorry for my sloppy explanation. If you don't mind me asking, what treatment do you have now? 
I listened to NPR's "Parasites" where they mentioned MS and Chrohn can be treated/cured where the immune system is completely broken down and then rebuilt (which I assume is related to the OT study) , or by implanting hook worm parasites. Don't quote me on this but from my understanding it made your immune system focus on the worms and not your own body.  Permanent end-ileostomy.  I was fortunate in that my Crohn's was restricted to my large intestine.  I've been symptom free since the surgery ~5 years now.

I had tried almost everything except fecal transplants and hookworms, including Remicade, Humira, and Tysabri. Those last ones are two of the treatments I find most interesting. But I bet they make a few people squeamish. I don't think there's good data yet to show they actually work. [deleted] No no I meant the fecal transplant and the therapeutic parasite infection routes. Other interesting research has been done with helminth (sp?) infections for treating allergies. Subjects knew they were receiving a placebo? &gt; So of course everyone says they noticed some improvement just to get the opportunity to get something that works, and it invalidated the whole study.

The part about it working thus the study being invalidated is confusing. As someone who is counting on a synthetic kidney to see out old age in the future, this is very exciting stuff! since this is bleeding edge research, are there any chances for some regular guy with MS to take part in this / benefit from it? I know a patient. And how would one go about getting involved. They are currently enrolling patients, and have some info [here](http://www.stemcell-immunotherapy.com/research_clinical.html).  You can also search clinicaltrials.gov to look for other clinical trials that may be enrolling patients.  The study they reported on here was all out of one hospital.  They will eventually be doing a multicenter test, but I don't know if the one they are looking at next is one. http://themscure.blogspot.com/2010/06/stem-cell-transplantation-reference.html

https://www.facebook.com/groups/149103351840242/ My gf of 2.5 yrs has RRMS. She takes kickboxing classes and such and is highly mobile. She's 50 and was diagnosed when she was ~25, iirc. Weekly interferon injections and it's been years since she's had an episode. 

I dunno what I'd do if she became Progressive. But at her last checkup her dr indicated that since its been RRMS for so long, and years since last episode, he felt confident saying it was very unlikely she'd ever become Progressive.

Fingers crossed.  This just made me cry. I have high hopes for my brother if only I can get him to change his attitude about it. She was uncertain about working out, whether she'd be able to do it because of balance issues. I told her that regardless of MS, *everyone* starts out not being able to do things. When I started martial arts, I couldn't do ANY of the stuff I can now--hell, I could barely stand on one foot, much less do a jumping spinning hook kick, or put my foot thru a stack of six inch-thick boards. 

I said that she'd never know what she could do, and would be surprised at what she learned she was capable of once she started advancing, that even without MS, the body still has to learn how to move, balance, etc. 

She was surprised to learn that I was right. Heh. In spite of the MS, she's more able and coordinated than she's ever been in her life. This after 25 years of living with the disease. 

Point is, you don't know until you *try*. And if you don't try, then you'll never be able to do anything. 
 Booyah!!! She sound like a kickass gal. I'm on 3 years diagnosis and beta interferons seem to be working well. Great to hear a fellow ms person is doing well :)  Very promising. I lost my mother to MS a few years ago, I'm happy to see new treatments finding success.  this is great news for president bartlet! I have a very rare autoimmune disease called Systemic Sclerosis/Scleroderma.  Dr. Burt is the man I plan to see if my disease progresses because stem cell transplants can put people into remission. He is literally a doctor that will change the course of healthcare for future generations.   My mom has MS and I just showed her this and she got so excited there's progress being made to cure it :) As an MS patient, this is very exciting. Thank you! My mother has progressive MS. I'm so glad that others will have hope. Its a heartbreaking condition. I get the distinct feeling that I will need treatment like this at some point in my life. I have some hope.  I really hope that before mine progresses they solve this. Is there an obvious reason why this treatment would work better for MS and not for other acquired autoimmune diseases like Addison's, auto-immune thyroid issues, etc? It seems like an immune system reboot could have far more applications than just multiple sclerosis.  The same group that is doing this study is doing studies in a whole slew of other autoimmune diseases. Don't remember if I saw these specifically but the list was quite long. If you go to the link at the bottom it will lead you to the study and other related links. A proper immune system reboot doesn't really happen with autologous stem cell transplantation - the stem cells are already from the patient, and they produce the same cells as the patient had in the first place.  Also, it wasn't 'myeloablative', so it didn't remove the patients bone marrow in the first place.  A 'reboot' would fit more with an allogeneic bone marrow transplant.  However, the 'reboot' means your immune system has to re-learn what is 'self' and what is 'pathogen'.  It often makes errors in this regard, which results in graft-versus-host disease - where the immune system attacks the patient, and this is why mortality from this procedure is often up to 30%. Everything you say makes sense, but as I understand it, certain autoimmune diseases are mediated by B or T cells (I can't remember which) and the development of the autoimmunity occurs secondary to to exposure. The autoimmunity is not usually hard-coded into the stem cells, although the predisposition may exist. 

So, if you harvest some stem cells, wipe out the majority of the acquired immune system, and then replace the stem cells so that you can start back redeveloping your acquired immunity more quickly, hopefully it will be minus the autoimmune part. I understand it's the same stem cells you had before, but to me it's like a "system restore" to a time before you developed the autoimmunity. My immune system knowledge is rudimentary, I'm sure. What you're saying makes sense, but I think the most important point that he made was that the treatment wasn't myeloablative (they didn't wipe out the existing cells before transplant). So if it isn't myeloablative, I take it that one still retains some portion of their acquired immunity. Seems like the hypothesis of the researchers is that even this is enough to possibly cure this one particular autoimmune disease. I'm just curious as to why not others. 

Edit: deleted a dumb second paragraph.  &gt; Is there an obvious reason why this treatment would work better for MS and not for other acquired autoimmune diseases like Addison's, auto-immune thyroid issues, etc.

Keep in mind that this treatment (stem cell transplant) is extremely dangerous (Wikipedia says 10% mortality or greater), so it isn't likely to ever be used for diseases that are not life threatening or otherwise extremely severe. Surely that mortality rate is with allogeneic transplantation, not autologous, as was used in this case. Not that the side effects of chemo aren't bad enough, but I doubt they'd do this study with a known mortality rate of 10%. This, among the Gordie Howe reasons, are why me and wife donated our child's placenta and umb cord to science.  As someone with MS who's been on disease modifying therapies for a few years often with nasty side effects especially from Capoxone usage and more recently Tecfidera. I read an article like this and think to myself this is awesome. Wow, somebodies come up with a cool treatment that works? Where do I get stem cells?!

However, I then think of how long it will take before any of this reaches the UK and it makes me sad knowing at best I need to wait 10-20 years before any of this makes becomes available. Just saying. Anyone know what type of stem cells these were? Read the article.  They came from the patient's own body, so they are adult or non-embryonic.  No ethical issues. As someone really ignorant, what are the main ethical issues with using stem cells from placenta?

Just yesterday my docotr suggested injecting my knee with platelet rich plasma and stem cells from placenta. Sounds like all the placenta comes from screened patients who donate their placenta for scientific purposes. Just wondering if I should have any qualms with his suggested treatment. Hematopoietic stem cells derived from the patients blood/bone marrow. I wonder this will work with people that has Sickle Cell disease like my self..well stem cells in the matter
 yes. Genetic correction of the hemoglobin gene that causes sickle cell has been done in the past  where researchers took mouse skin cells, turned them into stem cells, corrected the gene, made them into blood cells, and repopulated the mouse's blood system, curing the disease [source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18063756)

Recently, the immune disease SCID was cured in a similar manner, only this time the patient's own blood stem cells (like what was done in this study) were genetically corrected and then put back into the patient.  [source](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-stem-cell-researcher-pioneers-gene-therapy-cure-for-children-with-bubble-baby-disease)

The adult stem cell system of the blood is the most well understood and obviously easy to harvest compared to many other adult stem cell populations of the body.  This, combined with the monogenic nature of sickle cell makes it an obvious candidate for gene therapy trials in the near future. Oh wow I wonder why I've haven't heard more about it, thanks.
 My uncle died from MS less than a month ago. After losing someone close to me to this disease, I am now much, much happier there is a promising treatment for this fucker. How would one design a randomized clinical trial for something like this?
Would you give the HSCT to one group and sham for the other, then have test group take placebo to replace their normal regimen and have the control group take normal meds? Is it dangerous to take a MS patient, even one having only moderate improvement, off their meds for the duration of this study? 

I've never done studies on human subjects, and calves don't really get a choice. (Other than: research or McDonalds, take your pick.)

 My fathers compant does this ms treatment with fat stem cells for 1/4 the price. Adipose tissue are cells are just as strong, some even argue theybare stronger. To bad this will never be seen. As someone who's dad has Secondary Progressive MS, and is slowly watching him get worse and worse. I really hope this becomes a treatment soon. Honestly I've always believed stem cells were the way forward but I feel that governments want people to believe it's not due to over populated the world is already. This brought a tear to my eye. As a MS patient i can honestly tell you that there is no better news than this! 
 I've only been able to read the abstract, but there are lots of issues with this trial.

Firstly, as has already been pointed out, there is no control arm.  This means we do not know what would have happened to these patients without the treatment.  It also means the study could be subject to 'regression fallacy'.  I wasn't able to read the methods, but if you take MS patients who are currently undergoing an episode of MS, and they have relapsing remitting MS, you can expect their disability to improve.

Secondly, why are they using stem cell transplant?  The procedure is to harvest haematopoietic (i.e. blood) stem cells from a patient, then you give them back.  What does this achieve?  The patient already had them!  In haematology these types of stem cell transplant (autologous - i.e. taken from patient and given back to same person) are used simply to rescue patients from large doses of chemotherapy that would normally take out all the bone marrow.

Sorry to be negative, but until I see a randomised, controlled trial, I'm just not buying it. Would stem cell transplants work for intestinal autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's as well? Yes, they are doing trials. Source - have infused stem cells into these patients Eli5? read this as: "In a larger trail of 150 MS painters who received steam cell transplants.."

thought someone was doing a trail on ms painters.. my friends husband was newly diagnosed about a year or so ago, woke up one day couldn't see, couldn't walk. he was the main income he owned a construction company, she had just had their first baby. 
they were scared they went down to Columbus Ohio got to see a few specialists there, tried a random assortment of their suggested treatments nothing helped.
They researched and found a stem cell facility in Florida, and in talks with them they decided to sell the business, downsize their house and risk it all to try stem cell therapy.
He can now walk and see. The lesions on his spinal cord were completely gone. Went back to the OSU drs for his next follow up (they didn't know what he had done) and the nurse almost dropped the new xrays. When he told her what he'd done, she asked permission for copies and ran and got the DR. They had never seen proof in front of them like that.
Amazing stuff. And think how far behind we are thanks to Dubyah Bush [deleted] They aren't. The debate was over embryonic stem cells . Those are no longer used; not just for political reasons, but because they were significantly less practical and more expensive compared to new methods.  Such awesome hope. My 22 year old sister was diagnosed this year after temporarily losing her vision and balance. I work as an ICU nurse and feel a bit helpless. Glad to see so many dedicated people researching a very scary disease. They don't try this until other options are exhausted but by that time damage that has already occurred is not reversible -- something needs to change.  Some of the drugs are as bad as the symptoms. While a positive study given such good outcomes in this cohort, and one that adds to the excitement in this field, it is important that we continue to critique the research (as health professionals) and try to communicate with the public in a way that doesn't foster desperation and/or a misplaced sense of success in this particular treatment regime, especially given the vulnerability of patients facing multiple sclerosis.

I'll quickly outline some of the study limitations below:

1) Primarily it was an unblinded, case-series. There is the possibility of bias given the many functional measures were conducted in an unblinded fashion.

2) Many of the patients had highly active disease at entry to the study, which may over-emphasise the benefit of the treatment as some of the recovery may be, in part, due to the relapsing-remitting natural history of the disease.

3) Follow-up was of a relatively short-duration (2 years), and those who were captured in follow-up may have been those whose symptoms were, on average, better than the others, thereby biasing the results to appear more positive.

4) It's difficult to ascribe how much of the improvement in disability scores were actually due to the HSCT therapy, as the drugs used in preparing the patient for the transplant (i.e. alemtuzumab), have themselves been shown to improve disability scores.

It's also important to recognise that there is no evidence such a treatment would be effective in other type of MS (i.e. progressive MS) - it in fact appears as though it isn't effective.^^^Atkins ^^^HL, ^^^Freedman ^^^MS. ^^^Hematopoietic ^^^stem ^^^cell ^^^therapy ^^^for ^^^multiple ^^^sclerosis: ^^^top ^^^10 ^^^lessons ^^^learned. ^^^Neurotherapeutics. ^^^2013;10(1):68-76.

The wider safety profile of this treatment protocol and it's long-term effect on relapsing-remitting MS remains **untested** and **unproven**, and as such is ***not*** recommended as routine treatment. If you suffer from MS, *please* consult with your treating physician before changing any of your treatment. Please be **especially** careful about fringe physicians in other states/countries offering this treatment as a "cure" or who charge a large amount of money for such treatment, as your safety and outcomes are not guaranteed.

Let's all cross our fingers that more research is published in the near future that can really start influencing our practice. I have MS &amp; I say, YAHOO YAHOO YAHOO!!  My sister was diagnosed with MS last year. These articles have been amazing. Thank you. There is lots of info and help! There is an ms subreddit (cannot spell it on mobile) and if she needs discount meds (USA only) you can contact biogen idec or CVS Caremark. They also have a ms for dummies book. Hugs!  I hate to be a jerk, but is 150 patients a big enough sample size?  If properly selected, yes.  Considering the amount of work required and the relative rarity of the disease it is a huge sample size for a single institution. [deleted] [deleted] quibble: **improvement** in physical *ability* or **decrease** in physical *disability*.    
  
these syntactical blips do matter cognitively when it comes to speaking to a patient about their potential well-being.  The results are cessation of progression of disability for &gt;80% of the subjects. For 64% of the subjects, they also had improvement of physical ability at the 4-year mark. http://mssociety.ca/en/research/meddmmo-bonemarrowstudy-feb05.htm. 

Here's a Canadian link to the doctors at my hospital leading the autoimmune disease stem cell research. Google Dr. Harry Atkins if you want to know what else he's done besides MS and perhaps find a way to contact him if you want to be a part of it. I know that's what one of our patients did. My mother died from MS. Crazy how just a couple years after there finding a cure.... Stem cells are going to fix a lot of things, methinks.

I'm sorry about your friend with ALS; I worked on a film about it. Horrible disease. I hope there's a cure or at least a treatment soon. I have familial spastic paraplegia. it's not MS, but is similar in that it works its magic through nerve demyelination. My condition is not overly common (and to cap it off, I have an even rarer variant that onsets at birth instead of 20s/30s), so there isn't a huge amount of funding for research. It's always good to read about advances in MS treatment, hopefully something bleeds over into my realm! I have been looking for suggestions on some good stem cell companies that would be a safe bet for stock.  If anyone owns stem cell stock I would appreciate any advice.
 This is simply amazing to read :)! How does this compare to the recent article about using chemotherapy with MS patients? These articles are going to just keep making me sad until we have changes in our HMO system such that these advancements can actually be applied. Yeah, turns out if you take an autoimmune process and completely destroy the immune system, then repopulate it with someone else's stem cells, it tends to treat the condition. I thought they "repopulated" with the patient's own stem cells in this study? That's very good! This is great news. My dad was recently diagnosed with CIDP. It's been devastating to watch him deteriorate so quickly. Stems are pretty much his only hope at this point. 

I'm so grateful for the brilliance of scientists.  I'm a resident at a large university hospital our IM grand rounds was on stem cell clinical research. Fun fact: the largest reservoir for stem cells in our body-adipose (not bone marrow like previously thought). That's right, we can take our own fat, spin out stem cells and use it to repair organ X. Pretty cool stuff man.   I have a disorder similar to MS. This jus made my night! I hope you have steady progress as each day goes by [deleted] Hopefully someday we can buy them OTC Man, hearing about all of this stem cell stuff is making me want to hold off on the arthroscopy for my knee and wait for them to pump some stem cells in the MCL. Maybe it doesn't work like that. 80% Which one counts as almost relapse-free? OP didn't provide a link to the journal entry, so here's the abstract:

Unfortunately, it's more than three months old and is not the paper that's discussed in *The Telegraph* news article. Here is the correct research paper:

This may have some significant promise. Did you see the guy in which they transplanted nasal glial cells into his completely severe spinal cord area, and the guy is walking again due to new nerve growth. Pretty cool shit going on in this regard right now [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] I'm happy I live in current times. Yes there's war, media frenzy, et cetera et cetera... however problems similar have occurred in the past. I have so much hope for the future of humanity. Time will tell but I hope to see continued progress and understanding during my lifetime.  [deleted] [deleted] Here is a complete book on the topic and it is a great read. Pinker shows the data and it is not a belief that violence has been on the decline for over a century; it is almost hard fact according to all causes of mortality accumulated world wide. Granted, as Pinker also suggests, it could swing completely in the opposite direction almost instantly at any point in time.

I did a search to find an article on this in case anyone is interested: http://speakingofresearch.com/2014/10/21/paralysed-man-walks-cell-transplant/ I don't wanna break anyone's heart but this guy can't walk. It was certainly a major breakthrough though, he has gained slight feeling in his thighs and also gained muscle mass. But that's all, there would almost no change in his quality of life and he certainly can't walk  the videos you see of him between parallel bars and with a wheelie walker with splints, complete (ASIA A) paraplegics can do this.  I don't think that you linked to the correct research paper. It's from more than three months ago whereas the research discussed in *The Telegraph* is published in the most current issue of *Science*.

Here is the summary in *Science* by Robert Service that's quoted in *The Telegraph* news article:

[A soft approach kick-starts cybernetic implants](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6218/114.summary?sid=081831f5-3257-46e9-a7e0-93ebe9336b5b), R.F. Service, *Science*, 347(6218): 114, 09 Jan 2015, doi: 10.1126/science.347.6218.114

And here is the research paper by Dr. Lacour from the same issue:

[Electronic dura mater for long-term multimodal neural interfaces](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6218/159.abstract), I.R. Minev, *et al.*, *Science*, 347(6218): 159-163, 09 Jan 2015, 10.1126/science.1260318 You're right, I made an edit. Thanks, it's great to have the actual journal and not a link to the telegraph. Ph.d Mechanical Engineer here. While most /r/Science entries seem greatly exaggerated, these studies actually seem to show promise. In 2013, we discovered roughly how the brain sends signals to the spine, and that the signals are much less complex than we thought. I could definitely see a game changer for a lot of people within the next 10 years.  It's true. And in 2015, we'll learn how to monetise it.  I imagine it would still have a typical level of fibrous encapsulation. Yes it is nice it doesn't physically destroy tissue from movement, but saying "it doesn't get rejected by the body" is not really accurate. Yeah, my impression has never been that flexibility was a problem, the overriding technical obstacle to any implant like this has been scar tissue formation around the electrodes, blocking the implant from working. The first person to find a conductive material which doesn't get rejected in this way has a Nobel prize or three headed for them.  What if we make the electrodes so small, the immune system can't pick up on it. (It sounds silly so please tell me where I'm wrong.) The immune system can "pick up on" things that are VERY small, we're talking only 10 amino-acids in length, which in on the nano scale. The smallest electrodes we've made that are of any use are platinum ultramicroelectrodes that are about 0.1microns. These are only used for Voltammetry which is a very basic task compared to the electrodes needed to do the type of work we're discussing. To some extent it's the material science that needs to be advances and less so our understanding, at least with the method you are trying to suggest. In any case it's a good 10years away at minimum. Science is expensive, slow, difficult, but very rewarding,  0.1 micron = 100 nanometers, so it is on the nano scale. How small is ten amino acids in length? An amino acid has a diameter of ~.8nm. A small peptide chain would be around 5-8nm in length. 

For comparison; a H atom has a diameter &gt;0.1nm Yes, but those electrodes aren't usable for any such application. Sorry, I meant small enough that we'd use the nano scale. For example a typical amino acid (keep in mind they very in size) is about 0.8nm. So technically it's smaller than 1nm but still given in nm. Based on that 10 amino acids would be about 8nm in length. Also, keep in mind this is the smallest things that happen to be in our system that the immune system is reacting to. It doesn't mean that if we do introduce smaller this that the immune system can't potentially sense it. Also keep in mind that you can only make something, a electrode in this instance, so small before it's now smaller than any functioning unit and would just be atoms. For reference the hydrogen atom is 0.1nm in diameters. So imagine making a electrode smaller than that... it's not really logical since at that size the object would have to be made of a single hydrogen atom. The trick is to get things that can work on smaller thins, not necessarily make them smaller. That would be more helpful in things like making leaner phones and computer chips. That's actually one of the leading theories, at least with using brain electrodes. Make them so thin and small that it's impossible for scar tissue to form around them.  Smaller electrodes tend to break much more easily, even with the slightest movements, and thus are not feasible for in vivo implantation. Regardless, the electrodes in this device are not piercing the neural tissue, they just sit on the surface. Similar devices have been used over the dura and even over the skin to provide similar results. It's not like a cyborg where limbs are controlled by electrodes, this is merely delivering impulses that potentiate neural pathways that are already intact due to incomplete spinal cord damage in their model. It is never going to cure someone with a complete spinal cord injury-- for that you need tissue engineering.  Most spinal cord injuries [are partial](https://www.nscisc.uab.edu/PublicDocuments/fact_figures_docs/Facts%202014.pdf) though. That's true, but considering that generalized subthreshold external implantation over the dura has only shown minimal improvements of the intact tracts, it's not like putting electrodes under the dura is going to magically cure someone... it should have about the same results with much higher infection risk. Sure you can increase stimulation, but with current technology you are already trying to keep subthreshold levels to prevent involuntary spasms anyway. Sorry, I'm not trying to destroy hope, just trying to give perspective on the problem. Wouldn't smaller electrodes be more damaging? Nope.

Pedot electrodes can be made smaller then a hair, are flexible, and stretchable. And are biocompatible to boot. How? There's less interference with surrounding tissue as you get smaller and smaller. Think about it, would you prefer to get a tiny splinter or get impaled? Something to explore for sure, but even tiny things like ions can interact with other molecules and lead to complexes that the immune system can then recognize. &gt; (It sounds silly so please tell me where I'm wrong.)


On a long enough timeline,  everything sounded silly.  That doesn't mean we can't pull it off given enough years.  I'm completely ignorant about the subject, so can someone explain what the conductive core of a neuron's axon is made of and can we replicate that material in a lab?

EDIT: From reading Wikipedia for 10 minutes it looks like there are sodium and potassium voltage-gated ion channels which pass an action potential from one Ranvier node to another at 200 m/s using what is called saltatory conduction. I assume the axon is basically a cell membrane tube filled with an electrolyte and insulated with myelin.

EDIT2: I now understand it's a high-maintenance system which needs support and it would not survive for long on its own. It is a cell with other protective cells, so it has all the complexities of cellular structure, e.g. lipid bilayer, surface proteins/sugars, interaction with the ECM. Even if you could replicate the interface perfectly in a lab, it would eventually be degraded without the cellular machinery there to replenish/repair damage.   http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/actionpot.html
A good concise answer for what cause the signal in neurons. Nature is very different from what we've sorted to, and quite amazing. 

The rejection of these implants is caused by coagulation, similar to coagulation when the body stops blood loss. The coagulating proteins lose shape when interacting with the implant and an immune system response is triggered that encapsulates the implant in fibrous, scar, tissue. This fibrous connective tissue may cause the implant to lose its desired effect, or become infected with bacteria. I'll need to read more on the mechanisms behind it. 

This premise is what drives the backstory of the game deus ex machina. In a world where body modification with prosthetics is a booming business, advanced prosthetics users require a pill that hides the immune system from the implants on the nervous systems. This brings a ton of money to the pharmaceutical companies, so naturally there's a tizzy when someone tries to come out with material that makes the pill unnecessary.  The game you mention is "Deus Ex: Human Revolution."  No "machina" in there. Axons don't have a conductive core per se.  They are cell processes, that is extensions of membrane and intracellular fluid.  Action potentials, the electric signals of axons, are propagated by a sort of chain reaction of ion flows at the axon membrane surface.  It's very different from the sort of electrical conduction in a metal wire.   So the charge-carriers are ions rather than electrons? More like a tiny battery than a wire? Yes the charge carriers are ions.  The system is indeed set-up a lot like a concentration cell battery.  The interior and exterior of the axon have different concentrations of various ions - particularly sodium and potassium.  This gradient is maintained because the membrane is relatively impermeable to these ions.  The ions can only cross the membrane through special channel proteins.  

Now, the way the axon works is that it has special channel proteins that are voltage gated, which means they only open at certain voltages between the inside and the outside of the cell membrane.  The concentrations of the ions involved, and the particular voltage-sensitivities of these channels leads to a very unique behavior.  When a section of an axon reaches a certain critical voltage threshold, it triggers the opening of channels that increase the voltage even further, and this triggers further voltage gated channels ultimately causing a very specific, stereotyped response called an action potential.  

You can read about the details on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential), but the overall effect is as follows.  Once the action potential is triggered at one portion of the axon, the cell membrane activity at that section brings the next section of the axon to threshold, triggering the action potential there.  The action potential travels down the axon.  It does not travel backwards as there is a certain refractory period during which a triggered region cannot be triggered again (although, yes, if you trigger an action potential in the middle of an axon you get pulses going in both directions).   

 Do carbon nanotubes get rejected? Most likely. There's some evidence that carbon nanotubes are cytotoxic as well.  For many neural interface platforms nowadays, flexibility is included in order to help reduce that scar tissue formation. Research in many different tissues/areas of the body shows that implants which better match the mechanical properties of their surroundings reduce chronic mechanical irritation and thus reduce the chronic inflammatory response. Neural tissue is very soft, so you want to make the interface out of the floppiest material you can. Plenty of studies, including one I conducted as part of my doctorate work, have shown that indwelling cortical implants with lower moduli have reduced chronic inflammatory responses.  &gt; scar tissue formation around the electrodes, blocking the implant from working.

This is what they were referring to in Deus Ex when they talked about glial tissue buildup, right? I guess for the time being, we'll need Neuropozyne. Why can't we just discuss and embrace the positives and how this will be perfected?  I mean seriously, every top post on new exciting and positive achievement science is littered with "yea but..." 

 Is there a prize to be the smartest debbie downer in the room or something? The whole point of Science is to remain grounded. These common top posts assist in balancing the sensationalism typical of nearly every article about a scientific discovery. They are doing you a service, when they are accurate, in helping maintain a proper view of what is being reported. They are wiping the grease off the lens, so to speak. &gt; The whole point of Science is to remain grounded.

Anyone who disagrees with this has never done science. 

&gt; Why can't we just discuss and embrace the positives and how this will be perfected? I mean seriously, every top post on new exciting and positive achievement science is littered with "yea but..."

It's easy to get excited about theories and ideas like these. And you should get excited about these ideas because that's what drives us to keep making new discoveries! But Science is about putting those exciting ideas through rigorous testing to determine if those exciting ideas are, in fact, viable. We don't mean to be downers, we're just scientists and don't believe anything really works until it's PROVEN over and over and over.  &gt; The whole point of Science is to remain grounded.

This is nonsense. That is not "the whole point" of science.  The person you're replying to is talking out their ass and just speculating. There haven't been any significant rejection issues reported and for all intents and purposes the statement (the body doesn't reject it) is entirely accurate.

Edit: I honestly don't even think they bothered reading the paper. Direct quote:

"Neuroinflammatory responses at chronic stages were visualized with antibodies against activated astrocytes and microglia (Fig. 2C), two standard cellular markers for foreign-body reaction (7). As anticipated from macroscopic damage, both cell types massively accumulated in the vicinity of stiff implants (P &lt; 0.05; Fig. 2C and fig. S8). In marked contrast, no significant difference was found between rats with soft implants and sham-operated animals (Fig. 2C and fig. S8). These results demonstrate the long-term biocompatibility of the soft implants." Yes, having a technology doesn't mean we can fully implement its use.  As a paraplegic, this is terribly exciting for me.  Bravo, science! The crappy part about these kinds of announcements is you hear about all these breakthroughs and revolutions and theeen nothing.
I hope they keep up with human trials Thats how I feel about this. I had a family member become injured and is now in a wheelchair. Of course that got me into looking into stuff like this. That was 8 years ago. And while these designs are gettting more advanced and more studies are being done, even the stuff that was researched back then seems irrelevant. Because it seems like none of this stuff ever comes out. I honestly feel that a solution like this is cool and all, but will not actually be implemented on regular people (outside of trials) in our lifetime.  It's important to note that this is not some sort of failing of bureaucracy, though. Even if these breakthroughs were approved and distributed, they wouldn't be very effective (and might be dangerous). We are laying the groundwork for our children to be treated. Oh definitely not. I feel this way about most technological advances. They are laying the ground work for later. All of these breakthroughs and new findings and studies and important for the future. However, they arent going to be of any use for the common person anytime soon. Not necessarily a negative thing, just a reality check from getting our hopes up.  Too true.  I have automatic searches set up in Google News that took me a while to perfect, and I am *still* finding other things outside those parameters. agreed. but I did recently see the video with the man who had two robotic arms. it made me happy to see some breakthroughs slowly moving forward. paraplegic checking in also.... It's nice logging onto a major news site and seeing stuff like this instead of going out and "looking for it" which can turn into a vicious cycle.  Cripples unite!  Nice to see more of us taking an interest in these types of thing. It's not just us taking an interest, it's a lot of doctors and investors and general people who are using their time. I participated in the reeves (Superman) program at OSU and that was awesome. I worked with some great people there. It's a shame many of these programs run out of funding due to "big pharm". They make soooo much money on people in wheelchairs, I wake up and take 4 different kind of pills for Muscle spasms, pain, ect, ect..... Not walking is far from the worst thing I/we deal with.   My interest is in the case I become crippled.so I can be a future uncripple  Have you heard of Mark Pollock? You should look at the work his trust is doing for paralysis. A truly inspirational man Same here, the problem I continue to see, however, is many headlines begin this way, but I do not see any of these open to the public. Do you feel the same way? How can we have hope for these, if we never see these trials make it to public? In all seriousness, could this be getting closer to the kind of chip that Doc Oc had in Spider Man 2? I mean could this chip be getting us closer to interacting with computers and machines on a more mental level all together? Because this is the closest thing I have seen to that in real life. I too am curious to the answer to this. As an aviator, this would make flying my plane much easier. I wonder what kind of new maneuvers could be created with this level on control.  Question for you then. Wouldn't you still be limited by the actual control and dynamics of the plane design? Short of the relieving your physical fatigue from flying what would you hope might be able to accomplish?

I am slightly terrified by the thought of a pilot sneezing while on thought control and snapping a barrel roll on a commercial flight :) You wouldn't have to worry about that unless it's in Manual control mode. Most commercial flights are flown in autopilot.  There's a bunch of work that's happened towards that front.  There have been people playing games with their mind, someone watching a monitor sending a signal that gets processed by someone else who then pulls a trigger in a game, the eye with crappy resolution, and quite a few other experiments.  And then there's also the stuff that doesn't use electrodes hooked up to the brain like the robotic prosthetic arm that guy without a shoulder used(it used a sensor cluster hooked up all around the muscles/nerves that would have been sending signals to the arm). 

So I think the pace is relatively brisk all things considered. &gt;  And then there's also the stuff that doesn't use electrodes hooked up to the brain like the robotic prosthetic arm that guy without a shoulder used(it used a sensor cluster hooked up all around the muscles/nerves that would have been sending signals to the arm). 

They actually take the nerves that would have connected to the lost limb and reinnervate different muscles, such as pectoral muscles, which are hooked up to the sensor array. What's really amazing is that this reinnervated tissue is remarkably sensitive, and sensations can corrospond to areas of the missing limb. So basically we should eventually have fully robotic artificial limbs, complete with sensory feedback and a more 'natural' feeling control system. [deleted] You should head over to r/Trans humanism :) There's also /r/transhuman In Columbus, OH a quadriplegic man had a chip implanted in his brain that sent signals to an exoskeleton like sleeve to allow him to move his fingers and such for the first time again at Ohio State. Apparently since Batelle is near by they partnered up with their biomedical department to develop a chip. They had the man think about moving his fingers/arm and saw where is brain was activated on MRI. They then implanted the chip in that area to receive neuro input to send to the chip in the exoskeleton sleeve to allow for some movement. Pretty cool stuff. 

http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/06/ian_burkhart_neurobridge_experiment_how_a_quadriplegic_man_moved_his_hand.html [deleted] [deleted] I have a friend who was in a horrible accident several years ago and is paralyzed. 
These types of advances give her so much hope. 
I cannot wait to share this with her.  Imagine when we live in a world getting paralyzed is now as life changing as stubbing your toe. That's the medical world I would love to be in. Given enough time, the body will probably become more like a sleeve which you can transfer the mind to. Still a far way off, of course. Still exciting!
 I kind the like the idea of a modular body kind of like a plug and play for your brain. Although I do have to say i'm pretty fond of my current sleeve and Id be a little upset if I had to give it up haha. Amazing concept though If you haven't you should read altered carbon by Richard k Morgan. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] I'd think of it much more as a growth platform that a matured brain is transferred to later on in life.

Like the [Cymeks](http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Cymek) from Dune. Heard of Eclipse Phase? I would equate it more to breaking a bone. Stunning your toe hurts but goes away in seconds to minutes. Breaking your arm may require surgery and extended healing time, but in the end it isn't a big deal. Short of body repairing nano-bots larger injury will never be less than inconvenience  [deleted] I wouldn't share it with her (but I don't really know your friend) From someone in the situation (&amp; speaking only for myself, not on behalf of every person with paralysis), I don't mind when people mention things like this but when they do it usually ends up with them thinking I'm a pessimistic downer. 

I've been in a chair for about 17 years &amp; have been told since day 1 that some breakthrough research will have me walking in no time. You better believe I've done more research into therapy than 99.9% of the population &amp; more than likely knew about this way before the media published it. I also know a "cure" is vastly more complex than you or I understand. Of course, I'm glad the research is happening, but I can't get excited every time someone builds an impractical exoskeleton or implants some electrodes or I'll miss out on life.

By all means share, I wouldn't want to ruin your excitement, but please understand that my lack of enthusiasm &amp; tendency to point out that this is just 1 step along a very long road. When something actually exciting happens, I'll tell you :) [deleted] We get so barraged with promising and upcoming scientific breakthroughs that I slip into complacency and take it all for granted.

I read the article and thought to myself "huh, that's pretty cool." It took a moment for me to really appreciate just how immense of a breakthrough this is. We are on the verge to curing paralysis....for the first time *ever*, and all I can think of is "cool".

This is amazing work they're doing, and hope to hear of success in their future efforts. It will be a momentous event for all of humanity if we can overcome this terrible injury. On of my friends is in this research group, and I can tell you (from unpublished info), things are going pretty well! Expect news on this in the coming year!  hopefully something like this would be avalable to the public in the next 4-6 years... I would love it. c-6,c-7 checking in here. It's nice seeing stuff on the mainstream. I wont go looking for information on a "cure" [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] I believe this is the full paper: http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/201837/files/Wenger%20et%20al.%202014.pdf Unfortunately, no, the paper by Wenger, *et al.* is more than three months old and is not the paper that's discussed in *The Telegraph* news article. Here is the correct research paper:

[Electronic dura mater for long-term multimodal neural interfaces](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6218/159.abstract), I.R. Minev, *et al.*, *Science*, 347(6218): 159-163, 09 Jan 2015, 10.1126/science.1260318 Doh, sorry, and thanks for the actual paper!  [deleted] Would anyone be able to comment on the possible applications to diseases such as MS?

MS can also result in paralyses, but perhaps the implant wouldn't work around the scar tissue on the spinal cord, or in the presence of the damaged nervous system?
I'm not exactly a doctor, the above could be a bit inaccurate. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] My cousin had a stroke at 19 and lost a lot of control over the right side of his body. Does anyone know of any advances upcoming that may help him and other stroke victims? The dead bits are probably in is brain. The device is the article is to bypass spinal nerve damage. There's work being done on decreasing the amount of function lost in the time immediately following a stroke.  Helping someone years later is a lot more difficult because the loss of function is usually due to brain damage, rather than a loss of communication between the brain and the body. 

It's theoretically possible that they could use a system like this to connect parts of the brain that are still working to the musculature from that side of the boy and then try to re-train those brain areas to control the body.  But I'm sorry to say that's a far far more complicated and untested process and it's unlikely to happen any time soon. Or we could continue with stem cells  [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] I look forward to the day when my sister, a C5 complete quadriplegic, can at least move her arms again, if not walk.

I don't know whether the breakthrough will come from an implant like this or from a breakthrough in regenerative medicine, but it just seems like it's going to happen at some point in her lifetime.  [deleted] This is great news. I hope one day we can cure all bone damages. The future is sounding better and better everyday  It's always so amazing to see how many advances we have made in this short amount of time. It makes me excited to see how far science and technology is able to go in my lifetime. [deleted] [deleted] When researching, do they intentionally paralyse the rats?  The alternative would be finding paralysed rats so I'm going to assume they're deliberately paralysed.  Ok r/science why is this hundreds of years away from being reality? 1)Because the locomotion of rats is much different than humans

2)The rats are partially weight supported and held relatively fixed in a bipedal position.

3)It's a relatively crude method of eliciting motor function in comparison to other methods like blackrock arrays. It's stimulating the dorsal (sensory) area of the spinal cord in an effort to activate ventral (motor) areas.

It's useful as a therapy and has a lot of clinical uses for maintaining muscle mass and reducing spasticity, but as far as popping it into someone and having them up and walking functionally imo it's never going to happen with epidural electrical stimulators (this technology).
 What we will probably use is a ultrasonic phased array.  They are currently DARPAs pick.

Directly trigger an action potential in the nerve using alot less power then surface electrodes.  Also, the beam can be steerable so it can be self stabilizing ( with implanted under the skin but not anchored to the bone, or consumer BCIs on top of the skin.) and EM resistant (so a loud stereo or an arc welder won't cause your legs to spasm).  Also, no electrodes so nothing to reject 

Problem is right now you need a machine the size of a 90s cellphone for each element of the array (and you need a large array).  Add alot of power to run all this, and it isn't practical outside a lab.  But some companies are using the new MEMs tech to make much smaller and power effecient transceivers (about the size of a cellphone camera). 

Expect this stuff to hart hitting research in 2016 when the requisite chips hit the market.

(I work in the electronics industry and MEMs is our current next big thing) &gt;What we will probably use is a ultrasonic phased array. They are currently DARPAs pick.

Which project is that and who is the manager? http://www.ece.ncsu.edu/news/24222/oralkan-receives-darpa-young-faculty-award

Dr. Omer Oralkan is doing stuff with retinal Interfaces using ultrasonics and won a big award in 2013.

http://www.technologyreview.com/news/532166/with-100-million-entrepreneur-sees-path-to-disrupt-medical-imaging/

Ultrasonic imaging chip in startup.

http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fneng.2014.00027/full

Current state of the art in neuromodulation.  Ultrasonics stimulation in rats is part of it. Its not. Its right here waiting for us to perfect it as a very very valuable skill. It already *is* reality in rats.  The only problem is how long it might last, since the body is still likely to detect it/form scar tissue around it and get in the way of it working properly.  If they're willing to go in every single time it stops working it could be a possibility relatively soon, the patient might just be strapped in to surgery almost nonstop.

So it's going to take some more work, but not everything that pops up on the sub is a pipedream :P.  hundreds of years away... I am currently confined to a wheelchair and am pretty confident that I will be walking within the next 10 years. And im not the type of mopey wheelchair chump that feels bad for myself. Actually about to grad with a double major and got multiple job offers. so don't rain on my parade saying "hundreds of years away".... I would say more 4-8 years realistically.  It'll take 100 years for this to be pre-approved by your health care provider. As great as this is - and it is indeed great - Id like to see more movement towards the body being able to heal itself thru stem cells or something along those lines instead of producing a product. I know that takes time and this is a great thing for the in between phase.  

Still, it's amazing what we are able to do.  We have the technology, we can rebuild him.  [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] &gt;Researchers at the Ecole Polytechnique Fdrale de Lausanne are hoping to move to clinical trials in humans soon. They believe that a device could last 10 years in humans before needing to be replaced.

Having to replace it every 10 years or so would suck, but still, this is exciting. That's less often than most types of implanted birth control.  Definitely worthwhile. Sounds like the harnessed children in Falling Skies.

Thanks to whoever it may concern 

The one, the only, the vaninja.

Or with which chimps they share their favorite fruit stash location with?

&gt; "I never tried these fruits myself, but they do smell very good in the forest," Kalan says. "They are also quite big and easy to ingest, and we also know that they have a high energy content, which is important for wild animals."

Side Note: Part of me was hoping Kalan was one of the chimps. Or what if a mutation gives one chimp exceptional abilities to sign, and he uses this ability to communicate complex (and sexy) messages to the ladies and is able to procreate more. That could spread a super-sign-language-ability gene throughout the population. [Here is the paper being discussed](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004643), in case that link is problematic, as it was for me. Is there any chance you have the full text? Thank you so much. I'm an Evolutionary Biology major, and you just made my day. &gt; There are some chimpanzees at CWU that not only used sign language with each other, one of them taught its offspring sign language without the trainers prompting it, and they also have started hybridizing certain signs to invent new words, for example "run" and "play" have been combined to specifically mean "let's play tag", and it's not just that they were signed together as a phrase, they were actually combined into a new sign.

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washoe_(chimpanzee) Does this mean if one were to teach a wild chimp sign language (don't ask me how) then it would teach it to all of it's chimp buddies and they would have their own language that we would understand?  No, because the chimps didn't actually learn very much sign language in these studies. Claims about what they were capable of seem to have been exaggerated by the researchers and then wildly exaggerated by the popular press. The result is that it's common knowledge that chimps can learn sign language, when in fact they can learn a handful of signs at best. It's still impressive and gives us a wonderful insight into how language might have evolved, but they are not language users in anything remotely close to the way humans are. Also: They never combine them like humans combine words into sentences. It was ALWAYS 2 word utterances: "Me outside" "give banana", etc. 
 [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] More than a handful, but you are right, cannot form sentences. [deleted] [deleted] There's no reason to put "talk" in quotation marks.  They talk to each other. linguists would probably disagree.  orally communicating and talking are not necessarily the same thing.  i certainly understand how the distinction between the two can seem unnecessary or even politically(?) motivated, but there is a very sound scientific reason for it.


information can be communicated orally in either a digital or analog fashion.  if i hear you laugh i understand that you think something is funny, but the information is communicated in an analog fashion; I judge how funny you think something is based on how much or little you laugh at it.  same idea with crying and a bunch of other oral communications that i think linguists call "gesture-calls".


Language on the other hand is a digital form of communication.    A word means a specific thing, as opposed to information that exists within a spectrum of gradation like a laugh or a cry.  


Our development of a digital language is of tremendous evolutionary significance because it may have only been possible due to a change in the way our brains work.  I think Chomsky talks a lot about this stuff, and [here](https://naccl.osu.edu/sites/naccl.osu.edu/files/00_pulleyblank-eg.pdf) is an interesting paper on the subject.


In regards to this article, the calls of the chimps may (I think most likely) be more akin to gesture-calls, in that the feeling of finding and/or eating these various kind of fruits or trees elicits vocalizations in the same way we laugh at something funny or cry at something sad, and since they recognize the meaning of the vocalization the meaning is conveyed, but not with language strictly speaking.  hence "talk"  I have a bachelors in linguistics if that counts, and I definitely disagree with the parent comment. Animal communication is far more limited than human speech.

"Talk" to me implies that they can talk at the level of a human. They can't.

Human language is a symbolic representation of concepts. Words are analog (as in the audio signal), but as you said, language is digital, starting at the phonemic level: you only have so many ways to make a sound with your mouth, and they are discrete. It can be used to represent a Turing machine, which means that it is Turing complete. Animal communication is far too limited for that. 

Edit -- more reasons:

* it supports recursion ("My mom said that her mom said that her mom said that her mom said that the dog by the flowers in the grass near the lake in the canyon...").

* it supports abstract concepts: animals can't talk about the weather or love or what Bob did last week.  In this story, the chimps can only say that something exists nearby. Furthermore, they use pitch on an analog scale to say how big something is. We don't do that. We use discrete units, although we might embellish our speech with inflection or volume for effect. Ant communication is Turing complete. It takes very very little to create a Turning complete system. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness#Examples

Yes non-human animal communication is far less complex than human communication. However there is no clear boundary between the two. 

Edit: Also in terms of what they can compute analog systems are not less powerful than digital systems.   Does the fact that the same phonemes can have different meanings not detract from the digitality of language? [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Sentience does not imply an ability to talk.  The challenge here is establishing intentional communicative information exchange.  Chimps have failed at various other tests for this, so it is more prudent to be cautious about such descriptions. [deleted] Talking and communicating are not completely interchangeable. Barks and dances are indeed communication. However, I believe talking involves a language, and I'm not entirely sure we should go so far as to classify these forms of animal communication as languages. 
I've got linguistics notes on this somewhere if you want me to get into some hairy details about how we define language.  Arguably human language is far more sophisticated than what the chimpanzees are doing.

One need not "feel threatened" to believe there are legitimate qualitative differences between humans and other species.

What does "just as sentient" mean? It's not arguable. Human language is definitely more sophisticated than animal *communication*.

Edit: I am aware that human language is a subset of animal communication. From how I said it, it should be obvious that I meant every kind of animal communication except human speech.  Better way to put it might be that people aren't facing that we are animals, just like them, and are pretty closely related. The core make up of our self perception abilities, our experience of love, hunger, fear, pain, etc, is probably shared by them.

Sort of like when Europeans had to get over the hump of realising that the Africans were just like them even if they looked and spoke differently. Function is what matters, not appearance. Steven Hawking looks more different from almost anybody else looks to each other, but he's obviously intelligent. [deleted] [deleted] This might be true in a more... global sense.

However, in the article being discussed, scientists and good journalists, are right to be careful before suggesting they have observed language in another species.  Language, or talking, has specific requirements which have not yet been proven. 

I would suggest to you that, in the absence of evidence its OK to say we don't know, but not OK to assume they are "just like us" and then try and prove otherwise. One important question to ask is, appropriately enough, "do chimps ask each other questions?" Even in cases where apes have been taught some sign language and took part in limited conversations with humans, they have not asked a single question. One theory is that these apes do not have a theory of mind, they do not realize that other apes and humans have minds separate from their own. This is why it is sometimes said that they have the mental capacity of small children, because it is not until a certain age that human children develop a theory of mind. [deleted] Co Co is her name I believe. She is one of the most interesting experiments in both animal and human social behavior. She did indeed ask about the kitten when it got out and died. Even cried out loud when they told her what happened. Other incredibly interesting things she shows us was turning away from a movies ending in which a mother sends her child off somewhere. She recognized the characters relationship and was saddened at the thought of a mother saying goodbye to her child. When Robin Williams visited her she recognized him from his movies and almost immediately took to him.   [deleted] [deleted] As far as I know, there is not conclusive evidence that talking is the right concept for whats observed.  Many people would consider a required property of language be the fact that we can represent abstract concepts with words.  

I believe there is still significant debate if any other species are able to formulate even basic abstractions of the world around them or if their abilities are learned (monkey see, monkey do).  

I would be incredibly interested in any sources, with strong evidence, demonstrating what we consider higher thought is occurring.

EDIT: Added from my other comment for clarity.

For example, you might say cell signalling is a form of communication between living things. However, there is no thought process happening. The jump from communication to language is significant and so far un-observed outside of humans to my knowledge.

I know how what I'm saying sounds, so let me clarify. I'm simply saying its hard to differentiate between communication and language, thus far the evidence is not strong for language.

EDIT 2:  I'm not going to reword my statement, but referring to language and communication as distinct and separate was not a great idea on my part. 

2009 Article on animal language, http://ac.els-cdn.com/B9780080450469018684/3-s2.0-B9780080450469018684-main.pdf?_tid=e30d8b14-a11a-11e4-a9e3-00000aab0f02&amp;acdnat=1421809937_b9c35f753d83f57f76a4286a4ce82550.

Conclusion:

"Language research with animals has made fundamental
contributions to knowledge and has caused
us to reassess long-standing assertions and questions
that pertain to claims regarding language and human
uniqueness. Are humans unique? Yes, but probably no more so than most other species of animal life. Are
humans a creature apart from other species with regard
to advanced cognitive competencies? The answer
clearly is Perhaps more in degree than in kind. [deleted] [deleted] Communication of ideas requires abstraction. It's self evident as far as I'm concerned. Finely structured language isn't a prerequisite.
  
Higher pitches communicate smaller fruits, lower pitches communicate larger fruits.
  
Hell, my dog can think in abstract terms. When I say "outside" she knows what I mean. I don't have to pick her up and let her observe the outdoors while saying it. The concept of "outside" is an abstraction, recognized - understood and elicits a clear emotional response. 
  
The dog example is just to remind everyone that there are animals obviously capable of thinking in the abstract.
  
Studies like this one show their primitive usage of communication in the abstract among themselves - independent of human intervention. Largeness and smallness are relative terms. Relative to the primate itself. It may be the most basic of abstractions, but it is one. To describe something by its size requires interpretation of objective reality, and understanding of one object in relationship to others. The abstraction is inherent and the communication requires intelligence of the animals own world.

  
 To say nothing of the rest of your comment, It seems to me that dogs are good with pattern recognition. I can say "pizza crust" and my dog knows he's about to get food. He doesn't act disappointed if its kibble or a pretzel. He just associates it with food, because he is often presented with pizza crust when I talk to him about pizza crust. Similarly, when an ape says "outside" he knows he's about to be leashed and put in the yard. He'll even walk across the house to prepare for leashing, but it seems more like classical conditioning than comprehension of outside as an abstract concept  &gt;my dog knows he's about to get food.
  
That would be abstraction in itself.
   
"Pattern recognition" is necessary to receive the communication of an abstraction. In our own development in understanding language we learn what "things" visual, auditory, otherwise represent an abstract idea by the reinforcement of its connection. Even beyond the developmental stage the recognition of patterns is perpetually vital to finding meaning in our objective world.
  

   [deleted] [deleted] Yes primates are smart, so are octopi and dogs. Sometimes I find it hard to relate to chimps when humans are soooo far superior. I mean when you analyze what we have been able to do as a race, nothing touches even the smallest of things. Koko knows sign language, which I think is very impressive, but she can answer simple questions and does not ask questions. There is still an outrageous gap between human and primates, I mean looking at the top inventions of all time, it is outrageous what we have accomplished. [deleted] How do you know it's less introspective?  my vocabulary/knowledge is lacking here, the driven for improvement/wealth/layering cultural knowledge.... ness.  Recursive thought, which is a huge linguistic stepping stone.  [deleted] [deleted] I don't think this is evidence that animals are "just as sentient as we are," but as always, it's hopeless trying to define the term. Sort of. This is far from the first time animal communication of this kind has been reported, but it consistently differs from human speech in that it is finite, while human speech is infinite. Any given sentence in any given human language (barring the minority interpretation of what's going on in Pirah) has an infinite number of components, and many of these components have an infinite number of options. Animal communication systems like this are finite in both regards. You could make a list of every idea that it is possible to communicate with these systems, and researchers have. Some are quite long, but still limited. These might seam like a pedantic distinction, but it's what leads to the originality of human speech- any given utterance may be, and in fact many utterances are, completely original and never stated before. 

edit- autocorrect doesn't know the difference between a language and a fish. Actually even bees can tell each other where tasty food is.  This isn't even a good indication of chimp intelligence. I assume you mean Pirah, the South American language that Daniel Everitt claims has no recursion, and not piranha, the South American fish? What sort of language like communications do they use? How do the tell each other about a certain type of berry and the other chimp would know exactly what kind of berry he is talking about. I'm just confused on this whole topic. Chimpanzees have a very complex communication system that includes a variety of vocalisations, but also facial expressions and gestures. You need the quotes until you've established that there is grammar.  You also need to establish that this is intentional communication and not "that tree is for the high ranked in our group" iconic signal. Some would argue that there is a difference between taking and communicating. I could communicate to someone where I found an apple without talking by gesturing to the fruit and then to a tree. Talking implies a shared verbal language is being used. With that being said I can use grunts to layer a tone to my gestures and you would understand which grunts are excitement, anger, and sadness but whether or not that is talking relies in your definition of language.  Do you consider those who use sign language to be talking? I agree with your distinction between communication and language, however not all languages are verbal, as sign language involves recursion and has its own syntax as well. I'm guessing many people consider talking to be the human form of verbal communication. I don't know if it technically is or if it can apply to other animals.  I would find it extra interesting if the chimps lied. Perhaps Lucy is known to eat regularly from the mango tree, but tells other chimps that the bananas are the best, so that they stay away from her beloved mangos. [deleted] chimpanzees are pretty complex creatures, though Im sure theyre not having long-winded conversations

most mammals and apes ought to be treated with special delicate respect Wait, there's more to the primates talking story! And a funny twist.. read below!

The green monkey live in social groups and have special sounds that serve as warnings if a particular predator approaches. To us it all sounds like gibberish, but the sounds are very specific. Scientists tried to record then playback previously recorded sounds and they noticed that some sounds in particular triggered full group alarm. Some of these sounds mean "Hey, there's a lion approaching, run away!", or "hey, an eagle is coming, hide away!". The reaction is very different when the danger is airborne. And now the tricky part. If one of the monkey finds some particular fruit in the forest that another monkey wants, the second monkey sometimes shouts the "Hey, lion!" warning so that the first one runs away and the liar picks up and eats the delicious fruit. So here we have not only communication in a way that we barely understand but full and deliberate capacity to deceive the fellow monkey.

source: the most interesting Coursera course I have taken so far: A Brief History of Humankind by Dr. Yuval Harari [deleted] [deleted] &gt;"Smaller trees elicited still higher pitched calls, while calls associated with bigger trees with more fruit were lower in pitch."

That's amazing. In my mind, it's almost as if they understand supply and demand and act more excited (higher-pitched calls) when something both tastes good (Nauclea fruit) and is a more limited resource (smaller trees). Of course, that could just be me imparting our sensibilities on them, but still an interesting read for sure. Or could it be they've noticed the relationship that smaller things tend to make higher pitched sounds (baby chimp for ex) and bigger makes lower pitched sounds Or it could be a coincidence. Or if they had it reversed, they might use a low voice for a low tree, and a high voice for a high tree.  We can still impart our sensibilities on it so we can't conclude anything. high pitch and high elevation are coincidentally linked in our language - there's nothing intrinsic there. whereas a physically small chimp makes a sound that we refer to as a "high" pitch. that pitch isn't inherently large or tall, that's just the word we happen to use. but the baby is literally small, like the small, or short, tree. Ah, that makes sense. But "low" and "high" is made up...small and big in relation to pitch is factual and something they could notice in nature I wonder if they lie to keep their favorite fruit to themselves? You see this behavior in small children (who are liars but typically very bad ones), I think they'd be completely capable of ig.   Bees return to the hive and direct other to where the flowers are with a dance.  It's called the waggle dance.
 [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] There's a great documentary called ["Chimps are people too"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiZJwEzpXTU) which explores this and how they communicate. It's amazing because there's a part in the documentary where they have two chimps in separate cages, each with a separate tool, and they put a single apple outside of one cage. The chimps were able to work together with their tools to coordinate and get the apple, and then they split it. It's funny how close and yet so far chimps are.  But just 50,000 years ago there was a plethora of nonhuman species that actually talked to each other (Neandethals, Denisovans, H. floresiensis, etc.), 500,000 years ago there were even more- and then modern humans swept them all away.  Meanwhile these chimps have probably not advanced or changed too much compared to 3,000,000 years ago.  They and a few others left behind in tropical forests are all we have left.   The article is not published yet so it is hard to know exactly what the importance of this finding is, but here is the link : 
Wild chimpanzees modify food call structure with respect to tree size for a particular fruit species
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004643 I could not find a link to the paper or abstract in here, so I went out -

I believe this is the paper mentioned...

**Wild** **chimpanzees** **modify** **food** **call** **structure** **with** **respect** **to** **tree** **size** **for** **a** **particular** **fruit** **species**

Abstract:
&gt;The extent to which animal vocalizations are referential has long been debated since it reflects on the evolution of language. Our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, has been shown to have functionally referential food calls in captivity but evidence for such capabilities in the wild is lacking. We investigated the context specificity and function of West African chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes verus, food calls in the wild using all day focal follows of adult males and females of one habituated group in the Ta forest, Cte dIvoire. We collected over 750 h of observation and analysed 379 food calls produced for five different food species and found that higher pitched calls were produced for a single fruit species. Additionally, within this species, chimpanzees modified calls according to tree size, whereby smaller trees elicited higher pitched calls. Our results suggest that chimpanzees subtly vary the acoustic structure of food calls with respect to food patch size for a putatively highly valued fruit species, and we propose that arousal alone cannot sufficiently explain the patterns observed. Further work is needed to determine whether variation in food call pitch can influence receiver foraging behaviour. However, in light of our results, we propose that understanding the information content encoded by acoustic variation in chimpanzee food calls requires receiver knowledge about the natural ecological context, specifically spatial memory of tree locations. Therefore, this study highlights the potential significance of feeding ecology in the evolution of flexibly modulated vocal communication.

This strikes me as something that even birds probably communicate to each other. The infants also 'cry wolf' in order to hide food, as food is shared, and the little ones get the least. Soon we may decipher the chimpanzee's language and learn to talk with our primate cousins. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] I'm not sure why this would be surprising. If you consider the wealth of information that humans can communicate through vocal sounds, it stands to reason that animals can get at least a decent percentage of similar information across. When you consider that we're discussing an animal that's not too far behind us on the evolutionary scale, I'm surprised they don't communicate more thoughts and feelings. The chimps particularly like Nauclea trees. I wonder if that's the same variety that has been found containing opiates... "In short, the chimps seem to "talk" a lot about Nauclea fruits!"

[Nauclea fruits, the natural source of the synthetic drug Tramadol](http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2013/09/african-plant-natural-source-tramadol) 
-makes sense why they would talk alot about these babies haha 

"used by local populations to treat a wide variety of ailments  including epilepsy, malaria, general pain and many infectious diseases" its curious that our species attempts to communicate with alien species, when we haven't made much progress with species on our own planet. Why is there so much shit deleted?  Most likely racism.  That much?  Will the day ever come when scientists agree that chimpanzees are really talking? I don't like the idea of defining a lot of behaviors as 'strictly or primarily human'; I prefer to think of these as one of two: 'typical/likely of advanced species' or 'exclusive to civilization-forming species'. why the comments are deleted Maybe we can start seeing tree locations on yelp. But seriously, chimps are total extroverts. Why do they care about tree size? To help identify the tree in question, maybe How hard is it to climb? or maybe how much fruit there is.  Larger trees -&gt; more fruit. This makes more sense. I can't imagine a hungry chimp shying away from a slightly taller tree. Bigger trees bear more fruit, probably. [deleted] why do we care about building size? [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] There's a parasite based in Africa that causes uncontrollable, unrelenting, and untreatable itching while the parasite lives.  Most people commit suicide within a couple years. What's worse is even once a person receives treatment for the parasite, it can take over a year for the itching to stop as you have to receive continuous treatment until all of the eggs have hatched and been killed. [deleted] [deleted] K thanx gonna go make it extinct now.  TIL Jimmy Carter is a redditor.  A filarial worm. It causes "river blindness" because it's intermediate host is the black fly which lays it's eggs around fresh water. People going in the river would get the worm through a black fly taking a blood meal.  The disease is called River Blindness, and is caused by the Onchocerca species Malaria Still kills 500,000 per year. On the plus side, Bill Gates is doing his best to wipe it out. With lasers that shoot mosquitos midair Which is pretty easily treatable Which makes the number of deaths even scarier You won't like the knowledge gained from answers you seek.

[deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] According to a relatively recent NatGeo, only about 1 in ten of the cells in your body have your DNA.  Fortunately the mass ratio skews much more in your favor, but by numbers alone, the parasites win, hands down. I had a nightmare inducing shit this morning! [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] So even PETA can't object to this monster being kicked out of the web of life. One of the people responsible in large part for eradicating the guinea worm in Madhya Pradesh province of India was a close family friend and a true hero. I feel like this is the right place to post this. 

He immigrated to India to help those in need and founded the Barli institute. The institute focuses on education of women from rural areas of Madhya Pradesh province so they can send them back to their villages with the knowledge to better the entire village and educate others. It's really amazing the impact that one person can have on so many people, he was truly dedicated and his approach was one of the driving factors behind controlling and eventually eradicating the guinea worm from India. 

I remember when he came back to the UK for one of his rare visits was to accept an OBE from the queen in recognition of his work in India, he showed me the medal and told me that before the ceremony he asked if he could forgo all of it and take a donation to the barli institute instead. He was told that this was not possible but it just shows how dedicated he was and always thinking of helping people first before anything else. 

Sadly he died some years ago when the taxi he was a passenger in was involved in an accident, but if any one ever doubts how much of a difference they can make you can just look at his story, and if any one is ever looking for a good cause to get behind the Barli institute, his legacy is still there and championing womens rights in India and sustainable living through education.

Here's to one of the unsung heroes of the world. 

More about the institute http://jimmymcgilligancentre.org/

Edit: Thank you for the gold, and Thank you to user  sumofdifference for the correction. The institute is located in Indore City, which is in  Madhya Pradesh Province. 

 Hi, I am from Indore, just a minor correction. Indore is not a province but a city in Madhya Pradesh state(province).


Though I haven't heard about Jimmy before ,I really appreciate the work he is doing for women and marginalised section especially tribals. [deleted] *Pediculus humanus capitis* AKA the head louse AKA hair lice is a parasite that needs human blood to live. *Cimex lectularius* AKA bedbugs also live exclusively on human blood. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Nope, we just recently discovered that canines can serve as an animal reservoir:

http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/health/a-dogs-life-in-chad-filling-up-on-fish-guts-and-on-guinea-worms.html

Which is very fortunate, because now we know we need to keep an eye on dogs in areas where it was once endemic.  Had this discovery not been made, much of the work to eradicate Guinea Worm could have been massively undermined That's a different species of worm. D. insignis not D. medinensis. It specifically mentions that species only affects dogs and carnivores in North America. Humans are carnivorous  (technically omnivores, but I think that qualifies) arent dogs also omnivores? i mean i know they love meat but i see my dog eating the tall grass in my backyard all the time I know that deer will eat mice and other small rodents from time to time, but they're only consumed for the mineral content of the skeleton, it's best compared to being medicinal than anything else. Same thing in reverse with your dog. They're solidly in the carnivore column but plenty of those on one side or the other are really omnivores when they need or want to be.  Dogs are carnivores by classification, but then so are Giant Pandas, and they're herbivorous.  But even [hypercarnivores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercarnivore), like lions, only get around 70% of their diet from meat.  In this case, "carnivores" refers to an order of mammals, the [Carnivora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivora), which includes animals such as cats, wolves, bears, weasels, and seals. Personally, I prefer the term "carnivoran," which is less ambiguous. Someone needs to update the Wikipedia page.  In short, probability. Imagine that they could infect many different mammals, or even just primates. That would mean it has evolved countermeasures against the defensive systems of every single species that it infects. If those species' defenses are only slightly different, the organism must have different means of combating each one separately. It is much more probable for an organism to evolve traits that damage one species than it is to evolve against multiple.  Err...

&gt;The Guinea worm is a parasite that enters the human body when the unwitting host-to-be drinks water contaminated with tiny water fleas in which Guinea worm larvae lurk. 

It specifically infects at least one other species during its life cycle. And the lack of animal hosts for the worm has not been proved. It's just that we haven't found any. A second host that a parasite needs to complete its life cycle is different than a host that it can use as an alternative. It has to go human-&gt;water flea-&gt;human, so eliminate it from either of those two organisms and it's extinct. That's different from water flea-&gt; human or dog. In that case you can eliminate it from humans and have it come back later from dogs. So they could have been more precise when it comes to saying it only has one host, but the significance regarding eradication is the same. It's probably a matter of primary vs secondary hosts. 

They might only infect and reproduce within humans but mature outside of humans, in those water fleas. So if you eradicate their breeding ground, you eradicate the species. 

The article also talks about dogs being primary hosts, but I'd imagine most people given filtered water wouldn't make their dogs drink dirty ass water anymore.  The Rod of Asclepius (the symbol for medicine and health care) is thought by some to be a depiction of a way you get rid of a guinea worm emerging from your foot: by winding it around a stick and gently pulling. Except that doesn't work all that well, it shortens it by what,  3 days?  Even then that's three weeks to remove it And it's the only way it's removed to this day. The time the worm spends slowly crawling out of you is the most painful, and due to the open hole in your body, the most dangerous. Removing it and treating the wound as soon as possible after it breaks through the skin is the priority. Trying to dig around for it while inside the body would likely do more harm than good. I saw that in a movie, the cell.. But it wasn't a worm... [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] I am willing to part with that flower. But then I guess there'd be another being that depends on that flower, and it's a whole chain reaction :( [deleted] That's very unlikely to be a bigger deal than malaria already is. [deleted] Not really an effect of them going extinct, but it would probably be extremely difficult to target specific species unless they are somehow totally isolated. A poison that kills blood sucking species A will probably also kill nectar drinking species B. [deleted] Yep. They release sterilized males out into the wild by the millions and it reduces there numbers by crazy. You do that enough and it makes them extinct. Mosquito researcher here.  This will never happen.  Mosquitoes have a very plastic genetic code and have tons of progeny.  They will adapt to any mating or transgenic scheme we try to use.  There is also no way to just kill them without harming aquatic ecosystems.

Personal protection products and modern sanitation are the key.  We may be able to one day eradicate vector borne pathogens. Jimmy Carter can ex-president like a fucking boss. Possibly the best former president in history. He's the only man in history to use the US Presidency as a stepping stone to greatness.  He had to.  He was too smart to be a good president. [deleted] [deleted] Smallpox isn't extinct, the CDC has vials. "Extinct" is kind of ambiguous when it comes to viruses. Viruses are literally just bad nucleic acid data wrapped in a protein and sometimes an envelope. Even if we destroyed all the existing vials, we still have the viral sequence, so it could totally be reconstituted. The only way to truly make it "extinct" would be to erase all existing copies of the data detailing its sequence, which would be virtually impossible in the digital age, barring something like global mass extinction that includes all humans. But ultimately, we say the virus is "eradicated" because to our best knowledge it does not exist anywhere on earth in a legitimately infectious state. Is there any thought to the unintended consequences of completely eradicating viruses in this way? I always thought of viruses as similar to other forms of life, in the sense that they breed/spread/expand in a biological fashion and thus when extinct are somewhat analogous to a species going extinct, but it seems by your explanation they are easy to recreate in a lab setting (versus say, recreating a dodo bird). Is it simply a difference of degrees to the difficulty in recreating these biological materials and entities in a lab? Viruses are incredibly simple compared to other forms of life, and in fact it's debatable whether they qualify as "life".  Recreating a Dodo bird using just genetic data would be a much bigger task with today's technology.
 I understand that it's debatable, but I wouldn't consider a virus alive any more than I would consider a CD to be a computer. It's a program that needs somebody else's machinery to execute it. That's not alive. The amount of information in a virus is several orders of magnitude less than you would find in a microscopic creature not to mention a dodo bird.

Imagine comparing a floppy disk to a super computer.

That's not even getting into the way the information is ordered which ultimately is the difference between rocks, viruses, bacteria and people. &gt; The only way to truly make it "extinct" would be to erase all existing copies of the data detailing its sequence

Declaring [damnatio memoriae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnatio_memoriae) on a virus? Oh, and it's not a parasite Viruses are considered obligate parasites. You are partially right though. They are not fully considered parasites, they are not considered living organisms whatsoever.  A lot of virologists would take issue with that last statement.  A lot of biologists will tell you that the question 'are viruses alive?' is a lot more important than the answer.  It's almost like binary classifications nearly inevitably run into issues.   [deleted] [deleted] Yup. Not a virologist but I am an epidemiologist and stand firmly in the "viruses are alive" camp. See: [quasispecies model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasispecies_model) and [viral quasispecies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_quasispecies).

In the eyes of an epidemiologist, viruses (and prions) aren't really *that* different from other living infectious agents. They have pretty clear population structures, they evolve, and they can be inactivated so they are no longer infectious/contagious. Yes, they can't reproduce without a host (just like many other obligate pathogens whose "living"status is undisputed) but they do have really complex host/environment/concomitant pathogen interactions. Epidemiology doesn't even attempt to explain the differences in different types of organisms. In the eyes on an epidemiologist candida and e coli might as well be animals despite neither actually being so. It is an irrelevant distinction to epidemiology. 

As far as the biology of viruses go, they don't meet many of the common definitions of "life". They are inert while outside of a host and they don't truly "exist" as intact units while inside the host. If you can call a pile of engine and auto body parts a car then you could call a virus alive, I suppose... But from a molecular perspective viruses are at the mercy of the host cells processes. 

Other obligate intracellular pathogens don't get disassembled. They simply require something that the host cell makes. They would be more aptly compared to specific plant species that require specific conditions in their soil or extremophiles that are taking something in from the environment and thriving on it.  Well, think about it this way...the very definition of "what is alive?" is going to be different depending on which field of biology you're in and *none of the answers are the "right" answer*. I know that's super hard to accept but it's the truth. **It's a philosophical argument.**

&gt;they don't meet many of the common definitions of "life".

You mean...the organismal biology definition of life.

&gt; But from a molecular perspective viruses are at the mercy of the host cells processes.

Not totally at the mercy of them. They are totally *dependent* on their host to accomplish their goal (replication), but the same argument could be said for any number of obligate biotrophs (e.g. mollicutes). Viruses have effectors/pathogenicity factors that weaken or totally defeat host defenses like RNA silencing. You could say they're the perfect parasite, in a way. 

&gt; They are inert while outside of a host and they don't truly "exist" as intact units while inside the host.

Is the ability to totally disassemble really a legitimate argument against something being alive? i think what you're trying to get at here is that they have a lower level of organization than anything that is indisputably alive (other living things have organelles.) I would accept that as a mark against viruses being alive, but *only* from an organismal biology perspective.

&gt; If you can call a pile of engine and auto body parts a car then you could call a virus alive, I suppose...

Yeah but do those engine parts replicate? Do they self-assemble into a working engine if put inside of a car? Do they evolve to reproduce more efficiently?

&gt; They would be more aptly compared to specific plant species that require specific conditions in their soil or extremophiles that are taking something in from the environment and thriving on it.

Yeah, they're obligate biotrophs and fastidious. But so are a lot of things that are alive, and not all of them are even parasites. I agree with you that there isn't a correct answer. I was more arguing that epidemiology isn't exactly the most appropriate ruler to use to determine its "aliveness". You said that epidemiology landed you squarely in the " viruses are alive" camp and I don't exactly see how it could push you in either direction.  Just because something evolves, does that mean it's alive? Evolution is a passive process.  Memes evolve, but they aren't alive.  This is a good point. It's hypothesized that life began with the first self-replicating chemical process. It would not be considered alive at all, and yet it evolved into all the life we see today.  Both smallpox and rinderpest are viruses. Guinea worm is an endoparasitic worm. Not quite the same as OP's title.  Neither is rinderpest They're functionally extinct. They no longer cause disease or epidemics in the wild. The term would technically be extirpated, or extinct in the wild. Can someone please educate me on this subject a bit? The headline states this would be the 3rd parasite/disease to become extinct after smallpox due to human efforts. If smallpox is extinct and if extinct means what I think it means then why does the military still get smallpox shots? No, I am not a hippie opposed to vaccinations just someone who hates the scar that was left behind and remembers how much it sucked having to quarantine myself in my own house from my kids in order to avoid getting them sick. I remember reading Richard Preston's *The Demon in the Freezer* which is an account of the smallpox eradication effort(I highly recommend it BTW). He said that there were still samples of smallpox in the US and Russia and there was a major concern that the Russians might sell it to, say, Iran. If there are still biologically viable specimens out there then I wonder if we can truly say that smallpox is extinct. There's also always the possibility that the sequenced DNA could be used to construct a new smallpox virus, even if destroyed everywhere.  But at that you could conceivably construct an endless array of *other* deadly viruses.  We could never know for sure there isn't some natural reservoir of smallpox hiding out in the world somewhere. When we say a species is extinct, there is an implicit "as far as we know". There have been cases of species being declared extinct and then finding some more in some remote location.
 Who needs nuclear weapons and MAD when we have genetic sequencing? That is a truly scary thought. When they say "extinct", I think they mean extinct from the wild. There's plenty of smallpox in captivity in laboratories, weapons programs etc. The threat of weaponized smallpox seeing the light of day is real enough to warrant vaccinating soldiers.  Smallpox isn't "gone," it's just no longer a common threat.  We have samples of it, and other people might as well.  But it's very unlikely that it still exists "in the wild" since we'd notice the outbreaks.  Basically "extinct" doesn't mean what we'd normally use it to mean - no one is going to find a dinosaur or a dodo that happened to survive - but there is still some chance that you could be exposed to smallpox.  It's probably extremely unlikely, though, unless you're terribly unlucky or exposed by someone who has access to preserved samples. Smallpox is one of our "success stories," but the military isn't going to take any chances. It might be extinct out there in public/environment sense, but I'm sure there is still smallpox somewhere in a lab that has been weaponized or something along those lines.  Makes sense that they would cover all their bases I guess? I thought Smallpox was an infectious virus, not a parasite In the context of pathology, all disease causing organisms are classed as parasitic. 

Parasitic interactions are simply where one party gains and the other suffers.  And hopefully the brazilian will wipe out crabs. [deleted] [Save the Guinea Worm Foundation](http://www.deadlysins.com/guineaworm/) Is this a good extinction?  They are parasites, and pretty horrifying ones at that. I doubt that there are many people who would be sad to see them go the way of the Dodo. 

 A moment of silence for our terrifying worm friends. They've seen it all. Do you like playing host to a creature to alien? That was my question.  Whenever the conversation is about Monsanto, etc., it's all about how biological diversity is a great and necessary thing that shouldn't be stifled.  But the fact that diversity is necessary doesn't lend value to things that are harmful to humans?  Someone ELI5, please.


*Edit - I love reddit.  Thanks, guys. When people talk about biodiversity with crops (Monsanto^* and those) they're talking about diversity within a single species.  Less diverse species are more prone to disease, and more sensitive to unusual conditions.  That means higher risks of a major crop failure.  

When we talk about invasive species destroying native ones, or it being possible that killing off some type of mosquito would spiral out of control, that's more ecologically motivated.  We have a long history of thinking we have a brilliant idea and it panning out terribly ([see mongooses in Hawaii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Asian_mongoose#Introduction_to_Hawai.27i)).  These small changes have a tendency to spiral out of control and change things we don't expect, and while we're probably better at predicting the effects than we once were, the general lesson has been to just not mess with it.  Big changes like this might kill off species we like - simple things like wanting to be able to see a variety of pretty birds or the idea that we want places to have the animals they've always had so future generations can enjoy them, but also sometimes scarier problems like killing off a kind of bee that our crops depend on, or a kind of fish that we actually want to eat.

Guinea worms are horrifying parasites that cause terrible pain, suffering, and fear.  They're also human-only parasites that spend most of their lifetimes hidden away in humans, so they're not likely to have a big impact elsewhere.  So we're particularly motivated to get rid of them, and they're particularly unlikely to matter when they're gone.

^* There's also a larger bag of cats to unwind in the Monsanto case.  Some people automatically hate anything genetically engineered because we're messing with nature, or because it can't be healthy if it's not natural.  We don't really prioritize vitamins and nutrition in genetic engineering as much as things like appearance or shipping properties though, so they could actually be right in a stopped-clock kind of way.  One of the main things that we engineer are pest-resistant and herbicide-resistant plants; maybe supporting a system of farming based on increasingly powerful herbicides isn't so great either.  And Monsanto itself has done some sketchy things that reflect poorly on them if not genetic engineering as a whole. Most organisms, by virtue of being alive, provide useful traits to an ecosystem. For example, a sparrow will eat insects, and poop out nitrogen-rich compounds that can be used by plants. If the sparrow dies naturally, its body will d

Obligate parasites like guinea worm very rarely provide any useful "service" to the ecosystem. As an example, the malaria *plasmodium* does not aid either the mosquito or the humans in any way at all. It does not contribute anything, it only takes. The guinea worm is the same way. It is a biological "thief", and a dead end. Eliminating it will not affect the biodiversity of the planet in any significant way, since parasites will practically always evolve to become *more* dependent on their hosts, not less.

Also I should note that any species that *requires* the existence of another species, and only that species, in order to survive, is "rolling the dice" so to speak with extinction. This is, incidentally, considered a rather large issue with many of humanity's crops/livestock, most of which really couldn't compete very well in a natural environment. This due to humans hijacking the normal natural selection process over several millennia by selecting traits that benefit humanity, rather than traits that allow the plant/animal to compete against other plants/animals. Which is just fine... unless we suddenly end up with a situation where a fungus or something comes along and, say, wipes out all of our corn at once. That would be bad... &gt; a fungus or something comes along and, say, wipes out all of our corn at once. 

[Or our bananas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_disease). &gt; But the fact that diversity is necessary doesn't lend value to things that are harmful to humans? Someone ELI5, please.

Morally speaking we are entirely within our rights to wipe out things that mean us harm and can't be reasoned with. Full stop.

Furthermore, outside of humans and arguably our stable of manipulated species by extension, the rest of nature doesn't seem to respect agreements, etc.

For example:

Nature might need mosquitos, but they don't need to feed on humans. If we could manipulate them in such a fashion as to avoid or die from human blood. Problem solved.

On the microscopic level, eradicating any one virus or parasite isn't likely to have any effect on the environment as a whole, especially if it's human specific. it should be written to become extinct due to INTENTIONAL  human efforts.  [deleted] Jenny McCarthy or some other anti-medicine fuckwit. [deleted] Those commercials have haunted me ever since I saw one as a small child Give it time and antivaxxers will manage to being it back. Guinea worm eradication is being done with cloth filters and ensuring that people don't drink from water sources contaminated with them not vaccination (this should not be taken as saying I am in any way, shape or form against vaccination).

And once a disease is properly *eradicated* even anti-vaxxer morons can't bring it back. The only people receiving smallpox vaccination these days after all are military people (due to bioweapon fears that will hopefully never eventuate) and researchers working in one of the two labs which still have samples. Jimmy Carter for president! Save the guinea worm! Holy fuck I really didn't need to know that thing existed.  Thanks Jimmy Carter How come Jimmy Carter hardly gets a fraction of the recognition that bill gates does? So there's no animal reservoir? One reason we can't kill yersina pestis (bubonic plague) is that it lives fine in rodents. I'm sure that moms in California will find a way to bring it back.  Minor correction: smallpox is not a parasite what a world we live where science has eradicated real life nightmares. I'm okay with that. :) In middle school I did a report on Guinea Worms.

I'm glad they're gone.  Kill them all with fire. Al Jazeera has a great documentary on this. I had never heard of guinea worm before watching it but the scenes from this film have stuck with me.
http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/lifelines/2014/04/how-slay-dragon-2014429133319221182.html When I hear about a rare type of animal going extinct I feel bad about it.

When I hear about a parasite or any disease going extinct I would consider that a big achievement unlock for the human race. Well this is as good of an excuse as any to post Hunter S Thompson's poem Ode to Jack (Kerouac).  It even mentions guinea worms

People who don't vaccinate are selfish, spoiled dopes!!

Sorry, I just had to get that statement out of me and I couldn't really post it anywhere but anonymously [on Reddit]. I've always wondered if there are any unexpected consequences in the food chain when a species has gone extinct, even if it's an organism that causes human suffering like this nasty little worm? Let's say we find a way to cause the mosquito to go extinct, will that be the end of anything that feeds off them them, such as certain species of bat? i read as woman and thought wtf How exactly do we know these things are gone forever? Couldn't they still be hiding in some remote cess pool somewhere waiting to reinfect something and spread out again? Smallpox isn't gone. Good, fuck parasitic worms. Useless pieces of evolution!!  Thanks largely in part by President Carter. [deleted] [deleted] Argh. Not one post noting they are talking about pupae. Pupae are rarely located where they can be exposed to light, and are such squishy weaklings that most anything will kill them.
Imagine trying to expose say 3000 bushels of grain to this light. The only way is to auger it out and expose as it flows. Conveniently the mechanical forces will also kill any pupae.
Not much use but still good research, the more we know about bugs the better! Scourge of our existence out here on the farms.

Still waiting for the final mosquito solution (terminator gmo males) to be approved for release! It exists and has been tested... let's do it Tell me more about this final solution to mosquitos  They release millions of sterilized males. Since females only mate once per life cycle, this effectively ends the future of mosquitos  It's going to be a really interesting day when we can tell our kids/grandkids about the fact that we wiped out an entire species intentionally.

"Oh yeah, there used to be these flying bugs that drank our blood and spread disease, but you don't have to worry about them, we wiped them the fuck out. Just like nature intended us to do."

Edit: Look, guys. I get that a lot of you are concerned about the larger effects of destroying a species. I get that. But I don't care that you care. I was making a joke. I don't want a debate. You want a debate? There's gotta be like, at least 20 other people in this thread who care as much as you do. "An entire species"

We probably wouldn't, but if you're talking about mosquitoes as a whole, there are [kind of a lot of kinds of mosquitoes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mosquito_genera). It's a whole family, with 41 genuses containing various subgenuses and a total of approximately one metric shitload of different mosquito species.  &gt; one metric shitload 

Ah yes, my favourite SI unit. Named for the Dutch virologist Anouk Shitlo. What an amazing guy. In Holland, Anouk is a girls name!  [deleted] Yeah, but the problem with the US Fuckton is that it converts to 713 Imperial Shitloads whereas with the metric shitload, standard SI prefixes apply.  And the key is that not all are disease vectors for humans. So we would want to *selectively* wipe out just a few kinds. Importantly, they don't seem to occupy an important ecological niche. Frogs and spiders have other insects to eat so we think the ecosystem will survive the extinction of mosquitos. Sounds like the tagline of an apocalypse movie Built on a solid foundation of misunderstanding science. &gt; It's going to be a really interesting day when we can tell our kids/grandkids about the fact that we wiped out an entire species intentionally.

We're already doing it with the Guinea Worm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracunculiasis#Eradication_program I'm still concerned they might play some hidden role in some natural process. They should probably keep some mosquitos as backup incase the plan backfires. will there be any serious repercussions to killing mosquitos, as noted for killing bees? [Eradicating any organism would have serious consequences for ecosystems  wouldn't it? Not when it comes to mosquitoes, finds Janet Fang.](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100721/full/466432a.html) From that same article "Something better or worse would take over." 

Don't think we should take that risk! As long as it isn't flying spiders... Well mosquitos are the undisputed heavy weight champions of killing humans so I would wager anything else would be better. Check out this [Radiolab episode](http://www.radiolab.org/story/kill-em-all/) that addresses exactly this. Two sides to every story, even devil bugs. For someone can't listen to an episode now, can you give a synopses of the other side? No, the sterilized males thing has been done and done don't listen to the other post.  The thing /u/evranch is talking about is a Genetically Modified Organism.  It is a modified mosquito that can still breed with regular Mosquitos.  The males born from these matings will be fine and go off to father more Mosquitos of the same line.  The females though... Hehe, when they try to leave the surface of the water for the first time as they break free from the pupal stage can not fly.  They do not have the DNA to create the muscles that power their wings.  So they sit on the surface and get eaten.  The males go on to cause this same thing to happen to the next generation.  Each time decimating the population until within a very short time it is gone or nearly so. Pests resistant to blue LED, coming soon.^TM [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Here in Taiwan it's popular to use what are essentially [electrified tennis rackets](http://www.giftbazaar.in/uploaded_files/product/Mosquito-Racket-1iFGl.jpg) to kill mosquitoes. If it helps your tennis game however I'm not sure. 

As for this article: Does range matter, as in if you use the light 1cm or 20cm away from the insect with the LED lights?  They are fun, lately i have been using the bug-a-salt though. [deleted] I contemplated buying a BugASalt, mainly for the fun-factor, but then realised, 'wait.. Won't I be flinging piles of salt all around my house?'
What's your experience been - is it more or less an outdoor-only device?
I also read that they break a lot, and they're not that cheap. I would expect a few years use out of it.
Cheers They sell those at the corners in Brazil too  You could also call those "weekly battery memberships" [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Kill the pests leave the rest. A healthy ecosystem is a diverse one.  But an ecosystem without mosquitos is a happy one. :) Unless you're a bat, or a bird, or one of the other animals which eats them. Bug zapper with a bird feeder attached underneath.  Problem solved,  saved the world.  They will just eat other bugs.  Sacrifices will be made. Would there actually be significant harm caused if every mosquito on earth were gone tomorrow? I think I remember reading somewhere that there were more than enough insects for animals who eat mosquitoes to get by on other bugs.  There are 170 million insects for every person on this planet. That's almost 8000 insects/m^2. The ecosystem will be fine. 

Edit: For some reason I am being downvoted. After some further research my estimations were significantly less than reality. Here is a [source](http://www.si.edu/Encyclopedia_SI/nmnh/buginfo/bugnos.htm) for the number of insects in the world. Here is a [source](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1997/07/970730060806.htm) for the estimated number of insects killed yearly in the United States by bug zappers (it's 71 billion).

Using this info, there are an estimated 19,605 insects for every square meter of this planet. Now, the united states is 9,857,306 km.
1.9e17 insects reside in the United States alone. 71 billion is **0.000009%** of the insects in the united states killed yearly by bug zappers. I can't say I've ever heard of an ecosystem being damaged from a 0.000009% decline in population.

Now I realize there are some gross assumptions being made here, but that is such a ridiculously small number that accounting for flying insects attracted to light won't have a significant impact. I'm sorry.

 When people talk about bugs, 90% of what they are annoyed by is mosquitos.  Other bugs fly around, mosquitos bite you and make you itchy. biting flies.  they exist. Deer flies are the worst. One camping trip I saw one fly away with a little piece of my daughters shoulder! She had a neat little square bitten off. I had the same with a horse fly.  Fuck those guys. Horse flies are worse than bees, god damn I hate those things Idk, that's why I use bugspray, which unfortunately doesn't do much to stop confused moths from flying into my face every five seconds. Depends on where you live really. There are plenty of other biting insects out there too. Propane powered devices do work that pull in mosquitoes via their response to CO2 but they cost several hundrad dollars and are expensive to operate. I just want the mosquito killing laser that some patent troll company holds but will never manufacture.  [mosquito laser](http://www.ted.com/talks/nathan_myhrvold_could_this_laser_zap_malaria?language=en) Nathan Myhrvold, the troll of all trolls. Who is this man and why is he a troll Very good at sucking in unsuspecting University of Washington graduates to be slaves in the troll's lair for a few years before they wise up.

I told about 3 of my PhD students not to work there . . . only 1 listened.   They played it up really well for the press but apparently it doesn't work all that well. The mosquitoes they used to make those videos were heavily sedated. Patent trolls are one of the things in this world that irrationally infuriate me when I am reminded of their existence. Mosquitoes are another.

There should be a law that you have to make your patent useful somehow (e.g. by selling it as a product) or sell it to someone who will.  The patent troll mosquito laser company is one of the most infuriating things in existence.  They could make a billion dollars with a backyard deathstar they've already invented and proved works, but decided to troll patents because patent trolls are horrible people in general, even to themselves. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] My mother swears by her Mosquito Magnet.  She lives in Alaska and they're pretty obnoxious in the spring and summer months.  Lots of damp places for them to breed... I've always thought about if you loaded the bug zappers with dry ice. Would that work you think? If you needed a temporary solution.  Yeah, but then you'd conversely have to set them far away from you, so you'd need a few of them.

I think that's the best backyard way to do it, or maybe not even dry ice so much as baking soda and vinegar, or alka-seltzer in water or something.  Why would you have to put them far away? Are you installing your bugzapper in a walk in closet?  In Houston, just bought a zapper this last summer and that thing was full of dead mosquitoes. I had to clean it out once a week to keep room for them to keep flying in...  Made a huge difference in my yard and being able to hang out outside. Sure my puppy was much happier too.  [deleted] Except that it affects individual organic molecules in the bugs. It's a seemingly unavoidable chemical response.  And if one mosquito isn't attracted to it, that one mosquito is the one that gets the chance to reproduce, potentially making more mosquitoes that aren't as attracted to the light. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [Original article](http://www.nature.com/srep/2014/141209/srep07383/pdf/srep07383.pdf). 

Having not read the journal article yet, I'm somewhat confused. If blue light is lethal, then just normal sunlight should kill a proportion of eggs... 

Also, if the mechanism of action is ROS as suggested, then why would there be a species-specific effect of wavelength? That makes no sense. 

Ok, reading more. 

If I did my math correctly, the amount of blue light they used is much less than the amount of blue light received on a sunny day.  The species-specific effect comes from the fact that different proteins in different insects have different maximum absorption wavelengths. It goes on to say that UV light is worse (for the insects) than visible light. By that logic, gamma rays kill insects even better!

Plus, it's unlikely that one could find a spectra that ONLY kills pests but doesn't harm important species, such as bees. Bees that move into my house are commonly called pests. Hijacking this just to say:

**If you ever get *bees (not wasps)* in or near your house and you want them gone**:

Before killing them or getting an exterminator to do it, please google beekeepers in your local area. Often times they or someone they know will be willing and able to remove the hive and preserve it. 

We all know honeybees are taking a beating lately. These folks will voluntarily perform this removal, so you get the bees gone and it doesn't cost you a dime. 

Please consider this conscientious option. I emailed a local beekeeper about a give right next to a parking lot. They never replied... I don't think they knew what you meant by a give.
 Beekeepers are notorious for not responding to their emails.  Try to call them instead or send a physical letter.  I love this comment. I genuinely cannot tell if you are being sarcastic. Either way, I love it. It just seems almost plausible... but I'm probably outing my anti-beekeeper biases... Call. In my experience beekeepers are usually older folks who are not that quick at replying to email or anything like that and usually don't have much of a handle on technology in general.  Bees that pollinate the food you consume are commonly not called pests. The article is talking about insects in the context of a farm. That is not the only application of the science. You can't draw a conclusion without knowledge of specifics of protein light absorption. LED light can have a narrow spectrum so while the power over some band might be smaller the peak power spectral density can be way larger. If an important molecule is "tuned" to absorb in this narrow region the impact can be very high.

Also, I think it would be a fair hypothesis that stimulating some wavelengths while keeping others absent (versus broad natural light) could have specific effects that explain the mortality. I think this might be it. In reef keeping, LED's have the reputation of not being as "good" for just this reason -- the spectral peaks are dramatic and don't provide a "complete" light source for most photosynthetic aquatic invertebrates... compared to say, Metal Halide or florescent lamps that may peak at 420, or 451nm, but have much broader spectral graphs. LED's are pretty unique in this way. 

I'm not a scientist, so something something Wien's law, and an overcast day can have a kelvin temp of 15k or so, which would have plenty of the blue/violet peaks -- but also much smoother spectrum, and this doesn't cause a gory, B-movie version of A Bug's Life... so...

EDIT - it's possible, based on cloud cover/corresponding kelvin temp, that certain bugs evolved to "stay home" during certain types of nanometer spikes/weather. Specific nano-meter spikes make them uncomfortable (to presumably keep away from predators that come out, or a storm rolling in or, maybe - like oak trees throwing acorns during prime number years, to limit competition overlap -- but with other species?[certain bugs go and chill out, out of sight during their spectral cue, possibly avoid a "critical mass" feast that would attract predators, by rationing traffic] ). 

Whatever the reason, when this spectral spike - that they don't like - is isolated and blasted at them, they die. 

EDIT 2 - perhaps a certain kelvin temperature of (blue) "morning light" annoys them to wake up, as another example of specific spectral peaks compelling behavior.
 [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] diatomaceous earth It has done magic for me Bingo. The perfect natural killer. I also derive some pleasure from the thought of those little fuckers slowly dying from a hundred small cuts as they try to walk with little razors on their legs. While I don't blame you even a tiny amount for that schadenfreude, it's also funny to consider that bed bugs have 0% knowledge of any harm they are doing, and are basically as sentient as Clippy the office assistant.

Then again, fuck Clippy, and fuck bed bugs. Let them all burn.  I'm very happy to consider and even react to the potential harm I cause to certain terrible species that are just going about their lives. Bedbugs are not one of these species.  Doesn't always work/isn't always practical depending on where they are coming from Sprinkle it on ankle-deep and give it time.  People may laugh but this kind of works.


Had an infestation a few years ago so after everything else  I decided to use myself as bait.   I bought a cheap air matress and put it on my hardwood floor then slept on it for the next three months while surrounded by a foot-wide, inch tall ring of diatomaceous earth.    

The little fuckers couldnt help it...they wouldn't starve themselves so they kept trying to get to me.   And they all died horribly. Fun fact, they can live a year without eating If they must, but that doesn't mean that they can't be lured into a trap with the temptation of food merely a few feet away.  How did they know you were there? Do they sniff people out and try to get to them? iirc bedbugs as well as a few other insects which eat people are attracted to CO2 since we breath it. It's also why kissing bugs have their name, they bite people near the mouth since it's where we exhale. First thing I thought of when I saw the title, too. We didn't spend nearly as much to get rid of them, but we live in an apartment area where they keep coming back from neighbors' units. I can't tell if being pretty allergic to them is a good thing or a bad thing, but sometimes it gets pretty overwhelming mentally, especially when I'm dealing with other things then I wake up with a few bites. I still have nightmares, Almost like flashbacks a couple time a week. just the thought causes me to break out. I was very suicidal for a while luckily dident act on it. its psychological jarring and has been compared to PTSD by a few medical professionals in some articles.

if it kills bedbugs, ill fund the crap out of this Where do you live so I know where not to move very close? I'm really sorry to hear that :(. I actually work for a pest control company and we specialize in bed bug heat remediation treatments. Our price is $1 per square foot of the home or apartment so most of the time the cost of treatment is around $1500. We also back up our work with a 6 month warranty and have k-9 specialist inspect on a follow up visit just to ensure the infestation is gone. I hate hearing about people who have lost everything due to bedbugs because we do whatever it takes for our customers and their families to not have to get rid of anything. It's a special feeling you get after saving someone's home and personal belongings that makes happy to do what I do. Anyways, I hope all is well now.  Bedbugs are ass to get rid of, and i don't blame the pco's we hired for having a tough time. Unfortunately heat treatment wasent available in my area, too small of a town i guess. I did inquire about it though after i saw it online. In the end it was the nabours that prevented us from fully removing the infestation. We have bedbugs right now. Let me just say, our lives are hell. On any given day my fiancee has 200+ bites in her stomach and back and I get them on my arms and legs. They're in all the furniture except our son's plastic bedding. We've had two treatments by a professional and he hasn't returned in over two months for the final treatment so it's pretty much pointless now. I've begun spreading DE to help but I'm afraid of putting it around the beds and couches in the wrong spots for fear of inhalation. When we get our tax refunds, we're literally leaving everything behind, save the clothes on our backs. Going to get new clothes, their the final pair out, get new shoes. Then we're getting an all new place to live with the basic essentials, beds, clothes, food, and will buy new electronics as we can. We're just counting down. These next few months will be shit, but we'll be a lot better off once those refunds come back. "Nearly" + evolution = soon to be useless!  It depends on what nearly actually means.

If it means that N% of insects are actually immune to it then yes that means it'll be useless.  If it means that N% of insects that fly by the light source simply don't get exposed enough to it then that just means you need more :) That is a disconcerting smiley face. Its the "shits gonna die" smiley. Not everything can be overcome by evolution.

Vinegar and bleach for instance have been effective and will remain effective against germs. dkmj17 is implying that "Nearly 100% lethal" means that there are some mosquitoes that are resistant to the effect. You're correct, but I don't think you're replying to the right argument. &gt; implying that "Nearly 100% lethal" means that there are either some mosquitoes that are resistant to the effect.

Not necessarily.  It might, but it might also imply that they didn't quite use enough to kill all of them.  Different amounts of toxins are lethal to different individuals (see LD50).  For all we know, repeated applications across multiple generations might, or might not be effective at providing a selection bias.
 You're right, and I was going to include that alternate explanation (which is why I accidentally left "either" in the comment before editing just now). In the end I gave them the benefit of the doubt for their argument.

We'd need to know what kinds of limitations the light effect has to estimate if simple natural selection could make the mosquito population more resistant. Well, since we're talking about fruit flies (one of the most heavily studied lab animals), it shouldn't be too hard to see if we can intentionally breed a resistant batch over repetitive cullings.  It might take some considerable time, but not all that much effort. With fruit fly reproductive rates "considerable time" means 4 months. It's also worth pointing out that every new thing the species needs to become resistant to could make it slightly weaker in other ways.  If it wasn't a trade off then it would be highly likely that insects would already be resistant to it.  It might only end up meaning females lay a few percentage points less eggs, but every bit helps. Then we find those mosquitoes and kick the shit out of them. The difference is some misquitos are already resistant to this. So we kill all the misquotes that aren't resistant and are left with a mosquito super race that blue light does nothing against. They breed producing more resistant mosquitos.  but it reduces their overall genetic diversity which means the next thing might be more likely to kill them all off. Interesting angle, never thought about it that way before. Yeah. As an example, many antibiotics resistant pathogens have been found to be far less virulent. Also not all adaptive traits are neutral. Although the surviving mosquitoes are more fit to survive the blue light effects, they may be less fit in other ways.

Example (and somewhat related!): Sickle Cell Anemia helps against malaria but comes with health problems. What type of mosquito would be most resistant to blue light? A bright blue one. That would make hiding from predators a lot harder for them. the right way to do this would be to save until we have 3 super-killers then unleash them all at once.  e.g. LED Light, mosquito virus, DDT. ...DDT? Um, I have reservations about using that in anything resembling a reckless  manner.  Don't forget[DDT is largely the reason why malaria no longer exists in the United States.](http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/history/elimination_us.html) Toxic, but very effective. For sure. It's an OP move and any wrestler that uses it is god-tier.  Psh. You're always overreacting, Lily. Spray me down, Charles! Don't miss a single spot! [deleted] Aren't major urban centers interested in switching to blue LEDs? If yes, would that affect insect populations?  The deleted comment was correcting dkmj17, saying "*Natural Selection". However, natural selection is a part of evolution so the original comment isn't incorrect. [deleted] Hmmm... the power they quote comes out to about 1W/m^2 of that exact frequency of light... for 48 hours which isn't too bad, though it's tricky to get all of your photons at some exact frequency. 

But let's say you could, and you have an average 150 acre (~600,000m^2) farm.

How much energy would it take to kill most of the eggs in your farm, assuming you could light every part of it equally somehow?

Well, about 600,000Wx50h=30,000 kWh. At 100% efficiency. That's about $3000 at typical energy costs. I have no idea how often you'd have to do that.

Oh, times the number of frequencies that you would need to use to kill all of your pests.

Hmmm... interesting. Not sure if you intended to point out how impractical this is, but I'd just like to say that the best discoveries often come from science for sciences sake. Now we know more about insects than we did yesterday, and that is inherently good. Truthfully, $3000 is likely not that much if you're talking 150 acres of lane that you are maintaining monthly.  Cost could easily be offset by the extra yield you gain from having pest-free plants that don't get munched on. Also you could probably sell everything as pesticide-free with 0 pests and get a higher price.

Ain't never heard of sickness from blue. I'm alergic to blue, i only eat Blue-free food.  
\#BlueFree You probably wouldn't get along with this little guy I know. He lives in a blue world, and all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue like him inside and outside. Even at 50% efficiency and costs associated with renting/buying the gear, that's a good deal. Pesticides aren't cheap either! What about mosquitoes? Yep, a purple/indigo wavelength of light killed mosquitoes. [deleted] All of the results in this study were gained after irradiating the insects for 48 hours. I wouldn't exactly compare this to a bug zapper yet.  First rule of science journalism: the headline is always so oversimplified that it becomes a lie.

The actual article is not behind a paywal, so I suggest you read it (and read past the abstract).

The true story: Drosophila melanogaster pupae are killed by long-term exposure to fairly intense blue light. Other insects required different wavelengths. These are essentially LED grow lights, with 360 LEDs per panel. This will affect how the plants behave, too, because the day/night cycle is used by plants to regulate growth and reproductive cycles. The authors also speculate that low doses of blue light might be *beneficial* to the insects, so intense light becomes important. "nearly 100%" 

is this going to end in a headline that states that, we, the human race introduced a selector that helped to create the super insect species that would inevitable force the remnants of our own species underground? It wouldn't be much worse than what we have today, insects would just be resistant to death by a certain wavelength of light. Yeah, there are probably a few steps between not being killed by blue light and conquering the world. It could be, if that is a significant mortality factor in young insects. Most mutations are trade offs, rather than pure benefits or going towards superbugs.  They might become immune to blue light, but less fit and able to survive other environment hazards because of a thicker skin that takes more energy to maintain.

Evolution rarely produces super-anything, it just selects best ths traits that best allow things to reproduce. [deleted] All of the insects killed were pupae, not adult insects. How do they propose getting the light to the larval forms? ITT: People with little knowledge of science making big statements :(. Can we remove /r/science from default subreddits. (Lurker here btw) As long as they don't kill honey bees. How about instead of saying nearly 100% lethal, we say 90% lethal, or 99% lethal so we can really know how nearly 100% lethal it is. We really don't know, since it's a preliminary study. [Mosquito-zapping laser technology from ted talks](http://youtu.be/hqKafI7Amd8?t=16m22s) What intensity? Because the sun doesn't kill insects and I can fry one with any visible wavelength I want using a [big ass dye tunable laser](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/AVLIS_laser.jpg) I'm probably confused, but I was under the impression that sunlight contained light at all frequencies in the spectrum. Shouldn't sunlight then kill these insects? If it's not 100% lethal the probability is high that it would become useless pretty soon after implementation. It will be as though we are deliberately breeding insects to be resistant to blue light. Blue wavelengths are all around us. Why are bugs still alive? I can see some evolution happening as a result of this  [deleted] This could be a breakthrough for indoor growing as an alternative to pesticides. This is a super big deal! Blue LEDs could be the new pesticides, in other words? Killing the bugs that prey on pests, thereby destroying the stable bug ecosystem and replacing it with one where any blue LED-resistant bug can run unchecked? 
 How different is our current system? Cue anti-GMO music, Alfred! 

Er...anti-LED music!  Eli5: Why does this work So now we have to find the wavelength that kills humans. 0.01nm This makes me wonder as to whether or not there's a specific wavelength of light that can be used to kill other organisms. Or does this only apply to insects for a physical trait that other organisms don't have? The article said something about catalyzing oxygen reactions which are lethal, but is it only insects that have those? First, I want to say cool paper.  As other users have stated, knowledge for the sake of knowledge has its own merits, and this could certainly lead to practical applications.  That said, heres one reason we probably arent there yet.  
Based on the article, it looks like 3e18 photons per square meter per second is about the lowest light level of any wavelength to see any kind of efficacy, and the more impressive numbers are for light levels 3-4 times higher than this.  For comparison, full sunlight at the equator during the heat of summer is only about 2500 nmol photons per square meter per second from UV to red wavelengths (compared to ~5000 nmol photons per square meter per second for the lowest effective treatment).  
So, in order to use this in agriculture, one would have to expose the plants to ~2-8 times more light than they would ever ordinarily see for 48 hours nonstop, which will almost certainly fry most agricultural plants to death.
With these energies, I would be very curious to see temperatures of the insects at death, as it seems quite possible theyre being cooked.  Thats not to say this couldnt be used outside of agriculture (for example, treating produce during shipping to reduce invasive species spread) but even if this could somehow be scaled in an economically feasible manner, it probably still wouldnt serve much practical purpose (again, based on this article alone).

Edit: Disregard this post.  I just realized that I mistook micromoles for nanomoles, so the response is quite right - the light levels are a tiny fraction of sunlight. I'm not sure where your numbers for sunlight are coming from or what you mean by nmol. But the lowest level of efficacy is around a Watt per square meter. Which is far less than sunlight. How do you get the bugs to sit still for long enough (in their natural habitat) to get killed by the light application? I wonder how much exposure to the light is required to kill or weaken the insects.  I mean, I would love some kind of flashlight that would kill a rose shrub covered in Japanese Beetles, as opposed to a longer and more ambient exposure that might kill a lot of beneficial insects as well. From reading the article it appears that only 200 Kw/ms is sufficient to kill most insects. Take a blacklight, turn it on, place a notebook page over it. Every fly lost all of its senses, and can be easily swatted after only a few min. I figured this shit out years ago. That "nearly" 100% kinda annoys me. Yes, this could work as a new form of pest control, but at the same time, within a few generations, we could have a light resistant strain of bugs plaguing our sorry butts.

Evolution's a bitch. Developing resistence is not really evolution, but this guy is right. 
Remember DDT Why is it not evolution? Evolution is the change in heritable traits over generations. This hypothetical situation wouldn't be due to *natural* selection--sure--but *artificial* selection still leads to evolution. 

Edit: spelling mistakes  We need a proper biologist's advice on this, I really am not competent to answer. 

Any help, anyone?  My answer comes from having a BSc in Ecology, Animal behavior, and Evolution, and a MSc in Biology if it gives my definition any clout. That's what I learned in my evolutionary biology classes.  "Could leave a predator without a prey." Or we're the prey in this situation and kill off a predator. I suppose they do have some small effect of population control on us with that over one million deaths a year thing.  Let's just hope for Ant Man's safety his movie poster isn't orange and teal.  Maybe they squashed the insects with a heavy blue light bulb? Otherwise this doesn't make sense since blue wavelengths are all around us right now Think of it like UV light, it's all around you now but there (hopefully, for your sake!) isn't enough to disinfect they keyboard in front of you.

with enough UV, your keyboard would be disinfected (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet#Sterilization_and_disinfection ). OK, I understand that argument - so you reckon this has to do with the minimum dosage? I don't think LEDs would give out enough lumens to zap an insect with a high dose of blue light - do you?
Also wonder what evolutionary reason there could be for them to be this sensitive to one wavelength. Well It's probably less evolutionary (although I suppose since there arn't any super strong blue lights on our planet, they haven't evolved a solution) and more just a result of physics, for example blue light is also harmful to human sight: http://lowvision.preventblindness.org/daily-living-2/artificial-lighting-and-the-blue-light-hazard#blue

As regards LEDS having enough juice, I guess it depends on the concentration (how many LEDs in the given space), and focus of the light (think about car headlights) . I'm afraid it's not my field so I couldn't say more. but you have said enough :)
thanks - good comments Let's also point out that the fruit fly larvae don't live on the surface. Another contrived experiment. I appreciate when articles about scientific phenomenon clearly state 'we don't know what this means at all but it seems cool.' [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Or why things keep catching on fire that way, and it was a bacteriology lab. [deleted] This line is amazing to me:  "Blitzars last about a millisecond but give off as much energy as the sun does in a million years" I don't understand how that much concentrated energy radiating in all directions doesn't vaporize everything within many light years of the source. Like all things electromagnetic related, it probably follows [inverse square law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law).  Basically stating that the amount of energy a point is exposed to is reduced by some factor of the inverse of the distance squared.

Think of it this way, There is a star out there that is [ten million times brighter than the sun](http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/brightest-pulsar-detected-1008).  Yet for an observer on earth, it is barely visible.  Why is that? Because space is big and even something that is 10 million times the brightness of the sun dims out at a inverse square rate as you move away from it.

In other words.  Distance is our savior here.  Energy density drops off very quickly the further away you move from the source. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Why does light and so many natural phenomena follow pretty square laws with neat little 2s instead of some mangled number like pi with no rhyme, reason, neatness or consistency to its digits?

Edit: please no more explanations, I get it! 
&gt; [The inverse-square law generally applies when some force, energy, or other conserved quantity is evenly radiated outward from a point source in three-dimensional space. Since the surface area of a sphere (which is 4r2 ) is proportional to the square of the radius, as the emitted radiation gets farther from the source, it is spread out over an area that is increasing in proportion to the square of the distance from the source. Hence, the intensity of radiation passing through any unit area (directly facing the point source) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point source.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law)

tl;dr it's a property of 3D Euclidean space. In other words, if you track the sum total of all the energy as an "expanding sphere" radiating out from the point source, pi does figure in. The factor of PI doesn't really answer his question though, the neatness of the formula comes from the surface area of a sphere containing a squared radius.

If we found out that the explosion had the shape of a ostrich, or if pi was a 3.56 or something doesn't change the exponent being a nice integer. pi finds a way ;)

But yeah, most of them are something like 1 / (2 *pi * d^2) Exactly. Think of a wave in a puddle. It can only spread out in a plane. So if you track the front of constant energy moving out (assuming the energy doesn't dissipate too quickly) you'll see it has to describe a circle. The expanding circle has a length proportional to it's radius (to power 1), so that's how energy dissipates. In 3D space the "length" of the front is proportional to the radius squared, in 4D space radius cubed, and so on. Think about it this way:

Take a point source of radiation in space. 'Point source' just means that it radiates energy in every direction (x,y,z) equally. Now, energy itensity is measured in Watts per square meter; Basically, the power of the source divided by the area over which it is spread out. For a point source, this area is a sphere, and the area of a sphere is 4r^(2). So for a point source of light, the intensity at a distance R away from the source (ignoring absorbtion by gases in between) would be:

I = P/(4R^(2)) --&gt; P is the source power

Which is an inverse square relation. 

So really, it's not an amazing coincidence that the inverse square law works for so many phenomena; it follows from some clever thinking! It doesn't?  The article said that other telescopes quickly targeted the region where the signal was emanating and they did not see any signs of a violent event that would have caused such a burst.

But I would think the sheer amount of energy would give off all sorts of other violent reactions. If their source is something large enough to capture any other evidence of the event, such as a black hole, and it doesn't come into contact with any other matter, which is more likely than not, what would it have to react with? You'd expect in a couple of years that that shock front would hit nearby stars, who would then re-radiate the shockwave energy.

So if we keep our telescopes trained on that spot, we might well see other objects lit up by the flash. I guess that would be related to how close anything else is/was. It blows my mind that space is so big *light* takes years to get to places.

Edit: I fully understand how it works and all that people. It's possible to understand something and still have it be amazing. I like to flip the reference frame here and think about how the fastest thing in the universe is so slow that it takes millions of years to traverse even a tiny slice of the universe. Or from a different angle, it's pretty wild that our experience of time is so tiny that millions of years seems unfathomably large to us. Agreed.  My math could be off a touch (and I hope someone will correct me if I'm wrong), but light from the Andromeda galaxy, which is comparatively very close to our own galaxy, takes almost 0.02% of the entire age of the universe to reach us.  [z8_GND_5296](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z8_GND_5296) is one of the most distant known galaxies and the light from it reaching Earth has been traveling for 95% of the entire age of the universe.  

The best part for me though, is that even though light seems to me to be very sluggish from the reference frame of the entire universe, if I were a photon, I could be emitted by a star billions of light years from Earth and strike the retina of an astronomer looking into her telescope in the same instant. Think about how difficult it will be to create something that travels anywhere near the speed of light. Then, realize that even if we do that it would take something like 100,000 years to go from one end of our galaxy to another. It would take several times that to get from here to the next closest galaxy.

Humans really don't have the life span for space travel, even if we figure out how to travel as fast as possible. Not really true if we take relativity into account. You could potentially reach any spot in the universe within a human life span. Potentially. Just to fill that claim with numbers: Even if you somehow get your spacecraft to 99.9 percent of c, the 100,000 years would still feel like 4470 years to you. Exactly. It's just that the rest of the planet would have advanced 200,000 years or so since you left.  Not if the Universe is expanding. The expansion between two points depends on their distance: close points don't seem to be expanding at all, distant points are expanding noticeably (redshifted), very distant points might be regressing away faster than the speed of light (which is allowed because space itself is expanding rather than just objects moving away from us).

So even if your ship was going the speed of light towards those objects, the distance to them would still be increasing. Parts of the Universe are just fundamentally unreachable from here. Can you explain? I understand that time is relative in that the Earth will have advanced more than the people onboard the ship. However, the galaxy *is* something like 100,000 light years across. If you started from one end and went to the other, the people on the ship would still experience those 100,000 years whereas people on Earth would experience far more. &gt;Humans really don't have the life span for space travel, even if we figure out how to travel as fast as possible.

Depends on your perspective. Anatomically modern humans are believed to have existed for [about 200,000 years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomically_modern_humans). If you view the solar system as a kind of space ship, we've traveled about 153 light years ([in a reference frame where the center of the Milky Way is considered stationary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_year)) since we appeared. And the solar system is a pretty slow space ship; ships have been proposed that could potentially reach [10% of light speed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion\)#Interstellar_missions). Compare with solar system speed; 1/1300 of light speed. We just need [generation ships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_ship) is all. Worm holes or space folding, something like that. It still amazes me how a single line of communication sends millions of bits of information almost instantaneously from one part of the world to another. All that data has to travel almost perfectly through who knows how many different spans of wiring and various electronics.  AND compete with millions of other bits of data at the same time. Shock does not exist in a vaccum. If something explodes next to something in space, it only acts upon the other object if matter moving from the explosion, or energy (such as light, x rays, gama rays, etc.), hits the other object.

Shock is rapid compression and decompression of air, much like sound. It does not exist in space.  The explosion is nowhere near energetic enough for nearby stars to noticeably repurpose its light. Also, even if it blasts stuff apart, at that distance it would be very hard to detect - right now it would still be too small, and when it has expanded it will be not luminous enough to detect. Its Gly after all.

 It doesn't. These extremely high intensity bursters are usually found to be highly magnetically focused beams, which are very narrowly focused. Therefore they look, if entirely spherical, to be very powerful, when in fact, they are not.

It's all the difference between detecting a high power spotlight and then assuming there's a entire globe emitting energy of that intensity, when in fact it's highly focused. That's what gives the illusion of high power. But it's focused and not emitting 360 degrees around it, either, just when the focused power beam intersects our detecting scopes. It gives the illusion of being lots stronger than it actually is. Because it's not that much energy at a distance of a light year, and because it takes a lot of energy to vaporize a planet sized object.

Energy at one light year is equivalent to about 2 hours of sunlight at 1AU. It's delivered very quickly so maybe enough to vaporize dust but no more than a thin layer from anything much larger.

Vaporizing the earth takes on the order of 10^32 joules. If this blazar came from the sun, the earth would only receive on the order of 10^30 joules. A factor of 100 off.
 But apparently, it would still give you second-degree burns from ~15 ly, if absorbed in skin. So still a nasty flash. That sounds like a mass extinction level event.  From 15 ly  away.  Scary stuff. Yup. Gamma-ray burst happen just as often and would sterilaize earth from 100ly or more away. Sleep tight.  To add up: ["...every second the sun produces the same energy as about a trillion 1 megaton bombs! In one second, our sun produces enough energy for almost 500,000 years of the current needs of our so-called civilization."](http://www.physics.fsu.edu/courses/spring98/ast1002/sun/) Whats with "so-called" civilization? Like we aren't real or some shit? Basically, we aren't advanced enough yet.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale Advanced enough compared to shit we made up? We're the most advanced civilization we know of. &gt; We're the most advanced civilization we know of.

We're also the *only* civilization we know, which is kind of sad. I don't know if you're up for a discussion on that scale. But, in the Wikipedia on it says that it would take us 100,000+ years to harness galaxy. To me that seems long. Thoughts? I understand it's hypothetical.  if the milky way is 100k light years across, and we're off center that means it will take at MINIMUM somewhere more than 50k to even reach the edges of the galaxy.  Doubling that time to harness it all doesn't seem all that high to me. Or maybe we're uncivilized. We're a hypothetically young and underdeveloped civilization in context of what a civilization 'could' become in time. [deleted] That would make *a lot* of toast. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Only in that particular frequency band that we call radio waves.  Given the power output of the sun as about 4 * 10^26 watts, that gives this event a power output of more than 1.26 * 10^43 watts. Absolutely unfathomably powerful. Radio astronomer here!  For those interested, [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0342) is the paper describing this discovery.

Also, I've said some things in a few comments elsewhere about these fast radio bursts, but for those too lazy to dig:

- They are called fast radio bursts (FRBs) in the radio astronomy community, **never** blitzars- in fact, we so never call them blitzars that it took me a moment to realize what this article was on.  This is just a journalist trying to be cute.

- Right now, there are more theories than there are FRBs- literally, I think we are around 10 in the published literature.  So far all the observed ones came out of Parkes, and one from Arecibo- IMO it would be *really* nice if other telescopes start finding these, btw, as rumor has it a famous astronomer is writing a paper arguing the Arecibo one isn't real.

- This paper is significant because it describes the first real-time follow up of an FRB observation, and the fact that Parkes is now detecting these in real time.  This is going to be really important in the future for us to figure out what they are!  They unfortunately didn't see anything though, so not much is ruled out as yet- the paper I linked above says they don't come from nearby supernovae, or long-duration gamma ray bursts, but literally everything is still on the table.

In conclusion, FRBs are cool, and I'm glad Reddit agrees with me on that! :) So was the [Wow! Signal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal) an FRB? I thought nothing else like that had ever been detected.  The Wow! Signal lasted a full 72s, the full window of time that Big Ear was able to 'listen' for. FRBs are transient celestial radio pulse lasting only a few milliseconds.

 Man, thats one of my favorite mysteries. &gt; Parkes is now detecting them in real time

Does that mean there's an ongoing program to hunt for the FRB's? Or did it occur during a routine observation and everyone dropped everything and started observing the aftermath? I'm curious about this bit: 
&gt;The Parkes Telescope data alone revealed a new property of the bursts: the waves appear to be circularly polarised rather than linearly polarised, which means they vibrate in two planes, rather than one.

Is this different than normal pulsar radiation? Or is it just new information? Question

&gt; If the source can be found, it will help to calculate the density of the interstellar medium for the first time, Petroff says. As the signal passes through the free electrons between stars, it is dispersed like a rainbow, with "bluer" or higher frequency waves hitting us first. The denser the medium, the greater the dispersion. Knowing the density of this medium and how it has changed over time will be a key test for theories of how the universe evolved.

Where might I learn more about this? 

Thanks Whatever it was happened millions of years ago. We missed it by THAT much Missed it? Go back a couple decades and we wouldn't have noticed it at all. We were right on time, baby. Kinda makes you wonder what could've happened 20 years ago that we'll never know about. Yeah. There are records in history - ancient history, even - of astronomical events like supernovae and comets. We have to look back and extrapolate, and those dead guys didn't know what they were seeing. . . But people have always watched the skies. 

Edit - Swype This deserves more votes. When you put it like that, 20 years vs 5.5 billion years - that's the most awesome hail mary catch in history. that or these things are way more common than we think.  Or that the universe is just so damned interesting that we're going to see something awesome as long as we keep looking. Every time we invent an instrument and point it at the sky, we find something new. [deleted] "Up to," though So before the Earth was even formed? Yes, Earth is ~4.4 Billion years* old.

This Blitzar event happened ~5.5 Billion years ago.*

 ^*give ^or ^take ^a ^few ^million ^years. I like the idea of Civilization 1.0 attempting to contact Civilization 2.0, even though they'd be long gone before we got their message. The message they sent? *"Watch out for the blitzar."* Sounds like /r/writingprompts If a civilization was technologically advanced enough to do this and is long gone... That would certainly speak to the destiny of our species. This just made me extremely depressed..... Imagine how many civilizations out there could have tried contacting others, only to have completely died out before it was ever received... :( Must be way beyond our galaxy Yes, far beyond.

For perspective, the Milky Way is only 100,000 light years in diameter. &gt; only  
  
I know it's all relative, but wow, that's still fucking huge for something so "small"  Seriously! Going at the speed of light, it would still take 100,000 years to traverse the Milky Way. Holy crap To you the trip would be instantaneous... to any observer on earth it would be 100,000 years. Can You talk more about this? Or is there a link I can read on this sort of thing? Would something like this have a big impact on the planet or atmosphere if it hit?   It did hit. That's how we can see it. So: no, don't worry... About that one ;)  Cue /u/Andromeda321 in like 30 minutes with "Radio Astronomer here!" Well, if you insist. ;-)

Radio astronomer here!  The first thing to note about this story is *no one* in radio astronomy calls these "blitzars"- they are FRBs, or Fast Radio Bursts, and this science journalist is just trying to get cute.  Second, no one really has a clue what on Earth is causing these, so this is a great time to be a theorist as you can get a nice theory paper in on the topic.

Third, it's nice that there was follow-up (as that'll be a big part in figuring out what these are), but none of the follow up saw anything so we can only rule out long gamma ray bursts and very nearby supernovas.  Also, some other telescopes *really* need to see these already, only Arecibo has seen an FRB so far but the gossip is that a famous astronomer is writing a paper showing how that burst may in fact be fake based on the data involved.  So I really hope somewhere else sees an FRB soon! This is pretty fascinating stuff, thanks for the info.

It's interesting to hear about the many theories about what's causing these. Now you said there's more theories than observed FRB's. Myself being uneducated on the topic, it's fun to try and guess what they are, even if the answer isn't currently available.

So, if someone put a gun to your head and asked what you think causes FRBs, what would you say if you had to answer? Now becauses no one knows yet, I don't expect it to be accurate. Basically your leading theory if you were a betting ~~man~~ woman. This stuff blows my mind, so I can't get enough of it. Well I'm a woman, so...

I think it's pretty clear from the observed rate that these are created by something not super common, but not very uncommon either, and that really narrows the field of potential candidates. (For example, neutron stars don't collide that often.) So maybe something from magnetars- neutron stars with super high magnetic fields basically- would be my bet. Thank you, also sorry about the gender mistake. Between this, the recent earth like planets found, and the report there may be two planets behind Pluto yet to be found. It's been a blast reading about all this space stuff lately.

Beagle2 being spotted on Mars is pretty nifty as well.

Just because it's radio waves doesn't mean they were made synthetically. This just seems like a very powerfully large and quick cosmic event.  Radio astronomer here!  Basically even in the radio astronomy community at a conference when you get to the "talk over drinks" part of the evening some people will say they think the FRB signal is from an alien civilization.  The reason people are saying this is because it's fun to think about, and there is pretty much no good idea on what could be creating these naturally.

So yeah, Reddit is on about the same level as a bunch of drunk astronomers in a pub on this one.  Good job guys!

Edit: clarity What piece of evidence would move your speculations further that way? If there was evidence they're not astrophysical in nature.  Conclusive evidence of that is a LONG way off. The linked article says "relatively tight band of radio frequencies". What do they mean by "relatively tight"? I was guessing a pulse that is a few milliseconds in time will be all over the spectrum. 

Also, what do you work on at Parkes?  I don't work at Parkes, just a fan as they say.

Relatively tight means usually you get a lot of radiation from a source at a time, FRBs are rather smaller in bandwidth.  I think at least, that's not a scientific term used in the article, just something the author said. Because people think radio waves are a man made invention.

Edit: People seem to think I was trying to say people are generally stupid. To make myself clear, what I meant was we tend to associate the words "radio" and "waves" to man made inventions like a radio, when in reality, it's something natural that we discovered. (Correct me if I'm wrong) 

Dream on, friends, dream on.  No, because some people find it intriguing that such a huge burst of radio waves suddenly reaches us, and that there's nothing visual (as far as we can see) that caused the burst. 


Makes people think it may not be something astronomical, which therefore leads them to think artificial, thus alien-y. Not to mention the fact that we can identify different things based on the frequency of these radio waves. But we've yet to find out what those were. 

It's good to be a pessimist, but it's bad practice to pull anybody else in that attitude. Optimists are dreamers, and big dreamers do big things, in the end.  not to mention it would be so freaking wonderful if it was. Or frightening... Definitely frightening.

If an alien civilisation was able to produce a radio-burst with the energy equivalent to what our sun puts out in a million years, then they had to be pretty damn advanced.

Advanced to the point of being able to harness the energy of whole stars and in turn destroying whole star systems. If we assume it is not a natural burst, it could be a much weaker, directed burst.  Wonderful and frightening can be the same thing.

Tigers for example. &gt; that there's nothing visual (as far as we can see) that caused the burst.

Most objects we are aware of that can possibly make bursts of radio waves that large won't be visible to us anyway. Because whenever scientists report anything in space that doesn't coincide with an immediate, simple answer people jump to the possibility of aliens.

**Optimistic View**: Humans are immensely curious creatures (with an average curiosity of 0.7cat) with active imaginations. We want to find other life, and so we ascribe mysterious events to things we wish existed.

**Pessimistic View**: Many people like to postulate about things they have no understanding about. In the absence of understanding, they grasp for whatever buzzwords they've heard other people say, even if those people are complete whackjobs. I just found my new hobby, measuring people's/animals curiosity on the cat scale, where a 1.0 should likely kill you within 8years let's say. People are saying it *could be* aliens, because it *could be*. Just because it doesn't have to be synthetic doesn't it can't be. People are just saying it would be cool if we found alien life. I doubt anyone expects that to be the outcome of investigating these radio bursts, but we are allowed to speculate. "they vibrate in two planes, rather than one"

Having a hard time wrapping my mind around this, could someone explain the 'circular polarization' they're talking about?  [Circular Polarisation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Circular.Polarization.Circularly.Polarized.Light_With.Components_Right.Handed.svg).

Basically the sum of an "up-down" vibration with a "left-right" vibration, as the particle goes "forward". The overall effect should be the "circular polarisation" mentioned, which can be represented as a corkscrew motion forward.

(the above is based on what I remember from Physics class in college, please correct when needed) I never have any idea what I'm reading when stuff like this gets posted, but I never fail to get hyped and fascinated when I do read it. Space is awesome. "Swinburne University in Melbourne Australia"

Very rarely do I expect to see my uni on this site... That's a shame because your uni has a very well-respected supercomputing group, specifically in astrophysics too. Nobody expects to see their school on reddit.  Amongst our weapons are fear, surprise, and ruthless efficiency. And an almost fanatical devotion to the pope. [deleted] [deleted] &gt; The Parkes Telescope data alone revealed a new property of the bursts: the waves appear to be circularly polarised rather than linearly polarised, which means they vibrate in two planes, rather than one. "It's something nobody has ever measured before," Petroff says. But it's hard to know how to interpret it, she says.

Can someone ELI5 what "circularly polarised" is? I know it said "they vibrate in two planes," but does that just mean x and y?
 The Wikipedia page for it has a good animated image that explains the concept pretty well. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_polarization

To receive a circular polarized signal, like what satellites usually transmit down to earth, like the [Automatic Picture Transmission \(APT\) signal from NOAA satellites](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-tutorial-receiving-noaa-weather-satellite-images/), you need a quadrifilar helix antenna (QFH) which look like [This](https://www.google.com/search?q=qfh+antenna&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS607US607&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1075&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Bhe9VK_VDYWGyQSVv4GABA&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg) Normally an antenna is polarized linearly, meaning it is either horizontal or vertical in nature. While it is a sine wave you can think of these waves as being the x or y axis, straight lines. So, if you are transmitting a horizontal radio wave length you need an antenna that is going to pick up horizontal wave lengths, and likewise for vertical radio waves. Frequently when it comes to open radio communications, specifically FM radio, both horizontal and vertical wave lengths are transmitted at the same time so that both vertical and horizontal antennas can pick up the transmission. This circular wave length they are talking about is weird in that it is  a wave that is shifting between horizontal and vertical as opposed to sending 2 waves at once. "**Blitzars last about a millisecond but give off as much energy as the sun does in a million years**"

This is tough to wrap my head around... The idea of radio waves so intense that they dwarf the suns output of visible light is mind boggling. On a similar note, with this intensity, I would imagine every radio in the world picked up these waves for that milisecond... right? (assuming the waves were not all somehow concentrated at one precise frequency) I'm always amazed by how somewhere there are objects pushing the boundaries of what we thought possible. Objects that spin so fast, relativity prevents the formation of a black hole, Objects that give off so much energy in a millisecond that it parallels that of our sun over a million years. Imagine what only a tiny fraction of the sun's energy has produced on Earth over the last million years: all the plant life that has emerged and the animals that have evolved. I wonder if there were creatures which evolve in range of this "blitzar" billions of years ago. Would they enter large periods of dormancy only to awaken every so often in huge bursts of activity just as the blitzar does? Would they evolve the capiability of detecting radio waves biologically? 

On a side note, I feel as if I'm playing Pokemon with the way some of these objects are named. "Go Blitzar! use magnetic wave!" "  Can someone explain what polarization is, and how linear polarization is different from circular? It's a very fundamental concept in physics. Basically, EM radiation (that is, any light: radio waves, infrared, visible light, UV, X-rays, gamma rays) is composed of two oscillating fields. One of the fields is electric and the other is magnetic (which is why we call it EM radiation), and both of the fields are perpendicular to each other, [like so](https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/RadiationSafety/Graphics/elec_mag_field.gif). 

Now, polarization is fairly easy to understand. It's simply the direction of the fields. 

"Normal" light has the fields oriented at random angles. Imagine if you chucked 100 matches on the floor, and looked at which direction they were pointing in. Now, instead of matches, you can imagine that each match corresponds to either the magnetic or electric field of a single photon. You would see a similar sort of pattern if you measured the direction of polarization of unpolarized light. 

With polarized light, the fields all behave in the same way. Linearly polarized light all points in the same direction. So, that's like looking at a bunch of matches that are all pointing North, say. 

Circularly polarized light is a bit different. In this case we'd have a bunch of matches all spinning either clockwise or counter-clockwise. 

You can filter light by polarization too. This would be like dropping a bunch of matches on a barbecue grill like [this](http://static1.globein.org/sites/default/files/news-blogs-field-image/9-ethnic-grilling-recipes-you-wont-want-miss.jpg). Only matches that happen to be pointing in the same direction as the grill can pass through. If you were looking at light that was polarized in the perpendicular direction to your grill, no light would get through. If you turn the grill 90^^(o), all of the light would be able to pass through. 

When light reflects off something, it often becomes partially polarized. This is why we have polarized sunglasses. Light that reflects off a flat road tends to become polarized in a direction perpendicular to the road, so by choosing sunglasses which are polarized at 90^^o to this direction, we can reduce the glare from the road significantly. Next time you're out in the sun wearing polarized glasses, try turning your head 90^^o to the side, and try to see the difference in the brightness of the reflected light. Or alternatively you can do try the same thing with a computer screen, which also output polarized light. 

----

Probably made a few mistakes here - I didn't bother to check through for any errors and it's been a while since I did anything to do with polarization, so I might have forgotten some things. Hope it helps though.  Is it possible this is some sort of galactic lightning? I mean, don't knock it... but large energies dissipated in small timeframes instantly makes me think of lightning. Could it be some thunderstorm created by gravitational fields of galaxies or stars creating energy, much like clouds do on our own planet? 

Additionally, just trivially. How do we create radio waves ourselves? Sorry for the noob question, just want to add some context. &gt; Additionally, just trivially. How do we create radio waves ourselves? Sorry for the noob question, just want to add some context.

We send electricity into a wire, more or less.  We turn the electricity on and off very fast at a specific frequency, and other devices are able to detect the changes in the electromagnetic field produced.

It's like sticking your finger into a puddle.  When you put your finger into the puddle, a ripple/wave forms and extends from your finger, when you remove it, it also forms a wave.  Somebody else near the same puddle could watch the height of the water and measure how often you are sticking your finger in and out of it. Talk about an ELI5, well done! Just wanted to say this is an excellent description and analogy. &gt; How do we create radio waves ourselves?

This has been answered, but I just wanted to point out that radio waves do not in any way imply an artificial source. Radio frequencies occur naturally all over the place.  With an antenna!

Electromagnetic waves are just electric current being radiated by an antenna. 

For example, some kind of antennas are a metal tube (waveguide) that "holds"  and "transports"  electromagnetic fields. When that metal tube opens little by little, it becomes a horn antenna, because the waves on the waveguide adapt to the open air, and are radiated. 

Or they could be simpler: a dipole. That's basically a wire. If you have a wire and you pass current though it, It'll radiate that energy to the air. Design that with a bit of thinking, and you have an antenna.

Now, instead a constant current, put a signals with information, and BAM!  You're basically communicating that signal to the open air. 

Get another antenna that captures the waves, and you have a communication channel!! 

It's really simple as a concept, but maybe I didn't explain it right.  Radio astronomer here!

TL;DR version: no.

Longer version: the issue here is, firstly, all FRBs have been detected from outside the Milky Way.  So there's no normal galactic process that creates them or we would see them originating locally, and that isn't the case. (We can also tell that they come from very far away because they have a very large dispersion measure- basically you can tell how far away a signal comes from based on how the signal travels over different frequencies.) Some people have still suggested that these could be originating from flare stars in our galaxy though- think what our sun does to create the northern lights on crack.

Lightning on our planet is actually not a dumb suggestion at all tho btw, as during the FRB search it was discovered Parkes Observatory detects signals called "perytons" that look *very* similar to FRBs, during storms in July in particular.  But Arecibo in Puerto Rico has also detected an FRB, so the odds of that have decreased a bit. [deleted] From the article:

&gt; A top contender is the collapse of an oversized neutron star that should have given way to a black hole long ago, but was spinning so fast that relativity made it seem lighter. But other possibilities include a flare from a magnetar, a type of neutron star with an extremely strong magnetic field.

No aliens here boys. Move along, nothing to see. &gt;the waves appear to be circularly polarised rather than linearly polarised, which means they vibrate in two planes, rather than one.

Can someone clear this up for me as I can't grasp it at all. I thought there were two kinds of waves , longitudinal and transverse, so what are circular waves? Interested to see if the frequency was on or about the hydrogen parameter. What would that indicate? It's guessed that if there was to be contact from outside life, they would use hydrogen's frequency to send their radio messages, since it is fairly even in all directions (so a sudden burst would be noticeable) and since there's so much of it, listening on it's frequency would seem logical.  Aaah, Cool thanks very much. Have a great day mate.
 [deleted] I see, however if something intelligent sends a signal with that kind of know how whos to say we would understand it even if its dumbed down to them.  Interesting enough its freq was 1.4gz which pairs itself close to the hydrogen line.  I am no expert indeed. They'd have to shoot me a text for me to know lol.  http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0342v1.pdf

 I am wondering, what do you mean when you say hydrogen's frequency?  The [hydrogen line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_line) (1420.40575177 MHz) The frequency of electromagnetic radiation given off by neutral hydrogen atoms. How they're formed is kinda complex, but easily measured as it can pass through pretty much everything non solid.   Since the universe is mostly hydrogen then it would make sense for an intelligent lifeform to send a signal using that frequency. Im not subject matter expert but i believe that was the hype about the *WOW* signal. It was not.  It was a broad non-specific energy release.  No signal, no narrow band frequency.

The scientists even specifically said it was likely a neutron star eruption or black hole event. The frequency was 1.4GHz.

http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0342v1.pdf Pretty damn close to the line of 1420.xx.  10 more years worth of content for [Giorgio A. Tsoukalos](https://i.imgur.com/OK2Tru9.jpg)... Get ready for more "History" on the History Channel.

Although, I have to admit, would be interesting if the reason it seems unexplainable in nature is because it wasn't naturally occurring.  Imagine: Aliens sending a message to planets trying to see if someone is there with a big beacon, or an unbelievably massive collection of data being sent in a single massive burst, or Aliens sending power across the galaxy (or powering a ship traveling at near light speed) via high-intensity radio waves, or any other sort of SciFi worthy explanations.... any of which *could* be true in a universe of infinite possibilities.

Although, I find it far more likely scientists just witnessed something unseen before, like a Gas Giant collapsing in on itself or some sort of celestial storm phenomena that we've never seen before.
 &gt; would be interesting if the reason it seems unexplainable in nature

Not to be captain buzzkill but this just isn't the case. Radio waves are literally the same as light, heat This is entirely explainable in nature if an interesting phenomon. 

Unfortunately the click bait title leads people to think this is something more than it is. I would say this is pretty far from being a Click-Bait title in comparison to the more obvious and blatant click-bait titles that are thrown around on Reddit. The title is more or less exactly the truth and doesn't reference extra-terrestrial life. The assumption of possible extra-terrestrial life is completely understandable given the context. Science isn't about knowing everything and having an answer for everything, but rather to explore the unknown's and indulge in the mysteries of the universe based on what we're capable of comprehending in the present time. So IMO, it's completely fine to think that these could be from another intelligent species because truthfully, scientists don't have the capability of knowing 100%, which is why this is exciting for non-astronomers AND astronomers alike.  Captain ~~Buzzkill~~ Obvious (on the Click Bait) 

Except Radio is a specific frequency range, light is in a different part of the spectrum all together, so are other forms of radiation. That's actually not true; radio, light, and gamma rays (and more) are all on the electromagnetic spectrum. Ridiculous that you're being downvoted here. "Light" encompasses all EM radiation including radio. You're completely correct.  Does this have anything to do with aliens? "the waves appear to be circularly polarised rather than linearly polarised, which means they vibrate in two planes"

I understand wave polarization. But, can someone clarify this a bit more for me?

Does it mean it traveled through another wave or a magnetic field? /u/Hawk810 gave me [a great answer to this question](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2sx9ki/a_giant_burst_of_radio_waves_being_tracked_by/cnttn5j) Thanks, yes... I understand the conclusion. I am trying to understand the reason. From what I can conclude the interaction of a radio wave with a strong electromagnetic field can cause the polarity to go from linear to circular... Similar in concept to the Faraday effect.

But, I would like confirmation of this. 

(I know I may be screwing it all up... I am a layman so bear with me.) Ah - as a layman myself, I didn't understand that part of the conclusion, much less the source :) Doesn't that just mean "not polarized"? I believe it implies that it had either two sources or was close enough to effect or come in contact with another object such as an electromagnetic field. But, I am not sure.  I bet it's a technological singularity. A civilization that transcends space-time. With love as their vehicle! Kip Thorne! I have possibly a dumb question but shouldn't we be talking about this in past tense ? seeing as it is 5.5 Billion Light years away does that not mean it actually happened 5.5 Billion years ago ?

I know we are just now seeing it but the event itself happened a long long time ago 5.5 billion years to get to us is still an event in our time - for we have caught an event from long ago in the act. This changes things in the universe (our now knowing about it), thus the very distant past can and does still affect the present. I understand , I just feel that when people refer to something that happened that far away that long ago it sort of removes the concept of space time from the narrative. 
Because we then look at the event with the context of distance and not of also how long ago it was.
In my mind the radio signals we are currently observing are like a fossil of an event not the event itself.
 Right, its a bit misleading. What does it mean by it vibrates on 2 planes?  Tis but the emergence and birth of a blackhole. 

Do  blackholes emit energy? Hawking radiation. It depends what you mean. The area immediately *around* an active black hole is often a strong X-ray source. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Chemist here. There's a concept known as the Pauli exclusion principle. If we are talking about a chemical "bond" in the literal sense, then it has to consist of an electron moving into a hybrid molecular orbital between the two nuclei, and the Mu electron cannot go into an orbital that is already filled with two electrons. This means it has to go into an antibonding orbital, which is typically higher in energy than the component atomic orbitals that make up a molecular orbital. (This is why antibonds don't usually form.)

I can't imagine what is going on here, or why the Mu is only lower in energy if it is pinging between two Br atoms. I'm no longer in grad school, so I don't have journal access to Angewande Chemische, but I'd be interested in reading about this in more detail. 

Edit: I found a preview of the article, and the authors are making an isotope effect argument. With covalent bonds, we see the opposite kinetic effect, namely that heavier isotopes are more strongly bound, because they have a lower zero point energy in the energy well. With these vibrational "bonds," it's as if they are claiming some sort of resonance stabilization from spreading the electron density. I really wish I could see the actual molecular orbital diagram proposed, though. This would click a lot better for me.

Edit 2: Ok, I've read the entire article (thank you to a kind stranger!), and it seems that the key to what makes this sort of interaction special is found in the following diagram: http://imgur.com/7ufwdla

Notice the blue dashed lines curving downward in every case? These are the total final energy states of the systems as they move from reactants to products. The bond would not form if any of these curved upward. However, what makes the fourth one special, the case with Mu, is that the actual potential energy wells of the products (red curves) is higher than that of the reactants. The reason that this type of bond forms is because the product species themselves *sit lower within their respective potential energy wells.* We both want to get down to where the water is, so you dig a 30 foot well, but only climb down halfway, while I dig a 20 foot well and go all the way to the bottom. I will find the water, if that analogy makes sense. In the simplest possible terms, the bond forms with Mu because the grey area in the middle shrinks even more than the red line increases, allowing the blue line to still drop lower at the right end. It's not a covalent bond because the electron isn't in a molecular orbital. It's not a mere van der Waals interaction (called "bonds" here, though I've never called it that before) because it isn't merely due to electrostatic stabilization. It's a quirk of particle physics temporarily preventing three species from physically dissociating, so yes, it seems to me that it is fair to call this "a new type of chemical bond."

Edit 3: A digitally named friend has uploaded the entire article for our benefit, in case anyone wants to give a different/better interpretation: http://imgur.com/a/1VVa0

Beware that the pages are out of order. This will save some confusion :) Hello Chemist there.

How is this different from the old vanilla resonance hybrid, such as Ozone? Ozone contains actual covalent bonds with an electron deficient oxygen bonded to two oxygen atoms that share the negative charge. Each bond has an order of 1.5, meaning that at resonance, each bond is halfway between a single and double bond. It is less stable than diatomic oxygen plus an oxygen radical; the process that forms it is actually uphill in energy (energy that comes from solar UV radiation). But the molecule is fairly stable once formed, because the activation energy needed to destroy it is not achieved at a substantial rate thermally in the absence of a catalyst (such as CFCs, the public enemy of the 80s vis a vis hairspray!) You can think of this like a ball trapped in a giant bowl that's on top of a roof. If you could roll the ball hard enough, it would fly out of the bowl and off the roof and go all the way to the ground, but when it just sits there, it will remain on the roof. To add, resonance structures don't change over time. If each bond order is 1.5 that means that there is a high probability of their being 3 electrons being in each bond. Electrons don't really move from one spot to another, they just have a probability of being there. With this new type of bond it seems like the probability is shifting with time, it's just REALLY fast. So fast that it has the same effect as resonance. Hmm... I thought that electrons always moved around super-fast, so that the probability function was basically a description of everywhere they were in space over the last bit of time. I'm in Chem 2 as an undergrad and understanding this comment was a huge stepping stone mentally. I'm proud of myself. Congrats! It's the Great Filter. Don't get discouraged, though. It takes a little more effort up front, but the students who learn the principles rather than memorize facts end up more sustainably making it through. This is especially true when you get to orgo! Fellow chemist here about to finish grad school. Off campus so I can't read the original article, but I don't think the electron is going into an antibonding orbital, rather a higher level unfilled orbital. Check out the orbital diagram for XeF2 for as close of an analouge i can think of. The hydrogen isotope must be of such a high energy that filling these empty orbitals is energetically favorable (hence an "anti-heavy atom effect). Also it's not resonance in a typical sense, since resonance is an averaging of electron density of sorts that doesn't change over time. This new type of bond seems to have a temporal component in that in one instance it's electron is in an electron cloud of one bromine and in another instance is in the cloud of another. You are absolutely right in saying that this is effectively the same type of delocalolization as seen in resonance, as these instances must be so quick as to be effectively instantaneous at high T. &gt; so I don't have journal access to Angewande Chemische, but I'd be interested in 

Just to nitpick, it is "[Angewandte Chemie](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/\(ISSN\)1521-3757)" (German for "Applied Chemistry"); Interesting to see something as fundamental as bonds still is not fully worked out. The march moves ever forward. As fundamental as bonds **to exotic ultra-light atoms where you replace the nucleous with an anti-muon** still not fully worked out :p I don't know what to think anymore. Basically you can find different ways to stick stuff together. As long as you can find physical arrangements where there are energetically preferred ways to stay together you can find a new bond. Generally though atoms fall into several simple main categories as there are simple ways to make things energetically preferred, not to the exclusion of more complicated means. would down this path be the solution to many mysteries of the sun? sounds a bit like it, and would be awesome! The sun is made up of a substance known as plasma which will not take any orbital structure as the average energy far exceeds capture energy. However, they are subject to electric currents and large magnetic fields. It is best described as gaseous ions giving it properties other gases are not subject to.  Oh that's interesting. So the gases of the sun being ionic means they behave somewhat like metals (such as producing/being influenced by a magnetic field, etc.)? Yes. That's what causes coronal loops.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_loop Never thought about it like that, but a quick look at Wikipedia says you're right: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_magnetic_field.

TIL from that article: magnetic field reversal frequency is directly related to viscosity. The solar magnetic field is generated by light-element plasma, so it reverses polarity quickly every ~11 years. Meanwhile Earth's field is generated by solid/liquid iron, and reverses every half-million years over the course of a few millenia. why do magnetic fields reverse at all Basically, the orientation of the magnetic field is determined by the direction of the current generating it. On a small scale, we can observe this by putting a compass next to a wire carrying a sufficiently powerful current, changing the direction of that current, and observing the compass needle's movement.

On a planetary or stellar scale, though, the current in question is a very complex circulation of huge amounts of matter (for the Sun, plasmas; for Earth, molten iron and nickel). But not all the matter is flowing in the same direction, partly due to rotational velocity changing as you move throughout a sphere. The flow is chaotic, but most of the time is largely resolved into a dominant net flow, so we get an effectively uniform magnetic field.

Over time, the flow begins to diverge, and we observe a weakening* in the field ([basically it breaks up into multiple fields with different orientation, so they partially cancel out](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/NASA_54559main_comparison1_strip.gif)). Later, the flow reforms in the opposite direction it was before.

*For unknown reasons, the Sun's magnetic field actually strengthens during a reversal. Which mysteries are you postulating? [deleted] Is that really an atom then? I mean I understand that it's a particle but it's not really an "atom" in the same sense as a proton/neutron/electron atom. Someone tell me if I'm wrong because I've just realized I don't know what really defines an atom.  I think these are atoms in about the same way that complex numbers are still numbers. "Atom", on its own, connotes the regular elementary atoms, but would not exclude the possibility of atoms made from other things.

Also, I mean.... what else would you call it? Complex atoms? They're not particularly complex. A single muonium atom is described by basically the same equation as a hydrogen atom. Although the mass of the muon is lower, so you have to deal with the fact that the muon also moves sooner. However, that does not complicate the model much. (Essentially just a factor difference) (muon lasts 2.2us)

Of course, in a molecule, it acts differently due to the lower mass. Just the lower mass?

Note: there are also experiments where a muon -instead of anti-muon as here- takes the place of an electron. These make -relatively- 'tiny' atoms. Well they weren't confirmed, although they were postulated thirty years ago.  They are confirmed now though.  Bonds are very worked out, on elements found on earth, and in time frames that humans can comprehend.  Once we start smashing atoms together at high speeds and watching what happens in a fraction of a second, shit starts to get weird.  I think this is true of any domain in science. There's always a seemingly unreasonable new extreme to push. It's not that unreasonable when you remember that much more energetic collisions happen in nature all the time, far away from Earth. Yeah, who knows what animal behaviourists will find when we start hurling packs of wolves towards sperm whales at 250 000 kilometers per second. Welcome to chemistry, where the only thing that stays the same is the belief that the current model of the atom will be proven incorrect before you finish your PhD.  I'm pretty sure all science archetypes change like that. (Bio, Chem, Phys) They are constantly evolving and developing.   There's a relative rate and some fields more than others. Changes in biology happen every other month; changes in chemistry are more rare, especially with something like a bond. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] I've heard that we still don't have a good network/layer model for how water molecules interact with each other.

Water. 70% of what we're made of. 2/3rd of the planet. It's because water changes its behavior based on how many molecules are around each other (among other factors). You can get a PhD in water chemistry. I saw a presentation once about water cluster behavior. If I recall, the presenter was trying to extrapolate to find ways to predict snowflake patterns or something. I know there was something about snowflakes. 2/3rd of the planet's *surface*. By both volume and mass, the earth is mostly rock. In liquid form, true, largely because it's hugely complicated and difficult to model. Well my undergrad degree is officially obsolete. Me too and I just got it 4 years ago Our chemistry profs urged us to keep our chemistry books so that we could look back in 30 years and laugh at some of the theories. It's OK Pluto is still a planet based on my education.   From TFA:

&gt; [C]hemists experimenting at a nuclear accelerator in Vancouver observed that a reaction between bromine and muoniuma hydrogen isotopeslowed down when they increased the temperature.

First sentence from the Wikipedia article for muonium:

&gt; Muonium is an exotic atom made up of an antimuon and an electron, which was discovered in 1960 and is given the chemical symbol Mu. During the muon's 2.2 s lifetime, muonium can enter into compounds such as muonium chloride.

To me calling an exotic atom made from an antimuon and an electron a 'hydrogen isotope' is clearly wrong. &gt; To me calling an exotic atom made from an antimuon and an electron a 'hydrogen isotope' is clearly wrong.

Muonium behaves chemically as a light isotope of Hydrogen, due to having a nucleus with a +1 charge and ~ 1/9 amu mass.  By shining a spin-polarized beam of (anti)muons at a target and then studying the results using magnetic resonance techniques, useful information can be extracted about how Hydrogen atoms behave.  Since chemical reactions often take place in far less than the muon's 2.2 microsecond half-life, their instability does not pose a significant problem.

There are also situations where muons can be used to study reactions which are awkward to probe directly; for example, a muon beam can easily penetrate the walls of a high-pressure reaction vessel, allowing them to be used to study chemical reactions in supercritical water.

Source: The name "Percival" appears quite often in papers about Muonium.  That's my dad. Can we get an AMA in here?  You work the keys while he dictates if must needs be. Uhh... maybe?  I've grown up hearing about this stuff so I don't know if people would find it interesting.  Is there a mechanism for figuring out what AMAs people want to see in here? Yes please. Message the /r/science mods to set up verification and the rest of the ama. An AMA by someone dealing with exotic matter? Who *wouldn't* be interested? I wouldn't say that Muonium is exotic in the same sense as, say, Bose-Einstein condensates or quark-gluon plasmas, never mind dark matter, tachyons, or negative-mass particles.

But I think I understand what you mean. Maybe, but your thing actually experimentally exists. I don't know about offering an AMA, but people would DEFINITELY be interested.  I mean, it probably won't stand up to the vacuum salesman, but I'm sure it will still get more than a few good questions.  Yes, absolutely, we'd find it interesting. Go to /r/iama and check the requests.  Your dad would be more than welcome doing an AMA in /r/science. Is there a preprint or Arxiv version of the article that you could link us? Ah, you're Percival's son! Cool - I got my degree with Fleming and know Iain Mackenzie who worked with Paul :) One of the two sons.  I'm not sure which one you were aware of... It's considered to be a radioisotope of hydrogen.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22893978 &gt;This exotic atom can be considered

When scientists say "can be considered" it essentially means "not really, but for the one thing I'm interested in you can" Yeah - chemistry is all about the electron orbitals, so as long as the thing "inside" is *singly* positively charged then it's pretty much hydrogen. Wait, what?  If the "thing inside" refers to the nucleus, isn't that pretty much always positively charged? In this case the "thing inside" is not a normal proton-and-neutron nucleus, it's an anti-muon. Wasn't questioning "in this case."  See /u/szczypka's edit to include the word "singly." He just means it only has one positive charge, aka one proton, so it acts like hydrogen which has one proton. Any more and it would act like helium or some other element. [deleted] [deleted] Oh you said that. My bad dude. I promise I can read :p Yep - sorry, (well, let's ignore anti-hydrogen for now), I missed out "singly". My comment is now pointless, after having read your later comment on how the word "singly" was absent. Can you delete a comment? Edit. That would be nice. Normally the mass of the nucleus &gt;&gt;&gt; mass of electron, so you can simplify the wavefunctions, in this case the nucleus is still heavier than the electron, but massively lighter than normal. This will mean the normal separation of terms won't apply and things will be more complicated! For those following, what /u/Kandiru says is true. In this case the nucleus is about 1/10 of the (rest) mass of hydrogen, but still 200 times more massive than the electron. That said, the same logic applies to all models of physics that we can express verbally.

They are *all* situational simplifications of a larger truth we can study but never fully describe. Example, "as in this experiment only the weight of the participant affects the outcome, Johnathan can be considered an 80kg tub of butter."

Quoted: "...and Johnathn -- an 80kg tub of butter -- slowed down..." You really have to talk up research in Canada since the fed government has nerfed fundamental research grants.  As one that has never heard of muonium before, I think instead of:

&gt; muonium  a hydrogen isotope 

a better explanation for a scientific article would be: 

&gt; muonium  an short-lived exotic atom made from an antimuon and an electron that behaves very similarly to isotopes of hydrogen and is often treated as another isotope of such  For Scientific American

&gt; muonium - an exotic hydrogen isotope.

Anyone who cares will Google it, anyone who doesn't .. well their eyes glazed over the word anyway. Exactly. This is not a detail critical to understanding the main point of the article. wouldn't be reddit unless there was a nitpick that disproves the entire article though Well, it didn't disprove the entire article... We still have work to do But it looks promising The word "exotic" is not included in the article though. If it were then it wouldn't be a problem, as it has a clear-cut scientific definition.

Basically "exotic hydrogen isotope" has a totally different meaning from "hydrogen isotope". It is still a misnomer, its wave function looks similar with a change in mass and in pure quantum physics has no other real difference so depending on context it can be considered one or not.  Even reading this abstract, it seems that muonium is pretty dissimilar to hydrogen.  For example, I'm not aware that hydrogen generates free radicals when combined with hydrocarbons, and I'm pretty sure that the kinetic isotope effect will cause pretty significant differences when doing chemistry with something weighing 1/9 the mass of hydrogen-1. Thank goodness, was about to say how have I never heard of muonium It's hard enough to remember regular elements. Let alone their isotopes. Let alone their *exotic* isotopes. What's astonishing to me is that particles other than protons and neutrons can exist as the nucleus of an atom. Unless I'm completely misunderstanding this. A muon is just a big ass electron. An antimuon has a positive charge, same mass and other properties. So it's similar to hydrogen in that it's a big positive mass (like proton) with an electron. Also they decay after 2.2 microseconds, so they exist, but are not stable at all.  Thanks for the ELI15! So, what's the difference between an anti-proton and a muon? The size. Despite being a big ass electron, a muon / antimuon weighs 105.7 MeV/c^2. A proton / antiproton weighs 938 MeV/c^2. Other than that, a muon isn't composed of anything, it is an elementary particle (no known subdivision), whereas the antiproton is made of 3 antiquarks, up up down. Muon is about 1/9th the mass. Charge and spin are the same. A muon is elementary whereas an anti proton is composed of quarks. Yeah, it's kinda complicated. Like with beta decay, protons can become neutrons by emitting a positron, or neutrons can become protons by emitting an electron. Whacky stuff. The model of the atom taught in school is incredibly simple, and really doesn't explain what's going on very accurately.

Note: Not a chemist, just a student. I don't really know what I'm talking about. Phenomenal. I had always been under the understanding that other particles existed as the makeup of protons and neutrons and maybe interacted with atoms (as hard radiation), but it never occurred to me that there were other elementary particles which operated on the same scale as protons and neutrons. Yeah there are all sorts of subatomic particles other than protons, neutrons, and electrons. The Higgs Boson, for example, was recently (Well, in 2013) confirmed to exist by the team using the CERN supercollider. It's the particle that gives matter mass. There are also quarks, gluons, neutrinos, muons, etc. but that's getting a bit above my understanding.  I'm no expert, but I believe you're correct.  The important thing to keep in mind is they last about 2 microseconds before going boom, so they aren't exactly stable.  Apparently that is enough time to sort of make a compound before they are no longer existing. We have techniques that can study chemical structures that last on the [order of a femtosecond or even less](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtochemistry) (10^-15 seconds or less). So a microsecond can be a really long time, relatively speaking. [Original Paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201408211/abstract) for reference.

Don't expect this paper to radically change chemistry for the majority of modern scientists. This 'new' bond type, if it holds up over the next few years, is a very specific case. It won't drastically change the way chemistry is viewed because most bonds are characterized by the **dominant** type of bonding (covalent, ionic, metallic, other/secondary). 

In the case of this paper, the authors are discussing the dominant bond between the equivelant of the lowest atomic mass isotope (muon + electron) and a conventional atom (bromine). Although it won't change practical chemistry, this idea/paper does hold a lot of weight (great journal!) and could be a very big deal in the world of particle physicists/quantum chemists/theoreticians. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Can anyone provide a link to a journal article? http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201408211/abstract thanks. what do they say about covalent bonds at this school? they're outdated [deleted] &gt; This article was originally published with the title "New Vibrations."

I love how the author was so proud of that title that they just had to mention it at the end. I think it's just a standard practice. I'm actually curious: reaction rates do not always increase with temperature. Most notably, in the case of tunneling. Arrhenius plots of rate limiting steps of tunneling phenomena are not [only negative in slope, but non-linear](http://pubs.acs.org/JACSbeta/challenge/images/challenge19.gif). Given this particle has a mass less than or equal to that of a hydrogen atom, I wonder how they discounted the observed reaction being rate limited by tunneling of a more traditional reaction step in favor of this vibrational bond mechanism. &gt;tunneling

Like... quantum tunneling? Yep! There are a subset of chemical reaction steps that involve the tunneling of an electron, or even a proton in even more special cases. Instead of following a traditional activation barrier pathway from reactants to products, tunneling mechanisms operate by exploiting residual probability density that exists beyond a finite energetic barrier for quantum mechanical particles (i.e. protons or lighter). The QM particle avoids crossing the barrier by essentially "showing up" at its product position.  I feel really proud of my self for actually understanding this comment. Woohoo the education system works! [deleted] [deleted] Truly a [TRIUMF](http://www.triumf.ca/) for Canadian science! [SOURCE](http://imgur.com/a/1VVa0), I couldn't upload the PDF so I exported it as a JPEG created an album and uploaded it to imgur. You're welcome. Explain what this means like I am 5, please.  Or even ELI15 would be helpful. There are different ways atoms connect to each other. Ionic bonds, covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds... Many bonds are made by differences in electrostatic charges (one atom has more/less electrons than the other atom, so they connect together).

This vibrational type of bond has less to do with electricity and more to do with (I guess [friction] could be a way to describe it?). If I understood the article  basically what's happening is as the T (change in temperature) increases, the vibration of the muonium (an isotope of hydrogen) atom is increasing. The energy is centered in the vibration so the reaction doesn't speed up.

Source: High School Chem AKA I'm probably wrong &gt; as the T (change in temperature) increases

Is that what you meant to say? The way you wrote that means "as the change in the rate that the temperature increases" (as in calculus), rather than "as the temperature increases". I'm not sure if you wrote it that way intentionally or if the redundancy was accidental (since "increases" already implies "change"). What I didn't understand is how the increase in temperature would reduce the speed of the reaction, is it solely because it increases the vibration of the Muonium?

Also, holy balls they had to wait 25 years to confirm that the bond actually existed, that's some dedication there. Yea, what I took away from the article is that the muonium atom absorbs the thermal energy and vibrates between the two larger atoms more quickly, strengthening the bond and slowing the reaction. Do you know why a stronger bond would result in a slower reaction? It seems to me that a lower energy, more stable intermediate would result in a faster reaction. [deleted] This seems pretty groundbreaking. Is there potential for this discovery to merit a Nobel prize? [deleted] "With a Fleming working on the bond, you could say"
Layman here, and this type of reporting appeals to me. Shaken not stirred? This is how to engage the public and increase interest in what is typically a field grazed only by academics. Side note, this is not a hydrogen isotope it is an exotic atom. It exists wholly of itself without the qualifying factors that would exist if it were an isotope. &gt;  it is an exotic atom.

Well, Bond *did* always have a knack for the exotic ones...
^(I guess one could call that an isot**r**ope) It did make me laugh. Doesn't happen much with scientific articles. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] "Its vibrational nature lowered the total energy of the intermediate bromine-muonium structurethereby explaining why the reaction slowed even though the temperature was rising."

Out of curiosity, why would this decrease the reaction rate? Wouldn't a more stable intermediate with lower energy state increase the rate as this would likely result in a lower energy transition state and a lower activation energy? Why would the intermediate turn into the product rapidly if it is stable. It would be slower wouldn't it? So this is an intermolecular bond?  &gt; Chemistry has many laws, one of which is that the rate of a reaction speeds up as temperature rises.

What the article says is true only for most reactions, but not all reactions.

 [deleted] Don't mind me, just looking for the TL;DR/ELI5 version in the comments. Is the first sentence true?  I always thought the reaction rate rising with temp was a good rule of thumb but not an absolute.  Aren't there other instances where increasing temp does not increase reaction rate?  Maybe I'm confusing kinetics and pchem (dissolution). I got my bachelors in chemistry. Not only does this excite me but I absolutely LOVE how I can spend 4+ years studying something everyday and still know so little about it. This universe is so amazing.  How come this happens between bromium and muonium but not most other couples? What's special about it? What good does this mean for the average person? Time for a new textbook edition! "the lightweight muonium atom would move rapidly between two heavy bromine atoms".  This made me wonder if a lightweight atom could theoretically orbit a heavy atom.
