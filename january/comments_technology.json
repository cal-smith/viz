However they are losing ground as the majority of the Big Companies they want information for, already give them what they want, because the US govt has been abusing the Patriot Act since day one. \n\nSo while companies like Google and Microsoft to the public are extremely against the bill, on the back end, the Pro-bill advocates point at the fact these companies are hugely cooperative companies that adhere to the current demands of the US govt even without a exact law.\n\nNow there is the, what I call \"Reddit\" Anti-CISPA/CIPA. These users say CISPA is the old SOPA and PIPA. The three now 4 bills in any draft look nothing like each other. PIPA was clearly a redraft of SOPA but without the bullshit General Attorney ability to shut down a server. But CISPA was a whole different beast altogether.\n\nSOPA/PIPA was, at its root, aimed to stop Monetary Internet Banking in exchange for clearly International Intellectual Property Infringement. In the base of the bill it knew it has no power over stopping international IP issues. The point of the bill was to stop Banking to Aid it from the US. Someone read a line that didn't equal what they wanted. And that, wildly, translated into \"Diminishing Creative Thought\". It was odd, but the Internet Rallied and both bills died.\n\nCISPA, an actual terrible bill that is truly the US govt being a bad guy, rears it's head over and over. In 2012 it was introduced. The internet didn't even have to rally. The President called it down and no Democrat was going to disagree. It was so bad even the supporters of the bill were like \"Nah brah\".\n\nIn 2013 the bill came back with some, but not close to enough red lines. They called it CIPA. Less about Security and more about information sharing so that each type of business and government could help each other. The bill's glossary was expanded and references to massive cyber attacks changed the objective of the Bill from \"The US govt SHOULD get this as there are laws that already say we should\" to \"The private sector is hacked so much and so often that it is irresponsible for the Govt to not protect its citizens by forcing evil companies to continue to act so insecurely without monitor\".\n\nGood objective change, in a way. But the body of the bill really didn't change, just the statement of attitude. And since people we all still calling it CISPA, it died in the summer pretty easy.\n\nThis Reddit post kind of is ... misleading. Basically a Republican Rep (as he's paid to do) is going to bring the issue back to the floor. What we know is his team is just taking the last CISPA as a draft and they will work from there.\n\nThe Title is misleading. A new bill under the guise of CISPA has not hit the floor.

Opening up the Chrome inspector to the *Network* tab shows that the HTML for this page is 14.4 KB. At 128 Kbps, that'd take roughly a second to transfer. With a typical latency of 50ms with 4G, it hardly affects the total time. With a typical latency of 500-1000 ms on a 2G connection, you can easily double the time it takes to load a page. Now consider that this page has 23 separate resource requests (stylesheets, javascript, images, etc), and each of those potentially has an extra full second of latency added on, and it really stacks up.

Basically, it is expected that incumbents will raise and spend more money than their opponents for various reasons (name recognition, proven record, previous war chest). As well, incumbents are expected to have an advantage in winning the election for reasons independent of money (name recognition, gerrymandering, has successfully ran a campaign before). Treating every election as equal will pretty much only end up giving you the reelection rates of each house.\n\nInstead, if you look at the close races where the election is more or less even between the candidates, you get a much different picture.\n\n&gt;More outside money went to help Republicans in 60 of the 90 races we looked at, including 14 of the 25 toss-up races.

It\u2019s not statistically significant, but still quite suggestive.\n\n.  \n\n&gt;In toss-up races where the Republican benefited from a dark money advantage, only five of the 18 seats went to the Republican. Democrats won four of the seven seats where they had the dark money edge.\n\n.  \n\n&gt;The numbers confirm the emerging narrative. We can find no statistically observable relationship between the outside spending in House races and the likelihood of victory. Candidate spending may have had a small effect.

In all but the most demanding residential circumstances (such as wanting to stream 4K video without buffering), going from Xmbps to (X+Y)Mbps will not increase what you think of as \"speed\", assuming X is already greater than 10-15. This does not include heavy torrent users, families with several people streaming content at once, or business use. If you're a special case, you already know you're a special case. \n\nFor everyone else, the marketing departments at ISPs have done a fantastic job of convincing people that increasing Mbps will solve their \"speed\" problems. In reality, what matters far more are variables like oversubscription, latency, packet loss, and reliability.

Also, if I want to play an online game, upgrading my bandwidth \"package\" doesn't do me any good if my latency is still too high. Too many times I have seen friends and family members shocked that paying for twice the bandwidth still didn't solve their problems. Well, if you're area is completely oversubscribed (ISP selling too much of what it doesn't have), then a higher theoretical maximum download speed will not help you out. \n\nBefore you pay more for a higher tier bandwidth package I would highly recommend installing a router that allows you to aggregate incoming and outgoing bandwidth so you can see how much is being used.

I'd also recommend learning to use the ping utility (with a reasonably representative packet size, such as 1400) to check for packet loss on your ISP's network. \n\nI could go on a major rant here but I'll just leave it at that.

In many cases seeking *isn't* slower, but it can be annoying because the progress bar shows content having already loaded to that point even though it will have to be thrown out when you seek.\n\nSee: [DASH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP)\n\nDASH is a method used to help with network and datacenter load while improving experience for the end user. It splits a video up into 'slices' and then loads the best-quality slice it can based on your current connection. As it loads slices, they may not all be of the same quality. If you seek to a point that the player does not want to start from, it requests *an entirely new video stream* from the server which requires the DASH algorithm to reload the whole video from that point.\n\nWhen seeking, you are directed to the nearest keyframe.

So when you seek, instead of relying on your local computer to generate all the frames from the previous keyframe, it sends a request to the server for a new keyframe at that point.
