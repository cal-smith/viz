Therefore, net neutrality is a symptom of the problem of not enough competition (largely created by local laws, pole fees, and right-of-way fees).\n\nWhat we should be looking for is real *network* competition. It is not enough to have one network and those competing on top of that. We tried that with DSL and it failed something awful.\n\nI would say that we should have four networks to each home (unrealistic for some places, I know). This would completely cure network neutrality for a long time to come.\n\nThe problem that I have with municipal projects is that for right now they will match the speed of the best ISPs maybe even out-do them but what happens when 1Gb/s isn't good enough? What happens when it's time to upgrade their network. Now you have the slowest thing on earth trying to keep up with the fastest thing.\n\nThe same thing is true for ISPs competing on the same network. Who is responsible for the upgrades? All the ISPs will be against the upgrades.\n\nYou only need to look to electric utility companies to find out why I am against them. Now, that solar is almost cheaper in every state than coal, they want to charge fees to solar users. Why? Well, you can either listen to their bullshit or reason that it's because their biggest competitor is solar. Charging fees would put off profit loss for another five years. They are actively trying to slow progress towards a more efficient and cleaner product, which is ultimately better for their customers.\n\nI am pro net neutrality. I have the same concerns as you do about the FCC regulating them.

In smartphones we hit this limit too. There have been only two antennas for the last five years, typically at the bottom and the top of a phone. It's hard to put more antennas in a phone because they start to interfere with each other if they transmit simultaneously.\n\n\nAnother way to increase bandwidth is to use more spectrum but the amount of spectrum in 600 MHz - 3 GHz range available to cellular networks is limited.\n\n\nThe only \"unlimited\" way to increase bandwidth is to build more towers.

There is no reason to opt for 1080p for example, when you're watching video in small window. There's no reason to bump it up to 1080p if you've got - say - 1440x900 screen. Lastly, the way most people - and last time I checked YT was catering to roughly 1 billion unique users - prefer the quick access to content rather than default long buffering for high quality content. That's also the reason why YT generally uses the 'potato quality' compression. \n\nNow, how does it affect Google's bottom line? Well, let's think for a second what's Google business model in regards to YT, and who are you in that equation. You're essentially a product generating ad revenue for them. As such, in Google's best interest is to limit expenses: for example, bandwith usage, not to give you the highest possible quality content. In other words: they give you only as much as they need to keep you watching ads, everything above that is wasted (not counting marketing purposes).\n\nThat's how the system is supposed to behave - there are things to be fixed here (read: bugs), and it probably will be fixed at some point, but - again - Google is the one with accurate statistics from multiple sources, and they prioritize it accordingly. Funny enough, some of the issues affecting what YT defaults to might not be even in Google's hands here, but rather your ISP, home network architecture and settings, or even very PC you're using. The other explanation is they simply ignore the issue since it's inteded behavior, and they assume any user concerned enough with it will use 3rd party tools (which they might or might not pursue - for example, YT Center being taken down from Chrome Webstore...).", "score": 0},{"body": "The author of this story isn't fooling me.

To get a carry permit the standard process is for you to take firearms training and get fingerprinted and have a background check run.    Basically anyone who has one has been vetted, and any history of violent crime, anything involving drugs, any serious mental problems, you don't get one.\n\nSo you're selecting for a portion of the population who more or less has all their shit together, keeps their noses clean, and is willing to jump through legal hoops.     Probably the least dangerous subset of Americans you could come up with.\n\n&gt;or that it's possible for purchase an automatic weapon without being authorized as someone who's responsible to handle something with that kind of power. \n\nWhile it is *technically* possible for a civilian to get an automatic weapon, it's not really an everyday thing.     First issue is we did kind of a future-ban on them back in the 80s.   Basically any automatic weapon that wasn't in existence and registered by May of 86 can never be owned by a civilian.    So you're working with a set number, and every time one breaks, it's another one gone.   Eventually there will be none.\n\nSo let's say you decide you want to get one.    First of all, you'll pretty much have to be rich.    Since they're not making any more of them (and as I mentioned above, the numbers are actually decreasing), anything full auto is expensive as shit.     I think M16s go for around 16-20k.    I bought a used 5 series for less than that once.     (for reference, a recently-made semi-auto of similar design can be had for closer to $500)\n\nSo you find someone who has one and is willing to sell it to you.   Of course they can't just *sell* it to you.   You have to go to a gun dealer (FFL - Federal Firearms Licensee).   And not just any gun dealer - it has to be one who's obtained a special authorization and paid an extra tax etc etc etc.    Basically a special guy who's able to deal in these sort of items.     He'll do the transfer.\n\nBut of course, it's not just a matter of going to the special dealer, paying some fees, filling out some forms and walking away.   Every transfer has to be approved by the ATF (federal agency that deals with firearms) *and* the chief law enforcement officer of your local area.  (This is usually a chief of police for cities or a sheriff in less built up areas).     The ATF will take around a year to get back to you.    Some chiefs of police won't bother.     Some states don't allow this stuff.    (it's actually quite complicated keeping track of the jungle of laws etc and keeping yourself within them)\n\nOK, so you went through all that, everything came through after like 18 months, now you just came home from the dealer with your M16 and it's yours.     Just yours.    You have to be around it at all times when it's out of the safe, *and* you have to have a copy of the transfer form and tax stamp on you at all times.    Additionally, if you want to leave your state (say a friend has land in another state and you want to go camping and shooting), you have to fill out another form to notify the ATF.\n\nSO.....anyway - it's not exactly easy or quick, and it's in fact pretty damn rare.\n\n\nMoving on...\n\n&gt;but to have them so common that they can be sold in a superstore\n\nWell, this is an interesting argument.   I'm not sure If you guys have wal-mart or anything similar down there to do a proper comparison, but at any rate - If, say, a wal-mart sells guns (some do, some don't), it's because they have the exact same license to do so a standalone gun store would.     They go through the same background check and everything (wal-mart actually goes further, I believe, and videotapes everything).       \n\nIt's really no different than a separate store except the fact that wal-mart sells rifles &amp; shotguns means some communities where the only store for 20 miles is a wal-mart have access to them.\n\n\n&gt;and be so ingrained in the public culture that fierce arguments brake out all the time about how they should be handled, or how to prevent them being mishandled, and for those arguments to (usually) fall flat due to how sacred the gun culture is in America...\n\nThis part....well, shit, I don't know what to tell you.   We're a country born of violent revolution.   The ability to defend ones' self and family has been part of the American identity since before the country existed.   I've never lived in a USA where this wasn't the case and probably never will.\n\n\n&gt;The only thing I do notice about these arguments is that people seem to equate \"Gun Control\" to \"Take away all guns\". It doesn't need to be anything like that at all. Maybe it only needs to be \"Need to pass a basic psychological test\" and you get a license for most forms of firearms. It can be whatever you make it, however strict or lenient that it needs to be.\n\nWell, again, it goes to history.   A lot of the big voices in the gun control movement would *love* complete disarmament of the citizenry.      If you look at the history of our laws starting in 1934, it's been one long march towards more restrictions, and we all know where it ends.   (not to put too fine a point on it, but your country is exactly what we think they want to turn us into, gun law-speaking)\n\nSo it's not that we think that all gun control == take away all guns, it's more that we think that's the end goal of the people pushing it, and they're just trying to chip away at things.    Trying to demonize and ostracize people who own guns - think about it - in what other realm of discussion are you labeled a \"nut\" by default for complaining about the government passing a law that'd make you a criminal for owning a factory accessory to something you bought?\n\n&gt;Maybe it only needs to be \"Need to pass a basic psychological test\" and you get a license for most forms of firearms. It can be whatever you make it, however strict or lenient that it needs to be.\n\nYou've probably seen the argument that a registry of everyone who has a gun and exactly what types they have would be used to confiscate them, and you've probably heard the other side call anyone who thinks that crazy.\n\nHere's the thing - this *actually happened* two years ago in New York.  They passed a bill banning certain magazines, and since they had a list of everyone's guns, they knew which ones came with them from the factory, and they used the list to carry out the new law.\n\nThe idea of licensure to exercise a basic right just isn't the way we do things.    We take the stance that your rights are yours until you do something to lose them.   (Think \"innocent until proven guilty\")   \n\nNot that we want crazy people to have guns - and in fact there have been a number of improvements to the reporting of mental health issues put into the law recently to make sure that the different parts of the government talk to each other and if the crazy guy walks into wal-mart to buy a shotgun the background check comes back denied.   (**That** is most people's idea of \"common sense\" gun control.

Unfortunately the drop between LTE and 2G is very noticeable and the user experience suffers greatly.

The transport from cell site to core/Internet is the same, but the airwaves which transport data from a handset to the tower are what create a distinction. \n\nSpectrum is a finite resource, and can only support finite connections with finite backhaul in place to carry that traffic. For example, a site could be provisioned with 250mbps fiber backhaul. That total bandwidth is shared between voice calls, 3G, and LTE data. Voice usually is unaffected by busy sites, since the spectrum used to carry the calls is different from what spectrum slice is used for carrying data.\n\nI believe that wireless carriers should have traffic shaping policies in place, so all users get consistent data speeds. So each user can still enjoy unlimited LTE data, at consistent 5-10mbps speeds for downlink.\n\nThere is nothing that a user could do on mobile devices today which requires more than that bandwidth, so the ability to shape traffic so all users connected to a particular cell site can achieve that should be the goal of every carrier. Unfortunately that is not the case, and you're left with ^^fine ^^print from carriers which vary depending on the user. \n\nData access should be unlimited, at broadband speeds.

That these people were out there, and were up to something, were known qualities; it's not like somebody missed a memo and there simply wasn't a clue.\n\nOur government agencies are abducting foreign nationals and US citizens alike, holding them without formal charges being filed, and torturing them for information. People who were never charged with a crime have died from the conditions in which they are being held. Nobody can point to any useful intelligence that was gathered through these tactics, but military and FBI agents *can* point to individuals who were cooperating via the establishment of a rapport, under humane treatment, prior to the CIA taking over their interrogations. \n\nWhat we have in effect is a simple, obvious state of no privacy for some other agenda, whether the conspiracy theorists are right--and we're on the road to becoming an Orwellian police state--or it's simply a less overtly malevolent invasion of privacy.
