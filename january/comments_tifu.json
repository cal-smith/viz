Him and his buddies all show up at the same time with these lanky blonde gals. I was sitting in the corner smoking a blunt and remarking to my companion on how surreal their entrance was, as if they had appeared from some really cliche movie. So fast forward about 30 minutes, this guy shows up. He's about 150 lbs (68 kg), tall, and mousy. He seemed very unhappy in his own skin, or at the least very unsure of social endeavors. I note to my companion that it would be very true to the spirit of the night if the jocks began picking on the geeks. I began to regret this statement almost immediately and have since developed a form of survivor's guilt for ever saying it, as if predicting the event somehow called it into existence. So this neurotic mouse-man approaches this lanky blonde cheerleader. You know, the one dating the quarterback. Seeing a beer in her hand, he very nervously asks her where one might find more of the beverage. The music was very loud and she couldn't hear him but across the room I could very clearly see his eyes motioning towards her beer can and indeed the shape his lips took seemed to definitely imply that this man definitely wanted more beer. I couldn't fault the cheerleader, I have had much experience in providing beers for people suffering from varying degrees of incoherence. I hear her voice pique above all the noise \"*WHAT?*\". This is the pivotal moment of the night, and I believe if he had walked away at that moment he would have been fine. Fate, sadly, insisted this poor boy to lean closer to the blondes ear and again ask the age old question \"where is the beer?\". The blondes face scrunched up in sour grapes, I suppose he had bad breath. She pushes him away and goes into the kitchen, where her friends and the beer was. She starts telling her boyfriend about the strange encounter with an acne faced weirdo in the front room. The boy, eventually learning from someone the secret location of our alcoholic beverages, enters the kitchen and the girl points him out. \"That's him, that's the freak!\" She laughed and her boyfriend chuckles like a tiger purring. He was a mountain of a man. 250 pounds of lean muscle, seemingly chiseled by Greek sculptors of old. But the unfortunate mouse man had very limited situational awareness and decided an appropriate response to such an insult would be \"Bitch\". So our drunken bulldozer throws his beer upon the floor, and knocks two fifths of good whiskey off the counter. He grabs the boy up by the shirt and runs him out of the house, knocking over many a partygoer in his wake. He drops the boy in the yard, and the boy gets to his feet. He's a boy now, a mere child fighting against an infinitely stronger man with no fatherly compassion. A hit to the boys face sends him down. The jock leaps on top of him, and you can hear the air rush out of him due to a subsequent blow to the stomach. The jock begins bashing the boys face into the dirt, punch after punch. Long, momentous punches carrying extraordinary force. I could have swore he was trying to kill this kid. I was witnessing murder... Because someone called someone a bitch. It dawns on the jock that maybe he's being a little rough. He gets off the kid, walks bloody-nuckeled back inside like nothing happened. The boy stands up and his face looks like it's been hit with a hammer. I witnessed misshapen features like a zigzag nose or a mouth cracked open in the corner. Most gruesome of all, his eye seemed to swell from its socket, the white part turned dark red from all the violence. He got to a hospital that night, but I haven't seen him since. I sometimes see that jock at different stores and the like, but I keep better company nowadays and do not allow bears to attend my social gatherings.
