There are two issues being conflated in this, and every other Muhammad Cartoon fiasco. Is the problem depiction of Muhammad or criticism of Muhammad? They are being treated like they are the same thing, but they aren't. If Muslims are offended by Muhammad cartoons because Muhammad should not be depicted in Islam than we should really be addressing the historical frieze of Prophet Muhammad on the North Wall of the U.S. Supreme Court. There's also countless works of art throughout Islamic History that we need to answer for. It also raises the question why there was no controversy when South Park first debuted the Muhammad character in July 2001 as a member of \"The Super Best Friends,\" a superhero team of religious figures who fight evil (except for Buddha, who doesn't believe in evil).\n\nThe fact, is none of the prophets should be depicted in Islam. So, in theory, Revolution Muslim should have been sending threats the first time Jesus appeared on South Park years ago. In fact, Muslims should have stood along side Christians offended by Andres Serrano's Piss Christ and Chris Ofili's depiction of the Virgin Mary covered in elephant dung. Did they? Islamically speaking it goes beyond prophets. No living things are supposed to be depicted. Islam is an aniconic religion. So in reality, if the issue is a religious objection to depiction, Muslims should be objecting to every cartoon everywhere. It seems like hypocrisy to play favorites with our outrage. So, something else must be going on here.\n\nSo maybe it's about protecting the Prophet from criticism, as the South Park episode suggests. Muhammad is simultaneously the most beloved and the more reviled figure in history. So, let's not pretend that that's insignificant. It is more socially acceptable to say slanderous and defamatory things about Muhammad and Islam than any other religious tradition. I'm not just talking about mockery and satire, I'm talking about real substantive hate speech. I live in a society where political figures like Tom Tancredo are cheered for suggesting we drop a nuclear bomb on Mecca. Where Harvard professors like Martin Kramer advocate starving the Palestinian people to stop them from procreating. Where bloggers like Robert Spencer who practically regard my religion as a satanic cult are regarded as experts on Islam. I think this is a social issue, not a legal issue, but let's not pretend that Prophet Muhammad is not open to criticism.\n\nSo, what's going on here? If it's not depiction and it's not criticism what is it? The genius of South Park is that they were able to strike the root of the matter by isolating the variable. They never actually depicted the Prophet. It turns out that it was Santa Clause in the bear suit the whole time. And every image of Muhammad was censored. They also never actually criticized the Prophet. In the episode he's something of a heroic figure who saves the town. He's treated respectfully. He's not insulted, or defamed. In fact, his only role in the show is to be in high demand. The most offensive thing in episode, in my mind, was Buddha snorting cocaine. And yet Revolution Muslim still lept to the defense of Muhammad. Why?\n\nTo me it is now clear that it's not about Muhammad at all. Defending Muhammad is just a cloak of religious sanction these Muslims use to legitimize their behavior. Trey Parker and Matt Stone laid the trap, and Revolution Muslim jumped in.

Do they turn to the religion's teachings and cite those, or do they cite other problems in their lives? Perhaps some religions' teachings are more prone to be cited as justifying violence than others, and the teachers of those religions may face more of a challenge to show how the teachings do not in fact promote violence.\n\nNone of this is very straightforward though, since there are layers of history, politics, psychology and religious interpretation to plough through in finding out what motivates a religion's follower to commit violence.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 6, "created": 1420666041.0},{"body": "Buddhists aren't killing people at the rate Muslims are.

I work pretty hard to dispel some of the myths about Islam, and really try to live a life as a teacher who operates this way towards all ideologies (including atheism; I'm the guy who gets in trouble for preaching that we, God forbid, love our Muslim/Atheist/Jewish/Buddhist/whatever brothers and sisters). This to say, I'm not the type that's going to talk negatively about Islam (or any other ideology) for the sake of doing so. \n\nThe reason I've taken the time to explain all of that is to make clear that what I'm about to say is not a jab at Islam, it just happens to be the part about Islam that bothers me the most. Before moving on, I should clearly note that I'm simply providing an objective explanation of those two quotes actually make sense together in Islamic ideology. I'm *not*, however, in support of those beliefs, nor am I defending them.\n\nThe concept of \"peace\" (\"salaam\" in Arabic) simply does not mean what most of us think when we consider that word. In most culture, ideology, and language, \"peace\" generally indicates a lack of conflict. The quote you're citing here about Mohammad \"conveying a message of peace\", followed by a comment about killing people for drawing pictures, looks incredibly flawed an illogical to you and I, but in classical, conservative Islam, there's no discrepancy in the quote.\n\n\"Peace\" in Islamic culture means something totally different. It isn't necessarily the absence of conflict, rather it's heavily dependent upon justice. There's not a concept of peace in sense that \"we all get along and fighting stops\", rather that justice has been carried out on all that would cause there to be any kind of fighting against Islam. That's a main part of justice, too. It's not that everything is conflict-free, it's that conflict against Islam has ceased, and until then, there is no justice.\n\nIt's fairly twisted. Christianity nor Judaism hold to these beliefs. You may find sects within those religions that think that way (Evangelical Christianity is definitely one of them, but they have more in common with Islam than they'd ever be willing to even consider), but when we've seen that form of ideology take place in Christianity, it has collapsed (i.e. the Catholic Church, while still prominent, doesn't control half the world anymore).\n\nIt's *really* important to note that not all Muslims think this way. Many of them have a much more progressive view of Islam, and most Muslims truly do want to live in harmony with the rest of the world, without the tenant of classical, more \"old school\" Islamic justice that says there's no peace until Islam is the only thing around.

The silent march will start at 18:00 on the Place de la Republique in the east of the French capital. \"This massacre plunges our country, our city and our democracy in mourning. \"We are hit in the heart of our freedom'' said the mayor Wednesday in a statement.  \n  \nEdit 34: (16:04) suddenly marches are called for at 18:00 everywhere. Trafalgar square in London, Parizer platz in Berlin, place de Luxembourg in Brussels and all over France.  \n  \nJust to be clear on Paris: the journalist union said to gather today at 1800, the mayor's march is at 1800 tomorrow on Place de la Republique.  \n\nEdit 35: (16:20) US Embassy in France changes profile photo to \"Je Suis Charlie\": http://i.imgur.com/wXTcVGl.jpg  \n  \nEdit 36: (16:21) First people are showing up on Place de la Republique. Some holding signs with 'Je suis Charlie'. (I am Charlie.)  \n  \nEdit 37: (16:30) So much people want to come together the LeMonde newspaper put up an interactive map. Over 45 places in France where people will come together to mourn. http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2015/01/07/charlie-hebdo-la-carte-des-rassemblements-d-hommage-en-france_4550916_4355770.html\n\nEdit 38: Live YouTube feed from the place of the attacks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeIy0zH77MM  \n(currently showing police investigators doing their work).\n  \nEdit 39: using the hashtag [#JeSuisCharlie](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JeSuisCharlie?src=hash) people around the world are showing their support.\n  \nEdit 40: (16:42) I will not be online as much as I was until now for the next few hours. I'll keep reporting in intermittently while keeping an eye on the manhunt and the gatherings/demonstrations (demonstrators of the far-right National Front already engaged police just now.) People look very angry here: https://twitter.com/olivierfaye   \n  \nEdit 41: Le Monde reports: Details of one of the two police officers killed: he was a brigadier on mountain bike, arrived there with a colleague. Aged 40, named Ahmed, he was stationed at the police station in the 11th arrondissement. His colleague was wounded in the ankle, as well as two other officers arrived afterwards.\n\nEdit 42: (17:03) Twitter:  \n\"I agree with the French imam who called the slain journalists martyrs for liberty\" - Secretary of State John Kerry  \nOther side of the medal: https://storify.com/CEP/isis-supporters-respond-to-paris-terror-attack  \n  \nEdit 43: (17:12) No words needed for Ruben L Oppenheimers comic: https://twitter.com/RLOppenheimer/status/552848047089405952/photo/1  \n  \nThis post reached max length.

Lots of pictures of crowds coming together. Peacefully, luckily. The manhunt is still ongoing. I will report back if there are developments in this story.  \nCrowd in Bordeaux, in the South West of France: http://i.imgur.com/DO0BLgG.jpg\n\nEdit 45: Large peaceful crowds everywhere in France: http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/live/2015/01/07/en-direct-des-coups-de-feu-au-siege-de-charlie-hebdo_4550635_3224.html  \n\nEdit 46: (18:51) Breakdown of the deceased: 8 editors, 2 policemen, one visitor, one receptionist.  \n  \nEdit 47: (19:10) Salman Rushdie in the WSJ: \u201cReligion, a mediaeval form of unreason, when combined with modern weaponry becomes a real threat to our freedoms. This religious totalitarianism has caused a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam and we see the tragic consequences in Paris today. I stand with Charlie Hebdo, as we all must, to defend the art of satire, which has always been a force for liberty and against tyranny, dishonesty and stupidity. \u2018Respect for religion\u2019 has become a code phrase meaning \u2018fear of religion.\u2019 Religions, like all other ideas, deserve criticism, satire, and, yes, our fearless disrespect.\u201d   \nhttp://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/01/07/salman-rushdie-i-stand-with-charlie-hebdo-as-we-all-must/  \n  \nEdit 48: (19:14) This I found a chilling quote - after shooting the policeman on the ground (his name was Ahmed Merabet) one terrorist says to the other: C'\u00e9tait pas un alg\u00e9rien. C'est bon.\" (He wasnt an algerian, it's alright.)  \n  \nEdit 49: (19:20) The International Press Centre in Paris will hold one minute silence at 1100 tomorrow and calls upon all editorial offices to do the same.\n\nEdit 50: (20:17) The French president is now addressing the nation. I will get some quotes to update this thread with shortly.  \n  \nGoogle search page in France has a black ribbon instead of a doodle: http://i.imgur.com/yt9Jauz.png  \n  \nEdit 51: Francois Hollande: \"freedom will always be stronger than barbarism (...) The gathering of all, in all its forms, is what should be our response (...) Our greatest weapon is our unity (...) Nothing will make us bend. Long live the Republic and long live France!\".  \n  \nEdit 52: (20:26) A map with (worldwide) all the gatherings in solidarity with what happened today: https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/find-a-jesuischarlie-gathering-near-you-with-this-map/s2/a563699/  \nFor anyone wondering what the dot in the Indian Ocean is: La Reunion, a French island.  \n  \nAlso, it is announced that tomorrow, Thursday, will be a national day of mourning in France.   \n  \nThis image http://i.imgur.com/AciNgfx.jpg of president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande really is saddening.  \n  \nEdit 53: (20:42) Over 100,000 people are gathered now throughout France, at least 35,000 in Paris alone.  \n  \nEdit 54: (21:00) **People, I'm out of here for now.

By 1975, Kissinger had secretly channeled $16 million of military aid to the Kurds, who believed that Washington was finally supporting their right to self-determination. The following year, however, the Pike report, issued by the House Select Committee on Intelligence, revealed that the U.S. had never had any intention of supporting a Kurdish state:\n\n\"'Documents in the Committee\u2019s possession clearly show that the president, Dr. Kissinger and the foreign head of state [the Shah of Iran] hoped that our clients [the Kurds] would not prevail.

This policy was not imparted to our clients, who were encouraged to continue fighting.'\"5\n\n\"At the 1975 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) summit, Iran and Iraq temporarily resolved their border dispute. The Iraqi government was then informed that U.S. support for the Kurds would be withdrawn, while the Kurds themselves were kept uninformed about what was happening. Iraqi forces immediately launched an aggressive campaign against the Kurdish rebels. \"The insurgents were clearly taken by surprise. Their adversaries, knowing of the impending aid cut-off, launched an all out search-and-destroy campaign the day after the agreement [with Iran] was signed.

It's like saying the US finances the KKK because some of it's citizens pay dues. If you want to stop money and support flowing from the citizens of those countries you need the corporation of those countries to do so. \n\n\nAlso, we have to understand the context. This isn't a tactical conference where they discuss military strategies this is a meeting of *states* to discuss what the international community can do to impact ISIS. The things they are going to talk about are how to stop the flow of money/recruits into ISIS, and what military power these countries are willing to commit. The Kurds are not their own state and have no real presence in the international community. There isn't anything they would really be able to contribute to the conversation in a meaningful way in this context. Another way to describe this is this is a conference that will be attended by the US State Department, not the US Department of Defense.

It's an internal powder keg for Turkey and if they don't navigate that properly they could be dealing with their own civil war, not exactly good for the region at this point. If your goal is to get the counties to corporate with stopping the flow of support to ISIS, your first step should not be to piss off one of the most important countries you need to contribute. \n\n\n\nTo summarize:\n\n* The conference is for the international diplomatic community not necessary the military community. \n\n* The Kurds would not be able to meaningfully contribute to the topics of the conference\n\n* An invitation to the Kurds would be mostly symbolic. \n\n* The symbol would piss off some of the key players of the conference, and could even result in some critical nations backing out. \n\n* If you want the cooperation of the nations, you don't start a conference off by pissing off key contributors before it even starts.\n\n**TL;DR**: It's called diplomacy. You can't always make everyone happy and still meet your goals. \n\nedit: post-coffee phrasing.", "gilded": 0, "score": 131, "created": 1422022793.0},{"body": "People end up being way too idealist when it comes to a lot of foreign relations especially in the Middle East and seem to think everything is black and white.

Although there have always been cities, they didn\u2019t really have fixed borders for larger geographical areas until the Europeans came along and started drawing maps.\n\nThey were all used to gradually shifting alliances, and long-term feuds.  There was an overarching Ottoman empire in the region for centuries, but it didn\u2019t correspond to today\u2019s national boundaries.  Those boundaries were set up, mostly by Britain and France, after the Ottoman empire finally gave out in 1922.\n\nThe British and French set up the boundaries for their convenience, not for those of the underlying peoples.  In particular, the Kurds didn\u2019t get their own country but were instead divided up over a bunch of other countries.  They immediately had a revolution to change that, and were put down. So they had another revolution, which was put down.  And another, and another.\n\nTurkey responded by clamping down on Kurdish identity, banning the language, which of course just makes resentment simmer more.  Things started to take a terrorist turn in the 70s, and so Turkey clamped down even harder.  So the Kurds hate the Turks, and the Turks fear the Kurds.\n\nAt this point you have to wonder why the Turks care about the Kurdish region at all.  They probably wonder why the United States bothered fighting its Civil War for unity was well.  The Kurds in Iraq are sitting on some oil fields, but the Kurds in Turkey aren\u2019t.  \n\nPartly it\u2019s to keep the whole country from falling apart.  If you let the Kurds have a country, then the Zazas will want a country.  Give it to them, and the Armenians will want to secede.  And so on.\n\nPartly, it\u2019s because there are Kurds all over Turkey, not just in the Kurdistan region.  If the Kurds have a separate country it will cause unrest in Istanbul.  Turkey really wants to be a first-world country and join Europe, and they can\u2019t do that if they\u2019re falling apart.\n\nMostly, at this point, I think it\u2019s just sheer determination not to let the other guys win.\n\nhttp://askville.amazon.com/Turkey-hate-Kurds/AnswerViewer.do?requestId=4238698", "gilded": 0, "score": 6, "created": 1422026689.0},{"body": "Why is everybody forgetting about Syria?

The US average for federal, state, and local taxes on gasoline &amp; diesel are [$0.499 and $0.554](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_taxes_in_the_United_States) respectively. \n\nAt the federal level, [there's actually a pretty interesting story](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-diesel-costs-more-than-gasoline-2013-10) behind the different  tax rates ($0.184 for gas and $0.244 for diesel). The article is about President Reagan and the trucking industry getting into a slapfight during the 80s.\n\nAs for why there's a $1 difference in the prices, it's basically due completely to how refineries are configured in the US. The US creates more gasoline than diesel fuel, while the opposite is true in Europe. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2gaieq/eli5_why_in_north_america_is_diesel_more/) is a great ELI5 thread about it. The best answer in that thread:\n\n&gt;I finally can answer something. It's simply a matter of supply.\n\n&gt;It's simply a matter of refinery configuration. In the US most refineries are optimized to make gasoline over diesel. We have units call fluid catalytic crackers that break down long hydrocarbon chains into components meant for gasoline.\n\n&gt;In Europe most refineries instead have hydro-crackers that instead break down long hydrocarbon chains into components for diesel.\n\n&gt;Also trade flows are such that the US tends to export surplus diesel and imports gasoline and vice versa for Europe. This trade flow happens because of demand and arbitrage.\n\n&gt;Source: I trade crude oil\n\n&gt;TL:DR - European refineries make more diesel than gasoline and vice versa in the US\n\nHope that helps!\n\n\n**Edit**\n\n/u/Nanoo_1972 pointed out that refining diesel costs more than gasoline, so I did a bit of research on it.\n\nI actually just looked it up, and the US Energy Information Administration actually has a [a breakdown](http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/) of what you're paying for in a gallon of either.\n\nIt's for November, but according to their percentages, here's a little chart of what you're paying for in a gallon of gas or diesel:\n\n**Gasoline**\n-----\n$2.91/gal\n\nTaxes: $0.4365/gal (15%)\n\nDistribution &amp; marketing: $0.4947 (17%)\n\nRefining: $0.1746 (6%)\n\nCrude Oil: $1.8042 (62%)\n\n**Diesel**\n----\n$3.65/gal\n\nTaxes: $0.511 (14%)\n\nDistribution &amp; Marketing: $0.8776 (24%)\n\nRefining: $0.4745 (13%)\n\nCrude Oil: $1.825 (50%)\n\nAccording to their figures, it costs 2.7x more to refine diesel fuel as it does regular gasoline.
