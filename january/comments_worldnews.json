This is true for both democratic parties, revolutionary groups, and militant religious organizations. Religion is merely a tool to achive that goal, and it's very effective. Also, you're wrong, Islam does not encourage terrorism, definitely not the murder of innocent people. No doubt you've read a lot of quotes from the quran about \"killing the infidels\", but do you know the context of which they were written? The quran is not an easy read by any means, and just like any other religious scripture, is full of contradictions and passages open to interpretation/exploitation. Even reading the translated complete version for me meant a lot of head scratching, and a constant need for a dictionary and rereading of passages as their meaning was rarely ever cut clearly out in capital letters for one. However, to get back on track, rather than listing up a long line of examples of exploitation and misinterpretation of islamic verses, try reading [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2rz5dn/the_muslim_clerk_at_the_paris_kosher_store_risked/cnkvvw6) - it goes quite well in depth with the issue, and is a regardless what you believe, an fascinating, educational, and well written read.\n\nAlso, you clearly don't know a lot about history. The middle east experienced far more longer streaks of peacefull times than clashes of warfare (look up the islamic golden age for a starting example). Especially when compared to Europe, they've been in the historical perspective significantly better at not only upholding peace, stability, and avoid major conflicts, but also coexisting with other cultures and religions. \n\nAlso, the idea of islam being a political system is a logical fallacy. Is christianity a political system because of the Vatican? Is Judaism so because of Jerusalem? Both of those religions has a law/rule system just like islam has with Sharia. That theocratic states exist doesn't make islam a political system any more than catholicism is. A wheel doesn't make a bike, but you can apply a wheel to a bike to make it run, regardless of what philosophy it stems from. Religions differ from political ideologies through that they're guiding philosophies, using the bike metaphor, wheels on their own. Political ideologies are meant to function on a grander scale, but cannot be applied on the individual. Kinda like how the parts of an aeroplane can collectively function to make itself fly, but a massive fiberglass wing on it's own is completely useless.\n\nI think you should expand your horizon - Once one tries to look past single-cause scapegoats, you'll realize that the situation is far more complex than you can imagine.

We'll start just before the Spanish-American war :\n\n&gt;But Spanish Cuba remained the thorn in the side of the United States. The Florida and Yucatan straits were narrow. Although the Spaniards, even in their weakened state, might have been able to block U.S. trade routes, it was the British who worried the Americans most. Based in the Bahamas, near Cuba, the British, of many conflicting minds on the United States, could seize Cuba and impose an almost impregnable blockade, crippling the U.S. economy. The British depended on American grain, and it couldn't be ruled out that they would seek to gain control over exports from the Midwest in order to guarantee their own economic security. The fear of British power helped define the Civil War and the decades afterward.\n\n&gt;Cuba was the key. In the hands of a hostile foreign power, it was as effective a plug to the Mississippi as taking New Orleans. The weakness of the Spaniards frightened the Americans. Any powerful European power \u2014 the British or, after 1871, the Germans \u2014 could easily knock the Spaniards out of Cuba. And the United States, lacking a powerful navy, would not be able to cope. Seizing Cuba became an imperative of U.S. strategy. Theodore Roosevelt, who as president would oversee America's emergence as a major naval power \u2014 and who helped ensure the construction of the Panama Canal, which was critical to a two-ocean navy \u2014 became the symbol of the U.S. seizure of Cuba in the Spanish-American War of 1898-1900.\n\n&gt;With that seizure, New Orleans-Atlantic transit was secured. The United States maintained effective control over Cuba until the rise of Fidel Castro. But the United States remained anxious about Cuba's security. By itself, the island could not threaten the supply lines. In the hands of a significant hostile power, however, Cuba could become a base for strangling the United States. Before World War II, when there were some rumblings of German influence in Cuba, the United States did what it could to assure the rise of former Cuban leader Fulgencio Batista, considered an American ally or puppet, depending on how you looked at it. But this is the key: Whenever a major foreign power showed interest in Cuba, the United States had to react, which it did effectively until Castro seized power in 1959.\n\n&gt;The Soviet Influence\n\n&gt;If the Soviets were looking for a single point from which they could threaten American interests, they would find no place more attractive than Cuba. Therefore, whether Fidel Castro was a communist prior to seizing power, it would seem that he would wind up a communist ally of the Soviets in the end. I suspect he had become a communist years before he took power but wisely hid this, knowing that an openly communist ruler in Cuba would revive America's old fears. Alternatively, he might not have been a communist but turned to the Soviets out of fear of U.S. intervention. The United States, unable to read the revolution, automatically moved toward increasing its control. Castro, as a communist or agrarian reformer or whatever he was, needed an ally against U.S. involvement. Whether the arrangement was planned for years, as I suspect, or in a sudden rush, the Soviets saw it as a marriage made in heaven.\n\n&gt;Had the Soviets never placed nuclear weapons in Cuba, the United States still would have opposed a Soviet ally in control of Cuba during the Cold War. This was hardwired into American geopolitics. But the Soviets did place missiles there, which is a story that must be touched on as well.\n\n&gt;The Soviet air force lacked long-range strategic bombardment aircraft. In World War II, they had focused on shorter range, close air support aircraft to assist ground operations. The United States, engaging both Germany and Japan from the air at long range, had extensive experience with long-range bombing. Therefore, during the 1950s, the United States based aircraft in Europe, and then, with the B-52 in the continental United States, was able to attack the Soviet Union with nuclear weapons. The Soviets, lacking a long-range bomber fleet, could not retaliate against the United States. The balance of power completely favored the United States.\n\n&gt;The Soviets planned to leapfrog the difficult construction of a manned bomber fleet by moving to intercontinental ballistic missiles. By the early 1960s, the design of these missiles had advanced, but their deployment had not. The Soviets had no effective deterrent against a U.S. nuclear attack except for their still-underdeveloped submarine fleet. The atmosphere between the United States and the Soviet Union was venomous, and Moscow could not assume that Washington would not use its dwindling window of opportunity to strike safely against the Soviets.\n\n&gt;The Soviets did have effective intermediate range ballistic missiles. Though they could not reach the United States from the Soviet Union, they could cover almost all of the United States from Cuba. The Russians needed to buy just a little time to deploy a massive intercontinental ballistic missile and submarine force. Cuba was the perfect spot from which to deploy it. Had they succeeded, the Soviets would have closed the U.S. window of opportunity by placing a deterrent force in Cuba. They were caught before they were ready. The United States threatened invasion, and the Soviets had to assume that the Americans also were threatening an overwhelming nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. They had to back down. As it happened, the United States intended no such attack, but the Soviets could not know that.\n\n&gt;Cuba was seared into the U.S. strategic mentality in two layers. It was never a threat by itself. Under the control of a foreign naval power, it could strangle the United States. After the Soviet Union tried to deploy intermediate range ballistic missiles there, a new layer was created in which Cuba was a potential threat to the American mainland, as well as to trade routes. The agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union included American guarantees not to invade Cuba and Soviet guarantees not to base nuclear weapons there. But Cuba remained a problem for the United States. If there were a war in Europe, Cuba would be a base from which to threaten American control of the Caribbean, and with it, the ability to transit ships from the U.S. Pacific Fleet to the Atlantic. The United States never relieved pressure on Cuba, the Soviets used it as a base for many things aside from nuclear weapons (we assume), and the Castro regime clung to the Soviets for security while supporting wars of national liberation, as they were called, in Latin America and Africa that served Soviet strategic interests.\n\n\nSo Cuba, strategic location. USA does not want foreign power to locate there because it's been a big problem in the past. Therefore, not very eager to let go of Guantanamo. Whether I think this reasoning is right or wrong is not relevant. This is the attitude of the US towards Cuba.\n", "score": 1},{"body": "America and Britain Should Support Ukraine's Sovereignty Under the Budapest Memorandum -\n\nhttp://en.censor.net.ua/news/315106/america_should_support_ukraines_sovereignty_under_the_budapest_memorandum_the_huffington_post\n\nhttp://www.dw.de/ukraines-forgotten-security-guarantee-the-budapest-memorandum/a-18111097\n\nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ukraine._Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances", "score": 1},{"body": "History has proven that land belongs to whoever can hold it.

This hurt the Russian economy, but it alone would never be enough.  \n\nObama cut a deal with the Saudis, having them ignore OPEC pleas to cut production, so that global oil prices would fall.  The Saudis were happy to do so because it would screw their regional enemies in Iran, Syria, Iraq, and of course ISIS - all of whom are threats to the last major monarchy on the planet.  The Saudis publicly said it was to \"limit the long term impact of the fracking industry\" which is absolute BS.  \n\nWhen you drill for oil, the bulk of the sunk expenses are spent before you even start producing oil.  Finding oil, drilling for it, and then pumping it are simply expensive.  Once you've spent that money, you're not going to shut down the well because $40/barrel (with $10 continuing expenses) is always better than nothing.  Sure, new fracking projects will be put on hold because it no longer makes financial sense to pay the costs to find, drill, and pump the oil, but the current projects will continue until they don't pump out enough to justify their continuing expenses.  Stated another way, the Saudi's stated reason for depressing oil prices doesn't hold water.\n\nWhat do falling oil prices accomplish?  They crater economies that are dependent on high oil prices.  Putin is an oligarch, plain and simple.  Putin and his cronies have stolen billions - to the point where there are credible reports calling Putin the richest man on earth - from the Russian economy which has been propped up by $100/barrel oil.  In fact, the Russian government budget is dependent on $100/barrel oil! \n\nWhen the price drops, countries like Russia get whacked because they can no longer use their money coming out of the ground to support their policies.  Add in the sanctions and the Russian economy is simply fucked.   Putin will continue in Ukraine because he needs to keep the population distracted, but in reality that only amplifies the pain, because every dollar spent in Ukraine is one that isn't spent at home.\n\nWhere does this lead?

Pro-Assad groups say Israel supports the rebels and anti-Assad groups say Israel supports him. Fact is Israel has stayed out of the war and only taken action when there was a direct threat to its citizens. Since most of the rebels are more interested in fighting Assad now (though are clear they will come after Israel once they win), Israel has largely left them alone and had no reason to engage with them (though it has arrested numerous Israeli Arabs who traveled to Syrian to join the Islamic State). Should the rebel attack Israel, you'd better believe Israel will retaliate.\n\nYour attempt to make it seem like Israel is siding with America's enemies is laughable.

The problem with that assessment, is taking the Bible as a historical account is something rather new, and wasn't previously understood this way.\n\nWhich brings me to its allegorical significance: As a piece of literature, the Bible is a massive work with clever literary devices at play across the work. There is deep significance in the language used, the stories represented, and what they tell us. That is what, I feel, ultimately matters with a work like the Bible. The Bible won't change, only our interpretation of it will become more refined as the conservative \"all of this 100% actually happened\" die out. Not to mention The Bible has the unfortunate place of being incorrectly translated on *multiple* occasions throughout history. The key is to understanding the stories, how they work within the framework of the Bible, and their significance. It's a beautiful work; but demands proper analysis to be truly enriching.\n\n&gt;I don't really know why you're shifting the blame from religion, when religion is just a set of ideas created and maintained and modified by humans.\n\nMany of these are due to mistranslations and misinterpretations from previous generations that didn't know as much about the Bible as we do now thanks to academia and research. 80 years ago, I highly doubt your average person knew that when \"homosexuals\" are mentioned in Paul's Letters to the Corinthians, it was due to a mistranslation (thanks to the King James Version). Now we know the correct translation are not references to homosexuals; but \"sodomites\". Sodomites were male prostitutes, which is a clear difference.\n\nFurther, as I've stated and what many seem not to get, a BOOK is not responsible for riots and killings. Corrupt institutions brought in to represent religion are more of the problem. Look at what happened after the crusades and the Knights Templar. They were hunted down, tortured, and burnt at the stake because someone made up a rumor they were worshiping a goat head, and the severed head of John the Baptist. Those responsible built a case against them, and forced the members into confession. Afterwards, members of the Knights Templar stated what they admitted to was bullshit. But guess what? They were burnt at the stake anyway.\n\nYou seem to miss the fact that people act a certain way over the most trivial shit. People rioted at a GUNS N ROSES CONCERT because Axl Rose refused to perform. People in Boston RIOTED after the world series....BECAUSE THEY WON.

Since independence the country has done nothing but push itself forward as hard as it could, which means every working citizen down to the blue-collared laborer is driven to bettering themselves even when they're already over-qualified by international standards. To give you an example, last year one of our ministers released a statement saying our country had too many active lawyers, which was making law practice very hard to succeed in. The same can almost be said for other high paying white-collared jobs such as Medicine and engineering. This means to say, everyone is stressed from working hard, therefore happiness is lost.\n\n2. As an offshoot of our hard work, one of the things that developed throughout the past few years was a culture of improvement. This was laid out pretty openly back in the 1960's when leaders were planning Singapore's future. The idea was to inculcate a national mindset of continual advancement, to make the individual want more than they already had. This would prevent citizens from getting lazy and stagnant. To a large extent, this has worked. Having finished 11 years in the education system here, I can tell you 99.9% of Singaporeans would be incredibly unhappy if they got anything less than a high-paying white collared job, which of course is its own problem but that's another discussion. So this culture of improvement led to increased discontent among citizens, which honestly is something that's pretty prevalent throughout most advanced first-world nations.\n\nSo no, we're not unhappy because the \"evil government\" is stepping on our necks with a steel studded boot.
