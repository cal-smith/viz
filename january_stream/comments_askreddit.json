He teaches (mad) science to out of control, second and third generations of super humans as community service.\n\nHe shrank a bank and broke some rules, even though he eventually gave it back.

My father was brought up in the imperial system, everything in his head most of the time is in that system only. I was educated in the metric system everything is in that system for me most of the time. I have learnt to a basic level (from my father) the imperial system and he has also to a basic level learnt the metric system (mostly from me and from the changes of metrification), this purely on the basis that 99 times out of 100 he will ask for something from me in his system ie 6inches of this or a pint of that and for me it's vice versa. \n &amp;nbsp;\n \nMy entire knowledge of the metric system is to me 'in built' as it's what I know and was as such calibrated throughout my schooling, none of it made any real mention other than in passing that the imperial system is the old way and metric as we were learning is the new way and very briefly why it was better. However like I've said, I can work in imperial units when required by generally someone older. \n &amp;nbsp;\n \nAnd so on to my point, I just don't understand why it's not set in stone by government that the USA migrates to the metric system in much the same way that the UK and Republic of Ireland did so many years ago.  \n &amp;nbsp;\n \nNext to nothing changes except the following (+ my brief reasons why). \n &amp;nbsp;\n \n- **Education** - new children starting school for their first ever day are taught in metric only. No imperial system to be used at any time for these students educational purposes. Any existing students who are not starting school for the first time in their lives continue as they were learning in imperial/mix of units. No issue, everyone bar teachers should be happy and being honest even teachers should have no issue to adapting as their material change on at least an annual basis. \n \n- **Packaging of products** - everything remains the same, a 1 gallon jug stays just that, same size, same price, same packaging except that it now adds a metric weight/measure beside the imperial one. Apply this to everything, milk, fruit, boxed items, postage measurements, fuel. Everyones happy and everyone getting exposure to how much a metric measure of their day to day item actually is. \n \n- **Duality of signage** - any new road signs or signs showing distances show both the measures of the distance. Everyone that knows miles will still understand how far they have to go, but will start to get used to the idea that 80km is also 50miles. \n &amp;nbsp;\n \nIn time (30years or so) this will become the norm for young people, people will become used to it and those going through the updated education system (like myself) wont see a significant advantage to the old system. Therefore their use of the old imperial system wont make a difference day to day as they think and work in metric. \n &amp;nbsp;\n \nMove forward and 60 years after the introduction, the children of my generation will have been brought up by metric parents and therefore there will be very few people who will work in the old system fully and very few will have any real understanding of how many yards in a mile etc. \n &amp;nbsp;\n \nLike the UK and Ireland, the systems will slowly change by itself, manufactures will see that there's no point in offering 2lb of meat and start doing it in 1kg volumes after a period of time. People wont be happy with this change but over the course of 30years it's a grumble rather than the current hard sell that metrification has been for Americans (and British and Irish people).  \n &amp;nbsp;\n \nYes you do get some strange things like 4pints of milk (not in ROI) but on the whole 30 odd years after the metrification things are going well towards a 100% metric future. \n &amp;nbsp;\n \n**The key advantages to doing it this way are**\n\n- less opposition to the change to start with as nothing actually gets taken from anyone, everyone still gets the units and measures they are used to \n\n- easier to work with as no one has to outright learn the new system as they can continue to use the old one \n\n- you would be working on a common system with the rest of the world \n\n- avoids costly mistakes where unit confusion occurs (see certain space mission pancaked on Mars) \n  &amp;nbsp;\n\n**Main downsides**\n\n- people may get confused (very limited this one but the duality of the process means it's hard to find an excuse for confusion outside of stupidity) \n\n- slight cost implication to complete (change to packaging but if announced very early before the change would have no real cost addition because it would be possible to implement in advance of the change when a product changes the packaging at a point in the near future) \n\n- fuel (and some other things) will at some point need to change to metric (as they can't easily advertise prices in both on signs) but there's nothing wrong with that being done after 30years of the receipts showing both units and people getting used to it. A simple process of legislating that all signs are changed to metric and stations when they update signage can easily add the few $ for an add on they can mount with the word 'litres'.  \n\n- long process to implement (requires commitment but if it's made law then it wont fail and just requires patience).

Every last one of them, because just LOOK at those fuckers.\n\nStage two: About 45 minutes later He starts coming down a little and realizes this place is pretty much fucking uninhabitable because of the weird weather conditions caused by jamming ever imaginable type of ecosystem into a relatively small landmass. But then He does a couple bumps and remembers that this place is gonna be FUCKING AWESOME. He decides that what this joint really needs is more MOUNTAINS. Because mountains are KICK-ASS. So He wipes out the western half of the continent and replaces it with a seemingly never-ending mountain range. Just hundreds of miles of majestic peaks and confused mandrills wondering what the shit just happened to their jungle habitat.\n\nStage Three: God pounds a few more lines and re-considers His approach. This continent is just NOT FUCKING AWESOME ENOUGH. He decides that it would be AMAZING if instead of a solid landmass it was, like, a ring of land with water in the middle. Not even a sea, either. This shit would be like AN OCEAN WITHIN AN OCEAN. So He knocks the center out of the continent, drowning the now even-more-confused mandrills. The resulting earthquake triggers tsunamis that capsize hundreds of shipping vessels trying to make their way around this mess of a continent.\n\nStage Four: God runs out of coke. The comedown hits hard, and He retreats to His room. As He neglected to build His new creation on anything resembling a solid foundation, the new continent sinks rapidly below the waves.

If I don't have a gun, my only realistic option (say) is to hide under the bed and hope the fucker goes away with my TV. OTOH, if I have a shotgun, I have many options, including hiding under the bed until he enters the bedroom, then shooting him, or the riskier options of lying in wait at the top of the stairs and shooting him if he tries to come upstairs, or going downstairs and looking for him, etc. It's clear that I have way more options if I'm armed.\n\nIf this happens to 1,000 unarmed people and 1,000 armed people, and even one of the armed people chooses any option other than the most conservative one, then your statement becomes statistically true, albeit by a very tiny margin. In short, I'm not sure that the assertion is really very meaningful even if it is true.\n\nOn the other hand, it's possible that people who carry (as in your example) might try harder to maintain situational awareness and take extra precautions, like not going down the dark alley or giving the drunk a wide berth, so that your statement would be false. No sane CC holder wants to end up having to explain themselves to the police, the prosecutor, the judge, and a jury, even if their use of lethal force is completely justified by any objective standard. An over-zealous prosecutor can turn a legitimate defensive shooting into a horrible expensive mess that can ruin your life. These points (conflict avoidance and legal aftermath) are major topics of every CC training course.\n\nYou don't have to go very far to find [evidence suggesting](http://crimepreventionresearchcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Concealed-Carry-Permit-Holders-Across-the-United-States.pdf) that concealed carry permit holders are, on average, highly law-abiding to the point of being statistically much less likely to commit a crime than police officers. Even when trying to paint CC permit holders in a very negative light, you can't help but be struck by the fact that the number of people killed by CC permit holders \u2014 [679 over 7 years](http://www.vpc.org/ccwkillers.htm) \u2014 is a minute fraction of the total (roughly 100,000 in the same time period). Put another way, if the homicide rate of CC permit holders (679 in 7 years by ~8,000,000 permit holders) were extended to the general population, then we would expect fewer than 4,000 homicides per year rather than the ~15,000 we have, so it appears that CC permit holders are roughly one fourth as likely to kill someone as non-permit holders.\n\nI'm not sure how much this illuminates the discussion, but I do think it underscores how problematic \u201ccommon sense\u201d assertions, such as the one you threw out for discussion, really are: they can be interpreted and explained to suit either pro- or anti- gun agendas in the absence of the empirical evidence we need to decide their truth or falsehood, and they're of dubious probative value even when we know.", "score": 1},{"body": "When I was in the second grade I had a hydro seal, essentially it's where my right testicle was quite larger then my left.

You should have a hollow circle bent inward. Bend the out frame/circle more inward to a 1 ft radius circle.\n\n7. Attach it to the bottom of the silo. The outer frame should fit well with the bottom and use good rigging.\n\n8. Make done aerodynamic rocket wings for better flying. Attach evenly at bottom and 2 across from each other near the middle of the silo.\n\n9. Prepare for launch. Set launch pad and turn on air-blower-high pressure machine. The kazoos will produce their sound but at a high intensity that the molecules bouncing with other molecules will cause supersonic vibrations that will create a continuos shockwave, giving lift to the silo\n\n10.

Attorneys would be called, Kirby Delauter said.\n\nIn fact, we spent quite some time laughing about it. Kirby Delauter, an elected official; Kirby Delauter, a public figure? Surely, Kirby Delauter can't be serious? Kirby Delauter\u2019s making a joke, right?\n\nRound about then, we wondered, if it\u2019s not a joke, how should we now refer to Kirby Delauter if we can't use his name (Kirby Delauter)? Could we get away with an entire editorial of nothing but \u201cKirby Delauter\u201d repeated over and over again -- Kirby Delauter, Kirby Delauter, Kirby Delauter? OK, imagine we agreed because of temporary madness or something funny in the water that week, how would we reference \"Kirby Delauter\" and do our job as journalists without running afoul of our lack of authorization?\n\nBlanks? Sure, we sometimes use hyphens in the case of expletives. Perhaps we could do that: \"K---- D-------.\" Or, perhaps, \"Councilman [Unauthorized].\" We giggled a bit more than we should have when we came up with \"the Councilman Formerly Known as Commissioner Kirby Delauter,\" which doesn't seem as funny written down in black and white and includes his name, which defeats the point. Maybe we should just put his initials, \"KD,\" with an asterisk to a footnote (KD*), or refer to him as GLAT, the acronym for his campaign: \"Govern Like A Taxpayer.\" We could even make it sound a little hip-hop with a well-placed hyphen: G-Lat. Speaking of, could we get away with \"K-Del\"? Or we could simply go with the Harry Potter-esque \"He Who Shall Not be Named.\" (Cue the lightning strike and peal of thunder.)\n\nYet we could take the low road down even further and childishly mangle \"Kirby Delauter\" into references you, the reader, would still understand. \"Sherbert Deluder,\" say. Or \"Derby Kelauter.\" \"Shirley Delaughter\" (and don't call me Shirley). We found a great automatic online anagrammer that generated all kinds of alternatives and could make it a challenge for our readers to decode each time we have to reference the councilman: \"Rebuked artily.\" That was a good one. \"Bakery diluter\" is just silly but does have a ring about it. \"Keyed rural bit\" was another that caught our eye as somewhat telling, because Kirby Delauter's pretty keyed up. We're sure there's a joke in \"Brutelike Yard\" somewhere.\n\nDiscernibly, though, Kirby Delauter's ignorance of what journalism is and does is no joke, and illustrates one disturbing aspect too prevalent in conservatives\u2019 beliefs: That the media are all-liberal stooges hell bent on pursuing some fictional leftwing agenda. Generally this \"fact\" is bleated when the facts on the ground differ from conservative talking points. Take Councilman Billy Shreve's abstract, almost nonsensical defense of KD*: \"I think media outlets are cowards and they hide behind the label of journalists and that's a bully pulpit to expand their liberal\u201d agenda. Cowards? Tell that to the families of the 60 journalists killed in 2014, or the 70 in 2013, or the 74 who died in 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. All in pursuit of the truth, or the most reliable version of it at hand in the most dangerous regions of the world.\n\nEdifying as it may be to lapse into name calling -- and yes, we allowed ourselves a little childishness above and maybe a little bit below -- we need to make one serious point the councilman needs to hear and understand: We will not bow to petty intimidation tactics because a local politician thinks he can score political points with his base throwing around empty threats.\n\nLegally, Kirby Delauter has no case.\n\nAnd why? Here's how Washington Post blogger Eugene Volokh, who \"teaches free speech law, religious freedom law, church-state relations law, a First Amendment Amicus Brief Clinic, and tort law, at UCLA School of Law,\" nicely sums it up:\n\n\u201cUh, Council Member: In our country, newspapers are actually allowed to write about elected officials (and others) without their permission.

I'm nervous, excited, happy, sad...so many feelings as my parents walked with me to the counter. All the booths are completely empty except one. The line was all the way out the door. Fuck...it was my line. All flights to Chicago cancelled due to the weather.\n\nIt's not that I didn't appreciate them looking out for our safety, but whenever you have such a big plan and spent such a large sum of money, you just kind of wish things go right...and then it doesn't. I was upset not at the airline (and especially not at the lady working at the counter), but I was just mad that things couldn't go right. \n\nI was patient with the lady working furiously to get me to Seoul. I made a few jokes and she made a few back. I think she was just happy not to have someone yelling at her face for once.
