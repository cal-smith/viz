If you got a live feed of the raw electrical data from the eye and put on a monitor the images would be barely discernible (a very small hole in the center would have decent acuity). \n\nOur brain is what gives us most of our acuity. The refresh rate or fps on your eye are near infinite (i.e. continuous electrical signal from the light, though we only perceive a refresh rate of about 1000fps), that allows the brain to do some pretty incredible and accurate hypothesizing about what we are actually seeing, and gives us the incredible acuity that we perceive.

The body is a amazingly capable of adapting to the various stresses placed upon it. In the case you mentioned, someone who is fit should have a lower heart rate than the unfit person. This will occur for a few reasons, but they all come down to efficiency. (1) the heart muscle of a trained person becomes better at utilizing oxygen for energy than an untrained person. Also, depending on the type of training, a trained person's heart actually grows larger as well. This means that the volume of fluid ejected with each pump, something known as stroke volume, will increase. Thus a trained heart will utilize less energy for the same task. Also, studies have shown that changes in heart cell surface receptors will also make trained hearts more sensitive to adrenaline and noradrenaline. (2) the type of muscle fiber determines how energy is used. With enough training, some studies have shown individuals to have an increase in total mitochondrial mass. Mitochondria are essential for energy production during aerobic exercise. Therefore, a trained person will have more mitochondria, which also means they can utilize oxygen more efficiently (this is also part of the reason why people with more muscle mass have higher resting metabolic rates). \n\nSo, all that being said, someone who is in better shape will probably burn more calories just because they can perform the task longer, or with more intensity.

This hypothetical organism has no mechanism for sensing the presence or absence of light in its surroundings. But light *does* still have impacts on this organism, UV will denature cells, infrared radiation will create heat, etc. All of these impacts of light impact the organism whether or not it can sense that light *visually*. In time, the organism can develop responses to light without needing anything like an eye. \n\nFor example: It can make little plates on its membrane that prevent light from penetrating, thus allowing it to move closer to the surface of the water without being damaged by UV. In order for these plates to have maximum biological effect it could establish a set of protein structures that tell flagella to move the cell in directions which correspond to light being blocked. In this way it can move upwards towards higher-light zones while still having those plates facing the sun. All of these developments can be produced based on tissue damage which develops from UV exposure, no visual interpretation required. And it also requires no choice or volition - the individuals which develop innate responses to move them closer to the surface of the aquatic environment will naturally encounter more photosynthetic organisms (the responses are moving it towards higher-light zones where autotrophic organisms will have higher populations), and will thus have more calories and proliferate more quickly (natural selection).\n\nIn this way, there is no multi-cellular organism exposed regularly to light which has not already, in its historic lineage, developed the precursor structures which correspond to a light-response mechanism. The eye therefor must have first developed in an organism which did not have an eye, but it could not develop on an organism which did not already have the precursor mechanisms for an eye, and these developed based on non-visual pressures.

If we can somehow harness this superposition, we can have an effectively superparallel computer.\n\nImagine, if you will, that we have a digital computer instead of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat and instead of one random event that kills the computer, we have a 1024 random events, each of which sets an input bit.

Of course, this particular approach isn't that useful because when you open the box, you just have a 2^-1024 chance of getting the outcome of any particular input.  Even so, with some cleverness, it's believed that this superposition of states can be exploited for useful calculation.\n\n\nActual implementation of quantum computing is an active area of research.  There are 'quantum computing groups' at various large institutions all working on it.  If you look at the wikipedia entry for qubit  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit#Physical_representation) you can see that there's a variety of physical representations.

That is, what's the shortest time when it can perceive and set distinct information for the brain for the processing?\n\nThere's definitely some kind of fuzzing in this though, since the eyes get analogue of \"exposure time\" - you can notice motion blur, especially when it's dark, if you for example wave your hand in front of you and of course there are many electronic devices which utilize this, especially displays, which are often flashing at very high rate  due to the way they're updated (time multiplexing), but the eye sees the image as constant.", "score": 1},{"body": "The power of the antenna isn't just in its capacity to send out strong signals, but also in its sensitivity.

It's the same basic reason that, e.g. electrons around a nucleus fall into one of a discrete set of possible states. So contrary to classical intuition, quantum fields have a discontinuous difference between the ground state (which also has some minimum amount of vibration actuallly) and the excited state, the first quantum excitation of the field, which corresponds to the presence of a particle. As a result, for any point in space, you can ask \"is there an electron here?\" and the answer you get is either yes or no. In this sense particles *are* precisely localized.\n\nThere is also a sense though in which the particles are not precisely localized, again because of quantum mechanics. Everything is defined only in terms of a probability distribution. So even if you measure the particles position, making that probability distribution sharply localized, it will afterward immediately become fuzzed out again, as the wavefunction evolves into a superposition of different position states.\n\nThat can be described in standard QM, but there is also another way in which the 'point-like' nature of particles breaks down specifically in quantum field theory. Namely, as you probe the particle with higher and higher energies, some otherwise highly-quantum, highly-irrelevant processes involving creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs will become relevant, and you will directly see the evidence of a \"virtual cloud\" of such particles around the electron or whatever particle. So that is a real sense in which the physical particle is not actually point-like, even beyond the fact that its overall position may have a quantum mechanical uncertainty. \n\nAll that said, I think your question basically comes from imagining a classical field only, whereas quantum field theory says that you need a wavefunction assigning complex amplitudes to *all possible configurations of that classical field.* What I described above is the detailed answer, but I think the basic reason your intuition objected is that a single classical field is inadequate to match what I've described, which is certainly correct.", "score": 1},{"body": "A cochlear implant might be what you are looking for.

The way the transmission of neuronal signals within a nerve works is not via electron transmissions like in most used electrical conductors. Neither is a photon based conductor like glass fiber applicable. A nerve depends on so called action potentials. the prerequisite is a phenomenon called a membrane potential. A membrane potential is a very specific distribution of ions (electrically charges particles) along the cell membrane of a nerve. The main involved ions here are sodium ions (positively charged) and potassium ions (positively charged) as well as chloride ions (negatively charged) and organic anions (negatively charged). These ions have a specific distribution along the membrane depending if you look inside the cell or outside the cell, a balance which is upheld by a) permanently opened potassium channels and b) a pump that exchanges sodium and potassium ions for energy, the so called Na-K-ATPase. Two forces counteract each other: the accumulation of same electrical charges within one side (similar to a magnet, similar charges repel each other) and the concentrations of same particles on one side (you need more energy the more you want to concentrate a particle on one side of a membran as opposed to the other). Both of these aspects combine to form the so called electrochemical potential. The bottom line is that during the resting membrane potential, the inside of the cell is electrically negatively charged and filled with potassium ions (but the organic anions which can't escape the cell far outweigh the sum of the charge of the potassium ions, hence the negative charge), while the outside of the membrane is positively charged and filled with sodium ions (the only relevant counter charge here is chloride ions, but sodium outweighs). \n\nDuring action potential, voltage gated sodium channels (meaning channels that open when exposed to certain charges) open when exposed to a voltage higher than the opening threshold and let sodium ions cross the membrane because of the electrical and chemical gradient. the influx of positive charges inside the cell causes the voltage of the cell to go into the positives, a process called depolarisation. Neighboring voltage gated sodium channels are then activated from this increase in voltage/potential and the signal gets transmitted along the membrane in one direction. An action potential is then ended by closing of the sodium channels due to positive voltage and the Na-K-ATPase pumps out all sodium ions that are still within the cell, causing the voltage to into the negatives (repolarisation). If you were to [plot the graph of the action potential](http://www.uic.edu/classes/bios/bios100/lectures/action_potential.jpg) (voltage over time), you would see a base line starting at -70 mV, then forming a spike with the peak at 30 mV which then goes down to -70 mV again (and even overshoots a little into -80 mV, called hyperpolarisation). During the entirety of the action potential, another one can not be caused at the same time in the same place (refractory period), which makes sure the information only ever travels in one direction and not in the direction the information came from. (And guess what! there are even more mechanisms to increase the speed of transmission, but I'm not sure if my description is concise enough that I should risk complicating my post, so just ask if you're interested)\n\nNow the thing with action potentials is that their amplitude has no effect on the information they carry; an action potential either is or isn't. In computational terms, an action potential would represent a bit, and the lack of action potential would be similar to a 0 bit. Information is therefore encoded in the patterns and the frequency of action potentials reaching whatever terminal structure is calculating them into a full information (the upper limit of frequency is the length of the refractory period of an action potential because no new action potential can be caused within the refractory period). The information transmitted in nerve fibers is digital, if you will. (note that this doesn't apply to every single type of nerve fibers! some nervous networks like the retina work depending on the amplitude of voltage and are therefore analogue. Sensor potentials and synaptic potentials are amplitude modulated as well. This is really just taking about transmission within a singular fiber!)\n\nYou don't need to fully understand the process, but you should realize what goes into neuronal transmission is a rather complex amalgam of biochemical and biophysical systems concipated unlike any other technical conductor we artificially use.

This number system has the special structure of a [Vector Space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) over the collection of rational numbers. An example of a vector space is the 2D plane. As you may be aware, we can express every point in the plane as a pair of real numbers (x,y), telling us how far left/right we are (by x) and how far up/down we are (by y). We can kinda do the same thing with our number system of square roots. Every number in this enlarged number system can be uniquely represented by a pair of rational numbers (x,y). \n\nThe way we do this is as follows: Say I'm working with sqrt(d) and I want to find (1+sqrt(d))(sqrt(d)). This is some number in my new number system, so I should be able to represent it by some pair of rational numbers. So if we just multiply this out we get sqrt(d)+d. I then say that (d,1) represent this number. Here d represents the \"rational\" part (left/right) of my number and 1 represents the \"square root\" (up/down) part of my number. So (x,y) means the same thing as x+ysqrt(d).\n\nLet's see what this means when I try to *divide* in my new number system. I want to divide 2+3sqrt(2) by 1+2sqrt(2). Whatever this is, it is a number in my new number system, so all I need to do is find the two rational numbers that represent it. By definition 2+3sqrt(2) divided by 1+2sqrt(2) is the same thing as (2+3sqrt(2))/(1+2sqrt(2)). The only thing that's really stopping me from writing is as x+ysqrt(2) is the pesky guy on the bottom. I'll then use the rationalizing the denominator trick to get rid of the root in the bottom and get (10/7)+(1/7)sqrt(2). This says that the coordinate representation of this number is (10/7,1/7).\n\nSo \"rationalizing the denominator\" is the same thing as doing the actual arithmetic to divide a number with radicals. \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nI can extend this to multiple radicals. If I allow myself to have sqrt(2) and sqrt(3), then I'll get a 4-dimensional space, where (x,y,z,w) corresponds to x+ysqrt(2)+zsqrt(3)+wsqrt(6).

I'll answer a couple of these.\n\nFirst off, you use the word \"frequency\" when you should be using the term \"radio\". Radio is electromagnetic signals that travel through the atmosphere or even free space. Frequency is a property of radio waves. You can think of it like watching waves crash into the beach, how often this happens is called it's frequency. The same concept applies to radio waves.\n\nSecond, AM and FM are simply bands identified in the radio spectrum. They are arbitrarily defined and aren't inherent properties of radio. Not all radio waves are in the AM or FM bands. in fact there are LOTS of bands of radio waves outlined by the FCC. The FCC is the government body responsible for defining who can use what bands of radio.\n\nThere is, in fact, many different bands of radio waves that consumers can use. [Here is the chart if you'd like to look at it](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/United_States_Frequency_Allocations_Chart_2003_-_The_Radio_Spectrum.jpg)!

Remotes use a system called \"[Rolling Codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code)\". Basically there is an algorithm that both the remote, and the car's computer both share. After a certain period both the remote and the computer change the code they are transmitting and listening for respectively.

We experience something as hot, when it gives off more radiation than we do. And we experience something as cold when it gives off less radiation than we do. So actually cold things aren't a source of coldness, but instead we are a source of heat. Simply said, heat is just a temperature gradient between two things and of course, if there's something that has a high temperature, then something with a lower temperature will absorb some of the energy and warm up until the reach equilibrium with the heat source.

Dirac was trying to figure out a way to describe *relativistic* particles in quantum mechanics. Up until then the equations were only known for *non-relativistic* particles. After some clever manipulations, Dirac came up with an equation that we now know as the [Dirac equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation).\n\nThe point is that one then wants to solve that equation, and the solutions represent the different states of the theory. Some of those states corresponded to the system having just the right kind of energy and momentum to describe relativistic particles - so we identity these states as *particles*. But that was only half of the solutions. The other half of the solutions had the same momentum, but *negative* the energy. This is really weird in quantum mechanics, where you want there to be a \"ground state\", or state of lowest energy. In Dirac's theory, however, it seemed like the energy of the system could be arbitrarily big and negative, which means there is no lowest energy state. This is a disaster, because once you allow the electrons to interact with the electromagnetic field, for example, the possibility arises that electrons can radiate away energy indefinitely, thus lowering their energy, and keep doing this forever without end.\n\nSo how did Dirac solve this problem? It's brilliant actually. He invoked the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that no two fermions (the kind of particles which the Dirac equation describes) can occupy the same state at the same time. Dirac then postulated that all of these negative energy states are actually *already occupied* by a [giant sea of electrons that permeates all space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_sea). Then a positive energy electron couldn't lower it's energy, because in doing so it would have to occupy one of the negative energy states, and these states are already occupied - there's no more room for new electrons with negative energy!\n\nBut wouldn't we notice a gigantic sea of electrons all around us? The reason we would never detect these electrons is essentially because with negative charge *everywhere*, it's the same as negative charge being *nowhere*. Maybe that's not convincing, but mathematically it actually checks out (using Maxwell's equations, which were well established by then).\n\nHowever if one of the negative energy electrons managed to be excited into a positive energy, then there would be a \"hole\" in the sea of electrons. This hole would appear to have positive charge, and the same mass as the electron. So we would detect this hole as a new particle with charge opposite the electron and the same mass. This is the positron, and it was eventually discovered. This was a major triumph for Dirac, and the discovery of \"anti-particles\".\n\nThat is essentially the folk history version of it. Today we understand anti-particles somewhat differently, but the essential story is the above. Today we don't think of the world in terms of the Dirac sea. Rather we just say that these \"negative energy electrons\" are, in fact, positive energy states of a different particle - the anti-particle, i.e. the positron.", "score": 1},{"body": "Something else that has been around for a long time is uranium.

We currently explain the strong force using a Yang-Mills theory, and have a ton of good evidence (numerical and analytical) that Yang-Mills correctly describes the mass gap. However, there is no rigorous mathematical proof - such a proof would put our theories on better grounding. Also, it is probably the most realistic quantum field theory which has a chance of existing to arbitrarily high energies.\n\nThe problem is so important because we model the strong nuclear force by a Yang-Mills theory, which we call quantum chromodynamics (QCD). \n\nTo specify a Yang-Mills theory, one must specify a [simple compact Lie group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_group#Compact_Lie_groups), and one can also have the degrees of freedom (called \"gauge fields\") interact with other particles. QCD has an SU(3) gauge group which interacts with the quarks. The millennium problem is to prove a \"mass gap\" which holds for *any* gauge group, but you don't need to consider anything besides the gauge fields (in fact, if you couple to enough fermions, it is predicted that there *isn't* a mass gap).\n\nNow, the \"mass gap.\" The classical gauge fields in classical YM theory are massless - they create particles which travel at the speed of light. In contrast, evidence has shown that the quantum YM theory displays [confinement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement), where you can only have massive bound states of gauge fields, which have mass through their binding energy and E=mc^(2). This is especially important in our own universe, where the interaction of the gauge fields (called gluons in QCD) and quarks prevent any free gluons/quarks from ever being seen on their own in our universe.

This phenomenon can be best explained by Force Summation. Force Summation describes the addition of individual twitch contractions to increase the intensity of overall muscle contraction. This can be achieved in two ways:[10] by increasing the number and size of contractile units simultaneously, called multiple fiber summation, and by increasing the frequency at which action potentials are sent to muscle fibers, called frequency summation.\n\n&gt; Multiple fiber summation \u2013 When a weak signal is sent by the CNS to contract a muscle, the smaller motor units, being more excitable than the larger ones, are stimulated first. As the strength of the signal increases, more motor units are excited in addition to larger ones, with the largest motor units having as much as 50 times the contractile strength as the smaller ones. As more and larger motor units are activated, the force of muscle contraction becomes progressively stronger. A concept known as the size principle, allows for a gradation of muscle force during weak contraction to occur in small steps, which then become progressively larger when greater amounts of force are required.\n\n&gt; Frequency summation \u2013 For skeletal muscles, the force exerted by the muscle is controlled by varying the frequency at which action potentials are sent to muscle fibers. Action potentials do not arrive at muscles synchronously, and, during a contraction, some fraction of the fibers in the muscle will be firing at any given time. In a typical circumstance, when a human is exerting a muscle as hard as he/she is consciously able, roughly one-third of the fibers in that muscle will be firing at once, though this ratio can be affected by various physiological and psychological factors (including Golgi tendon organs and Renshaw cells). This 'low' level of contraction is a protective mechanism to prevent avulsion of the tendon\u2014the force generated by a 95% contraction of all fibers is sufficient to damage the body.\n\nSo when you get all that adrenaline, combined with a powerful intent, it might be that the signal sent by the central nervous system is so much stronger than any signal you'd be able to muster under normal circumstances, that this gives you a \"strength you never knew you had.\"", "score": 1},{"body": "Yeah right.

Firstly there is no special receptor which cannabis and only cannabis acts on. Why would the receptor exist in the body if it served no natural purpose, and historically never did? Cannabis acts on the same receptors as a group of neuromodulators called endocannabinoids. The receptors are CB1 and CB2, and are activated by endogenous (made within the body) compounds including anadamide, and 2-arachadonyl glycerate. CB2 receptors have more to do with inflammation and immune function, but are also present in the brain. CB1 receptors are generally more likely to be found in specific regions of the CNS, such as the limbic cortex, hippocampus. amygdala, cerebellum, and several regions of the striatum. \n\nYou are correct in that receptor activation blocks calcium influx. The only way in which you would consider them competitive to endocannabinoids is that they work on the same receptor, but the receptor is what controls the downstream events, not the ligand which activates it. In this sense, cannabis is an agonist. \n\nI'm not sure that there are any direct effects on K+ channels; blocking calcium channels may alter the membrane potential, but really the inhibitory effects are due to decreased release of neurotransmitters in general, but especially glutamate, as it is a principle excitatory neurotransmitter. Post-synaptic neurons being overstimulated by glutamate synthesize an endocannabinoid which diffuses back to the presynaptic neuron to reduce the amount of glutamate being released.\n\nThe key component here is that calcium is required in order for neurotransmitter-filled vesicles to fuse with the pre-synaptic membrane, which releases neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. CB1 receptor activation closes calcium channels = less calcium available for this process. \n\nYou asked about muscle paralysis. That isn't really what's going on here. The reason people who smoke feel slow is because of the action of cannabis in some of the brain regions I mentioned, especially the cerebellum and regions of the striatum. \n\nYou asked about lipid solubility and detection in urine over extended periods. As you mentioned, THC is lipophillic, and fairly hydrophobic. This means that it cannot exist in high concentrations dissolved in water, or it would precipitate out as a solid. It CAN exist in much higher concentrations in lipids, which is where it hangs out. When you smoke, the drug quantity gets distributed amongst the various parts of your body, but not necessarily in equal quantities. Imagine an empty glass of water, and an empty swimming pool. Say it rains for 10 minutes. Obviously, more water is going to end up in the swimming pool. Please ask if you want more detail on this concept.\n\nYou asked about drug testing. THC is metabolized in the liver to a large degree, often by hydroxylation reactions, and also by carboxylation. Both of these make THC more water-soluble, but it is still largely excreted in feces. The increased hydrophilicity as a result of hepatic metabolism allows the drug to be excreted in urine as well, although this is not the major route of elimination. As the drug is eliminated from the bloodstream (as described via metabolism and excretion), the concentration of drug in the blood falls. This creates a concentration gradient, which pulls more of the drug out of the fat where it has been hanging out, since it is more fat soluble than water soluble. \n\nI hope that wasn't too verbose and answered your questions.

The energy then relates to the motion of the atoms that constitute that matter. The lower the temperature, the lower the energy, the slower the atoms. \n\nMatter brought to very low temperatures are confined in a potential, meaning if they are trapped in some region by a force.  The spatial extent of the atoms in that potential relates to their temperature.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nTake for example the atmosphere on earth, which is about 10 km thick.  Ten kilometer is how far atoms at the temperature distribution of our atmosphere can move against the confining gravitational force.  If the temperature of the air were ten times smaller the atmosphere would be only 1 km thick.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThis same principal is used to measure the temperature of ultra-cold systems in magnetic traps. The size of the chilled atomic cloud is determined by illuminating the cloud with laser light, which is strongly absorbed by the atoms, and they cast a shadow.  With the help of several lenses, the shadow is imaged onto an electronic sensor similar to those in digital cameras.  Since the magnetic fields are precisely known, the size of the cloud is an absolute measure for the atoms' energy and temperature. This of course encounters a quantum problem since measuring the temperature increases the temperature.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAnother technique to determine ultra-cold temperature is to measure the kinetic energy of the atoms.  For that, the magnetic trap is suddenly switched off by switching off the current through the magnet coils.  In the absence of magnetic forces, the atoms simply fly away, and the cloud expands ballistically. The cloud size increases with time, and this increase is a direct observation of the velocity of the atoms and therefore their temperature. This approach has the benefit of inferring what the temperature was before you interacted with the matter.\n\nYou can read more and see pictures of atomic cloud shadows of Bose-Einstein Condensates that were used to measure their temperature [here](http://cua.mit.edu/ketterle_group/Popular_papers/Ultralow_temperatures.htm).

If an object is orbitting inside the event horizon of a black hole, it experiences such a massive inward pull that, in order to not get sucked in, it would need to orbit faster than the speed of light.\n\nSince this is impossible, all objects simply get sucked into the black hole once they pass the event horizon.\n\nI'm not a scientist nor do I try to pose as one.

The answer are interconnects. The die stack is built up with a series trenches and via layers that are filled with particular conductive metals that allow information from the transistors to be accessed.\n\nBecause there are so many transistors, you need a lot of repeating stack layers.... think more than 7-8 for something modern.

Could you tell me if this analogy is accurate.  Imagine a clear, plastic piece of graph paper that was designed to somehow expand when heated.  Then imagine sprinkling some material on this paper. The places where the material rests don't expand under heat because the stickiness of the material prevents it.  Is that right?  \n\nI never knew that.  It is super cool.  \n\nSo, if you created a numerical matrix that held a representation of the effect of expansion in geometric coordinates then you would see positive numbers where dark energy is the dominant force and negative numbers where matter gathers.  And space expands only in the areas where it is positive. There is a mathematical separation between our solar systems and the no man's land between them", "score": 1},{"body": "Speak for yourself.
