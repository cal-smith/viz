Basically, that limit will be unfeasible for near term machines at any price rate. Buuuut as to differences that humans could actually detect in a double blind study? It is going to be pretty close to 100fps depending on content it could be much less.

Our eyes can react to single photons. And each receptor can fire hundreds of times per second. And we have about 100million receptors all going off out of sync. So the framerate at which the eye can no longer detect change will be near 50~100BN fps. Which is obviously pointless. Sorry for the confusion, I meant the net forces due to static pressure equal 0. I hope this is correct, it's been a while... but correct me if I'm wrong :) well those countries also tend to have lighter skin... I could overlap the blue and yellow but it looked like more of a gradient to me. Pretty cool stuff  I have no problem focusing or even looking at these images. Eek terminator camera vision. "Blindsight" is also the name of an excellent "hard" sci-fi novel by Peter Watts, and he describes this very thing. I've read that the human eye can see upto 220 "FPS". The way it was measured, is that they placed a ISAF-jetpilot inside a completely dark room. They then had a "short glint" of an aircraft. The subject was supposed to push a button every time he was able to notice the glint, and identify the object. The subjects were able to notice it upto 1/220^th of a second.

So the exchange of blood really doesn't relate to the disease  since the issue is precedent that,  one very important thing also is that there's no microorganism present to determine the term infectious to the disease :) Ahhh. I can definitely see the difference between one and two eyes. Thanks for the eye opener.
Edit: I admit that was a terrible pun. Can you tell me what they are talking about in this then ? at 1:28

https://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-cl=85027636&amp;x-yt-ts=1422503916&amp;v=dxKgBkdOKr4 There's actually some really interesting information out there regarding how certain animals can see in "slow motion" due to the fact that they have a higher "FPS".

This "FPS" is due to the amount of time the neurons have between firing when they sense something and the time your brain perceives it. The smaller you are, the less time it takes to process information between your eye and your brain. 

Think of it like trying to tell someone a play-by-play of the super-bowl who is in a different room than the TV. It requires you to be running back and forth. The shorter the distance you have to run back and forth, the more information you're gonna be able to tell this person because you get to run back to the TV more often.

Make sense? That's about a third of the estimated power output of the human race.

I'm not sure if I'm impressed with us or horrified. When I look at the image upside down it is just as uncomfortable to look at though. UHD and 4K monitors are no better than 1080p for this reason as well, at least at the maximum recommended field of view as specified by THX view angle 30 degrees x 60 arc seconds is 1800 units wide. 1080p is 1920 widex1080 high.

Additionally the human eye can see as few a 9 photons as long as they arrive withing a 100ms time period. 

Also they can see 11 stops of light, high end cameras can see 9 stops of light. This means the human eye can see detail in areas twice as dark and twice as light at the same time compared to a camera (seeing in shadows and bright daylight at the same time) The human eye has ISO speeds as high as 3200 as well. Potentially. I've observed the same effect, but only while riding in a car myself, looking at the wheels of other cars. Never happens while I'm looking at a passing car. 

Also, I don't see why the vibrations from a car would be substantively different than those of an airplane, so it makes sense that the effect would hold true. Is that Norwegian?! I am a native English speaker/reader, and I feel like I can almost read parts of that.  Since "how many FPS does the eye see" is an impossible question since the eye doesn't see in frames, I'll answer what you're most likely asking: how high can your FPS go before you can't tell the difference anymore? For playability, I can "feel" the increased smoothness at least up to 144hz, likely higher. At a minimum, I think 30fps is a pretty well-established standard, anything below that gets annoyingly choppy especially with games. If you wanted to be able to see things fly by while you're twitch 180-noscoping in a fraction of a second, you'd need thousands of FPS. I actually think we are developing a consensus, with us just on opposite ends of the spectrum. My order of likelihood would be...

-3- This is bending a minor rule. The NFL is responsible for deciding what rules matter to enforce, so agreed, no fine. But it would suggest Brady in being less than forthright in his press conference.

-5a- Facts come out as different than previously reported and the temperature does account.

-2- The equipment manager takes advantage of the buffing process and inspection to just give a little more edge to Brady's preference. This also doesn't deserve a fine. Also, I think it quite likely Brady would be aware of this, contrary to his press conference.

-4- Quite possible, I just think the equipment managers understand football psi and processing better than this given how often they handle the balls and for different quarterbacks with different preferences for different weather.

-1- They broke the rules rather then bending them. It had little consequence on the game. And considering the fine is incredibly small, 25k, the NFL doesn't care either. But given the attention they will need to decide if they want to actually care about this kind of play and up the rules or fine.

-5b- This can be 100% explained by theoretical or experimental science of people with limited information of the actual circumstances.

Now is the time when we can agree to disagree. May your beer be ice cold and your guacamole adequately seasoned with lime. Have a great Superbowl! That's a weird way of putting it, although mathematically correct now that I think about it.

The center of mass is essentially the average location of the mass. The moment  of inertia is essentially a measure of how an object's mass is distributed around the center. Likewise, the mean is the average location of the data, and the variance is a measure of how the data is distributed about the mean.

Mathematically, both are described as the integral over some range of a distribution (be it a mass distribution or a probability distribution) multiplied by the square of the independent variable.

Consider some density distribution d(r), and some probability distribution p(x).

Zeroth moment:

Integral of density over all positions=Mass ; Integral of probability over range=1.

First moment:

Integral of density times position over all positions=Center of mass; Integral of probability times range over range=mean.

Second moment:

Integral of density times position squared over all positions=Moment of inertia; Integral of probability times range squared over all range = variance. Removing the sand element is feasible by heating to a liquid state but the chemical process releases a substantial amount of Co2 albeit over a much longer period of time than the visible setting process takes. The sooner you began attempting the process the closer to the 'original' form of cement you would obtain, however by heating and grinding you are again introducing more changes in composition, so it really isn't feasible to obtain the cement you started with. I'd say more like 50 years.

In my life time DNA sequencing went from 3 billion dollars and 15 years to a few days and a few thousand dollars (I know the two aren't directly comparable but ballpark).

Computers went from 1Mhz to 3Ghz (and the speed up was considerbly more than that would indicate since modern machines do a *lot* per clock cycle, have 6 times or more the L1 cache of the first machine I had total memory and multiple cores).

Domestic internet speed went from 800bps to my home connection at 150 million bits per second.

My first PC didn't have a hard drive, my first hard drive was 10Mb, the machine I'm on now has 2000000.

The PC built after I was born cost $9000 adjusted for inflation, my current machine cost a 10th of that.

We've gotten very very good at accepting this pace of change but when you stop and really look it's actually pretty terrifying.

The 20th century belonged to the computer, the 21st is going to belong to biology. The most interesting one for me is people who can't recognise faces but can recognise objects, and people who can recognise faces but not objects. Anomic Aphasia. And for those who don't already know, not only is it a good read, it's also freely available online licensed under creative commons. http://rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm

I got a copy in paperback and the epub edition on my tablet. One of the more famous people to have face blindness is the artist [Chuck Close](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Close). 
Which is ironic since his art is mainly of faces. Maybe the two are correlated and it only *seems* correlated. well, i'm experiencing a resurgence of paranoia and am about to google everything in activity monitor.

 Well the way to test this would be to put different frames into different films, recognisable household objects, and have them running at different speeds until the majority can no longer detect the object in the film when asked after viewing. I suspect the number would be quite high, well over 60fps. But as stated in other comments, the eye doesn't see in FPS, it's constant, what I think you're really asking is what is the upper limit of change in fps that we can perceive. Adding to the parent comment:

This is why salting is important and why you shouldn't roll out your own solution (hashing function / key generation / etc). These algorithms have been studied thoroughly for years and, while there are vulnerabilities, we know about them and how to avoid them.

Some of these vulnerabilities will blow your mind, just spend a few months in /r/netsec and read a few hundred submissions. That's how I realized I know enough about encryption to be dangerous, like many, many, *many* other people: I got the basics and I assumed I knew how it worked and I started making "reasonable" assumptions and drawing "reasonable" conclusions. What I didn't know was that some people were devoting their life to making better algorithms and finding flaws in existing ones, and there are a lot of flaws which happen in some very obscure circumstances, but those circumstances are more common than you'd imagine.

What's even more surprising is that these vulnerabilities aren't just theoretical, there is public PoC code which proves their existence beyond doubt. Here are a few examples:

This is what kernel programmers have to deal with: http://networkfilter.blogspot.com/2014/12/security-openbsd-vs-freebsd.html

So, to finally reply to /u/Krutonium's comment: any bit of information you leak lowers the entropy (and thus the effort needed by an attacker) almost every time, some times by a little, some times by a lot. My advice is to *always* assume the worst case scenario, because it happens more often than you think, unless you are absolutely sure you have all the details, you understand 100% of the math involved, and you know every single possible use-case for the algorithm. I'm too lazy but could someone [Moore's law](http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) this to estimate when this will happen? By practicing can we get faster/better at this? Is it just our physical abilities that improve or can we actually make our neurons react quicker to some degree? The rods and cones of your eye don't have an FPS as such, but ocular microtremors do. See a human eye vibrates a tiny bit with about 85 Hz frequency, probably to do a sort of supersampling of the visual field for increased apparent resolution. 

Great article on the subject: http://accidentalscientist.com/2014/12/why-movies-look-weird-at-48fps-and-games-are-better-at-60fps-and-the-uncanny-valley.html So, in short - thanks to atmospheric drag - there is no speed at which a ball could be thrown to enter a sea-level orbit. (Presuming a sea level unobstructed path 'round the globe existed, of course.)  I can't imagine an alloy would do that much, you would still have free-beryllium. You might be able to bond it to something and retain some properties. @WRSaunders has a good answer, but I just wanted to add an analogous answer:

Actually the resolution on the human eye isn't what gives us most of our acuity. We perceive an incredible amount of acuity, when at about 20 inches our eyes are capable of giving us about 170dpi (pretty good, but not jaw-dropping, think 10 megapixel camera) at the fovea and is actually quite poor as you move to the periphery (worse than oldest camera phones). If you got a live feed of the raw electrical data from the eye and put on a monitor the images would be barely discernible (a very small hole in the center would have decent acuity). 

Our brain is what gives us most of our acuity. The refresh rate or fps on your eye are near infinite (i.e. continuous electrical signal from the light, though we only perceive a refresh rate of about 1000fps), that allows the brain to do some pretty incredible and accurate hypothesizing about what we are actually seeing, and gives us the incredible acuity that we perceive. Since the brain is doing a lot of complex cobbling together of the electrical data we don't actually perceive at about 1000fps though human beings can only detect changes at a max of about 200 fps.

Given all of this it is actually really difficult to say what resolution we see at.

My neuroscience prof always told us our visual resolution is roughly equivalent to 120 megapixels. At the center of our vision we have 160,000 cones (sensors if you will) per mm^2 However, move 20 degrees away from center and it drops to 8000.  It's not uniform. Our brains do a lot of remembering and guessing to paint what we think is a full-res picture. 

Edit:grammarz While *swimming* that sounds plausible to me, but I am not qualified to verify. If you were walking on the bottom of the ocean, it would make it harder. Nope not correct.  Time actually runs slower on the sun due to the higher gravity.  If you were to come back to earth the 2 watches that were syncronized before you left will now run at the same speed but your watch will be behind because it ran slower during the time on the sun.  

The effect I am referring to is called gravitational time dilation.  It's well understood and proven thanks to Einstein and is something that is adjusted for on GPS satellites.

If you watch the movie Interstellar it's actually woven into the plot. They consulted a physicist to make sure they got the science correct on the generalities.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kip_Thorne What's the closest object that we observe to be redshifted due to expansion? Well, you could say that they all arise from the low-energy limit of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which is described in terms of a spin-1 field with a certain type of gauge symmetry (U(1)), that implies conservation of charge. You can rewrite the rules of electromagnetism in such a way that Maxwell's equations reduce to one or two instead of four. You can also modify them for the potential existence of magnetic monopoles or massive photons.

The way you "get there" starts by rewriting Maxwell's equation in terms of scalar and vector potentials instead of electric and magnetic fields, and then writing that in a more compact relativistic formulation. [This](http://www.physics.indiana.edu/~dermisek/QFT_09/qft-I-11-4p.pdf) slideshow sort of takes you through it. So mega pixels dead center of non moving images. What would that be, about?

I believe it is a neutron reflector. You KNOW the hash don't you? Isn't that the whole point of this? The hash could be written on the outside of the machine but it would still take "forever" to brute force? If it makes you feel any better, the Tsar bomb made a plasma fireball nearly 6 miles in diameter, was bright enough to give you a 3rd degree burn(no pain) from nearly 38 miles away, and broke windows 300 miles away from where it was tested. Do animals have the same thing for other animals of the same species? Like, can a wolf look at other wolves in its pack and recognize them just by their face? Or do animals go mostly by smell? New Kanye album?  when he said it could have done anything, that includes hiding itself from the resource monitor.

The safe thing to do would be consider anything on the computer as radioactive, and reinstall a new OS and start fresh. Practically speaking, you're probably okay backing up data files to restore them later. Thai is my time to shine, I'm getting my PhD focusing on visual processing. You gave a great answer, but you don't see while saccades take place - you take in visual input when you make fixations. &gt; The eye also has a "blind spot" where the nerves go out that has no sensing cells.

We did a mini-demonstration in one of my courses... psychology I believe.  We drew a little black dot on a piece of paper, closed one eye, and then focused on a point about an inch from the dot.  Once you got the dot in the blind spot just outside of where you were focusing, it disappeared.  That was almost 15 years ago and it is the ONLY thing I remember from general psychology.

At a distance of 0.3 meters the human eye can resolve 5-6 line pairs per millimeter. Think of a series of lines: black/white/black/white/etc.

That would mean that at its most sensitive and accurate point, the human eye can see a single one of these black or white lines measuring ~0.1 mm in thickness. 

It doesn't really answer your question in terms of resolution in terms of megapixels or height/width but this is how sensitive your eye is to say...pixel density, or DPI, in an image.

I can't find the link now to their results, but I am sure it's either linked to in wikipedia or a fancier google search would provide it. &gt; The resolution isn't uniform, it's only that high in the center of view. 

That seems similar to a camera then. The highest resolution on most lenses is in the centre, and it drops off to the borders. There are useful resolution charts that depict just this drop-off gradient for interested purchasers. I don't know really anything about quantum mechanics (I'm a sophomore electrical engineering student). I can accept the first two for what they are, but is there any intuition behind Faraday's and Ampere's Laws without getting into QM (or if not in such a way that I can understand)?

http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/december/infants-process-faces-121112.html Reminds me of this commercial, for what I'm not really sure, but a segment of it has a voice over telling the person in the shot that their vision is going to be upgraded to 1080p. I'm pretty sure that's a huge downgrade.  It would make it harder swimming too. The amount of mass you'd have to displace to go the same speed would go up, so more energy used. I might be alone in this, but is this similar to when you first wake up and look at an object, and can't quite make out its shape? For example, when I was a kid, and I fell asleep and woke up in the car, I'd look at a stop sign and not be able to distinguish the eight sides. left in the toaster for three days, but popped out again perfectly browned To accurately create a piece, some artists will turn their reference photo upside down if one is being used, for this reason. Helps eyeball a more accurate shape, line and spacial proportioning (if thats the correct terminology) without the brain butting in with what it expects to see.

Edit:grammar Did those symptoms go away eventually? But in air, I'd use more energy to "swim" it than I would for water to go the same distance so it makes sense to me you would be more efficient in water, higher pressure. OP didn't specify walking so I assumed swimming.

I don't know but until someone answers that's qualified, that's my guess. I remember reading a study that that the Air force did in checking image retention at ultra fast speeds and found the ability present in many subjects to be able to retain information at exposure speeds in excess of 1/500 of a second.. So from this you could deduce that it is possible for a frame rate that high to actually benefit some.  Yes, actually. Photoreceptors are just specialized nerve cells and when under full activation, like most nerve cells, will send a signal about once every millisecond. However, like other people have already mentioned, the brain processes these signals differently than just a frame by frame display.
 Oh, I thought you meant the friction will keep adding heat because I was referring to the core eventually cooling down.  I remember reading in a photography book that the human eye is equivalent to 1/60s...maybe someone can back me up or explain further, but that is what has been stuck in my head for quite some time.

If that is the case, can I even back up safely through my USB? Well you can understand it all basically in terms of Coulomb's law and special relativity. Thank you for your submission!

But in 1000? 10000? There is lot of years in bilion years. We could start over a 1000 times. We might get it right once. The reason it has to bend isn't only because there is no theoretically strong enough material possible. It's also that the fastest that information can propogate is the speed of light. So if you started swinging at one end of the bat, and your bat was 1 light year long, the end of the bat couldn't feel you swinging for a year (in actuality the force would propogate much slower, at the speed of sound in the bat). This means that either your bat will bend because the handle starts moving before the tip, or it will break. Also someone has to use a winamp playlist to "hack the governments dolphins" And that's not the limit either because the eye supersamples by jiggling (ocular microtremors) i've only ever heard it called "face blindness" (whoda thunk?) but a quick google of that let me to this barely-pronounceable nonsense: [prosopagnosia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia). Our eyes move a little bit all the time, because our brain "fades out" data it already saw.

Because of this the "tunnel view" exists, as there are less sensing cells at the edge of our eyes, then in the centre, so that the minute movements our eyes make all the time might not be able to change what the cells outside precieve. The same goes for our blood vessels inside our eyes, while they're infront of our sensing cells, we don't see them, as their position doesn't change and they always cast the shadow on the same sensing cells, same goes for the "blind spot" you already mentioned.

Interesting video on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_W-IXqoxHA I believe it is prosopagnosia. I have a slight form of this.

If the ice was perfectly symmetrical, the gravitational force you would experience in the middle is zero, so you would speed up for the first half, then slow down for the second half. This article is an interesting take from a game developer. Game devs are very interested in the effects of FPS on viewers.

Edit: Pushing exactly on the rim would still give translational motion.  And then you would slide back the other way, go a little less far, back again.... this would be a fun ride. These are great examples and the whole thing is cured if I just get rid of one of the doubles. Face looks strange but at least it doesn't hurt anymore.  As other posters have pointed out, there is no spatial center of the universe. But there is a kinematic center. This is to say, there is actually a definition of "sitting still". You can see it in the dipole moment of the cosmic microwave background, as first seen in the 1970s. Not if you're attacking the system directly (e.g. sitting at a keyboard entering passwords, or more likely attempting remote logins with a script). If you have the hash itself, you can break it, no problem: modern hashing hardware is so fast even the best cryptographic hash won't prevent a dedicated breaking attempt. The point behind elaborate hashing systems is to slow down the cracking to give users time to change their passwords (a long password is still usually impractical to crack, though). See [this](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/03/how-i-became-a-password-cracker/3/) article for some more information. I'd be concerned about what else an injection of H202 would kill besides cancer cells.  And, dude, hypernova is not the preferred nomenclature. I think people have largely settled on super-luminous supernova, though a lot of folks refer to them as 1998bw-like.

How's that for pedantic? It does not make me feel any better, no. What does make me feel better is that it was so huge it was essentially unusable so no one would really get to feel what it is like to be around when one of these fuckers went neutrony. Would you ever stop, if you kept going back and forth and not grabbing the edges and the like? You're probably looking for an introduction to quantum computing, look in the literature for that. States are *put* in superposition, and you can perform operations where they create multiple results simultaneously but ultimately you observe the system, collapsing into a single state, so that superposition isn't a simple parallel execution. Moreover, states can be in an arbitrary superposition. The classical closest example are non-deterministic algorithms: you can suppose your random bits are a sort of superposition of possibilities and your output is a single outcome of that. The difference is quantum probability (and algorithms on a quantum computer) can't be explained by classical determinism: the different outcomes (sort of, from a classical perspect -- refer to literature for more detail) interact with themselves. Unless we have harmed the atmosphere enough to cause a different outcome. That'sa good point, but it's difficult to say actually. If we floated in air it may be easier at certain speeds to swim through it. It depends how you're measuring "easy". Air is probably hard to go fast in, but so is Mercury, I imagine. There's probably an optimal density that balances between having more to push against (so you can move more mass without having to expend energy moving the mass of your arm back and forth as much) and not having to displace large amounts of mass when your body moves. Perhaps somewhere near the density of water is best, because that's roughly the density of our bodies. Buying this and Ramachandran's 'Phantoms in the Brain' thanks to you guys, cheers The one on earth. Sound is a pressure wave, meaning that the loudness of it is related to the maximum and minimum pressure in that wave. 

For a normal sound wave, the biggest possible difference between the maximum and minimum pressure is twice atmospheric pressure. The moon barely has an atmosphere.  Thank you for your submission!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* This is an overly simplistic answer but we discussed this in my sensory &amp; motor neuroscience course 3 days ago. As was said below, the eye doesn't see "frames", but we can simplify our understanding of it by, for example, noticing that when we look at lights, we usually don't see a flicker that exists because it flickers at a higher frequency than our eyes can process. The equivalent "FPS" speed that your eye and V1 cortex processes images at, therefore, is somewhere around 60 FPS.  That could work, but you would have to also provide the minikatz files, and know where they will be located. And beyond that, based on a brief look at that page, there is no function for extracting the Windows SAM. Well the absolute limit on any speed is the speed of light, but there's an argument that there's a bound of c/3^1/2 , or aboutRe 173000 km/s. This is also the expected speed of sound through a gas of light, if that makes sense. However, I recently read [a paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5116.pdf) saying this bound is maybe violated inside neutron stars. There is a lot unknown about the interiors of neutron stars. Assuming your terminal velocity is 125 mph, which it wouldn't be, it would take over 17 hours to fall through the tube of a moon-sized body. Yes, it's from having and extra half cone in their eye. Usually the women who have it are related to someone else who is colorblind- that is, someone who is missing a cone. A normal person has 3 cones- for the 3 primary colors. The extra allows them to differentiate between colors more. So one person might look at two green things, and see the same shade. To them, one would be a another whole different shade of green. Testing them has shown consistency.
http://discovermagazine.com/2012/jul-aug/06-humans-with-super-human-vision If we assume there's no atmosphere/air resistance and completely neglecting friction..... you'd go back and forth forever. 

 Prosopagnosia is generally characterized by a deficit, usually a lesion, in the inferotemporal cortex, or IT cortex, which is primarily responsible for specifically recognizing face shapes and, more personally, actual faces.  The ball on the ramp would take longer to reach the ground, but it would have the same speed and kinetic energy as the falling one when it hits the ground. 

The ball on the ramp accelerates slower because for a 45 deg ramp, only half of the force of gravity is acting on the ball along the downslope direction. The other half is perpendicular to the direction of motion and countered by the normal force.  But the concept of terminal velocity is the speed you reach in Earth atmosphere where the acceleration due to gravity is negated by wind resistance. If we're on an Earth-moon sized ice moon, there'd be no atmosphere to slow you down (or negligible. I dunno, is there a micro atmosphere on our moon?) so you'd continue to accelerate until you hit the middle, then start to decelerate away from it. Yes. Every object with mass or energy has a gravitational field.  You're referring to the quantisation of time. The general consensus is that time is continuous, although there is a fairly significant group that thinks it's quantised. As of now, there are no observations that suggest that time is quantised.  Personally, my favorite analogy for this would be software rendering vs hardware acceleration.

Hardware acceleration (face recognition) works much faster because it has a special part of the computer reserved just for that.

With software rendering, you not only work slower, but also have to tell the processor a lot more about how to do the task, whereas hardware rendering makes some innate assumptions.

How'd I do? Say I push on the wheel. Let's say the equal but opposite force being applied to me is directed through the center of my mass. Would I move backwards and the wheel only spin? You would have two objects pushing on each other where one object only has linear momentum and the other only has angular momentum? Nathan, would you say that your conscious mind perceives 200 FPS, but the unconscious picks up all 1000 FPS, just doesn't bring it forward to the conscious? Physicists* physicians are doctors. 

The stuff outside the observable universe is expected to be the same as the stuff in it. 

There is no edge of the Big Bang. 

You can't travel out of your observable universe.  Vsauce touched on a similar topic before I believe.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I5Q3UXkGd0 I thought the speed of the expansion of space is faster than the sped of light.

A tall enough staircase can reduce the escape velocity to your jump velocity.  That's not really a speed though, because nothing is moving. It's the rate at which the space in between two objects is stretching.

edit: that was a valid question, you didn't need to downvote it so hard! If it makes you feel any worse, large nukes waste most of their energy upwards into the atmosphere and were abandoned in favor of smaller yield nukes produced [en masse] (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/US_and_USSR_nuclear_stockpiles.svg/555px-US_and_USSR_nuclear_stockpiles.svg.png) Resolution: Analog. There is a limit to how small a thing the human eye can see, so there is a distance minimum of the width of some thing it can see. The eye's resolution is therefore that distance. It will vary from person to person. If the coefficient of friction is 0 on your ramp thingy, then you only need to compare the vectors of force corresponding to the air resistance against the 2 objects in the medium they are moving in. One mass has a single vector that air resistance is pushing up against, the mass on the ramp thingy has a different path. 

Do your masses have a coefficient of friction? 

Are there variable wind speeds along the paths your objects travel along? If the masses are traveling through a medium without variability, then you will approach the possibility of the masses arriving at the ground at the same time.

If you depressurize your chamber, no wind resistance. 

Other than that, all you really have is gravity pulling down your stuff.  Hmm, I know mass and density are each factors in gravitational pull, but how does energy create a gravity field? I don't think you would make it out the other side. While gravity does cancel itself out while going down/up, you also have to account for friction... though small, it would still have an effect. Also if this IceMoon has any kind of an atmosphere, that would slow you down even further. Exactly yeah! It's like when the image recognition on your camera freaks out because of low-light or something and you see the little box flying around the screen.

 Try not to think of it as a piece of yarn thats forming a shape, try thinking about it as the energy that we are made up of. We are electronic and magnetic, producing heat and noise thats interfering and interacting with each other. The "strings" are the cosmic forces,  ripples on a pond, bouncing together and making crazy shapes like the Universe, and all the rest of the dimensions too, not just the three dimensional one we are looking at.  That's exactly what made me think of this question. I've been really interested in quantum mechanics lately as well as a growing interest in computers. Wikipedia can only go so far to the point where I need a bit more professional information. So thanks for all this new stuff. I have my English class filled out for me for the next few weeks now. Mimikatz could be downloaded from the internet and input from the ducky can be converted from base64/base85/whatever to binary executables. You're right though, this doesn't exfiltrate the SAM file. It's worse, the plain text password of the currently logged in user is revealed.

And if you're goal is still hashes, [it's not too hard.](http://superuser.com/questions/364290/dump-sam-file-while-system-is-running) It's more like a CID (Charge Injection Device) than a CCD (Charge Coupled Device).  Essentially, it doesn't scan lines, but your brain gets updates when individual photoreceptor cells fire off membrane action-potential signal cascades.   (The sequence of "updates" for signal vs. non-signal is inverted of course, but not discussed here.)

The individual photoreceptive proteins respond usefully to electromagnetic radiation in three wavelength ranges between 0.4 and 0.7 m.  This corresponds with the atmospheric EMR non-absorption window hovering around that range.  Absorption for these bands probably results in a specific conformational change for those proteins.

There is even an interesting kind of signal averaging going on within the cells and at the neuronal level.  If an insufficient number of photoreceptive proteins activate in a short enough span of time, then the cell membrane potential will not be triggered.  Likewise, if a down route neuron requires several inbound axonal junctions to trigger to get above threshold for signal propagation, it can filter out minor signals. &gt; So do they end up seeing just the beginning and ending segment of the motion, or 'frame by frame' or what exactly? 

I know there's a concept involved in smoking too much really strong pot called "framing" - it's only ever happened to me a couple of times, but you start seeing things in 2-5fps.  I remember watching a plane fly across the sky, and it was just jumping - it would stay suspended in the same spot, and then suddenly teleport to the next spot, and so on.   It's an extremely interesting subject! 

You can recognise that a colon followed by a right bracket means a happy face. So, even if you have Face Blindness and don't actually see a smiley face you can still say "Ok, colon and bracket, that means happy". 

The same mechanism worked with your family. Brown hair, shoulder-length with a fringe plus green eyes and that specific set of wrinkles around the eyes and that opal necklace = Mom. 
 My brain tries to fuse the images into one, like I've got double vision. Most uncomfortable. It depends on the time it takes for the rods/cones to attenuate to a stimulus.  There are probably no saccades in that sensory window Fun webpage on "viewing" your "blind spot"

https://visionaryeyecare.wordpress.com/2008/08/04/eye-test-find-your-blind-spot-in-each-eye/ Mass and energy are essentially two sides of the same coin. The mass-energy equivalence formula (E=mc^2) can be used to calculate the gravitational field created by pure energy. Thank you for your submission!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* Yes. Most of the interactions we see between light and matter involve either light getting absorbed or emitted by electrons changing energy levels. Positrons (anti-electrons) work exactly the same way. The only difference is that they carry a positive charge. They didn't say a hole through the center. They implied an angle and a chute.

So assuming a spiral to the center that spirals back out (maybe offset by a few feet to avoid overlap)...  Or a circle shape of half radius tangent to surface... 

I'm not sure the answer is yes except for the hole through center.  Math, because I'm bored. 

Escape velocity is given as 

v = (^2GM / r)

Some rearranging, and we can solve for r. 

r = ^2GM / v^2 

Average male jump velocity, which can be obtained from average jump height and conservation of energy, is ~8.96 m^2 / s^2. 

Plugging that, all G and M in, 

r = ^2 ^* ^6.67384e-11 ^* ^5.972e24 / 8.96^2 

r = 9.9290927e12 meters, or about 27352.8 times the radius of the moon's orbit. 

I advise not building stairs to space. It is [highly impractical.](http://what-if.xkcd.com/126/) What implications could come out of time being quantized? Wow my mind is blown. I turned it upside down and the discomfort stopped immediately. When it was right side up my brain kept going "there's a facethere's a face there's a face there's a face" faster and faster  Hi there, good questions. 
If you managed to fling a planet into absolute nowhere it would probably keep spinning on its axis getting slower and slower over a ridiculously long period of time as all of its energy ran out getting closer and closer to absolute zero. But it would probably still be spinning like a top. (is that what you were asking?)

Yes the Sun does, the  Sun has all the effect, we are sitting in her loving arms... arms like the 'bowl shaped curve' of space time

That question about Mars and its Moons gets answered by our Moon. Its called [tidal locking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking)
And yeah i think your right about the egg shape speeding up and slowing down again. Just tiny, tiny fluctuations at a time. Yes!  The square root.

w^2 = z has two solutions, which differ by a minus sign.  You're probably used to thinking of the square root to mean the positive square root (e.g. sqrt(2) = 1.41... not -1.41...) but the square root of a complex number is another complex number (e.g. sqrt(2i) = 1-i or i-1).

To turn the square root into a single valued function, you just need to make a choice about which root you take.  You can write any complex number in polar coordinates: z = r\*exp(i\*theta), but changing theta into theta+2pi doesn't change z, so there's not a unique choice.  Picking the "branch" of a multi-valued function (i.e. making it single-valued) amounts to deciding on a convention for theta: for an example, two common choices are 0 &lt;= theta &lt; 2*pi or -pi &lt; theta &lt;= pi.

There's nothing special about the square root.  The cubic root (or any power that's not an integer) is multi-valued. Thank you for your submission!

*[I am a bot](/r/AutoModerator/comments/q11pu/what_is_automoderator/), and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* One reason might be because the human eye is white. If you notice, animals' eyes are not white. When a person looks at you, you can see the white on both sides of their eyes, which I guess helps you realize where their pupil is pointed. I saw/read something about this once, it is quite interesting The blind-spot in the middle[-ish] of my vision is probably the most unbelievably obviously-false thing I had ever heard of, but then I did the tests and saw that I had it.  It's really weird. In fact I doubt the moon has enough of an atmosphere to sustain a pressure wave at all, it would just be particles flung off the bell then hitting you. That assumes that there is no data compression or preprocessing, which wouldnt be the case. So light speed somehow influences mass in a way to create relative gravity? Do you know how? Another disorder to add to the list! I don't remember what it was called, but those who have it do not recognize a certain area in space. For example, If you put a clock in front of them and asked them to draw it, they would draw 2/3rds of it on paper. If you rotate the clock, they would say that the numbers are changing! I made a mistake, pushing on the rim would still cause translational motion.  If you completely neglected friction, the time it would take to slide down *any* chord between two points on the surface and up the far side would be the same. One major thing I know quantum computers can do is factor large numbers, using [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm). Major public key encryption algorithms are based on the difficulty of factoring these big numbers, so this potentially could become a problem in the future. Good Job!  Thanks for shedding the light of reason on this topic.

In your analysis, don't forget to include the "Rubbing Process", as described by Coach Belichick.  Before the AFC Championship game, the balls were kept in the locker room (assume 70-80 degrees F). They were then rubbed vigorously for a substantial preparation period. The rubbing likely created heat from friction. The heat increased the air Temperature in the footballs above the indoor temperature, and their Pressure increased. The warmed footballs were given to referee Walt Anderson, who was asked to set the pressure to 12.5 psi. The balls stayed in the official's locker room for 2 hours and gradually cooled back to the indoor temperature. This resulted in an initial drop in Temperature and a corresponding drop in Pressure below 12.5 psi (approx 1 psi drop per Belichick).

Check out this informative video which explains the possible significance of the "Rubbing Process" in the pressure-drop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf8oQ4rhR-A
 Do you mind me asking what you have a degree in? I'm very impressed with your knowledge; I'm working towards a degree in neural biology. Making a switch from psychology and it's been time consuming to say the least but my transfer to a research university has been approved for this fall so the work has been worth it. Can't begin to describe how stimulating it is to read about how our brain functions...

Thank you for taking the time to explain how our brain processes images. Yes. It has an negligible thin atmosphere.  Ah of course! Thanks for helping out. Can't believe I didn't think of that.  As long as it is a straight chute, the time taken will be identical and the answer would be yes. 

For any other shape ignoring friction, the answer would still be yes as gravity is a conservative force, meaning if you are a certain distance from the centre, you would have enough energy to get back to that distance regardless of what route you fall through.  I seriously doubt humans could destroy all life on Earth. Not all the nuclear weapons ever built would accomplish that. Fungi, bacteria... Life would go on, albeit with a bump in the road. 

The Earth will be just fine. While doing things like restoring an old version &gt;might&lt; get rid of it, it also might not. A clever piece of malware would modify the OS (the original poster mentioned this with a "kernel level program"). Every program you use (unless you boot off another device) is interacting with the OS, which could send false information to whatever program you use to hide itself. Yes I know of SHH. Some histories of naming various molecules are interesting, like TLRs
 No. There's a reason why batteries and computers get hot, and that is the biggest sign that you're losing energy to the environment.  More than slightly exaggerated! Asteroids are much more spread out than you would see in, for example, *Star Wars*. Asteroids are, on average, about 600,000 miles apart! The odds of successfully navigated an asteroid field are pretty close to 1! In fact, NASA has already done it 12 times. 

Of course, asteroids exist in a smooth distribution of sizes instead of being all the same. The largest is Ceres and is a little smaller across than Texas on I-10. They go all the way down to the size of tennis balls and grains of sand. The total mass in the asteroid belt is still only a few percent of the mass of the Moon though, and they occupy an orbit much larger than the orbit of Earth. 

To put it into perspective, if an unremarkable asteroid the size of a football field is shrunk to the size of a grain of sand (1 mm), the nearest other asteroid would be 6 miles away! Not a big risk of hitting a big one by accident! Maybe, but that's beyond my understanding.  To be honest I never really considered if it went all the way down to zero, and whether it was slowly decreasing or quickly decreasing.  I could only speculate on what would happen.  I do know that a lot of our current understanding would probably need to be revised.  Check out [this link](http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/ast25may99_2/) for some more reading on factors that may influence the Hubble constant, and some background on it.  The article is a bit old, but its fascinating stuff and that site is loaded with more.  Thanks a lot for this discussion, you've given me quite a bit to think about. The gravitational binding energy of the Earth is 2x10^32 J. To unbind it and blow it up, you would need 50 thousand trillion megatons of tnt. We have lots of nukes, but not that many. The biggest (unclassified?) nuke ever detonated was the Tsar Bomba at 50 Megatons. You would need a thousand trillion Tsar Bombas to literally destroy the Earth.  There is a part of the brain whose only job is to recognize, specifically, normally-oriented faces, called the [fusiform face area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusiform_face_area). One man who had brain damage that destroyed his ability to recognize body parts (like arms and legs) could still recognize faces normally, but as soon as he looked at a face upside down, he didn't recognize it. WHAT ABOUT THE COLTS BALLS?

1) It has been rumored that the Colts balls did not lose pressure during the game, but the NFL has not confirmed this.  Maybe they were not checked, and were also out of range.  We don't know for sure.

2) Maybe the Colts balls were not rubbed pre-game, started out at indoor temp (70-75 degrees), and were set to upper end of range (13.5psi).  By halftime, they fell less than 1 psi and remained within range. This is the most likely explanation.

3) Maybe multiple pressure gauges, with different calibrations were used at different stages.

4) It has been rumored that the Colts anticipated lodging a complaint before the game even started, so maybe they filled their balls outdoors with cold air before giving them to the referees, knowing they could be checked at halftime.  This might suggest someone on their team knew about the effect of temperature on ball pressure.

5) Maybe the Colts tampered with their balls on the sidelines before halftime, after finding them to be soft, knowing they could be checked at halftime. 

6) Maybe the Patriots balls were out of range to begin with and NOT properly set by officials pregame.  This could have been because of miscommunication, laziness or malfeasance by one or more of Walt Andersons officiating crew, which they might not realize or are reluctant to admit.  Being responsible for an embarrassing mistake of this magnitude could be career-ending.
 Let's say my mass is 100 kg and the mass of the wheel is also 100 kg. If I push off the rim of the wheel and I go backwards at 1 m/s does the wheel translate in the opposite direction at 1 m/s or less than 1 m/s? Relative to a stationary point that is. Is it read by Sachs? I love the sound of that man's voice. No, gravity has nothing do with it.  Sliding on ice, as mentioned below causes friction which will stop you.  Falling through a hole would theoretically work if there was a perfect vacuum.  However quantum mechanics would rear up to prevent such perfection but that would take a very, very long time. It's not quite like that. In general relativity, mass and energy are considered the exact same thing. If you have a mass m1, and you add E energy to it, the new mass will be m1+E/c^2 . The inverse works as well: if you have some energy E, and you completely convert a mass m into energy (for example, through matter-antimatter annihilation), the new energy will be E+mc^2 . However, calculating the gravitational pull of an energy field is not as simple as converting the energy into mass via E=mc^2 and using Newton's gravitation formula. To calculate the gravitational field, you will need to use [Einstein's field equations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations), which are much more complicated, and outside of my field of expertise. In your first step, you incorrectly assumed that the two structures would be at different speeds. If the forces acted on both structures for an equal amount of time, both structures will have the same speed.  If there was any atmosphere or contact with the surface you would only fall most of the way through. Otherwise yes. Also as a side note, the material of the globe matters not. It wouldn't act as a slide, just like a huge vertical whole. As the gravitational potential energy you posses gets converted into kinematic (motion) energy the exact process would reverse past the centre with proportions trading off. If any energy was lost to due ANY other form such as heat or sound, you wouldn't quite make it back to your original position.  The translation would be such that linear momentum is conserved.  For more about the special function our brain has on face recognition, 60 Minutes had a great feature about people who are impaired in that area. To get a sense of how specialized facial recognition is in our brain, [look at what happens when viewing faces upside down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8cXus7SNQY&amp;t=4m0s) (skip to 4 minutes in, if it doesn't automatically).

At [6:30 in that video, there is also a fascinating look into the opposite spectrum, super face recognizers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8cXus7SNQY&amp;t=6m30s), who remember a face even after an incidental meeting. This leads to surprisingly awkward social encounters, such as saying, "Oh yeah, we met before at a party five years ago, don't you remember?"

[60 Minutes on Face Blindness Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxqsBk7Wn-Y)

[60 Minutes on Face Blindness Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8cXus7SNQY) I'm just trying to grasp the concept of an energetic presence effecting mass/space. I guess heat and nuclear reactions and stuff expand space. Thanks anyway There is no centre of the universe. The centre of your observable universe is you.  It would most certainly take longer on a ramp. In fact every shape ramp takes a slightly different time for object to travel down it, even if the horizontal and vertical displacements are the same. There's a shape that optimizes this trade off between acceleration and moving something side ways and regardless of the parameters it always ends up looking like a smooth bent concave stick.  That explains why looking at LCD lights while playing a musical instrument can get pretty crazy looking. I used to play the trombone, and looking at a digital clock while playing certain notes would make the numerals float around and even appear outside the boundaries of the clock! Thanks! This is very useful. The solar system isn't moving away from the Big Bang.  Heat can transfer from low temperature driven by humidity differences. Same reason you will feel cold after getting out of a hot shower - water is evaporating which requires latent heat input. Your skin cools to provide energy for water to evaporate.
 That's really, cool, I had never thought about how similar they are mathematically.  But your right, it does make sense if you consider it. &gt; We could shorten the delay and see what the inter-ocular temporal resolution of the visual system is. 

I'm curious if we could tell as easily as with sound localization - if we could design an experiment that tells us something meaningful. There's so much processing in the visual system and it never would've needed to compensate for/calculate time differences in the two eyes, whereas evolutionarily it make sense in the auditory system.

I guess I imagine such an experiment giving the psychometric curve for how short of a time difference we can notice, which seems it would be more an artifact of the downstream processing and not due to designed features. Maybe that's what you're interested in, though. citation needed
 Twenty feet away. If objects in mirrors were all on the "surface", you would be able to focus on every object in the mirror without changing your focal point which isn't true.  The forces aren't what have the energy; the objects do. Atoms, protons, etc, have a potential energy associated with the forces that affect it (think gravitational potential energy. Gravity doesn't have the energy, the things do). The forces are just how that potential energy is converted into another form. Can you explain this further? 

For example, when I think of the universe, I think if a giant oval "sphere". So if I'm on the edge of that or close to the edge, how am I still the center? 

Sorry if this sounds dumb. I'm quite uneducated about this but even more interested.  There is no *known* center of the universe.  I believe the precise nature of the shape and extents of the universe are still unknown.  I have even heard theories that it may be toroidal in shape. An additional point is how much prediction the brain is doing - not everything we see is direct sensory input. A lot of interpolation and guessing happens in the brain, predicting what we'll see next, correcting predictions based on current inputs.

I remember hearing a neuroscientist say in an interview that he believed that our sensory experience may be as little as 10% real-time input and 90% prediction/internal projections. (I don't know how widely his numbers are believed, though.) The way I do it is by closing my eyes when the leg and body are aligned, and then opening them after the leg has oscillated past the furthest point from the body. It doesn't work every time, but it's more than chance. Its like watching a video, but not fast enough (fps is lower than the standard 1/16th, after which our brain perceives it as motion). Imagine pouring a cup of tea. And you blink all the time so you can only see a single still frame of what's going on. And then suddenly that frame changes to the cup overflowing. I feel so honored but I try to stay somewhat humble so I'll have to decline. 

Thanks for the information too! Technically, It depends on the shape of the mirror.

However, assuming its a flat mirror (and disregarding the glass) the image will appear 20 feet away from you so your eyes will have to focus to accommodate that. I might have phrased it wrongly. There isn't a centre of the universe according to common consensus, but there haven't been any conclusive observations.  &gt;The eye makes up for this uneven resolution with super-deluxe image processing hardware that's capable of some very big apparent improvements. The eye moves a little all the time in what are called saccades...

Can we (somehow) apply some of these optics or processing to cameras, perhaps by thinking of a camera lens and CCD in a different way?  This might allow us to make a very long range camera that has very high resolution at its center, but able to detect movement outside of that range and refocus immediately on that movement. Also another interesting read if you're interested in these things is Phantoms  In The Brain by VS Ramachandran. Brilliant work . It is, and you should feel like that. Norwegian and English are both Germanic languages in origin and there has been a fair bit of interaction across the North Sea in the past. Especially the basic vocabulary is quite similar, although of course in many cases the connotations have diverged and/or English has adopted a Latin-based word instead.

Trying to "fit" modern English directly:

&gt; ... er en bok utgitt i 1985, skrevet av nevrologen Oliver Sacks, som beskriver sykehistorien til noen av sine pasienter ...

&gt; ... are one book out-gived in 1985, scribed of neurologue-the Oliver Sacks, same be-scribes sick-histories 'till not-known-ones of his patients ...

&gt; ... is a book published in 1985, written by the neurologist Oliver Sacks, which describes case histories of some of his patients ...

(Disclaimer: I am not a professional linguist nor a native speaker of either language.) The human eye doesn't work in frames per second, because human vision is based on a constant stream of information while the eyes are open, rather than a series of still images shown in quick succession.

That said, you can see a difference in FPS in a very simple way [here](http://30vs60.com/bf4running.php). This simple site helps to show that claims that the human eye can only see 24 FPS or 30FPS are completely untrue.

I can't find any scientific research, because to be perfectly honest I don't know where to look for it, but I have seen research in the past that tested fighter pilots ability to detect FPS improvements (increases in the number of frames per second) up to 280FPS. 
 To add to your comment. If you guys want to "see" the blind spot take  a piece of paper and draw two Xs about two inches apart, then block one eye with your hand. After this focus with the one eye (lets say right eye) on the left X and move it slowly back and fourth and youll see the X disappear. Do the opposite for your left eye. As you said, it all depends on how you define touch. Two atoms are never actually just going to rub up against each other - instead, they hover very closely together, as they are repelled by their negative charges. However, atoms swap subatomic particles all the time. Electrons are constantly moving from one atom to another. Nuclear bombs work because you can give an atom's nucleus extra subatomic particles.

Sorry, I just had to reply. This guy deleted his thread right after I finished typing this answer. :( So if I looked at a mirror that was 15 ft away and then was able to take that exact image (that was in the mirror) in the same resolution and put it next to the mirror, when I moved my focus to the image, would it look twice as close? Isn't the universe expanding? Can we not measure that? Well, c is constant in our 3 spatial and 1 temporal dimensions. 

We don't know it as a fact, but we're very sure that it's true since the whole of special relativity depends on that assumption and special relativity has never been observed to be wrong.  Since this question has been answered a bunch of times, here's a close up picture of an eyeball (Warning - Gross/Fascinating)

http://rebloggy.com/post/life-beautiful-face-eye-blue-nature-reflection-pattern-human-color-anatomy-see-m/46973208961

Science: Pupil is actually a hole of darkness, which the tissue surrounding it contracts and expands to focus the light passing through Your phrasing was fine.  I just wanted to point out the fascinating lack of knowledge we actually have about the nature of the universe.  

* If it's infinite, the term 'center' is meaningless.  
* If it's a toroid, there is a center, but there's literally nothing there (not even empty space).  
* If it's just a sphere, there *is* a center but we have no idea where that center is, and we likely never will due to the fact that the recession is speeding up! My physics teacher from two years ago has this condition. Was always strange speaking with him. Yes the universe is expanding; no, not from any special point. There is no place where the Big Bang happened; it happened everywhere. Matter is not flying through space away from a point; all of space everywhere is expanding between the bits of matter.  To add to what's been written that feeling you're experiencing is a result of your subconscious brain processing things a lot faster than your conscious brain. There are a few subtle cues that cause us to suspect someone is looking at us that again are social and largely subconscious. As we turn around, we immediately look eyes with anyone looking in our direction. Quite often your eyes scanning the room causes others to do the same. This often happens so fast one or more parities feel as if they knew they were being starred at, and didn't just state immediately into the correct set of eyes. This was important for our survival as eye contact is huge in human relationships/aggression. Which also explains the white of our eyes, contesting our pupils.  There is no image in the mirror, the mirror only reflects light. Your question is therefore, 'if I looked at something at half the distance, would it look twice as close'. 

Yes Well, your eyes would have to focus on an object twice as close, but the image would look further away. 

This is why computer screens give some people problems. Even though objects displayed might be in the background far away, unlike in real life, the user is focusing on the screen. 

It is most apparent in movies. In 2D movies, you can't switch between objects in the scene without switching focus, but in 3D movies, you have to switch focus because the objects far away are actually simulating the effect by varying the angle of light.  Another very very interesting phenomenon: in certain types of blindness, motion and spatial arrangement processing remains intact, but your vision (colour, shapes, light perception) goes away. Its like, you can walk on the street, you can pick up cups, you can even put letters in letterboxes, but you can't see yourself doing it. It highlights how different image processing and the perception of vision is.  So your implying that we will go in opposite directions at the same rate? It seems to me that the force applied to the wheel should get divided into some of it causing linear momentum and some of it causing angular momentum. Because some of the force causes the wheel to spin, it shouldn't also be translating at the same rate as I, who does not spin.  Yes? You have to remember how light is working in this whole process. When you look into the mirror, you are actually seeing a 3d space, thus you are able to focus on the object that appears to be 30 feet away. When you take a picture, it's 2d, and you simply focus on the picture. You might perceive the image as being further, as you would when playing a video game, but it's not the same thing.

Also, an interesting thought, a camera would probably focus on the mirror itself, assuming it was to use an ultrasonic distance measurement. To conserve both linear and angular momentum, that would have to be the case. Remember that there is no law stating that under Newton's third law, the energy has to be equally divided.  &gt; If you're brute forcing a lump of encrypted data and have absolutely no idea what is in there or what to look for then it can be tricky

AFAIK, it's pretty easy to identify, mathematically.  Encrypted data is highly random, by definition.  Unless someone encrypted random noise, you'd be able to tell.

But like you said, that's more computationally intensive than simply checking for " the ", "JPEG", etc.  Most file formats have metadata in the beginning of the file and are easily identified. Thats sounds very intriguing. Was a dyson sphere employed? I kinda think at this point in evolution, what 'society'/life would need is energy, possibly in the form of electricity, and heat. Light seems a very specific source of energy to need. I mean, if you're aiming for endurance, you'd want to minimise the creation of entropy, and be extremely efficient and use reversible processes (cue quantum computing). Photosynthesis seems a bad option in this regard. If you could just upload consciousness to a reversible, or near reversible quantum computer, I bet such an existence could be maintained for a much longer period of time. Slow down for the second half? But still slide to the other side? If you were on a sled on rails, and couldn't crash, but shot out the end into the "sky"? Then parachuted down? 

Best futuristic theme park ride or not? Images dont work that way.

Resolution is a property digital/printed images... a reflection is exactly that: a reflection. Photons bounce off of you, then they travel to the mirror and bounce back. You cannot "scan or capture" a mirror.

To focus on a life size image (cardboard cutout) beside the mirror would require focusing at half the distance as the image in the mirror. Similarly the cutout would appear 4 times bigger (due to the inverse square law)

Edit: grammar &gt; But nobody uses this encryption method because it is wholly impractical.

Sure they do.  It's impractical for random communication between strangers, but it's quite practical for two parties who know they're going to be communicating short messages that need to remain secret.

How can we know how the brain processes these images. Is there hard evidence or a lot of assumptions being made by scientists? &gt;But is that "seeing" it? They couldn't describe the image, just that there was a flash, IIRC.

It has to be. Otherwise we're literally saying a person needs to be able to be flashed an image of a clown, a horse, a house, a monkey, a clock, a dog, etc. within the span of a second and the person needs to recall them all and once they can't that's their limit. 

The question was always about continuous motion, not perception of individual frames. A person need not track a ball bouncing as to its orientation every single frame, just track it and feel that it is in smooth motion. 

 &gt;I believe that there were responses better than guessing of statistical significance somewhere up to the 60 FPS range, but that most people fell off around the 30 FPS range, meaning beyond that most people can't see any difference of the higher rate. 

This would be pretty interesting and highly controversial if true. Though I have to doubt it otherwise my eye processing is literally so superior that I am seeing something most people cannot. 

I'd like to read that study as to me, the majority of people NOT being able to tell the difference between this:

http://boallen.com/fps-compare.html 

Just blows my mind. And that's that 60 isn't even that great, 120 fps is so much more capable of fast motion. Distance in meters or?  Their brain doesn't process the information sent to it from the eyes. It's pretty weird but from what I understand someone with Prosopagnosia cannot recognize anything distinguishable about a face that they can identify. You can be born with the disease or acquire it due to brain damage so how people compensate differ. People are forced to recognize people by their clothes, voice, style of movement etc. &gt; Haven't passwords, for the most part, always been hashed?

Unfortunately, no.

OS-level passwords have been hashed for a very long time, but lots of systems with their own user/password databases stored in plaintext in SQL tables persist to this day. The lone pairs. The reason molecules tend to have lone pairs is the excess positive charge holding on to some extra electrons until they balance everything out. If another molecule has more positive attraction it has the potency to strip them off. Leaving both objects with a net charge.  No, you will exit and reach the height at which you jumped in.  Hell, it's not even the brain that does all that. Just in the retina there are multiple layers of nerve cells that process an image even before it reaches the brain. 

Just this week I read a paper about how the leading model is that retinal ganglia cells (the bottom layer) fire under one of two circumstances. 1) "on cells" fire when the presented image on that part of the retina goes from dark to light over time or if it sees a light spot surrounded by dark. 2) "off cells" do the reverse - respond to dark spots or darkness over time. These responses are computed over a few nerve cells and sends that info to the brain. This takes place over two or three layers of neurons, imagine what an entire brain can do. 

I can post the paper if there's interest, though it's highly technical. I can't remember if it's behind a paywall cause I'm not at my computer right now.  The images that you commonly see are those of the observable universe. In those images, the Earth is at the centre. The observable universe is basically the part of the universe that we can see because the light has had enough time to reach us.  First of all, there is a deep sense in which Maxwell's equations are the unique classical limit to the quantum field theory of a neutral, massless spin-1 particle interacting with matter (the U(1) gauge theory mentioned by /u/iorgfeflkd).

However, you don't even need that to see that Maxwell's equations aren't totally independent. This is very well-covered in [this Stack Exchange answer](http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/20072) by Lubos Motl. The idea is, if you remember that div(curl(**v**)) = 0 for any vector **v**, and apply the div operator to Faraday and Ampere's laws, you find:

(div B)/t = 0

(div E)/t = -div j.

The first implies that div(B) is a constant, so the Maxwell equation div(b) = 0 is just setting the initial condition here. The second can be used with the continuity equation (the local statement of conservation of charge):

/t + div(j) = 0

to say that (div(E) - )/t = 0, so Gauss' law is an initial condition/constraint for Ampere's law. So you can view the six components of the Faraday/Ampere laws as dynamical, and the Gauss laws as "initial conditions." Seriously though, you're at the centre of your observable universe. You're not at the centre of someone else's observable universe though.  &gt; Science predicts that their is many more dimensions

I am not sure science actually predicts this.

There are hypotheses which look at using higher spatial dimensions to predict the workings of the universe. But they are still only hypotheses.

&gt; how do we know that the speed of light isn't one of these dimensions

The *speed of light* is not a spatial dimension.

There may be a higher-dimensional-universe in which one dimension is varying *speed of light*, but that would be different from a time dimension or a spatial dimension.

You can then have a dimension for all/any physical constants, which will all be non-spatial dimensions.

We can travel through the 3 spatial dimensions at will.

We can only travel through time in one direction.

And as I_Cant_Logoff pointed out, we can only experience one point of the *speed of light* dimension (IF that's even a thing). Osmium metal comes to mind - actually, it's very useful, widely used and generally not a hazard; however, it's [extremely toxic when oxidized](http://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/safety/sop/SOP_Osmium_Tetroxide.pdf).  I've worked with both the pure osmium metal and catalytic OsO4 before in synthesis. The smell of OsO4 is very distinctive, kind of like the copy room (metallic ozone smell).   For angular momentum to be conserved wouldn't something besides the wheel have to be spinning in the opposite direction that the wheel is spinning? Since I pushed on it and the force is directed through my center of mass, I'm not spinning. For the wheel to have any rotation at all it would have to convert some it's linear momentum into angular momentum. I understand this might not be equally divided into linear and angular momentum but it seems like some division of momentum would have to occur.  Angular momentum isn't only in the form of actual spinning. It's the product of instantaneous linear momentum and perpendicular distance from a given axis. In your case, the total angular momentum would be conserved because your linear momentum isn't directed through the axis of rotation.  That was a great link. I tried one of the pictures and was surprised just how difficult it was to detect change with even a short mask. Myself and my fiancee looked at it upside down and it did not agitate our eyes. Units in is units out, so at 30cm:

30cm*0.0002909 is 0.008727cm, or 87.27m (87x87m is about the smallest thing you can see at 30cm from your eyes). The iPhone 6 Pro's retnia display is 401 ppi, which means a pixel is 1 inch/401, so pixels are approximately 63m. This is why they call it a retina display, at 30cm, which is reasonable for a phone, the pixels are too small to see. You would have to hold the phone about 21.6cm or close to your eye to see a pixel. Neither.

If It is being asked as a straight line passing through the center (and since it was asked as a possibility of stopping at the center, I think it is fair to assume that is what is meant)

Even with no resistance, the best outcome is the acceleration gained on the way down is offset by the deceleration on the way back up.

However, ice may provide less resistance, but would still provides friction.  Even with the most minimal friction, it is a net sum lose through the entire journey.  

You would not make it back out the other side, and would be pulled each way repeatedly until settling at the center

 But again we are limited by what we could possibly perceive as properties. So it tells us that all physical properties ie mass, speed, rotation, etc. are the exact same?  &gt; 50 thousand trillion megatons of tnt.

This is roughly 10 times the mass of the planet, TNT wise. (if my math is correct)

Much less nuclear material is needed, but it will still be a huge chunk (which we just don't have) Though in the scale of things, if we're considering two people on earth, the percentage difference is small :) &gt; the denser the medium the faster sound will travel

That's not true. The speed of sound is inversely related to density.  You would be shocked at how many places your password (because you use one password for everything) is stored in plain text. If the chute was cut directly through the center of mass, then you would slide through, then slow, then slide backwards, then slow, repeating this pendulum like motion until you came to rest in the center of mass (you would feel weightless at this point). EDIT: actually, come to think of it, the ball would also need to be spinning slow enough as to not negate gravity's effect on your body...

If the chute was *not* directly through the center, then what would happen entirely depends on many different factors (friction, how off center the chute is, size of ball, speed of spin of ball, etc...) Did you just make the connection? I made it after reading your comment and it's things like that that still amaze me even in topics that are fairly basic.  Remember that it is really the strong nuclear force holding these atoms together. Electromagnetism loses power with distance, meaning that if an electron broke free it would be gone forever(probably). What we're talking about here appears to *increase* with distance, hence the ridiculous probabilities at distances far from the center of the nucleus. I was going with there being standard air pressure so you can really enjoy it.

Hm...  I must be doing something wrong.  The gravity acceleration on the surface of the Moon is 5.32 ft/s/s.  That would not stay constant as you fell towards the center, it would increase, but I'm going with the easy constant.

d = 1/2 * a * t^2 = 1079.5 miles (radius) = 5699760 feet

5699760 * 2 / 5.32 = 2142767 = t^2
 
t = 1464 seconds = 24.4 minutes to the center ???

v-max = a * t = 5.32 * 1464 = 7788 ft/s = 88.5 mph ???


 Awesome, thanks for helping me on that last step! I understand now. And we also need to take into account that at the top of those stairs, you'd have a tangential velocity of:

*3.58 x 10^18 kilometers per second*

**11.9 trillion times the speed of light**

- if all my math is correct  You can't always verify by comparing hashes. For some cryptographic hashes, you can verify that a given plaintext satisfies the hashed value, but encrypting the same plaintext won't deterministically result in the same output. One of the really cool things about vision is that "seeing" isn't really done by the eyes. You can imagine your eyes as just a billion little receptors that detect light and send information at the speed of the action potential to your brain. There isn't really a concerted "frame" that is sent to the brain. Like your eyes don't create a frame per milisecond for example and send that as a packet of info to the brain. 


That being said there are upper limits to the speed of motion your BRIAN can detect. If things are moving too fast in a certain part of your field of vision it appears blurry because your brain can't parse the information into discrete moving objects. 


If anyone is interested this is some pioneering work done in the 50's that describes how the visual field is organized in the visual cortex. It's exciting!


http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1359523/ http://i.imgur.com/N6vEMPY.jpg

this is worse for me. at least with the doubles eyes and mouth if I focus on the nose or the whole picture it stops being weird. With these types of pictures it's is like when you look at a bright light too long.
 So when physicists talk about how light approaching is blue shifted/passing is red, this phenomenon is uniform in all directions? Just something I've never really heard explained. If that's the case wouldn't that suggest we are probably closer to the center than farther?  Since the OP used an ice ball, I've taken the liberty to help him make the assumptions of a frictionless, stationary environment :)

Any path through this environment would result in the same sort of motion, with the guy going all the way through and oscillating back and forth.  If the planet would be capable of slowing down, as you say, then it is theoretically possible for it to eventually come to a full stop. Can you explain the forces that affect the change of it's rotation in this case? Which exact forces would get lower, and why would it affect the rotation. 

My default assumption was that it would be impossible for a planet to come to a full stop, even if it's core froze to an absolute zero. Based on Newtonian laws, in order for that to happen, there would have to be an external force. Also, I figured that if dark matter is able not only to work on a tera-scale (pulling galaxies, superclusters etc further away from one another), but also on a pico-scale (increasing the distances between atoms), eventually there wouldn't be a planet left, thus eliminating any rotation. I would also like confirmation on this. However, I just wanted to know whether there are other forces that apply.

Also, if the sun has an effect on the speed the Earth rotates around it's axis, where does that effect come from, what forces are at play? Thanks for your input.  Very interesting, thank you :) &gt;The gravity acceleration on the surface of the Moon is 5.32 ft/s/s. That would not stay constant as you fell towards the center, it would increase

The acceleration due to gravity would DEcrease as you fell. At the center of the ice-moon (thats no space station!) you are surrounded equidistant by the mass of the moon. Every direction is attracting you equally.  If you started off at the center point of our hypothetical ice hole, right in the middle of the moon, you'd float there, attracted equally by all the mass of the moon in all directions. Yes, it is uniform in all directions as far as we can see.  On average, galaxies are receding from us.  Of course, some are actually approaching us, but since the vast majority are receding, we can pretty confidently say that the universe is continuing to expand.  Not only is it expanding, but the expansion is accelerating!  Nobody knows why this is, but this is generally what "dark energy" is supposed to explain, if we ever figure out what that is. Sure they can, it's just highly unlikely.  This is the basis behind the quantum tunneling effect.  Understand the wavefunctions that give rise to orbital shapes only give probabilities, which relate to a possible state of the system, not to the actual state.  In QM locating a particle is  nonsense. All you can do is to compute the average position and momentum.  Physicians are probably just a flummoxed as everybody else. To answer your question title: Starlight visible to us is part of a spherical radiation. An exception is pulsars where we see one of the polar cones intermediately as flashes, [which you can see in diagram.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Pulsar_schematic.svg/1000px-Pulsar_schematic.svg.png) and here's a real live example from the [Vela pulsar.](http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=10426)

In your example of the beam, the problem is that you can't see light from the side unless it interacts and scatters off something. For instance if it passed through a dust cloud, some of the light might scatter off and reach your eyes from the side--you can see this effect with a pen laser when it's really dark out. The light scatters off the dust and the air itself and reaches your eyes, otherwise though, the laser is invisible until it hits something and reflects.

However, there is again one exception, stars don't just give off light, they give off incredibly energetic charged matter aka plasma. This plasma will be visible from the side because as it travels it is giving off light in all directions, the most dramatic of these plasma emissions are jet cones being given off by neutron stars black holes like this jet from a supermassive black hole in the [M87 galaxy.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Messier_87_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg/1024px-Messier_87_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg) These jets are relativistic and are often being ejected at at appreciable fractions of the speed of light. Our previous friend, the Vela pulsar not only is a pulsar, but also is clothed in a supernova remnant and is itself shooting off a particle jet at around [70% the speed of light,](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2013/vela/) which you can see in this video/article--important to note, the particle jet is *not* the pular light cones, Vela is a really amazing astrophysical object. The theoretical best resolution of the eye would be dependent on the spacing of the photoreceptors in the retina and pupil diffraction limitations.  I believe it equates to about 20/8 vision on the snellen scale if memory serves me correctly (Which is much better then 20/20). Good question. 

Sound is only sound because humans have evolved to comprehend it as such. I.E.: Human ears hear certain frequencies and can decipher these frequencies into meaning. That's what sound is to humans--just frequencies with meaning. And once the frequency becomes too high or too low for a human to hear, is it really sound anymore? (No.)

Once the frequency gets large enough, the "sound" would just be vibrations. So this "limit" you speak of is subjective to the animal experience.

The phenomena you are considering is really just a physical wave. If you want to read more about this, look up wave propagation through different media (e.g: water, vacuum, metal, etc.). Im with you as far as the taking a very very long time... but what quantum mechanics effect would be at play (not a challenge, I know nothing of quantum mechanics. Tell me what I should be  wikipedireading.) I've never heard of that one actually. Is it something like this? 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_agnosia
 You need a pressure differential. Setting the membrane in the ocean will Not work because the feed pressure and clean water pressure ( called permeate) will be at the same pressure. typical Reverse osmosis (RO) differential pressures can be as high as 200 psi or about 460 ft of water. Flux through the membrane(gpm/ft2) increases with pressure, but With diminishing returns.  It's still arbitrary, it's just like Dewey decimal. Mineral X is between 3 and 4, so they call it 3.5. Mineral Y is between X and 4, so they call it 3.6.  He's right. It's one of the many philosophically individualistic, and very awesome, concepts of relativity. Very true but simple hash-compare-repeat examples get the point across well enough.  Curious individuals are (unfortunately) far more likely to hear about bad salt+hash systems which fit that mental model than systems where sincere cryptographic effort is expended and can't be attacked this way. I am not sure it is that we are taught to look in the eyes as much as insticts from millions and millions of years fo being animals that we look at the eyes first for almost all information (threat, sexual, friendly, etc.) It's less to do with being taught and more to do with evolution.  Or brain has a subroutine if you will that recognizes faces.  The extra eyes and mouth are throwing it off and confusing it.

Further reading: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_perception No--there are some around the same density, but you wouldn't call them a gas. For instance, supercritical carbon dioxide has a density of about half that of water at room temperature (but at 73 atmospheres of pressure!). Supercritical fluids are neither gas nor liquid, but a different phase that has the properties of both and its own unique properties. Here's carbon dioxide's phase [chart.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Carbon_dioxide_pressure-temperature_phase_diagram.svg/509px-Carbon_dioxide_pressure-temperature_phase_diagram.svg.png) Also here's a video of [supercritical CO2.](http://youtu.be/-gCTKteN5Y4) Take notice how the gas and liquid phases disappear into a single phase. It isn't super sampling, rods and cones stop firing when they are given the same stimulus for longer than x time, so that is why the eye has to saccade back and forth so that the stimulus is always new and re-sampled for changes.  We're built to detect movement.  Not super sample the same thing, per se.  We get the "picture" pretty fast, whether it is in your conscious awareness or just stored in your unconscious are different things altogether.  Thank you for your submission!

If you disagree with this decision, please send a message to the moderators. You are correct, I incorrectly and hastily applied the high school textbook reasoning, where the SOS in air &lt; liquid &lt; solid. However, the speed of sound is fundamentally dependent (for a gas) on temperature and molecular mass, and should not be thought of as simply inversely proportional to density. This can be incorrect in many cases. For instance, with increasing altitude, the speed of sound decreases, as density and pressure both decrease. It does get [complicated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound), and I am no expert. (In fact this was more for my benefit than trying to school you.)

The most worrisome part was the short term memory loss for a good few weeks. It slowly got better each day, from maybe only 1 minute or so of memory for the first day to maybe 10 the second, and from there on it was a little different. More like I would just forget what the hell I was doing. I'd walk into a room and forget what my objective was and just stand there aimlessly for a bit. That and my body was so weak from the seizure and the fact that I was apparently quite "uncooperative" during the time I don't remember (a couple days, I had said I was unconscious but that's what I meant). My brain was swollen so I guess that makes you act quite aggressive sometimes...

But ya, as far as I know I am completely back to normal... unfortunately that is somewhat impossible to know for sure when all I have is my own brain to base it on. Wrong. Texels and pixels are something very differents, and you are confusing the two right now.  
The only limit to screen resolution right now is the bandwidth of the frame buffer. And it can be VERY VERY high in modern graphic card. Look at stuff like Ati's Eye infinity. Displaying a 3240 * 1920 display is no problem at all for average gamer graphic cards.
On the other end, despite the much higher resolution, your game won't look prettier. One texel will be displayed on 2,3 pixels instead of 1.  
Because game pretyness and sharpeness is actually limited by the "power" of the graphic card, while resolution is just the suze of the matrix being filled, with not much impact on the complexity of the object you are handling.  
Resolution is quite easy to achieve. I bet most modern computer could run crysis at 10k if some setting were allowing it. 
The 1k fps game is very doubtfull. Most games have monothreaded physic engine that are bound to the fps, and we haven't made much progress in single threaded performance over the last few years. (Still stuck at around 3.2ghz). 
So even if the graphical part would be a 10k, a lot of these images would be identical because the game state would not have changed.   Would it, theoretically, be possible to be born with a brain where that function is not completely broken, but not functioning correctly either. For example, would it be possible to have a brain that thinks "k[" looks like a face, but not ":)"? This is called [akinetopsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akinetopsia). Subjective reports of people who suffer from this say that they might start pouring water into a glass and then suddenly notice that it's overflowing. Or they might look down a street and see a car far away and all of a sudden it is right in front of them. Such severe cases are extremely rare and there have only been a handful of documented cases.  If the observable universe were a sphere it is possible that we might find evidence of its origin because of residual heat signatures emitted during the big bang. This question has been asked several times, and a couple of great answers appear in the FAQ on the right-hand side. It is complicated, but there is the conscious and unconscious mind.  The unconscious stores nearly everything the sensors can transduce, sight sound etc.  there is a minimum threshold for the conscious to understand so you can actually think about it out loud.  Everything below the threshold is just in your unconscious.  For instance, a frame of a burger injected every 60 of a film, 1/60, you don't know is even there will get a statistically significant portion of any group mysteriously wanting or later thinking burger, never even having consciously perceived that burger frame.  So there's gotta be a point at which the tangential velocity, in relation to the distance, would be enough to pretty much sort of... fling you off the stairs. 

I put the lower bound at one earth radius and the upper bound at 9.9e12 meters.  Also besides biological limits, there is a fundamental physical limit slightly smaller than this that depending on the lens is a maximum resolution before light interference makes it impossible to distinguish separate points since the waves overlap I don't see why not. Have you heard of [synesthaesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia)? It's a similar idea. People experience something relating to one sense but it manifests as another. So, for example, people "see" music and smells as different colours, etc.

Really interesting. If you are talking about adaptation (stare at a spinning spiral and then look at your hand or somewhere else and things appear distorted), then this isn't directly related. 

Reports from the few people who have had this disorder describe it as people suddenly appearing in a room without seeing them move into the room. Or they might start pouring water into a glass and suddenly it would be overflowing. It is called [akinetopsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akinetopsia) and there is a description of a few cases on wiki. Yes this is well studied. Vision psychophysical experiments study what's called the "flicker fusion limit." This is basically the frequency at which flickers of light appear to be continuous. As you might imagine, the limit depends on the luminance and waveform of the stimulus. However for a purely sinusoidal modulation, the limit for rods is about 15 Hz and for cones it's about 60 Hz. 


Of course, if you make more complicated waveforms with inteemodulation, you can definitely perceive at a higher fps than that. Remember that only 1-2 photons are required to activate a photo receptor. If you activate them at different times, you can in principle achieve higher frame rates, kind of like using interlaced versus progressive scanning. That part is hypothetical though, so the only widely accepted "frame rate" is the flicker fusion limit. All others depend on too many variables for us to really say with certainty what the human eye can achieve.  Thank you for your submission!

Do both electrons get stolen or just one? I'm assuming both to avoid a radical right? The speed of light. You'll find out 8 mins later.  Thank you.  That was an excellent explanation. Would this be related to why faces of other races look the same? Is this ability to tell faces apart based on race hardwired into us or learnt? so would say a white guy growing up around asians have the same ability to tell them apart or would he struggle and that just be chalked up to a "bad memory"

 Do you have a source? Or is this just like your opinion  I'm sure you could theoretically count the number of rod and cone cells in each eye and the number may roughly equate to a pixel density... but it still wouldn't be a smooth conversion because your brain doesn't necessarily use all of the raw sensory data collected from these cells when images are "displayed" There's been several historical approaches to handling gravity quantum mechanically and the general consensus is that any effective spin-2 massless field theory is by default a theory of gravity (this is the position a lot of string theories take since they have such fields--therefore a lot of string theories are by default quantum theories of gravity--and there's some good theoretical justifications for this). In the Feynman lectures on Gravitation he derives Einstein's field equations from first assuming a quantum theory and deriving the classical result--in this interpretation, gravity acts on objects (and itself!) on flat-Minkowski spacetime (aka Special Relativity), the geometrical interpretation that spacetime is literally bending and changing from mass-energy distributions (stress-energy tensor) isn't brought up until late in the lecture. Feynman wasn't the only physicist to de-emphasize the geometrical interpretation in favor of a more particle centric viewpoint and Weinberg wrote a pretty good textbook formally enshrining this.

However, most physicists use the geometrical interpretation by default and textbooks like Wald and Misner-Wheeler-Thorne (lovingly nicknamed the black bible) and others start with the geometrical view from the get-go. There's some reason for this, the geometrical interpretation is quite beautiful mathematically and it's essentially a complete description of gravity. Most people know it is probably not the whole story and thus it's been a highly active area of research for decades and will remain so for decades to come.

Edit: To note, the derivation of spin-2 fields are often characterized by problems which prevents it from working in all the situations it should, such as in renormalization of say loop diagrams. Partially this is why they haven't caught on--as mentioned before string theories can attempt to solve this by introducing degrees of freedoms via "strings." So what does it say that looking at the multiple eyes and mouth faces upside down and sideways makes no difference to me? It's equally eyewatering. Full disclosure, I'm an artist if that matters. And, btw, I don't flip my images upside down -  I use a mirror or in the computer flip the canvas horizontally.  In General Relativity, the current best theory of gravity we have, the speed of gravity - the speed of the propagation of gravitational effects - is the same as the speed of light. Special Relativity holds that *c* is the maximum possible speed of any interaction in nature, applying to light, gravity and any other particles that do not have mass. http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/gravity/overview.php

The papers are linked within the story.  Interesting - learned something new today. It makes sense that new cracks could grow faster when exposed to water. Thank you for the link. What year/journal was that from?

Admittedly this is not my field, and all my experience with breaking glass is without water. From the FAQ: 
[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kjp6z/does_gravity_travel_at_the_speed_of_light_if_the/cbpmm9a). If you are still bored:

Find the R such that the circle's circumference divided by one day will give you a speed equal to Earth's escape velocity. Put simply, we see a tiny portion of the edge of an ever expanding ripple of light.

Just like the world looks flat to you, the wave of light coming out of a star, complex as it might have been coming off of its surface, has mixed together into a singular, averaged out, plane of light that we see a single point of due to the relative size of that ripple to the star that created it. Any star other than the sun will be something on the order of 40 million to 1 trillion times smaller than wave of light we see coming from it. Because they are so bright this means they appear to be infinitely small points.

In a sense we see it as a column of light waves approaching like this:

O | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | &gt;

You can imagine that each of those lines is a tiny portion of a larger circle that goes around the central circle.

As for the other question, there are cases where it might be possible to see 'events' reflecting off of objects perpendicular to our view of the star, though these will always be further in the past than the light we see coming from the star directly.

If you want example of this, draw a line between two points, A and B.

If you place another point C anywhere at all, then the path A-C-B will always be greater than or equal to the length of A-B. There is probably an infinite amount of energy in the universe.

However, don't confuse the scientific term "theory" with the popular usage of the word. In common parlance, "theory" is used to mean what scientists would refer to as a hypothesis: an idea which is proposed to explain various observed features of the natural world. 

A scientific theory is a framework of ideas and explanations which describe the mechanisms behind the behavior of the universe and which makes testable predictions about the universe. Big Bang cosmology is a theory because it's a comprehensive explanation of the state of the universe which has been incredibly well-tested, not because it's laden with uncertainty or anything like that. We can measure velocity, but only relative to other objects or points of reference. There is no way to measure an "absolute" speed. You can only measure how fast things are moving towards or away from other things. 

No matter where you're standing, when you look really, really far away, it always looks like you're stationary at the center of the universe and everything else is flying away from the stuff around you. He's referring to the observable universe, which has a finite size and therefore can be measured. The observable universe is only a subset, though, of the entire universe, which is likely infinite. He's right, relativistic mechanics suggest that the top speed for any propagating wave (gravity) is *c*. In principle, anything outside our Local Group.

In practice, galaxies also have a "peculiar velocity", which is their particular motion through space relative to the CMB rest frame. Our galaxy is traveling at a few hundred km/s in the direction of Virgo, for example. In the very nearby universe, it's very difficult to measure the Hubble Constant because the redshift due to expansion is so small compared to the galaxy's peculiar velocity. Most peculiar velocities are of order a few to several hundred km/s. Since the Hubble Constant is about 67 km/s/Mpc, you have to get to at least a few tens of megaparsecs before the Hubble Flow starts to dominate over the peculiar velocity. When people talk about destroying the world with nuclear weapons, what they really mean is destroying humanity. We've got plenty of capability to screw up the planet bad enough that *we* can't live on it anymore and we all die. But that's the equivalent of using a rag to wipe off the surface of a bowling ball. Life, if not humans, will survive, and the Earth will continue to rotate around the Sun. Until the Sun blows up. it's not an "engine" like a star, burning. It's a liquid core which is liquid because of residual heat left over from when the Earth was forming.

Asking can you restart a cooled core is like saying can you restart a wood fire that has burned out. Sure you can, if you add more fuel and more heat. But you'd need an absurd amount of heat and fuel to restart a core and at that point you're not really restarting it, you're making a new one. Can you define the eye's frame rate as the rate at which aliasing begins to occur? We can but

a) the universe is not expanding to or from anything. The Big Bang happened everywhere

b) Expansion of space doesn't happen within gravitationally bound clusters of objects like solar systems and galaxies. Gravity is much stronger than the expansion of space. IIRC, that's a disorder of the fusiform matrix (the part of the brain that connects details and movements to whole objects) Thank you for your submission!

If you disagree with this decision, please send a message to the moderators. Here is another way to consider this:

[The heat release of a hurricane is equivalent to a 10-megaton nuclear bomb exploding every 20 minutes.](http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2011/08/nuclear-bomb-hurricane) And as the planet itself goes hurricanes are insignificant.

Now I know that the energy of the hurricane is not directed down and atomic bombs are more focused and all that. This is just to give you a notion of the difference in scale involved.
 I can't say if this is exactly the same thing because I didn't get it diagnosed (beyond a scan to make sure I didn't have an aneurysm) and it was temporary, but for a while I was getting crazy migraine auras that were causing everything to look like stop motion animation in the mornings. I would walk, and things would kind of... update their positions. Really bizarre. Hierarchical hidden Markov models? I am paraphrasing but your brain analyzes data by sifting it through smaller and smaller holes by comparing and contrasting images it has seen before.  In the book "How to Create a Mind" by Rat Kurzweil, the author talks about how when presented with a picture of his wife's face with a mustache his brain quickly figures out that something is different out this particular image.  

Like this:

(Brain 'sees' mustached wife image)

Brain: "Something is wrong here. Let me go check to see if I've seen this before"

(Swiftly looks at every image it has ever seen of wife and finds no other image with mustache)

Again I am shooting from the hip with knowledge I kinda picked from a book that went way over my head. Lol.  

 Thanks for checking out our FAQ. :) Just curious, are saccades responsible for the times I'll realize I've just read some text in my surroundings somewhere, but have no idea where? And then after a minute of searching I can find the text that was stuck in my head for no apparent reason?

This happened to me earlier today at work. All of a sudden I had "TNT Blue" in my head, and didn't know where it came from, so after looking around I saw that it was the brand of nitrile gloves sitting a desk away. Did my eyes scan over this while "saccading" and take in the information without my realizing it? Moore's law won't go doubling forever, or even that much longer. Its already hitting its peak with Broadwell generation of chips. They can't seem to double. And the problems are expected to be worst when they get to 7nm. That makes sense, thanks.

Is there a galaxy, our local group, where we can point to and confidently say here is where are starting to see redshift due to expansion?

I'm trying to relate this to the original question, so if the universe started to collapse, I would guess that we would first notice it from the closest object where we could tease out a measurement of the Hubble Constant from its peculiar velocity. I don't know for sure, but from what I can gather reading this thread, it seems like the processing part can take in 1000 fps (or something roughly equivalent to that number) and all of that information is used to put together about 200fps in transmissions to the part of the brain that "sees" the image.

So, more like it's taking in information 1000 times a second, or more, but uses bunches of frames to create image signals 200 times a second.

Then again, I could be way off. Even after backing out of that page my eyes feel like they are still out of focus. Love the fact the guy build a valve-less pressure container.

He did however engineer it for hight pressure and test at a higher pressure than he'd be handling it at. To address the core of your question, apart from the invalidity of measuring the Earth's distance relative to the Big Bang (which isn't a real place), you CAN measure how far the Earth has gone but it always must be relative to something. The Sun, the galaxy, etc. I think of is as "resolution on demand" - a picture or movie needs to provide all the resolution up front for all of it, but looking at reality gives you the resolution for whichever part of the world that you care about. It get's the center of vision and focus, it gets saccades to get an even finer resolution than a single 'snapshot' of the eye can do, and so effectively we have the maximum resolution at all directions and ranges, combining the data from all the different eye positions. I want one, like on my desk or something. Just a few small corrections:

&gt;Neurons can fire in a millisecond, and up to 100Hz

Excuse me, the [occulomotor system](http://www.psy.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/schall/pdfs/TheSuperiorColliculusCh3.pdf) would like a word. These neurons can fire upwards of around 250-300 sp/s. (Figure 3.3, page 63)

&gt;So we know the first visual information may reach primary visual cortex from the eye in about 10-50 milliseconds.

[Median response in V1 is ~60 ms.](http://webvision.med.utah.edu/imageswv/Lats.jpg) In Einstein's field equations, the [stress-energy tensor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor) is the source of gravitational fields. This mathematical object describes the density and flux of momentum and energy which includes things like light as well as rocks. Speed of light isn't important here. You can religate it to the status of conversation factor and in natural units just set it to 1.

So,

* E = m

Or more completely,

* E^2 = m^2 + p^2

Where m is mass and p is momentum. The point is mass *is* energy and energy generates gravitational fields which themselves also have energy. You can even interpret GR and by extension gravity is the "sloshing" of energy from objects to fields. Cool. Thank you for the reply. If we could rewind the time, the entite universe would end up in the big bang. So why not that brief moment after the big bang is not the center of the universe?  Theorically speaking that brief moment in time and space is still part of this universe despite the lack of reference point to pinpoint it. This is a convention that is often imposed by teachers, but you are right that it is not mathematically necessary.

In fact, it is customary in many situations in math and physics to leave square roots in the denominator, despite what your teachers have insisted on your doing.
 &gt; shape and extents of the universe are still unknown

Eh. We have some pretty good evidence as well as theoretical justifications for a flat-infinite universe. Planck's high resolution imaging of the CMB restrict universe curvature to near zero--future experiments will most likely narrow the field of possible curvatures even more in the same way we have an experimental limit for the *possible* mass of the photon which we just take to be massless. I don't think so.  even some of the best RTGs only produce around 100W of power.  And then they are the size of a large microwave. &gt; If it's just a sphere, there is a center but we have no idea where that center is, and we likely never will due to the fact that the recession is speeding up!

Global spherical geometry doesn't have a center. Neither does a toroid I believe--but I'll need to double check that one. Can you point to the center of a balloon's surface? And don't say center of the balloon because that's not what global geometry refers to. Yes. The moon does act on geostationary satellites which need to compensate for it with thrusters. In fact it is that limited fuel with is generally the limiting factor in their service life. Ideally if we could create an engine that could create thrust without a propellent we could keep satellites in service for very long periods of time indeed. That might [not be totally sci-fi either](http://inhabitat.com/nasa-confirms-the-impossible-propellant-free-microwave-thruster-for-spacecraft-works/). I spent way too long seeing nothing but her roataing clockwise. For others who can't get it to work,  I finally saw her switch by closing my eyes and quickly opening them at random intervals,  taking a quick peek, until I saw two "frames" in the correct order and she instantly reversed... very cool... What does it say about me if the only direction I see her spinning in is counter-clockwise? It's very clear to me she's going that direction, and she never changes.  @Candiana is on the right track.
A fully mature cone can fire at about 1000 times per second, the human brain does a bunch of complicated things, etc. The average human being isn't going to be able to detect any differences in frame rates higher than 40fps, however certain cognitive tests have shown that people trained at certain tasks can detect changes at 200fps. The whole idea of frames per second at the perceptive level isn't really correct. &gt; That's a weird way of putting it

It's pretty common in statistics, a lot of quantities are referred to as "moments." At least my university statistics courses referred to them as such. Distant galaxies aren't moving away from us, rather the space between us and them is expanding. Would you mind to explain Faraday and Ampere's Laws in terms of special relativity? I can't find an answer on the internet. OK, this is probably going to sound unintuitive, but if you rewinded time, you'd see everything collapsing towards you. It would appear that you were at the center. The reason for this is that space is expanding uniformly everywhere. The reason for that is because the big bang happened everywhere at the same time, not at some single point. Oh, yes, because the quintillions of exciting years beforehand are completely worthless when there's an infinity ahead of nothing.

This argument is almost identical to "why live when you die eventually anyway?" What would be a safe way to share files with a stranger in a situation like that? Is there some sort of device or software that makes a USB port one-way? This is true, but other properties of the substance usually have a much-greater effect.

Most liquids have higher speeds of sound than most gases, most solids have higher speeds than most liquids. Even amongst solids, rigidity has a greater effect than density.

So, in a practical sense, it is *often* true that a more-dense substance will have a higher speed of sound than a less-dense substance. For example, steel &gt; water &gt; air. That makes sense. Thank you! Adding onto your comment, if you look at the N64, they countered this issue by developing an expansion slot for games that required more memory than was on board at launch (Majora's Mask).  
  
It could have been possible to pull off in the late 80's and early 90's, but it was most likely not cost effective to dump that much money into research when you could just develop a new console altogether. Wouldn't the planet's gravitational field be stronger as it's mass increases? Therefore it would start to alter the position of the sun? No harm going into chemistry, thanks a lot for your detailed explanation!  That is a really neat paper. Ooh I hadn't considered the fact that proteases may be in the enzyme mixture. Is it difficult to prevent proteases from ending up in your enzyme solutions? For example - if I buy a bottle of Lipase, should there really be any protease in there?  You'd slide through. The curve you follow if the moon is rotating and you don't hit the walls is a twisted ellipse. A simple ellipse if you're on the equator. The force is roughly 1/r. Its exactly 1/r if you ignore centripetal forces. It's occassionally used in things like embassy communications and such - it's safe from snooping even if you fear that NSA has broken the standard private/public key algorithms, as long as you keep a key safe.  If you know the recipient, then it's not so hard to ship a DVD full of proper random noise.  Even Kremlin-Whitehouse comms at one time used this concept with a pile of numbered paper pages for OTP encryption. I can't for the life of me remember where I saw this information and I will try my best to find the source but I believe the human eye can detect movement up to 25frames/s. Anything beyond that will appear to smudge or blend because its too fast for our brains to process (i.e. motion blur).  I'm a native English speaker too and thought the same thing, so after reading your comment I decided to try to translate the first paragraph:

&gt; The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Taleser en bok utgitt i 1985, skrevet avnevrologenOliver Sacks, som beskriver sykehistorien til noen av sine pasienter. Tittelen henspiller til en pasient medvisuell agnosi.[1]The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hater grunnlaget for en opera med samme navn avMichael Nyman, urframfrt i 1986.

Which I think would be this:

&gt;***The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales*** is a book published in 1985, written by a neurologer Oliver Sacks, who (somethings- relates? tells?) (histories or something) of his patients. The patients all have visual agnosi (which I don't know what it would be in English). *The Man WHo Mistook His Wife for a Hat* was made into an opera by the same name by Michael Nyman, produced in 1986.

And here's the actual text in English:

&gt; The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Talesis a 1985 book byneurologistOliver Sacksdescribing the case histories of some of his patients. The title of the book comes from thecase studyof a man withvisual agnosia.[1][pageneeded]The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hatbecame the basis of anopera of the same namebyMichael Nyman, which premiered in 1986.

Not bad, if I do say so myself! I'll admit I was kind of cheating since I had heard about the book earlier today in English for a small group exercise, so I knew roughly what it was about, but the accuracy was pretty good. I'll freely admit if the word 'opera' wasn't in the Norwegian version I would have been lost on the last sentence. I'm not sure if that is a viable method of transmission for a key logger but it has been shown that viruses can be stored on the configuration partition of a thumb drive, moved to the computer, and then potentially infect any usb device with on-board memory, which is a surprisingly large portion of modern USB devices. Sort of like a USB STD.. That's a fairly new technique though, he'd have to be a real l33t hax0r to pull that one off. "Nerd statistics?" Okay...  
  
Anyway the first video isn't YouTube's framerate, the video's that the gamer recorded is. If your graphics card/video chipset isn't powerful enough, you will see a loss in framerate while running a 3d application if you're attempting to use more VRAM by recording your entire screen. This loss of framerate shows up in the video.  
  
Sometimes you record the video and it sits at 30-60 fps just fine, but after passing it through a video editor or file converter with the incorrect rendering settings, you get lower framerates as a result. Somewhere between the raw video file and the final output after passing through youtube's codecs caused the final product to be choppy. The video player is playing at 30 fps still.  
  
So all in all, the video player isn't laggy at all. The guy just didn't produce his video to 100% quality. Usually conventions like this simplify something for students. Do you know why teachers insist on this rule? Is it related to the deal where if you raise kittens in a room where there are only vertical lines, they never develop the ability to discern horizontal lines, so when you put them on a table, they don't see the edge and just walk right off? Or something like that. Screw you AP psychology was over a decade ago! :P Stranger in question not only persistently insisted that I take some movie clip off his thumb drive, but also persistently insisted that I join his pilates class. My hax0r-dar broke on that. His USB drive had an extra memory card. I agree he could have explained that better, but the difference between infinite and irrational is pretty important to understand in mathematics. Quantized time would most likely be naturally coupled with quantized space as well. Also, there's some very interesting implications for the big bang and the concept of [action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics\)) in physics. We're not moving away from the centre of the big bang. There isn't one. Our local group of galaxies are moving away from other groups of galaxies. The big bang doesn't have edges we can see. Some suspect that some other type of geometry or re-connected-ness is going on. Others think the universe is a dodecahedron reconnected on offset facets. We don't know. From our perspective the edge of visible space is the same everywhere. None of it shows any edge-like things althrough there are hints that large masses could be far beyond visible space.

Our proper motion within our local group of galaxies isn't that big. We have motion around the sun, our rotation on the earth, rotation in the galaxy and the galaxy is in a local group. Beyond that its basically static space or what's commonly referred to as the co-moving frame. The comoving frame is the movement of all the motes of dust sitting in the expanding universe and floating in empty space far from any galaxies. We are moving relative to that frame but not by a lot. Most of our time dilation is probably just from being in a gravity well.

Edit: Its crucial to look at inflation before looking at the Hubble constant. We are moving away due to the inflation that occurred during the first 10-^32 seconds. Its not acceleration. Time is moving the same for distant galaxies. They were never accelerated relative to us. They inflated to higher velocities. Haha, well if he was really insistent on you copying that movie clip.. ehh that's like social engineering 101.

If it puts your mind at ease though, that configuration partition hack was only discovered in October or something I think, so it's unlikely that it was infected in that way. You don't really switch focus in 3D movies, since all the images are anyway projected and focused right on the screen, but they create the 3d/distance effect by providing a different picture for each eye, i.e. the angular differences. That causes a headache for some, as the "range detection by eye focus" becomes inconsistent with "range detection by binocular vision".

Or does some of the newer 3d tech actually deliver images at a different focal range? Thank you for your submission!

That book was tough.  Probably among the best scifi I've read in a long time.

 Well, a phone can run on half a watt and a small laptop on something like 5 watts. The power supplies can draw much more power to allow for quick charging, but the operating consuption is nowhere near 100w. I can tell you this, that as someone who grew up around CRT monitors, I was more sensitive to the refresh than most. At 50hz, most people could notice a subtle flicker of the screen, and few could see anything at 60. However, for me and a few others, anything under 70hz was annoying, and completely gone by 75hz. So, somewhere in there, depending on the human. Would this apply to sulfur hexafluoride as well? I'm referencing [this gif that shows its high relative density by floating an aluminum foil boat on it](http://imgur.com/EhkNIE8).  You mean console players? Imagine if you had a similar disorder but you couldn't see nipples or something.     Brain.Sensors.IO.Eyes.FormatException: Invalid input format for a FaceObject.
        at Brain.Sensors.IO.Eyes.ProcessFace(CodifiedVisualInput view) I may be wrong but isnt the face thing more of a problem with visual recognition rather than visual interpretation? making that an entire different subject? I have the sequel but I haven't read it yet. I'm engrossed in The Dresden Files right now. Those types of waves are generally still called sound waves, at least in the physics literature.

OP is asking a more fundamental question about whether there exists a limit to the speed of such mechanical waves. There is a part of the brain that is dedicated solely to face recognition, since there is it's vital from a evolution point of view to differentiate the face of your family members and your enemies in the human social group. It's just one of the system dedicated for visual processing. Read some where that grandmaster chess players have gain the ability  to use this system to recognized patterns on the chess board. They remember better which out come is the best for a specific pattern. This is very wired but makes sense.    It's not a bad habit to teach because when they eventually get to complex numbers they will have to conjugate the denominator to get rid of any imaginary portion. This is just my speculation and there's a distinct possibility that it's just one of those arbitrary things that teachers do. But it would be possible to melt charcoal? Admittedly, I've never heard of a liquid form of charcoal You are not describing time resolution. You are describing space resolution. You could set a camera with a shutter speed of 1 second and aim it at your monitor then wiggle the mouse at 60 hz and guess what? It would see individual separate cursors.

To see time resolution you need to distinguish whether two cursor positions happened at the same time or at different times. One way to test this would be a computer program that randomly either flashes two dots at the same time, or one in one frame and one the next. And ask you to tell which situation happened. So hypothetically if I could survive being thrown into the mantle, I could float around like it was the lazy river? I would recommend Steven Pinker's book [How the mind works](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_Mind_Works) lots of interesting information on how we process visual information, explained in a clear and interesting way. A low deer population causing wolves to starve. With lower wolf numbers deer aren't as hunted and their population increases. With an increase in deer population the wolf population makes a return and the cycle starts over. Coyotes have only been in SC for about 30yrs, they were illegally introduced and would actually seem more like an invasive species to me. Their population is on the rise and as a result deer population is down, just as it would be for wolves. So it seems more a case of replacing one predator for another though they will have slightly different affects on populations. Mesopredator release is more how lack of an apex predator leads to increase in middle predator populations (that were already there) and decreased numbers of small prey animals, thereby affecting vegetation and so on according to the wiki. Basically because the coyotes are there, and their population was already on the rise when Red Wolves effectively became extinct in SC it would be difficult to say it's a product of mesopredator release. If any of what I said was confusing or needs more clarification please let me know, what I'm trying to say doesn't always make it into words well. Thank you for your submission!

I thought it was the same effect. A calorie is a unit of work. The work required to perform a task should technically be the same for two humans (controlling for anatomic variation). That being said, the reason two people of different body types have a different reaction to the exact same exertion is due to efficiency. The body is a amazingly capable of adapting to the various stresses placed upon it. In the case you mentioned, someone who is fit should have a lower heart rate than the unfit person. This will occur for a few reasons, but they all come down to efficiency. (1) the heart muscle of a trained person becomes better at utilizing oxygen for energy than an untrained person. Also, depending on the type of training, a trained person's heart actually grows larger as well. This means that the volume of fluid ejected with each pump, something known as stroke volume, will increase. Thus a trained heart will utilize less energy for the same task. Also, studies have shown that changes in heart cell surface receptors will also make trained hearts more sensitive to adrenaline and noradrenaline. (2) the type of muscle fiber determines how energy is used. With enough training, some studies have shown individuals to have an increase in total mitochondrial mass. Mitochondria are essential for energy production during aerobic exercise. Therefore, a trained person will have more mitochondria, which also means they can utilize oxygen more efficiently (this is also part of the reason why people with more muscle mass have higher resting metabolic rates). 

So, all that being said, someone who is in better shape will probably burn more calories just because they can perform the task longer, or with more intensity. The task itself should be the same. I approached this question from a physiological perspective, I'd like to hear what a physicist has to say about this. 

 It can depend on type of file, but for most of those things don't have "waiting time" between two attempts. So cracking program just types one password candidate after another, same as you would do it manually but much faster.  I'd like to point out that the eye as an organ indeed works using very similar principles to a camera (including the aperture, image inversion, and light-sensing elements). Whatever happens to the electro-chemical signal after the light had been captured is not a part of the camera, but a part of the image interpretation system. Thank you for your submission!

Good questions. We would never be able to make a confident measurement of cosmic parameters from a single galaxy, especially not one so close as to be inside our Local Group. The Hubble Law is derived from statistics on large numbers of galaxies, and if the expansion of the universe started decelerating again, then we'd need to measure a lot of galaxies in all directions to be sure of that.

We might first notice a change in the velocities of nearby galaxies, but the trouble is that we'd not be sure whether this was due to a change in cosmic parameters or whether it was just due to the unseen influence of some distribution of dark matter in the local universe.  Thank you! Sorry for such a n00b question but I'm just scratching the surface of this area now! I remember a woman who had no "left" concept. She would draw a circle looking like a crescent moon and say "yes, totally 360 circle".
   
But now, not to be able to process a face, that's interesting. &gt; they eventually get to complex numbers

I really doubt that convention is there for complex numbers. 
Most people won't deal much with those. ok, so instead of a microwave to get the drag a lunch box around with you that's also weighs over 25Kg.  still not very useful.

small laptops use more that 5 W.  5 to 10W when **idle**.  under load they can easily reach over 50W or even more.  high end notebooks will consume over 100W It could be that it presents with "nicer" looking fractions where the denominator will be an integer number. To be pedantic, you can either have an Exception, or an Error, but 'exception error' is nonsensical. Me too.

I want one calibrated such that if I place it next to my laptop fan it will go into supercritical mode. 

He had to heat his some inconvenient way. Thanks, that's interesting. I meant to write "outside of our local group", but you covered that anyway.

Is the accepted value of the Hubble Constant determined through something like a trend line through a scatter plot, after distance and velocity have been measured? It's denser than air, for sure, but not water.  At 1 kg/L to sulfur hexafluoride's 6.17 g/L, water is over 160 times denser than SF6 The speed of light. But this often gives the impression that planets and stuff orbit where say, the sun *was* delayed by the speed of light. However that is not the case.

The earth for example, is not feeling the pull of gravity, in the direction towards where the sun was ~eight minutes ago, but where the sun is now. Thank you for your submission!

The wikipedia article. Even with anti-matter bombs which have a mass -&gt; energy efficiency of no less than 100% it would take 1.1 * 10^15 kg of matter and the same amount of anti matter. For comparison, the [67P comet that Rosetta was sent to](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko) weighs approximately 10^13 kg, so it would take 55 of such comets, and 55 comets made of anti matter to create such an explosion.


A cost estimate of anti-matter is [$62.5 trillion](http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/212_fall2003.web.dir/tyler_freeman/modern.htm), or $6.25 * 10^13 per kilogram. To make the 55 comets would take $6.875 * 10^28.

Even in $100 USD bills, this unimaginable stash of money weighs 6.875*10^23 kg ([at 1g per note](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar)), which is 11.5% of the mass of the Earth. 

So it's slightly less of a logistical nightmare than TNT.  Every year someone says that Moore law is about to be broken and somehow it keeps going.  Finite location as in just one location in just one moment in time. Imo a "moment" is really only a theoretically concept. Time and space are constructs that i think of as being "infinitely precise". There is no smallest amount of space or time, there never will be. Sure we can get a period of time to something arbitrarily small to our perspective, but to another perspective that could be the entire lifespan of the universe. That being said, when we say something exists in a single location, we're looking at a combination of where that something has existed over an arbitrarily small interval. I think the better question is though how can something truly be "point-like" if space is infinitely precise, it's impossible. It has to take up more space than 0 units, and if it takes up more space than zero units, it doesn't exist in a "single" location, it has dimensions. To our perspective, the area it occupies may be negligible, but if it exist then it has to exist than it has to take up more than a single unit of space because the idea of a unit itself is relative.

But wouldn't the immediate disappearance of sun indicate the earth would experience the effects right away? If not my question becomes if the change didn't reach us immediately does that mean space itself works as a medium for gravity to transmit through? 
Or is gravity bound by the speed of light also? Anytime I have warning (like in this thread), I squint to the max before hovering/clicking and the eye's accommodation takes care of it. Compensation complete. Commence visual signal... http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/this-thumbdrive-hacks-computers-badusb-exploit-makes-devices-turn-evil/

Never plug in USB devices from strangers into you pc/mac. Especially not when they are insisting. 

Ideally you wouldn't even plug in USB devices from people you know because they could unknowingly have an infected USB device. Even if you have plugged in your own USB device into someone else his system, you can't trust that device anymore. Practically this means that if you are really paranoid, then you can't really use USB devices for anything else than personal backup or peripherals that never get connected to another system than your own. I can remember someone I've only saw once and seeing them again like ten years later. It's crazy.  And I can vividly recall where I saw them and what was going on.  It takes a second, but if I focus briefly on the separation between the duplicates, I can resolve them into an object without constantly trying to decide if I've somehow crossed my eyes vertically.

At which point, I wondered: "I wonder if when she blinks, they're all in sync, if she'd blink in pairs, or in some other pattern." Gravity is bound by the speed of light. The speed of light is the speed of information, and the maximum speed of the universe (I.E nothing goes faster that *goes* in any sense of the word). Danish is even easier to read for English users. Norwegian "bokml" is basically a Danish dialect, but has undergone a spelling reform that Danish didn't. In Norwegian they spell words like they say them, so C's become S'es and endings like "-tion" becomes "-sjon" and so on, like "Information" is "Informasjon" as you get less "human" it doesn't screw with you as much, you don't have the same problem with a [close up of a spider](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1230/782312555_c9d1eeebe6.jpg) for instance, and as people have said above simply turning the images upside down "fixes" it for your brain (can't be arsed doing it but i did try turning my head upside down, does work) I have tried something similar but I can always guess the color. I tried using 3 different colors. Our immune system attacks the bacteria that bypasses layers of the intestine which they are not supposed to cross, thus keeping them in line.  What camera uses ultrasonic measurements? All that I know of use contrast or phase.  True, however I was replying to the post by /r/askachemicalengineer where the SF6 would be under supercritical-fluid pressure (if that term applies to this particular gas) Another cool think to think about - 
Pretend that the moon is totally hollow but still with a large mass. At some point your vector would not go directly through the center of mass, as tends to happen with the randomness of things. The angular momentum would cause you to basically go into an elliptical orbit inside the moon. Eventually this would probably become more circular.  Any decent hash function will not have such properties. The hashes for "passworc" and "password" will be completely different and there should be no measurable correleation between the distance between guessed password and correct password and the distance between guessed hash and correct hash.

Almost all comparisons will fail within the first few characters compared. And comparison is very fast, in the order of clock cycles per character, so that's a nanosecond timescale you're trying to measure. Even in the best of circumstances (brute force software running on the same machine doing the validation), measuring time differences in verficiation attempts is very tricky. In real-life applications, jitter of signal propagation time between validation machine and attacking machine will be orders of magnitude larger than the time difference you want to detect. Okay, its sometimes used for some old school embedded spy kind of stuff. But not like network communication or securing files. Its very rare that you will have a secure channel to communicate a key and then later have an insecure channel that you want to send some fixed small number of messages across. So rare that I think its reasonable to say that basically nobody ever uses one-time-pads.  [Link](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2dfdsy/15_free_ebooks_on_machine_learning/) to a handy archive with 10+ free ebooks on machine learning.

I glanced those, and they seemed to be pretty advanced, but maybe there's also stuff in there that can take *you* further. (I myself am also rather a beginner.) As I said, the mantle is *solid* material. It would probably give a bit if you hit it with a hammer - think a blacksmith forging a piece of hot metal. Asymmetric crypto is only needed to establish a session key. If you had a private channel to communicate your key for your one-time-pad then you could have just exchanged a reasonably sized key and used something sane like AES to encrypt your message. This is just as strong against NSA interference and you wouldn't need to agree ahead of time on the maximum length of all the messages you ever want to send in the future.  

Old school espionage is so far removed from modern crypto that it seems reasonable to me to ignore it.  I'm not sure if I'm normal or not, but 3-D movies just don't look right at all to me. Everything looks artificial and flattened, very narrow range of depth between object distances. It almost but not quite gives me a headache. That's a fantastic response. Thank you! So the earth would continue perfectly along its orbit for eight minutes before any change in its trajectory? Would it be like trying to identify people by their index fingers?

 Is it possible that Venus started off as a gas giant? And if that is the case is it possible Jupiter and Saturn accrued some of the material lost from Venus?  The trick that works for me is looking away but keeping it in my peripheral vision, and then sort of imagining the vague motion I see as rotation in one direction or the other, then moving my eyes back. At first I was "stuck" for quite a while in one direction or another, but after a few minutes of "[woooaaahh duuude](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2UsIouIAk-c/Uiv_k9kuSlI/AAAAAAAAAR4/h3N-FIeyjKk/s1600/lrr_dude.gif)" I got the hang of switching it around more or less at will. Would that be possible because the heat signatures would be slightly warmer on one side than the other as unless we are in the exact center of the finite universe?  Let's focus only on the retina and forget about visual cortex processing. Assume you've taken an average healthy human eye, rigged it into a life support system specifically designed to keep the eye functioning, and connected the optic nerve to a neural interface.  
What would the resolution of the live retinal image be? I'm sure there's going to be some economy of scale effect if we start producing so much anti-matter :) The pressure is probably so low that the atmospheric molecules are too far apart to interact with each other. It depends, there is a graph which has two variables temporal summation (fps) and spatial summation (size of object).

Long story short, your eye can follow different sized objects at different frames per a second. When you can no longer follow them, you may notice reverse motion. Look at the rims on sports cars when they're going really fast. (The rims appear to be spinning backwards) Yes.  This would probably depend on how human like the alien is. While I don't know how similar they have to be for this effect to occur it's clear that if it looked like a spider this effect wouldn't occur. What are you seeing there, that I'm not seeing? What effect is the zebra striped area supposed to produce?  As I tried to explain by way of vapour tube, it makes *more sense* to me that the d-d transition is emitting a specific band to produce a distinct colour, in the same way vapour tubes do. It makes *less sense* that the d-d transition absorbs everything. It is a single transition (mostly, I know it's actually from 2 or 3 low states to 3 or 2 high states, depending on high-spin/low-spin, field strength, etc). Whenever I stay awake longer than about 6 days (which happens more than I like) everything starts looking like that. In particular regularly spaced patterns of small objects like dots seem to dance around whilst at the same time remaining totally still...its difficult to describe unless you've tried it yourself. Which I do not recommend. Is this why people can see strange effects when they purposefully hold their eyes still like when staring? There aren't any ways to do what you're describing without the use of highly inaccessible equipment.  In the context of frame rates, people are talking about the perception of animated motion which is inherently both spatial and temporal.  My example is not meant to be taken as evidence of extreme temporal resolution of the eye, or even anything to do with the eye itself, but rather as a disproof of commonly touted frame rates being some sort of catch-all physical upper limit.  The fact that it's a byproduct of the discrete nature of the samples (frames) rather than the how the eye processes information doesn't change that. Gravity follows the law. If you somehow managed to not follow it, then you would violate several conservation laws.  It's supposed to be a visual representation of how it feels to have a migraine. It is not the most accurate depiction but it does have a familiar feeling to it. I cannot really look at it to long without flinching.  No, because different parts of the brain are used when looking at faces. Apparently ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15312646])
"findings indicate that face recognition and greeble recognition rely on separate mechanisms". 

What's a greeble? Anything but a face. Simple. Bring it to a planet with much higher gravity than Earth. Or bring an object from the top of the mountain to sea level, although the difference is hardly discernible.

But if you're talking about mass, it's an entirely different thing. 1. You're right, the effect is only obvious on large scales. 

2. Even on large scales, you don't get cyclones commonly forming near the equator because the effect is extremely weak and gets stronger the further you get from the equator. 

The fact that they only let the water settle down in the first demo makes me convinced they're inducing some motion in the water during the pouring or removing phase.  Take a cm ruler and an inch ruler. The tick marks of one ruler has a different distance than those of the other. Yet both rulers represent just the concept of distance, which could stretch out forever instead of ending where the rulers end.

Space itself expands (a cm slowly becomes an inch). What you're imagining instead is that the rulers grow longer, but that's not what happens. So, like gravitational potential energy, the energy within an atom is essentially stored in a default 'resting' state? (for want of a better phrase) Right I've heard him say multiple times that all of the universe we see today was once " smaller than the size of a pin, about the size of one atom" and has been expanding ever since. Because we don't see the "pixels" of our own eye (i.e. the rods and cones) we can say that the image processing part of the system (i.e. the brain resolves those issues. Like the optical low pass filter in a digital camera smoothes out areas of contrast to avoid moire. One measure of a lens's resolution is MTF or modular transfer frequency. What this boils down to is the density of line pairs that can be resolved by the lens and when the circle of confusion renders line pairs indistinguishable. 

So the resolution of the eye should not be thought of in terms of pixel density like a camera or screen but understood as limited by the physical properties of the lens: the diameter of the aperture (pupil) and the focal length.

This is discussed at length [here](http://www.clarkvision.com/imagedetail/eye-resolution.html) It depends on the distance, you already can't differentiate 720p from 1080p at a distance of 17 feet on a 50 inch display.

http://i.imgur.com/ir7M1Nb.png

A 30 inch display at 20 inches viewing distance will only need an approximate resolution of 4400 x 2500 to match your eye capabilities.
 I have had this experience personally, it's like the moving thing doesn't exist at all. It disappears from your model of the world while it is moving. However if you look closely where the object should be you can see it sitting there, so almost like frame by frame as you suggested. It's strange to know your brain just isn't processing it, so strange that I had a panic attack at the time of the episode. After getting some sleep I was fine and could see motion regularly again.   Or put it in or on anything that's accelerating upward, such as a rocket or elevator. The only realistic way is electromagnetism. Be advised however, that if you're trying to 'invent' a set of barbells that adjust their weight it won't be quite that easy. The strength of the magnetism falls off with the square of the distance .. Meaning they'd need to be super powerful and super quick to adjust.  Thank you. I had actually often wondered this as well. Check the askscience FAQ or search bar. That's originally how the Hubble Parameter (since it does change over time, that's a slightly more accurate name for it) was measured, although that's a very error-prone way to do it because measuring distances of extragalactic objects is notoriously difficult. Due to a misunderstanding about the populations of Cepheid variables that he was using, Hubble originally got a value of H that was about an order of magnitude too large!

In modern astronomy, we use two main techniques for determining the Hubble constant. The first is basically the trend line method (though it's more complicated than just a line, like most things in cosmology), but done with Type Ia supernovae, which can be calibrated as standard candles. The second, and likely more accurate, is deriving it from high-precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background. H*_0_* is [determined by the energy density of the various components of the universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law#Derivation_of_the_Hubble_parameter) (matter, radiation, dark energy, and any spatial curvature that the universe may have), and we can measure those densities from observing the CMB. The Planck space telescope is the latest instrument (after COBE and WMAP) to give us an accurate map of the CMB and thereby revise the value of H*_0_*.  If motion is only handled at the object-recognition level, then what explains motion after images such as when you walk on a trail for an hour then stop suddenly and there is an illusion that everything is sliding forward, or when you spin around ten times then stop and it looks like the whole world is spinning - these happen regardless of there being things you can recognize and it's based on regions of the visual field rather than content? How does this work with finate speed signal propagation? Shouldn't that mean that forces aren't always exactly opposite to each other? Yes, but there is a refined and more general version of Newton's third law: it's just conservation of momentum.

So, what happens is that a certain amount of momentum is transferred to the field that mediates the interaction between objects. So, Newton's third law is not correct, but momentum is still conserved. &gt; The eye moves a little all the time in what are called saccades the information from which is fused in Transsaccadic memory to form the "pictures" we perceive of the world we see.

It's like the Google self driving car sensor. Instead of multiple cameras pointing in all directions, there's a camera (well multiple probably, and other sensors) pointing in one direction that rotates around to scan everything. &gt; half 

Not 1/sqrt(2)?
 So, Newton's third law can be violated without violation of conservation laws. You may have more cones than average. Out of curiosity, are you female? Some women [may experience a much higher range of color spectrum due to having an extra type of cone](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy).  
  
I envy their visual experience. I feel old, to live in a time when it makes sense to tell computer-savvy people _who_ John Carmack even is, and not even tying his name to game development anymore ;-) We'd only need that resolution if we were covering our whole field of view. A computer screen doesn't take up our whole field of view. Yep. I see. 500km/s/Mpc sounds like it would have been an exciting universe, for a short time at least.

Appreciate your time, and I didn't mean sound like I was implying anything about this is simple.  100% male here. I will try it again today and will see how the experiment turns out!

I do know for a fact that my eyes have a much higher resolution (non-science speak). I can easily see and read things most people can't. Thank you for your submission!

I did cringe at my oversimplification. Wouldn't accelerating it be the easiest way? The charger generates an oscillating magnetic field which affects a metal coil in the device to be charged. A changing magnetic field in a conductor generates an electric current through the process of electromagnetic induction and this electric current is used to charge the battery.

The fundamental process behind wireless charging is the same process used in, for example, induction cooking (the induced electric current in the pan is turned into heat) or wireless smartcards / NFC (the reader uses induction to power a tiny chip in the smartcard which can then send back data).

This process was studied in detail by Nikola Tesla and is part of the well-known Tesla Coil.

For more info, see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonant_inductive_coupling I'm not sure where you have gotten your assumption from, but it contradicts what many scientists (including Steven Hawking) believe in that [Entropy is not time-reversible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time#Overview) and so in a universe where time is reversed, entropy increases which leads to really weird stuff like sound waves hitting a broken glass jar, "uncracking" it and sending it upwards.  When you slide a box across a table, you give the box kinetic energy. This happens when you accelerate the box from rest to some constant sliding velocity. Afterwards, you still need to keep pushing the box to keep the sliding going, because you're working against the friction between the box and the table (and to a much smaller extent, friction of the air).

But this process doesn't increase the kinetic energy of the box any further. Instead, the energy expended here is turned into heat, which is generated at the contact area between the table and the box. This is why some things get hot when you rub them against eachother, a large amount of friction has to be overcome for the rubbing and this generates a large amount of heat.

Once you let the box go, friction will slow the box down and turn its remaining kinetic energy into heat. Depending on how smooth the table is and on the velocity of the box, this can happen over a few mm or a few meters (or past the edge of the table). In nature they can't really get past 5mm and the main factor at play is gravity. In a zero G environment water is held together by surface tension in arbitrarily large sizes unless something acts on it.

Here are some water "drops" as big as your hand (0.8 liters)

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQ7qGilqZE They sever the data+ and data- pins on the computer side, not the USB drive itself. There are many many examples of organisms of all sizes from viruses, bacteria, up to sharks and crocodiles that are well suited to their environments and for which little pressures to change have been applied.

In these populations random mutations will still happen but unless they are advantageous they tend to just die out. I once forgot password to my PC and some IT guy botted from CD and it showed every account on PC and what password it has. How does this work?  This conveniently omits the problems engineering has caused with its unintended consequences which can be quite numerous. It's not fully proven but it's suspected that's behind the increasing incidence of my own autoimmune disease.

It's also important to think of the multiple million or billion functions which work properly in multicellular organisms and self-regulate or self-correct properly the vast majority of the time with perhaps minor exceptions.

That's all I'm trying to point out. In addition, it's a component of some of the most powerful known [rocket fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_rocket_propellants#Bipropellants) (beryllium-hydrogen-oxygen tripropellant).

&gt;Based on theoretical specific impulse, beryllium is the most attractive metal additive in tripropellant systems. Comparing the specific impulse of the bipropellant at its optimum ratio of oxidizer to total fuel O/F with that of the tripropellant at its optimum O/F, we find that increments of 69.2, 34.4, and 13.5 sec are theoretically achievable when beryllium is added to H2/O2, N2H4/N204,and RP-1/O2, respectively. Beryllium addition can also increase the density of the bipropellant systems. However, because of its toxicity, there is opposition to the use of beryllium as a rocket fuel. 

http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19860018652.pdf

Some SDI proposals would have used BeH2 fuel for space-based interceptor rockets,

&gt;WASHINGTON  The Pentagon is testing beryllium, a highly toxic substance linked to cancer and lung disease, as a fuel for space-based interceptor missiles that would be deployed under the "Star Wars" missile defense program.

&gt;Although beryllium previously has been rejected as a rocket fuel, partly because of health concerns, military officials said its use in Star Wars would pose fewer risks because the interceptor missiles would be fired in space after being carried into orbit by other rockets.

&gt;Even so, critics contend that the new fuel would pose a serious health hazard if one of the ground launches fails, causing the interceptor missiles to explode and releasing a poisonous cloud of beryllium oxide above the launch site. 

http://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-25/local/me-749_1_beryllium-star-wars-interceptor There two way to observe inner structure of Earth I know of. First way is to observe seismic waves. Just from the arrival times at various stations around the Earth and basic geometric optics you can figure out from what layers the waves reflected. With enough data and powerful computer it can even make relatively detailed 3d images, thats called seismic tomography. The other way is to observe changes in geomagnetic field. That's bit more complicated but the basic principle is the same. External magnetic fields have effect on Earth's magnetic field which depends on its inner structure. Whoah, dude. I always wondered how the pupil dilated and now it makes sense. Up close it looks more like an oriface covered by a lense, such as an anus, that can open and close. Very cool. I think, if I understand correctly, part of the damaging aspects of loud sounds is the amount of "energy" in the sound. Just because you can't perceive it doesn't meant the energy isn't there, so it is likely a higher or lower frequency than "hearing range" could still damage your hearing. Non-scientist here.

Because metal is a *much* better conductor of heat. Your hand is (usually) warmer than the ambient temperature, therefore the metal is cooler (let's say by 15 degrees C). Since metal is a great conductor and energy, heat in this case, flows from high energy/density to low the heat in your hand readily flows into the metal thus your skin becomes rapidly cooler and you experience a cold feeling.

Wood on the other hand is a *terrible* conductor of just about everything, heat included. So when you touch wood at the same temperature the heat in your hand can't really go anywhere, so it just sits there and you don't feel a cold sensation. 

99% sure that's right but there's probably some science words that can be thrown in to make it sound more intelligent! This is a [nice little movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-yhtXAzYwc) showing the second example together with cues that makes it possible to see each direction at the same time.

I've seen different examples of this illusion before, but this one was unusually hard for me to get to rotate the other way. Could it be cause because the implied perspective of this sample make her appear quite off-balance when rotating the other way around  ? For me, the other way it the right pane. The other samples I've seen have been 'straight on', without any implied perspective, and because of that without any sort of off-balance / perspective distorting movements. Muscles don't really have attachments like that.  Tendons are what your looking for there.  I have no idea what they would do when using something artificial.  For bone graft though I know they cut the bone under the insertion into, typically, a dowel or block, which has a hole cut in the replacement that it fits in.  Once enough time has passed the bone growth with reattach the tendon naturally.  A bone graft like the one I have described becomes your bone over time.  Like DNA and everything.

Muscles more or less just sit around the bone. &gt;There's been several historical approaches to handling gravity quantum mechanically and the general consensus is that any effective spin-2 massless field theory is by default a theory of gravity

It's better than that. There's exactly one massless spin-2 theory (which is local, 4D, ghost-free, etc.) and that is nothing other than general relativity. This makes sense now. Thanks for the reply!  I think this video about the work of Bach-y-Rita on neuroplasticity can give us some answers. The video is about a device that lets the blind see with their tongues and demistify some common assumptions we made in our representational way to understand the visual phenomenon. 

http://youtu.be/7s1VAVcM8s8 When you say without input from the ears, are you discounting the entire auditory system? It is possible to bypass the air conduction stage of hearing via the use of a bone conduction transducer. This allows sound to reach the inner ear via the bones of the skull rather than through the tympanic membrane (eardrum), the ossicles and the auditory canal. As for actually tricking the brain into hearing music, I'm not so sure. That sounds plausible. The sound is still being emitted and reaching our ears we are just unable to change that into a sound our brain can distinguish. I agree with you. Also, populations without (or with fewer) environmental pressures become more diverse - small mutations occur that are neither advantageous nor disadvantageous, so both forms persist. I think I just got it. There are like a thousand child comments here and I haven't seen a simple enough explanation yet, but this makes sense:

~5000 years ago was the "MRCA". At some point between him and you (and everyone else), one of your ancestors had a child with one of his ancestors, making you one of his descendants.

For example, say your mother did not descend from the "MRCA", but your father did. You would be considered a descendant of the "MRCA". Of course, this probably happened long ago and over a long period of time. The point is, as you trace your lineage back from generation to generation, at least one half of one of those generations (man/woman) was a descendant of "MRCA", making each subsequent generation a descendant. Yeah, but that's a pretty small effect, even for Jupiter. It is currently thought that both us (anatomically modern humans  or Homo sapians) and neanderthals evolved from a close common ancestor. The fact that they could breed isn't actually that astonishing. The 2 species of African elephant manage it so well that most people think that there are only one. 

As for where they lived... someone else can take point from here.

I'd suggest searching r/documentaries for free things to watch . The BBC have produced several excellent documentaries as well and they're now on youtube.  I figured too that with that much magnetism around electronics and all sorts of gizmos would burn up. Pace makers even.

It was a fun idea and definitely one with money in it, but just a bit too Jetsons I suppose. And the lastest copy of National Geographic talks about neanderthal art and possible culture, if you can find a copy. Technically (assuming the hypothesis is correct), I believe it does mean we all "came from the same person". It's just a matter of how far back in our lineage each of us joined that person's lineage. For example, my mother was not at all related to him, but my father is his descendant. Maybe for you it was one of your grandparents. More likely, considering the hypothesis is that **everyone alive today** is his (her? or did they say it was a man?) descendant, this happened hundreds, if not a thousand, years ago.

Your mother isn't a descendant of your father's father, nor your father of your mother's father (or mother, in either case), but you are a descendant of all 4 of those people. And out of those 4, one of their parents was a descendant of that one person a few thousand years ago. A solid sphere has a center.  (e.g. the earth has a center).  A surface sphere does not, as you said.  I was thinking of a solid sphere.  A surface sphere would have a center, but there would be nothing there (not even empty space), just like the toroid.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus#Geometry

So once again, it poses the question, are we on the surface of the sphere, or does the universe lie inside the sphere?

Edit: The center of a surface sphere exists in a higher dimenaion, but it does exist by definition.  No center, no constant radius, no sphere. basically the same as you looking at chimpansee faces. they all look the same to you, but human faces all look wildy different. in fact, chimpansee faces differ just as much objectively speaking. it's just that you're not wired to see it as well. someone with very specific brain damage would also not be able to recognise faces anymore. slightly more specific damage and and looking at faces could become...

 Depending on the sand type you can make structures of it as well with the help of water, for example sand castles on a beach. The important part here is water acting as a glue between the clay/sand particles due to capillary forces. Since the grain size is much smaller for clay it is also "easier" for water to glue them together.

More general descrition of capillary forces between particles:

 No.

You would feel no gravitational pull whatsoever if you were inside a perfect sphere.

http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mechanics/sphshell2.html &gt;  The 1k fps game is very doubtfull. Most games have monothreaded physic engine that are bound to the fps, and we haven't made much progress in single threaded performance over the last few years.

You could simulate things in 60 fps and then extrapolate in quaternions for in-between frames. That writeup mentions the oft-quoted mythical fighter pilot test but gives no source.

The Wikipedia articles source all their claims, but the reddit amalgamation and the forum "sources" don't actually give any credible information.

A much better explanation to the limits of human eye "frame rate" would be its [absolute threshold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_threshold#Vision). It appears that over half the test subjects were able to detect 1ms stimulus, which would translate to that reddit writeup's mythical "1000fps", even though it doesn't take into account what *kind* of stimulus was measured. I can focus on them perfectly. Does that mean anything? It would look like you were in the middle of empty space. You would see the same stars you see from Earth, bright points for the planets, and the Sun, which would be noticeably dimmer than from Earth. You may be able to see some asteroids, but they would be so far away that you couldn't tell them apart from stars. To produce the same perceived soundlevel, speakers use considerably more power, since they deliver their sound in a rather ineffective way by spreading it all around. A lot of the power used is wasted on soundwaves that will not enter the users ears. Earphones on the other hand, are directly in the ear, which means that very little sound is "leaked".

So to produce the same perceived sound level, earphones are more efficient. You cannot change mass by acceleration. Only the momentum changes differently due to relativistic effects. &gt;con**v**er**s**ation factor

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* Looking at it macroscopically the material goes from a solid directly to gas without passing through a liquid state. The easiest I believe is to look at a phase diagram of a material. The two main things you can change for a system is the pressure and the temperature so a phase diagram has these two variables on the axis while it plots the type of phase (solid, liquid, gas, etc).

http://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/images/research_education/equilibria/h2o_phase_diagram_-_color.v2.jpg

From easier materials such as water there is a phase line (certain temperature/pressure relation) between liquid and solid where both can coexist, like ice blocks in a river sort of. If you follow this line down you will reach the so called triple state where ice, water and vapour can coexist. If you decrease the pressure/temperature more following the line you're in the sublimation region where the solid goes straight to gas.

In real life this is more complicated since there is not just one solid phase for water for example and you seldom have pure water etc. How the hell scientists could measure that "quantization"? Isn't it beyond our capacity?

I mean we perceive time as a continuous incremental phenomenon, and I don't get how could we overtake this perception of time even if we develop the tools to measure it's an illusion. Scientist here, and your answer is spot on. The difference in thermal conductivity is what causes the different sensations. This is also why metal can very easily feel very hot (for example a metal object left in the sun) compared to other materials. This article in [Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-babies-ex/) has a pretty good overview; the answer is not really. If you could make the striped area move around while smashing a quadrant of your head with a hammer repeatedly and amplify the tiniest noises through 18" subs duct taped to your ears... then it might be a little more accurate :) Sir. By definition a black hole sucks all the light towards it and everything between his center and its perimeter is sucked at the speed of light towards its singularity. That being said, anything sent inside the blackhole can never come out as nothing can travel faster than the speed of light to escape the gravitational pull at its perimeter. &gt; Or is the time spent liquid phase so minute that it's written off as negligible?

This. It is nearly impossible to "melt" a large amount of carbon-dioxide (or iodine) all at once. It passes too quickly from the solid state to the gas state; the liquid state is not observable under normal circumstances.

Of course, if you put dry ice into a very strong boiling tube and seal it, the increasing pressure from the building gas will allow liquid CO2 to form (assuming that tube is strong enough to handle the pressure). You can't and neither can you for resolution, the right question is how high those two must be so the eyes don't distinguish them anymore from real life. But the answer is not the same for everyone, since visual capability varies a lot. Getting oil out of the ground in large quantities is far easier in Saudi Arabia than it is in the US and this is reflected in the costs (this for the largest part due to the geology and not because of political or economic reasons). Saudi operations will have a much lower cost per barrel than US operations. Especially the recent shale oil operations are anything but cheap.

Especially with the current low market price for oil, shale oil operations are facing troubles breaking even. So it's more economical to import most of the oil than to harvest it locally. Of course, politics can decide to ban or restrict oil imports to promote local extraction, but such a decission would cripple the economy.

Finally, countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait continue selling oil simply because their economies are so dependent on it. They don't really have the choice to dramatically dial down their exports. This may cause a problem in the long run when reserves run out and the country hasn't steered its economy away from oil. Dubai is an example of the opposite, the country became rich thanks to oil, but is now trying to transform into a country focused on international business and tourism, so they can remain relevant after the oil age ends. To contribute with the question, and perhaps create a spark for discussion, I saw today a clipping were scientist discovered a planetary system at 117 light-years away from Earth. The estimated age of this system is 11,2 billion years - which indicates that it was an early bloomer from the beggining of the universe. If life had conditions to occur on this planets and took the same time as it took on ours, our neightbor civilization would have 4,5 billion years of existence (discounting only 200 thousand years from our existence - the modern looking human age). Would it be possible to accumulate 4,5 billion years of data and intel generated by a society? You are making assertions that the scientific community has not reached a concensus on.  There are credible hypotheses that posit mass-carrying particles as the candidate for dark matter.  

There are also a number of models and observational data that demonstrate and illustrate dark matter having a granular distribution, both within galaxies and within galactic clusters.  Just try googling "dark matter distribution", for example.

Finally, are you familiar with the mathematics of Newtonian gravity?  If so, and if you understand the data behind galactic velocity curves and galactic cluster dynamics, you would understand that in order for dark matter to provoke such dynamics, it must clump up inside the orbital trajectories of the observable matter.  In fact, dark matter density can be inferred by the velocity curves of visible matter in such structures once the effect of the visible matter is subtracted out.  Therefore, the characteristic or scale size of dark matter "clumpiness" appears to be on the order of galactic scales. 

As far as I know, however, dark matter does not seem to have appreciable affect on solar system dynamics, which suggests that it is more diffusely distributed than a typical solar system. Some people distinguish between R and r, and then the squares of each of these, but basically, R is the correlation coefficient, which can go from -1 (perfectly anti-correlated) to 1 (perfectly correlated). R^2 goes from 0 (knowing a value X does not help you predict Y) to 1 (knowing a value X helps you predict Y with certainty). I've used slightly different wording that sometimes goes with the flavor of the interpretation but clearly both are very similar. R^2 is often used because it is related to the unexplained variance of a model fit, which is arguably the more "natural" quantity. From a physics point of view the amount of energy in a photon is not the same as heat, heat is transferred as vibration/rotation of molecules. To initiate this type of motion one needs light of a certain colour, this colour is red (infra-red). So we would experience a red light as warmer because it sets off heat-motion in our bodies molecules. 

This is why a hot plate on the stove turns red if left on and not blue. Thank you for your submission!

I imagine it has to do with moisture and sugar contents. Soft cookies, like sugar and chocolate chip, have high sugar and moisture content, more so than the air around them, and so as they lose moisture to the air they become harder. Hard cookies like biscotti have low sugar and moisture and also have greater pockets of empty space, where air had been trapped and then when baked it escaped, and so then afterwards air and moisture enters back into the areas and thus the cookies become softer? It's important to remember that the eyes are intrinsically connected to the brain. What the eye physically sees is electrical impulses from retinal cells. It's the processing that gets you to seeing anything.

There's such a thing as hysterical blindness where your brain stops processing image information. Your eyes work perfectly (studies show that you'll follow a $100 bill with your eyes) but you're blind. Yes, and thus the satellite needs to undertake maneuvers using thruster burns to maintain their orbit, which is called [station keeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_station-keeping#Station-keeping_in_geostationary_orbit).

In general, gravitational effects of the Sun and Moon cause changes in the orbit's inclination, which must be compensated for by thrusting in a direction perpendicular to the satellite's orbit, while the effect of solar radiation pressure must be compensated for by thrusting tangentially so as to maintain the eccentricity of the orbit.

See http://www.satsig.net/satellite/inclined-orbit-operation.htm for some more brief info including what ground antennas have to do to maintain signal with satellites that are running out of fuel. I wouldn't mind doing some sort of poll on a big forum one day just to see if people are more likely to initially see one spin than the other. I can see either in this gif with some effort, but I have to admit the counter-clockwise spin always looked a bit off, like she's leaning out at an awkward angle that makes her look like she's about to topple over. Also something about the direction her lower foot is pointing doesn't seem to work with her hips.

But maybe there are people out there that think the same about the clockwise spin. I was thinking something along the lines of an in-brain MP3 player, something that could be volume-adjustable, have the normal qualities of music and not just song-thinking (e.g., humming), without the risk of irritating other people with the noise. Nope. 

A building isn't airtight, so the air pressure inside would be equal to the air pressure outside. Unless the building is either a) a massive chamber or b) at a higher altitude than the place where you measured pressure outside then there wouldn't be any difference in air pressure.  2 main sources of info:

Several processes have brought geological materials from the mantle to the surface (Obduction of ophiolitic complexes, mantle xenoliths in kimberlites and other deep-seated magmatism). These provide us with a well documented collection of the rock types present down to about the middle mantle. Ophiolitic complexes in particular are huge, mountain range sized chunks of the upper mantle and ocean floor thrust upon the continental crust - plenty of data from there (lookup the Oman, Thetford Mines and Cyprus ophiolites for more info). Xenoliths are just boulders picked up by magma as they travel upwards. Some of the weirder intrusive rocks (kimberlites for example) are sourced at considerable depth with the mantle and carried samples of the surrounding material picked up along the way.

Geophysics, especially seismic methods, but also gravimetry and others, give us data on the density, the physical properties and structure of the inner Earth. In particular, seismic highlights boundaries where abrupt chnges occur in physical properties. 

Also worth noting that we know the mass of the Earth and have a pretty good idea of the composition (and relative density) of materials all the way down to the middle mantle (remember those ophiolites ans xenoliths?). Simple substraction allows us to constrain the density requirements of the remaining lower mantle and core. AutoModerator does that sometimes. It's automatic based on keywords, which is why your post was removed. 

It's approved now. Is this like the discolight effect then? When light flashes in intervalls and you only see "keyframes" of people? To clarify, DNA doesn't only code for proteins. There's non-coding DNA and it can also code for miRNA as well. The complexity lies in the combination of proteins expressed and cellular responses as well as the regulation of gene expression. The structure and composition of proteins give rise to their function and the sum of all the functions of all the various proteins you express more or less helps create your body. There is a nice visual interpretation of this.  Instead of a single ball on a ramp, imagine a large number of balls, initially all suspended at the same point, but each traveling on its own straight wire extending outward and downward in various directions at various angles.

Now let all of the balls begin to slide on their (frictionless) wires at the same time.  The ball on the wire hanging "straight down" will fall the fastest, and the balls on the wires extending out at very shallow angles will fall much more slowly.  The net effect is that all of the balls will form a "surface" in the shape of an expanding sphere, increasing in radius but always remaining tangent to the original point from which all of the balls started.
 Could you please explain what a "hashed password" is? A friend of mine has this to some degree.  He had a really interesting description:  imagine everyone wears a tie-dye shirt, and that everyone else can recognise the patterns instantly and instinctively.  He doesn't - he has to actively memorise the patterns.  That's what faces are like to him - unique, but not immediately, instinctively identifiable. Pilots are trained to sweep their eyes across various ranges rather than glance for this reason. Furthermore, if the hot plate were heated further, it would begin to emit higher frequencies of light, but these are in addition to the lower frequencies it is already emitting. So when it is hot enough to emit green light, it appears yellow (red + green), and when it is emitting light at the top end of the visual part of the electromagnetic spectrum (that is, blue light), it appears white as it is then emitting all frequencies of visible light. I can't remember where I read it but the US military was testing this by training pilots to identify a jet each time it popped on the screen. One pilot was able to identify a MIG fighter jet at a 200th of a second. So it most likely does not apply to everyone, but as of now it is possible to see up to 200fps and know the difference.

It make me think of something I've wondered about this process for a while.

To make these burns, the satellite must have brought along fuel.  How long will the satellite be able sustain its orbit before it runs out of fuel, on average?  And when one of these does run out of fuel, and can no longer sustain its orbit, what will the fate of the satellite be?  Being thrown out of its inclination is not the same as falling out of orbit?  Would we expect collisions between satellites? They don't. They'll eat anything, it's in their instincts. In the wild they wouldn't know where food or their next meal would come from and they had to scavenge for everything and anything and hunt whatever prey they could catch. Even domesticated and on a feeding schedule some dogs just have a higher food drive and need to eat everything in sight. If it is poisonous or deadly to them, well then they'll learn or barf it back up...maybe try eating it again. They're not always the brightest bulbs. Some dogs have low food drives and won't eat anything and barely touch their food and be very picky about what they will eat. Just like humans too. Some of us have high food drives and some of us have low food drives, some of us know when to stop eating, some of us can't ever stop. It's all genetics and personality and metabolism etc. [Alan Turing's work in this area is quite nice.](http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf)  He was able to distil the biology of cell differentiation down to simple terms and was able to account for biological patterns (spots, tentacles, etc) using basic physical principles - specifically regarding the diffusion and reaction of "morphogens" amongst different cell groups .  The Fraden group at Brandeis recently [experimentally verified](http://fraden.brandeis.edu/research/bz.html) Turing's analysis

 [Saturn V rocket acceleration graph for apollo 8.](http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/pics/gforce.gif) The first stage peaks out at about 4Gs. A Formula 1 car accelerates around 3Gs (although decelerates near 5), a street Ferrari much less than that. Yes, they are called planetary mass objects or simply [rogue planets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_planet). There are probably more of them in the milky way than stars. There can also other objects orbiting around them, although i don't know if we have discovered any of such yet.  a better analogy would be variable pixels sizes (very sharp in the center, getting bigger towards the edges) and variable and individual refresh rates per pixel

What PengKun brings up as far as how the image processing is handled is also important. Complexity comes from the way DNA codes for proteins.

A simple analogy is this: the English language has 26 letters. Put those letters together in different combinations and you get (current estimates) [1,025,109.8 different words](http://www.languagemonitor.com/number-of-words/number-of-words-in-the-english-language-1008879/). With that many words a near infinite number of sentences can be written. 

The same thing with DNA. The chemical components (nucleic acids) of DNA make up the Letters. These letters are arranged in groups of three (codons) to make up the "words" of biology. (4 letters arranged in groups of three gives us 64 possible variations, or "words"). Each codon matches to an amino acid, the chemical components of proteins (you can think of this matching like translating a word in English to one in French). The words (amino acids) are then arranged to make up a "sentence" (protein).

The complexly grows ever grater. Proteins can combine with other proteins to perform larger complexes with greater function (in our analogy you could think of this like sentences combining in a paragraph). 

Proteins are also modified by chemical additions. These changes the way the protein functions, much like an umlaut changes the sound of "u" to "" or accents changes the sound of "e" to "" or the tilde changes "n" to ""

Now there is more.

DNA is not just an open book that can be read anywhere.

DNA also has instructions which say what to read, when to read it, how often to read it and who is allowed to read it (this is anthropomorphism of course but it makes explanations easier)  I won't give away the ending but yeah, it basically is about a realization that perhaps this wasn't the best way to go about things.  I highly recommend Stross' work in general. &gt; It makes less sense that the d-d transition absorbs everything.

But as I said before... You don't have to absorb "everything" or "most of the visible spectrum" to show a colour. All you need to do is to absorb a narrow band to perceive a colour - it's how [subtractive colour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color) works. We can go back to the [spectrum of erythrosine](http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/@api/deki/files/5068/image039.png?revision=1) - in the range of wavelengths in visible light (from some 400 nm to some 700 nm), it only absorbs from 480 nm to 560 nm - so it leaves much of the violet and blue, and yellow, orange and red untouched. It really only absorbs in the green region. And white light with the green region removed is perceived to be red.

Or perhaps, you're surprised at the absorption peak width of a single d-d transition? Splitting energy is a function of ligand field strengths, and at a given temperature you're going to have a distribution of ligand distances, symmetry, vibrational modes, etc, which gives rise to a peak much wider than one would expect from a single transition. This is particularly pronounced in solution as the water of solvation is in constant exchange with other water molecules. There shouldn't be a visual eye specific latency effect, optic raditions cross over to represent left visual field in right hemisphere.  [So the eye has both ipsi and contralateral projections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_radiation#mediaviewer/File:ERP_-_optic_cabling.jpg).   You can also get the opposite, where faces are seen in almost everything. They eye doesn't work like that.  Each eye projects to both hemispheres, so there won't be an interocular delay, like with auditory cortex. Hope you get an answer. I kinda also want to know if there's a way to measure the number of brain cells in someone. Like compare there measurements before and after an experiment to see if there was any changes.  Its a really weird feeling reading about that while thinking about how my eye is reading about it. Really cool stuff thanks Just curious, can you have varying degrees of synaesthesia? For example, some letters have associated colors for me, but not numbers. I also measure distance between two months by perceiving the year as a clock face, and seeing how far apart the months are on that clock.  The issue you are having in making this connection may have to do with assumptions regarding 'an organism without eyes that evolved to have them.'

I tend to think when most people use the term 'organism' they are referring to something multi-cellular, but we need to go back much farther than that to find an organism which genuinely has no mechanism for interpreting the presence or absence of light (in those cases where the progeny of that organism will eventually undergo pressures for sensing the presence or absence of light).

Imagine we have a single celled, aquatic, heterotrophic (eats other things), motile organism. This hypothetical organism has no mechanism for sensing the presence or absence of light in its surroundings. But light *does* still have impacts on this organism, UV will denature cells, infrared radiation will create heat, etc. All of these impacts of light impact the organism whether or not it can sense that light *visually*. In time, the organism can develop responses to light without needing anything like an eye. 

For example: It can make little plates on its membrane that prevent light from penetrating, thus allowing it to move closer to the surface of the water without being damaged by UV. In order for these plates to have maximum biological effect it could establish a set of protein structures that tell flagella to move the cell in directions which correspond to light being blocked. In this way it can move upwards towards higher-light zones while still having those plates facing the sun. All of these developments can be produced based on tissue damage which develops from UV exposure, no visual interpretation required. And it also requires no choice or volition - the individuals which develop innate responses to move them closer to the surface of the aquatic environment will naturally encounter more photosynthetic organisms (the responses are moving it towards higher-light zones where autotrophic organisms will have higher populations), and will thus have more calories and proliferate more quickly (natural selection).

In this way, there is no multi-cellular organism exposed regularly to light which has not already, in its historic lineage, developed the precursor structures which correspond to a light-response mechanism. The eye therefor must have first developed in an organism which did not have an eye, but it could not develop on an organism which did not already have the precursor mechanisms for an eye, and these developed based on non-visual pressures. I would add that this sort of development cannot occur over several generations, it would take **many** generations even to develop a light-blocking membrane structure. Thank you for your submission!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* I've heard it's kind of like a flip book. Like you see each individual piece but it's very choppy and all the fluidity is gone. No. The innermost stable orbit is the photon sphere, at 1.5 times the event horizon, where light can orbit in a circle. Inside that but outside the horizon, things can either fall in or escape to infinity. Inside the horizon, they can only fall inwards. That's not entirely true: there is a slight difference in pressure due to the restricted airflow through the ventilation.  If there were no pressure difference, there would be no airflow through the ventilation and the occupants would suffocate.  Also, changes in air pressure outside would not propagate inside the building immediately.  That's probably pretty accurate.  The visual system is essentially reconstructing the visual scene in our mind.  You can see failures of this reconstruction process - we call them visual illusions.  Vision is not just a simple feed-forward process - we see rapid feedback throughout the visual heirarchy, and even longer term feedback to v1 on the order of 200-400 ms.  We percieve a realtively stable environment because our whole perceptual system makes assumptions based on what we've seen before (in the short ms time frame), but also what we've already exerienced (in the life time frame).

Its an area of interest dating back to the 70s, called ecological vision, where people realized that just looking at the response properties of a single stimulus ignored the whole environment.  

So maybe a better way to think about it is that maybe it is 10% realtime input, but the 90% prediction is operating at probably something like 98% correct, so what do you really care? How high an fps can be perceived depends very much on the contents of what one sees: if nothing is moving, a still image is sufficient. The faster any movements within the field of view, the higher the required fps.  
So a decent reference for maximum observable fps is the fastest movement (more precisely: the largest amount of displacement within the field of view) that the eye/brain can detect in reality. A frame rate higher than that would be pointless.
 But would that be the actual eye, or something not working in the image processing? I say that because the human mind is really good at finding these sorts of patterns, we even can spot faces in clouds and such. I'm guessing there's something our brain that can take can see an image and pick out any pattern that resembles a face and then cross reference that to other faces we remember to see if there's a match. But to me that doesn't seem like something the eye does, but it's something in the brain that does that. The important thing to appreciate is that mutations don't have to be advantegous to be preserved. Many will be neutral and this provides opportunities for complexities to arise later on. For example, gene duplication has a very small cost to the organism, but provides a spare copy of a gene which is then able to mutate without the original function being lost. 

With this specific example, if you haven't already read it, [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye) answers many of your questions. 'Seeing' doesn't require many of the things that you've assumed it does and there is likely to be an advantage to many organisms in being able to detect some light. Plants can sense how close neighbouring plants are by the colour of light and adjust their growth accordingly.  &gt; 40fps

I have done a lot of tests with blinking LEDs, and there is a very noticeable difference between a LED blinking 40 times a sec and one blinking 100 times a sec. The 40Hz one is *more or less* stable, but it looks a bit noisy and looks to be fluctuating a bit. The 100Hz one is rock-solid. No noise, no fluctuations, nothing. And IF 40Hz was enough, why then are CTRs 60Hz and up? For me, even a 60Hz CRT isn't a "stable" image, it's flickering ever so slightly. 

&gt;The average human being isn't going to be able to detect any differences in frame rates higher than 40fps

The average human doesn't know there is a difference. Tell there there is a differance. Then ask them which is better in an ABX test.

There are people that can't hear the difference between a $5 headset powered by a no-brand chine MP3 player and a HiFi system set up by an audio technician. Their brain is filling in for them. They aren't listening. 

Another problem is the notion of "FPS". A more interesting question is how quickly can in image flash before you before you can't make out what is was? Fighter-pilots have been able to identify the correct plane when shown an image for 1/4000th of a second, of 4000FPS if you'd like. But 30FPS is enough for most motion to be perceived as "smooth". 

**TL;DR:** There is a huge difference between what is passable as real, and what that is indistinguishable from real. 30FPS is *passable* as real, 200FPS+ is. &gt; This is also the expected speed of sound through a gas of light

What is "a gas of light"? Does that mean it's possible that someone could have better vision than another person even though their eyes are worse, because their post processing is better? 

Also maybe your vision could improve without eyes getting better, I remember an article saying 3D gameplay improved shape recognition. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_gas Definitely sounds like it, although I'm not sure if it's apperceptive or associative. Yes. Eyespots are only found in eukaryotes, so no bacteria (prokaryotes) have them. Sensing light is likely to be advantageous for organisms that rely on light and can move, but for organisms that life in the soil, or an relatively immobile, it won't be so much of a benefit. Interestingly, it's been suggested that bacteria can indeed sense light [without an eyespot](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030287) but using similar proteins to those in our eyes. I think many people portray this poorly. In terms of monitors, the higher the fps, the smoother it looks. In gaming @ 45 fps you may notice it is hard to make out details in something that is in motion. When you increase the FPS all the sudden you capture more detail and things seem less blurry/fuzzy.


It isn't that you can see every single frame at 45 fps, it is the fact that things in motion become less blurry the higher the frame rate.  


I am sure someone will tell me I am wrong, but this is the simplest, most broadest way of explaining what is occurring and why you need higher FPS in gaming. Sure.  The general point remains.  neurons fire quickly, but the information they represent does not typically come from a single "fire."  It rather comes from lots of firing, and from neighbors that fire a lot.  They can fire really slowly or burst very fast, and this depends on internal properties of the cell as well as the cell's direct connections.

Similarly, we can count the synapses from photoreceptor to visual cortex to get the shortest latency possible, although the actual recorded time that a V1 cell is reliably dissociating presence or absence of a stimuli may be much later.  By the time we say V1 has a stimulus, that stimulus has already hit most of the dorsal system and started feedback to V1.

The story remains - the visual system can be extremely quick, and it is a rapidly expanding network starting at the eye, where information goes in multiple directions.  So we can't just think about it as some computer analogy where your brain is a dumb display of a CPU generated environment. Why 1.5 ? I thought the event horizon was the limit underneath which you'd have to go faster that light, so I assumed that was where photons could stay in circular orbit. What happens to a photon in orbit at, say, 1.2 times the EH ? Interesting. Is this something ever naturally observed or theorized to exist? That page doesn't mention it. That first image is pretty much an exact representation of coming home at 3am after a night out and trying to watch Netflix.  

I can usually manage it if I watch with just one eye.   Well, the example it gives is blackbody radiation, and that exists. The system people were thinking of is basically a hot internally mirrored box with a little hole it, so light reflects around the box and you can use the hole to see the spectrum of light escaping. It's also used to describe the early universe. It either escapes to infinity or falls in. Even for the hash, the person should be using a fixed-time algorithm that checks every character regardless of whether a mismatch is found.

e.g.:

    matching = true
    for char_a, char_b in zip_longest(hash_a, hash_b):
        matching &amp;= (char_a == char_b) There are two questions here: one about the nature of quantum computing, and one about the implementation of quantum computing.

The theory about quantum computing goes something like this:  Rather than being in a definite state like a digital computer, a quantum computer is in a superposition of states.  If we can somehow harness this superposition, we can have an effectively superparallel computer.

Imagine, if you will, that we have a digital computer instead of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat and instead of one random event that kills the computer, we have a 1024 random events, each of which sets an input bit.  Then the computer would be in a superposition of states, each of which is testing one of the 2^1024 possible input strings.   Of course, this particular approach isn't that useful because when you open the box, you just have a 2^-1024 chance of getting the outcome of any particular input.  Even so, with some cleverness, it's believed that this superposition of states can be exploited for useful calculation.


Actual implementation of quantum computing is an active area of research.  There are 'quantum computing groups' at various large institutions all working on it.  If you look at the wikipedia entry for qubit  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit#Physical_representation) you can see that there's a variety of physical representations.  Each of these physical representations is its own technology.   Similarly, the act of programming a quantum computer depends a bit on the technology that's involved.

Typically quantum computers are highly noise sensitive, so they operate in special environments designed to minimize noise.  This includes vacuum, extremely low temperature and electromagnetic isolation.
 I think this is a bit misleading, since you're talking about the processing of the visual stimuli in the visual cortex of the brain itself, but not the function of the eye itself.

The "FPS" question could be understood as "what rate do the light sensitive cells in the eye send new information"? There's already some kind of simple processing within the eye itself (like "encoding" the colors or using "data" from several cells), however there still has to be some rate of communication (even if it's probably not constant at all the time or the particular area of the eye) between the eye and the brain.

So the question would be, how large is the resolution of the eye on the time scale? That is, what's the shortest time when it can perceive and set distinct information for the brain for the processing?

There's definitely some kind of fuzzing in this though, since the eyes get analogue of "exposure time" - you can notice motion blur, especially when it's dark, if you for example wave your hand in front of you and of course there are many electronic devices which utilize this, especially displays, which are often flashing at very high rate  due to the way they're updated (time multiplexing), but the eye sees the image as constant. The power of the antenna isn't just in its capacity to send out strong signals, but also in its sensitivity. You're right that phones, compared to cell towers, produce really weak signals. But the large antenna in a cell tower is much more sensitive than the small antenna in a cell phone, so the tower is still able to register the weak signals sent by a cell phone. And is this is a consequence of the fact that the Earth and most bodies in orbit of the Sun were borne of the same rotating cloud of... stuff, way back when? Is that how the Earth 'knows' where the sun is 'now'?
 &gt; So, Newton's third law can be violated without violation of conservation laws.

That depends on whether you consider the transfer of momentum to the field to be part of 'an equal and opposite reaction'. Once past the event horizon there is only one gravity down.  Think of it as you swimming past the crest of a great waterfall.... once you reach it, can you in fact swim faster than the force of the mass of water and gravity at that point...... no.

tl;dr: Note that the water wan't poured in for the first part so it has stabilised and then for the other parts the water wasn't poured in from the same side. The circular motion is from the pouring of water and not the rotation of the earth. It *doesn't* take a powerful radio antenna to send data to our phones.

I had to spend a few days making a script to update all of the configs and hash all of the passwords... Observable universe yes, since its difficult to say anything scientific about things we cannot observe. 

The universe can be thought of as a set of relationships between objects, thus if those relationships are changing such that distances between them expand, then the universe itself must be said to be expanding. The universe is not a container or an object in itself, it is more of a characterisation of the relationships between objects. Consider a universe containing only two balls, we can only characterise this by the relationship between the balls, if they are receding from each other inertially, it can be said to be expanding, as there is no reference point to otherwise define it (this is guaranteed by the principle of relativity). We have good reason to believe our universe is "flat" and thus has no features barring the objects/events that occupy the spacetime.

To the implied question: there are good empirical reasons to refer to the "observable universe" as the "universe" since its all we can scientifically justify. If we had data suggesting expansion of more than the observable universe would this extra region not also be observable in some manner and thus be part of the observable universe? Just tell us how many pixels so we can move on to the next post, mister smarty pants!


Jk that is interesting thank you :) closing one eye seems to help. Any idea why? It also prevents information leaks about the length of the password and/or the password file.  And exactly why rock and shadow on Mars looks like a Kevin Bacon movie. Technically yes, but it's not something you'd be able to measure. The difference in the force of gravity downstairs vs. upstairs in your home has a bigger impact on the weight of the drive than whether it's full or not. And you're not going to measure that with any common scale either. I think they see the entire continuum; but at any given moment they can't "feel" where things are going or where they came from, just where they are. Interesting. As it turns out 31 arc seconds is about the size of the moon. I'm going to write a programming language that *only* throws exemption errors *just for you.* So cancer occurs when there is mutation in a key gene which regulates growth and cell growth becomes uncontrollable. Now mutations occur when the cells are dividing and a mistake occurs while copying the DNA. Not all type of cells divide at the samr rate. Eg. cells like that of the brain or even heart cells don't divide as much as say hepatocytes (liver) cells or lung cells. So the likelihood of them getting a mutation is less than these other types. So brain or heart cancers are not impossible but exceedingly rare. That's pretty unpleasant, I couldn't keep the image open for very long. I lost the original version of this reply so this one may be slightly less than ideal, but hopefully useful enough.

The fact that quantum mechanics is applied to the field means there is a sharp difference between 'vibrating' and 'not vibrating'. It's the same basic reason that, e.g. electrons around a nucleus fall into one of a discrete set of possible states. So contrary to classical intuition, quantum fields have a discontinuous difference between the ground state (which also has some minimum amount of vibration actuallly) and the excited state, the first quantum excitation of the field, which corresponds to the presence of a particle. As a result, for any point in space, you can ask "is there an electron here?" and the answer you get is either yes or no. In this sense particles *are* precisely localized.

There is also a sense though in which the particles are not precisely localized, again because of quantum mechanics. Everything is defined only in terms of a probability distribution. So even if you measure the particles position, making that probability distribution sharply localized, it will afterward immediately become fuzzed out again, as the wavefunction evolves into a superposition of different position states.

That can be described in standard QM, but there is also another way in which the 'point-like' nature of particles breaks down specifically in quantum field theory. Namely, as you probe the particle with higher and higher energies, some otherwise highly-quantum, highly-irrelevant processes involving creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs will become relevant, and you will directly see the evidence of a "virtual cloud" of such particles around the electron or whatever particle. So that is a real sense in which the physical particle is not actually point-like, even beyond the fact that its overall position may have a quantum mechanical uncertainty. 

All that said, I think your question basically comes from imagining a classical field only, whereas quantum field theory says that you need a wavefunction assigning complex amplitudes to *all possible configurations of that classical field.* What I described above is the detailed answer, but I think the basic reason your intuition objected is that a single classical field is inadequate to match what I've described, which is certainly correct. A cochlear implant might be what you are looking for. Cochlear implants are constructed in such a way that electrodes bypass the entirety of the middle and inner ear and stimulate the auditory nerve fibers of the inner ear in corresponding frequencies. They're implanted in such a way that electronic stimulation can be applied from the outside via a removable "artifical ear" (which is basically a microphone that sends frequency impulses to the respective electrodes). You would in principle be able to replace the ear with a contraption that instead of having a microphone would play fixed music into the cochlear implant. Of course nobody does that because that would be excruciatingly expensive for a gimmick.

As for direct stimulation of the brain, the only thing I would see is stimulating the "early" areas of the auditory cortex. The auditory cortex is organized in such a way that different frequencies of sound are projected onto different areas of the primary auditory cortex and then calculated in subsequent auditory areas (a principle called tonotopy). You might be able to build an implant that would specifically stimulate different areas of frequency. You might imagine that that's quite impractical and straight up dangerous though. I would argue that an incandescent black body that is "blue hot" would be perceived, upon closer examination, as a lot hotter by your average human when compared to the same body that is "red hot".


I think the source of this convention is that we typically don't encounter anything that is "blue hot". White hot is about as hot as we commonly encounter, and red hot is pretty common too. If you're going to associate a color with something being hot, red makes more sense because of people's experience and not any particular physical reason. A good question and one that is still not settled in the literature. In order to avoid a situation where we end up branch counting (which is incoherent since QM gives us no way to define branch numbers), Deutsch and Wallace have unsuccessfully tried to provide a decision theoretic argument based on a rational agent trying to maximise betting rewards based on quantum outcomes. Their axioms fail to be consistent with each other in the end (aside from this surely the agent always wins any bets or at least some copy of him does - which one is actually him? If we follow this any further we stray into crazy territory...). Some authors have gone as far as showing that the only consistent set of decision axioms from the original D&amp;W formulation actually forces you into the dreaded branch counting scenario. Source?  Because I can't see how it would weigh more, data stored on a hard disk is just differences in the magnetic field on parts of the plates, right?

I don't believe there is a difference in weight between a magnetised and un-magnetised metal since there is no adding or taking away of material it is simply re-arranged. I don't think it's limited to motion.

I remember one example where the guy would correctly guess what object or image was in front of him but would swear he wasn't seeing anything. Since added energy equals added mass (E = mc^(2)), and most storage devices represent a 1 bit as a higher energy state than a 0 bit, a hard drive filled entirely with 1s would have an immeasurably higher mass than one filled with 0s. But even a microscopic speck of dust would outweigh any such difference, not to mention discrepancies in manufacturing between two different hard drives.

However, in reality, neither a "full" nor an "empty" hard drive is filled entirely with 1s or 0s. Both would contain a seemingly random pattern of both bit values.(\*) This randomness can mean that in general either drive can have greater or smaller mass than the other.

&amp;nbsp;

(\*) Interestingly enough, generally nowhere near in equal quantities. An average used hard drive contains roughly 30-40% ones and the rest zeros. The lights aren't moving. Our eyes sort of fill in the gaps. But when something is moving, you only actually see it when light is there. It'd like a very fast strobe light.  Try moving your finger in front of you following her raised foot in a circle in the opposite direction you're perceiving it.

edit: It's important to note that when the foot is moving on the front, it is either higher or lower depending on the direction she's rotating. You might be taking this a little too seriously.  Geosync satellites are expected to retain a reserve of propellant for placing themselves into a "[graveyard orbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_orbit)", well above geosync, at the end of their useful lives.  That places them in a location where they can shift around due to tidal forces without endangering operational satellites.  ~~There have been a few geosync satellite failures that left them unable to move to graveyard orbits, though.~~ according to that article, the majority fail to successfully do so, though.

In general, at geosync separations are reasonably broad and the risk of collision is limited;  It's more of a concern because a failed satellite will leave that position in geosync unusable for future sats.  Low orbit satellites have a higher risk of collisions and higher velocity collisions, and collisions there are a major concern. So, essentially, it's a REALLY good *analog* camera, making defining resolution difficult? No, the eye's resolution isn't averaged out like his math, the eye has way higher resolution at the focal point. Yes, fascinating.  I'm curious how (or if) it relates to Capgras Syndrome (which is the delusion where one perceives loved ones as imposters of sone sort) I'm curious about this too, and what I want to know is what is the maximum resolution (in pixels) the human eye can actually see? So, as far as TVs go, what is the highest resolution that would actually matter? For instance, the eye can clearly detect a difference between 720p, 1080p, 4K, and 8K, but when do we draw the line and stop improving image quality because it won't matter anymore?

Edit: Assuming 20/20 vision. I know some people have better than that, and in the future there will probably be ways to better our vision significantly past 20/20 as well. As our eyes stand now, by nature, is what I'm inquiring about. The skin on the glans is "tougher" than the mucosa of the foreskin (increased keratin) and has more cells in it. The increased number of cells provides more targets for HIV, and the foreskin may also be more susceptible to trauma and tearing, thus allowing the virus further targets.^^[1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2877841/)

The actual reduction of HIV in circumcised males is debatable - some studies have shown it while others haven't, but a large meta-analysis showed a protective effect of about a 44% relative risk reduction, and up to 71% in high-risk patients.^^[2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11089625) They separate when they're pretty much out of fuel. They just parachute down - they don't navigate to a landing point, the launch is just planned so the separation point is over water and they can pretty much predict where they're going to drift down to and have boats waiting in roughly the right place. This has an almost scary implication for future AI. Imagine a generally artificial intelligent robot that is able to make sense of all of its entire frame of view simultaneously without saccades. How it experiences sight would almost be incomparable to our vision.  I expect it is because of the high likely hood that the denominator would be an irrational number.  If you can arrange to delay evaluating the irrational parts as late as possible, and then dividing into them instead of dividing by them, you can more easily calculate the result.  Compare evaluating 1/sqrt(2) vs sqrt(2)/2 by hand.   you'll find the later isuch easier.   Well, gravity is always downward. That's not what the question is about.  Nuclear plants are still heat engines, which are inherently inefficient.  If you compare [the efficiencies](http://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_08_01.html) of different types of power plants, you see that nuclear is no more efficient than coal, and less efficient than natural gas.  The upside, of course, is that regardless of efficiency, it doesn't have any greenhouse emissions.

I'm a little confused about the second part of your question; which extraction process do you mean?  Mining?  Enrichment?  Re-processing?  Either way, uranium is incredibly energy dense, so I am reluctant to believe that 95% of uranium's energy content is spent refining or enriching. But then you'd always either be lagging behind a frame, or the graphics would have to be predicting the future. Or fill it with a substance lighter than air (such as helium). Vent the substance to increase the weight of the object.

(Obviously this decreases mass.) Every day there is something new in MATH and what we actually know is NOTHING compared to the UNKNOWN.
The great mystery that Mathematicians did not solve up till now is finding a formula of how PRIME numbers ever formed :) It you want a way oversimplifed and probably inaccurate answer, I'd go with roughly one megapixel. There are only 1.2 to 1.5 million retinal ganglion cells[[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_ganglion_cell#Function)] connecting your retina and your visual cortex. So, if you want to make the inaccurate assumption that your eye is simply taking pictures and sending data to your brain, then there are only 1.5 million "cords" through which that can get done.





 A [hash function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) converts input data of an arbitrary size to a fixed output size.

An example of a trivial hash function would be a function that takes a number and returns 1 if it is odd, and 0 if it is even; no matter how large the input number is, the result can be represented in one bit.

A [cryptographically secure hash function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) (the type of hash functions used in to store passwords) are hash functions that are specifically designed to be resilient against cryptographic attacks.

So, a "hashed password" is the result of passing a password through a cryptographically secure hash function.  For example, here is the output of the string "asdf" when passed through two common (but old and no longer cryptographically secure) hash algorithms:

* [MD5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5): 912ec803b2ce49e4a541068d495ab570
* [SHA-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1): 3da541559918a808c2402bba5012f6c60b27661c

Note: Modern systems should not store hashed passwords, because they are vulnerable to [rainbow table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) attacks.  Modern systems should store the output of [key derivation functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function), which use a combination of salting and iteration to defend against rainbow tables and other attacks. What if I have no problem looking at either of those pictures?  Can you expand on that a bit more on why that is? Perhaps a source? Tendons and ligaments being largely made of connective tissue almost never display tumours and if they get them they are seldom cancerous/malignant. 

Here's a hungarian study over 22 years that identified only 75 tendon tumours, in the malignant cases the tumor cells largely came from surrounding tissues (tendon attachment point, tendon sheaths etc...)

http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00393879 It will continue to orbit, but it will not be stable. In a normal eliptical orbit, as the object falls towards the object it is orbiting, it accelerates, which gives it the momentum to reach its high point again. In a black hole, the speed it would have to reach to do this is higher than the speed of light, and because it can't go that fast, it will not make it as high on subsequent orbits, and eventually collapse into the singularity at the center. Not quite. A cell phone is sending information to only one device, the tower. 

The tower is sending information to potentially several thousand people. Some may be in the tens of thousands in very dense cities. 

You're not wrong, but the fact that the tower has many thousands of times more devices connected to it is more of a factor than sensitivity. The shuttle was usually launched eastward over the Atlantic Ocean.  The boosters separated about 2 minutes after launch, by which point the shuttle was ~25 miles from the coast of Florida and 150,000 ft in the air.  They've still got a lot of forward velocity, so they would continue moving east for a while before beginning to fall back to Earth.  Once they do, the parachutes wouldn't open until the boosters were down to about 15,000 ft of altitude and the main chutes wouldn't open until 5,500 ft.  The boosters hit the water at about 50 mph, so they wouldn't have an opportunity to blow back inland in such a short amount of time.

On top of that, NASA tracks the boosters after separation and have the ability to remotely self-destruct them to prevent them from landing in a dangerous area. Since no one else has answered I'll take a  stab.

I think the answer is simply that we don't know. Most microbes need a minimum of a carbon source, nitrogen source, energy source, water, and various ions and elements e.g. Fe, Ni,Co,Cu, Zn,Mg,Na to name a few.

Additionally the type of enzymes their genomes encode for largely determines what media they can grow in. For example if a microbe doesn't produce superoxide dismutase or catalase it can't live in oxygen because it can't detoxify the by products of aerobic metabolism.

Some bacteria like E.coli are very simple to culture because they can make all their own AAs, lipids, and carbohydrates. Others are so complex that we simply don't know all the very specific essential nutrients that they cannot synthesize themselves from basic sources. An example my book gives is the Treponema pallidum species that causes syphilis. It has a very complex metabolism that  a laboratory medium able to support its growth has not been developed yet. The only places that don't develop cancer are those in which the cells are already dead - i.e. hair, nails, and the outside enamel of your teeth. Brain cancer is actually not that uncommon, nearly 1% of males will have been diagnosed with some form of brain cancer by the time they are 85 (1 in 150 for females). Most heart tumours are benign, and metastatic involvement of the heart is far more common.

Most heart tumours are benign, and metastatic involvement of the heart is far more common. I don't know if someone has said this, but there's an amazing short film called [Still Life](http://youtu.be/La6T8Bq6CsU) about just that. There's something I've never quite understood about the quantum gravity discussion; does the particle-based interpretation of gravity replace the geometric interpretation as the actual "story" of what's going on in the universe? Or is it more that the geometric explanation of gravity occurs as a consequence of the quantum theory?

 you need to explain the "now" if you're going to put it like that I always assumed Linux made it take longer to make brute forcing more cumbersome. But I guess I've never really looked into it. There is a contingent of physicists who always say this, but I think the problem is worse than "non-renormalizeability"alone conveys (although it is connected with the problems I am about to list). Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the "gravity does with with QM" only goes as far as: we know how to do low-energy first-order QM-grav corrections on a fixed background. But that's cheating; it ignores the major technical and conceptual difficulties of uniting QM and GR, which have to do with the quantization of the metric. For example I don't think we know how to calculate something as simple as a QM-grav double-slit experiment (ie where the particle is very massive) because the uncertainty in the particle's position generates an uncertainty in the metric so that interfering wave functions are no longer even on the same background geometry, leading to basic problems of how superposition and the Born rule is even supposed to work. There of course other big problems, such as holography, that while it may be related to non-renormalizability, just saying that QM-GR is non-renormalizeable doesn't really capture the depth of the problem.
 This is true for perceived loudness, but at the same volume (50% system volume, for example), wouldn't they use the same amount of power?  The musical signal has already been amplified, so it just matters which speaker that signal drives, or do headphone jacks have a separate amp circuit in the device? Thank you for your submission!

To broadcast to multiple recipients, a transmitter has to either allocate a timeslot or a frequency for each recipient, but that's it. It takes just as much power to reach 1 device as it does to reach a 1000.  We just move the insertion points. For instance, in proximal femoral replacement, the abductor tendons can be fixed to the ITB, or some of the bone with the native attachments can be directly fixed to the replacement. It's worth bearing in mind the complexity of these operations often dictates a case-by-case approach to each patient (especially given the high proportion associated with malignancy) and what the desired functional outcome may be. moh is ordinal, so yes. It's likely extrapolated from a better measure of hardness and just put in terms of moh for general consumption. People who are storing passwords in plaintext aren't mitigating timing attacks. Everyone have the face of slenderman to them. Thanks! Vsauce goes into great detail about this you should look it up. But basically the human eye has a really low resolution but our brain fills in the stuff our eyes miss It would depend on the character of the amino acid but amino acid absorption in the small intestine is pretty general and mostly based on the charge i.e. cationic vs. anionic vs. neutral. Rates of absorption do vary though.

So most likely it would get absorbed and if the body didn't have a use for it degradation would occur in the liver. All amino acids have the same basic structure; a carboxylic, amine, and side chain group.  First the amino group would be removed my transaminase and you would pee it out as urea. The rest would either be oxidized into CO2 or shunted to another pathway depending on its character Not true. Mine are 26 megapixels Not exactly. Processing starts at most 13 msec after single stimulus presentation. We don't know how long it takes to complete. 

So if "FPS" means "the number of frames *fully* processed per second", the answer is "we don't know, because we don't know how long processing takes". If "FPS" means "the number of frames you can *start* processing per second", the answer is "we don't know, because we don't know the minimum interval needed to start processing a new frame".  He is correct. Digesting, and indeed sometimes even metabolizing molecules intracellularly, does involve some use of energy before the organism can get returns for it's investments. We use energy to chew, swallow, keep the stomach churning and peristalsis in the intestines for example. Different nutrients don't all take the same amount of energy to break down, either.

Proteins are broken down into amino acids, their individual building blocks, when they are being digested. The body then uses these to make it's own proteins. It costs energy to break the bonds between these amino acids. The energy spent digesting these proteins amounts to about 20-35 % of the total energy yield from the protein, depending on what protein it is. For sugars, like starch which pasta and bread is rich in, the body can get somewhere around 95% efficiency under ideal conditions. as someone who gets migraines often... that instantly stung. yes. every mass, no matter how small, can produce a gravitational field. k[ &lt;-- dead while sad and really pissed of ? Oh yea, I know. 

I have had bad headaches in the past and thought, "Surely this is a migraine." or "Migraines can't really be worse than this." 

And then one day not too long ago I was sitting in bed and it felt like someone was driving a sharp object through my eye socket into my brain. I screamed out and was in the fetal position for a short time. That shit was way to brutal for me to handle. And to think people suffer those constantly is just horrifying. I can still sort of feel the area where it happened like it's threatening to start up again. Buoyant force is an upward force resulting from hydrostatic pressure difference above and bellow the object. Deeper you are higher the pressure so the force points always up, but if the object is heavier than the displaced liquid this force is not high enough to support its weight. Short answer: it's the resistance of an AC circuit resulting from the combined effects of resistance and reactance. Reactance being the opposition of a circuit element to a change of electric current or voltage due to that element's inductance or capacitance.
 The reason film is 24 frames per second is because, after testing with audiences, engineers discovered that that was the lowest frame rate humans could look at and still be tricked into perceiving motion. 23 frames per second wasn't fast enough, and people who start to see individual frames. 

Since film is extremely expensive, the less film you can use the better! Oxytocin. Also dopamine. Noob question - doesn't have multiple tiers of authentication like that possibly create a security issue where your password is compromised, but the new password hasn't propagated from the higher tiers yet? The problem here is that the volume level is poorly defined. "50% system volume" doesn't have a fixed definition that speaker manufacturers should adhere to. As an example, my desktop has a speaker set with a separate volume control, that is independent of whatever I set in Windows. My headset on the other hand, has a volume control that is nothing more than a hardware interface for the Windows (or any other OS) system volume. If I set my speaker-volume to 0, I can have my system volume at 50% and the speakers will definitely use less power than the headset with 50% system volume.

The system volume only determines the amplitude of the signal that the OS spits out. To what extent that signal is amplified will depend on the speaker/earphone hardware.

So while system volume isn't really a good way to measure sound, perceived loudness is. Because in the end, that is what the user notices. Only at the photon sphere can light make an orbit that returns to the same place. Anywhere else there are only two options: escape or fall.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere Put simply, all foetuses develop as females for the first two months of life, following that pathway of development that includes growing nipples. Male foetuses then have surge of testosterone which turns off the female development pathway and switches us down the path of developing male anatomy - but the nipples have already developed by this time.  [Capgras delusion/syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgras_delusion) is really rare, so there are no good studies of the underlying neural cause. My understanding was that physical recognition is intact, they perceive that this person looks like their loved one, but they don't recognise them *as* their loved one. The hypothesis being that there is a disconnect between the internal feelings for these people (your understanding of their personality, etc), is disconnected from their physical appearance.

If you think about it, Capgras really would not work if you lost the ability to appreciate the person's physical appearance. I like to think of it as differentiating sheep. They all look the same to me, but a farmer can tell you the personality of the individual members of his flock, and can differentiate them very well. It doesn't take much power, in fact as tech improves they are constantly reducing the power because shorter range means more cell towers, and more cell towers means more bandwidth. Modern phones have advanced circuits to limit how much power to transmit so they can just make it to the closest tower without the next closest tower hearing it. This is very important in cities where you have many people.

Now for the powerful antenna/tower question. The tower is somewhat powerful, but the cell phone does not need to reply to the tower at the same power level. The tower has much better antennas than the phone, and can transmit at a slightly higher power (they don't go too high, because that could cause interference with phones connected to other towers). But what matters for both is the SNR of the signal (signal vs noise ratio). A better antenna gets a better SNR, and a higher power gets a better SNR, the tower transmits at a higher power to get the cell phone to receive it with it's tiny antenna, then the cell phone transmits at a low power, but the tower can still get a good SNR because it has a very big expensive antenna. Additionally towers have directional antennas which results in additional gain (they don't pick up noise from all directions).

Radio still does take a lot of power though, so the big trick they use is turn off that radio whenever it's not in use, so phones are constantly turning their radios on and off to save power. Ahh. Til, thank you! Hubble's law is the idea that relative velocity depends on the distance between the two objects. The constant that relates them is known as Hubble's constant and it changes with time. Thus looking at a given galaxy over time its speed relative to us becomes larger and larger as it moves away with the expansion of the universe. The trick here is that as we watch a galaxy it is moving further away in space but not moving backwards in time, it is moving forwards in time, the travel time of the photon gets larger but this is not the same as the galaxy going further into the past. So your 5 ly galaxy at X/2 will become a 10 ly galaxy at a speed Y (X &gt; Y &gt; X/2) as time goes by in an accelerating universe (as the Hubble constant always goes down with time). But if we keep watching that originally 5 ly galaxy it will continue to get further and further and faster and faster as time goes by. So your example doesn't present a problem for an expanding universe.

Does this answer your question? It's the result of an encryption algorithm run on a password. There are a lot of different kinds. But the basic idea is, you take a plain text password, and turn it into something else (e.g. 'myPassW0rd' -&gt; L9ThxnotKPzthJ7hu3bnORuT6xI). The most important feature of these algorithms is that they can't be reversed. So you can go from a password in plain text, to a hash, but not the other way around.  How do they actually transmit the signal such a long distance without any degredation of the signal? What is the actual medium, satellite? I would imagine it depends on the shape of the bottle.  Ultimately, whichever orientation has more surface area contact with the wall of the freezer (where the refrigerant is circulated) will freeze more quickly.  If the bottom side is totally flat, I imagine it will freeze more quickly if it is standing upright.  This will also depend on if the air of the freezer is circulated by a fan (typically not the case), location of refrigerant lines, etc.   If A is a number that is a rational expression of numbers and radicals, then it can be written as a linear expression of numbers and radicals. Equivalently, if you add any finite number of radicals to the rational numbers, then you get a finite dimensional vector space over the rationals and division is the same as "rationalizing the denominator". Sure I agree with all of that. Of course the problem runs deeper than mere non-renormalizability, but it's simply not accurate to say general relativity doesn't work with quantum mechanics. Maybe I shouldn't have worded my response to give the impression that that's the only problem, even though what is implied is a new physics threshold. &gt; either allocate a timeslot or a frequency for each recipient

Timeslot (TDMA), Frequency (FDMA), or Code (CDMA)

But I agree, number of users is unrelated to power level. All that matters is the SNR, and number of users is not related to that (though number of users connected to the tower near you might be related to SNR). By the time that it's alcohol, the part of the sugar that held the energy has been (mostly) turned into carbon dioxide and water, and split off.  The alcohol is the part that's left over, and happens to be more energy dense.

For example glucose has the chemical formula C6H12O6, and Ethanol has the formula C2H6O.  The metabolic reaction that produces alcohol might look like:

C6H12O6 + O2 -&gt; C2H6O + 4 CO2 + 3 H2O

You can see that most of the CO2 and H2O must be from the glucose, and not from the oxygen.



 &gt;In general, gravitational effects of the Sun and Moon cause changes in the orbit's inclination

I had been envisioning something more like an actual tide, where as the Moon passes the orbit stretched away from Earth, and drops back again.  I should have thought about the inclination issue - I guess my mental model of the Solar system is 2D.

&gt;the effect of solar radiation pressure must be compensated for by thrusting tangentially so as to maintain the eccentricity of the orbit.

This never occurred to me... and if it had, it wouldn't have occurred to me it'd be enough of an effect to worry about over timescales smaller than years.

Thanks for the response! And you can only assume my assumptions and assertations are incorrect, be it hypothesis's as well. It doesn't take a community to make a correct answer, only consensuses that it is. Agree though, some look juicy after higgs for dark matter but is it an illusion, the higgs fog, type that into google.

Appearances arent everything, dark matter presents itself as granular so that is the assumption not the theory, or the illusion. The dark halo is perfect for evidence of it being granular.

Yes you have me on distribution and the galactic dynamics but the point in the end is if dark matter has mass, if it doesn't lol, higgs is there but its not, the illusion. 

Am I familiar with Newtonian gravity, is it Einsteins or is it newtons, neither. Both are assumptions of gravity, not the forming of it, but back to the point of 2d gravity yes I am. Not that it formally exists in 2d but an apple hit his head how was he supposed to know.

You looking at the illusion of dark matter from the illusion of gravity to form an assumption that it exists lol. The fact that dark matter is not influencing solar systems is an argument for a massless dark matter
 Is there a neurological disorder there you can't remember book titles..? It's a very nice experiment to achieve to block your eyeball. The software (brain) does not understand the still information and put everything black. Tested ! Remarkable. I assume that it's pretty much like watching some ancient writings or letters of an unknown language. You can see them, but you can't see/observe any meaning in it. For example, when I see Chinese hieroglyphs, the only thing I can notice is a bunch of random lines and figures, without being capable of arranging them in specific shapes and/or meanings.

As hard as you try, you can't make this smooth movement otherwise and you'll find yourself jumping from spot to spot to spot along the page. 

Also, rather than take a video of yourself... just ask someone else to try these two tasks and watch their eyes. Much easier!  Very relevant: http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lj4htjuFgq1qzxzwwo1_1280.jpg Those would all be affected. These people lack the function for differentiating  between things that look like faces and things that don't. They would never see the face of Jesus in a toast, because they lack the concept of how a face looks. http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lj4htjuFgq1qzxzwwo1_1280.jpg If something starts from just outside the event horizon going the speed of light *straight out* from the black hole, it can just barely escape. In a circular orbit, the object isn't moving straight out from the black hole, but instead moving around it. Something just outside the event horizon that starts off moving sideways at the speed of light will fall in.

If you ask what's the radius at which something moving the speed of light *around* the black hole could continue to orbit without falling in, the answer is 1.5 times the event horizon. (The simple factor 1.5 is the result of some complicated math.) &gt; in AA, what is being detected is the photon emitted from the atom
AA should, in general, stand for "atomic *absorption*", in which what's being measured is the decrease in intensity of a light as it passes through an atomized sample. UV-Vis, like AA, is an absorption spectroscopy that happens to use light in the visible and UV wavelengths, but a typical UV-Vis spectrophotometer is appropriate for molecular mixtures, not bare atoms.

You could probably use a UV-Vis device on a gaseous mixture containing bare atoms, but I doubt it would work as well. Atoms are more prone to emitting their absorbed photons than molecules are, so the light intensity you detect would include contributions from the re-emitted photons.

Measuring light emitted is the principle of "atomic emission" and "fluorescence" spectroscopy.

Skoog's Instrumental Analysis is a nice introduction to these topics. So the hardware isn't too impressive, but the processing software is light-years ahead. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I5Q3UXkGd0 It seems their is no overall consensus, though their is correlating data suggesting that a gene responsible for it may be on the X chromosome. This would mean it is inherited from the mother.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_loss#Male_pattern_baldness This should be higher up. I don't quite understand why people ask questions here without simply googling it first. Really anything that's not alive doesn't get cancer by definition, and that can cover a lot of organs (though most of them are closely tied to the tissue that creates them, and that tissue is constantly growing and has high cancer rates). A good example is hair, you can't get hair cancer. Maybe it's semantics or philosophy but I disagree with the statement that "it's simply not accurate to say general relativity doesn't work with quantum mechanics." I think the most important conceptual aspects of GR, the things that distinguish GR from, say, universal gravitation, do *not* work in QM. So if you are going to make a concise generalization for the sake of a lay-person's conceptual understanding, I just don't think it's fair to say that GR and QM work together. I think people like the OP are trying to grapple with the sorts of questions that you are sweeping under the rug when you try to imply they work together. Semantically I would be much more comfortable with "aspects of gravity can be approximately modeled within QM, but on a deeper level they are incompatible without a major modification to one or both."  If this thread just gets a dozen people to borrow an Oliver Sacks book from the library, then it has justified its electrons.

If this thread gets a hundred kids to read about Oliver Sacks and just one of them becomes a doctor or psychologist in order to help people, then it has justified /r/askscience's electrons.

If this thread gets a thousand kids to want to become research scientists and just one of them cures a disease, then I will come back here years later and Gold a hundred of its commenters.

RemindMe! 20 YEARS "Any diseases cured and they mention an old Reddit thread?" I knew about the vision thing; but I'm very impressed that the balance thing actually retrained the brain into developing a new sense of balance that didn't depend on the tongue device. Aah, I see! Thanks for the explanation! 

So the brute force hacking with a hashed password is to just make random passwords until you get one that, when hashed, makes the same string that you already have? Sounds like that'd take a ridiculous amount of time... But then again, IIRC brute force methods do take a lot of time, don't they? &gt; The only places that don't develop cancer are those in which the cells are already dead - i.e. hair, nails, and the outside enamel of your teeth.

The cells producing hair and nails are not dead (which is easily evident in the fact that hairs and nails grow). They just don't proliferate a whole lot. however, the stem cells localized close to the hair follicles (which are not only responsible for recovery of hair follicle cells, but also basal cells of the epidermis) are prone to mutation and can form basal cell carcinoma (which despite what the name suggests doesn't originate from basal cells). Many algae lack an eyespot.

&gt;Shouldn't an eyespot be an advantage for almost every organism? It's not "convenient," it's intentional. I'm not talking about the problems with engineering (of which there are myriad). I'm talking about the problems with evolution by natural selection, which does not seek to create things better suited to human comfort. **The fact that wool was produced by natural selection over the last few epochs is not evidence of it being "better" than synthetic materials, and saying so is faulty thinking.** Cancer and hemophilia and Down syndrome are not "unintended consequences" of evolution the way human error or poor foresight are for an engineering project. As far as nature is concerned, they are equal in every way to the evolution of the human eye or (of wool as sheep's fur) until the genes for them go extinct. Engineering has mistakes, while evolution is just the ONLY process there is for nature to create complexity. I think your whole confusion here boils down to the point below.     

&gt;It's also important to think of the multiple million or billion functions which work properly in multicellular organisms and self-regulate or self-correct properly the vast majority of the time with perhaps minor exceptions.    

You're conflating two things here: complexity and "goodness." Yes, biology is more complex than engineering; complexity as a quality requires the passage of time. Biology has had roughly 13 trillion years, while engineering has had less than 100,000. Yes, natural selection creates biological components that "work properly" when their goal is to pass on their own form, but evolution isn't trying to make things "good" for us. If it were, we'd by immune to lava, could breathe underwater and be able to fly or live for decades longer than our flesh-and-bone organs. Guess what does allow us to do those things... engineering. There is no instance of evolution overcoming the problems of an engineered project, while engineered things are specifically designed to overcome the limitations of biology. This discussion itself is about making a *coat*, an engineered thing.     

Would you at least concede your original point that a wool garment should be "better" at keeping humans comfortable than a synthetic one *because* it was crafted by natural selection over a geologic time scale? That's all I'm really disagreeing with. I always thought that the eye was around 500mp, but i doubt thats accurate The earth pulls an apple toward the center of the earth. In the same magnitude of force, the apple pulls the earth towards the center of the apple. I don't know if this is allowed, but [vsauce actually did a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF3ejw7JJuc) on this exact question. Pretty interesting. I don't know enough physics to critique his explanations and speculations, but there are others who might in here. :) I actually notice my correct password taking longer Really good answer. The argument against evolution based on some idea of irreducible complexity is pretty much as old as the idea of evolution itself. Its flawed mostly as you state because it essentially tries to work backward using the modern eye as the overall "goal" of evolution.

 It's officially called prosopagnosia You are allowed to have radicals in the denominator.

But it's like simplifying the fraction 6/12. You could obviously leave it that way and it's perfectly correct. However, the fraction 6/12 has a much nicer form which is 1/2. 

So it's just a matter of what you call "nicer" for fractions with radicals. It turns out that we mostly prefer the radicals to be in the numerator than in the denominator. This is mostly an arbitrary convention, but it's somehow easier for computation purposes (dividing by 2 is easier than dividing by sqrt(2) ).

Plus it sometimes allows for simplification that were not obvious from the start.  Thank you for your submission!

If the black hole isn't rotating, then if a photon tries to orbit at 1.2 times the event horizon, due to the nature of the curved space-time, any small disturbance in orbit will cause it to either fall into the black hole or escape. No, the compositional makeup of a star and the planets that orbit it doesn't relevantly affect the orbit due to gravity. The Earth "knows" to orbit the sun because of the Sun's gravity due to mass. It's irrelevant what the Sun's mass is made of, just as it's irrelevant what the Earth is made of. It's all about mass and distance.

I think your downvotes were likely handed out due to the perceived absurdity of your question. It could almost be interpreted as trolling... All of those links would be great band names /r/foundtheprogrammer 20/20 would upvote again. I'm really late with this reply but thank you! 24 fps Yep, and if you think about it, from Earth's perspective, we'd lose gravity and be flung out to space the instant the Sun flickered out. In fact, it would be impossible for us to know the Sun flickered out before the Sun flickers out. So from our relative perspective, the Earth would continue along its orbit as long as the Sun still exists. If you reset the password for the user account, couldn't you use the new password to reveal other passwords in keychain? My dog doesn't eat *anything*, it eats any food. If I am doing DIY and drop something such as a screw the dog comes running over, usually gives it a sniff, and decides not to eat it. It does know what is food and what isn't, but *how*. Carrots, Cheese, and Cornflakes don't seem especially alike and don't resemble dog food but the dog still knows that these are fine things to eat.  A *hard disk* stores data by changing the orientation of the magnetic field in a small region on the disk. So there's the same amount of stuff present: same amount of atoms, same amount of electrons, same amount of energy.

It's like asking, does a coin have more mass if it's heads up or tails up? It's the same.

Now, other forms of storage are different. RAM and flash memory *do* represent values with different energy states, so it's conceivable that by changing the data you change the amount of mass-energy present, and that's where these answers about a tiny mass gain come from.

But note that whether a drive is "full" or "empty" is merely a way of *processing* the information present. All bits are either 0 or 1, so a drive is always storing the most information possible. Whether or not that information is meaningful and is assigned to a file is what determines how much space you are "using" on the drive versus what is "free" to use. Einstein mass.

 Basically you can't with electromagnetism. HOWEVER if you compress a spring, it will have more mass due to E = mc^2  
Absolutely negligible, but still there. Yeah you did all the math right until you converted 7788 ft/s into mph.  7788 ft/s is 5310 mph.  You've left out a factor of 60; you have calculated 88.5 miles per minute Hum, then you would either have a delay of one frame for every action (lerp from previous frame to the latest), or brutal shift in the pictures when your prediction don't matche the calculations (lerp from the latest to the next) No, the account password and keychain password are technically different. They're just the same when you create the account, and when you log into the account, you automatically use the same password to log in to your keychain. When you log into the account after resetting the password, you'll be prompted to type in the keychain password or create a new keychain. Inb4 /r/pcmasterrace &gt; most storage devices represent a 1 bit as a higher energy state than a 0 bit

This is not true with magnetic storage, which is by far the most common form of storage. It is true with flash drives and RAM, although there's no reason to assume 1 is represented by a higher energy state than 0, especially with flash. In fact, modern flash cells use multiple energy values (not just high and low) to store more bits per cell. Arguably, as /u/functor7 also pointed out, the standard handling of both radicals and complex numbers are subtle ways of showing that field extensions can be obtained from linear extensions. My dog won't eat metal either, I suppose they aren't that dumb. I assume there must be something in the way it smells on a very basic level that indicates what is and isn't food. I mean even something rotting and disgusting like 2 week old leftovers I'd forgotten to throw out he'd try to eat if I let him, straight from the garbage after I dumped it. Something that smells horrible. Unless it smells good to him, who knows. But metal or rocks? Suppose not. Wood though, or anything that isn't metal or rock, he'll give it a taste. we need a video of wood melting at high pressure. As /u/iorgfeflkd said, it's not really a speed and I see this trail of thought of comparing an expansion of space to the speed of light come up a lot and it's nonsensical, here's why:

Given any positive expansion (Not a retraction) of space you can always find two arbitrary points A and B for which light emitted at any of the two points cannot reach the other point. You just need to select these two arbitrary points in space far enough from each other such that the collective expansion of space in between the points exceeds the speed of light.

With that in mind, as soon as you have ANY expansion, ANY expansion at all whether it's really really slow, or crazy crazy fast, it's ultimately ALWAYS faster than light at some scale.

Thus we can say expansion of space is ALWAYS faster than light. What does that tell us in and of itself? Nothing. As other have said your eyes will focus at twenty feet, you can test this by putting something (like a sticker) on the mirror and focus on it, you will see the image in the mirror become blurry (but you need to be close enough for the effect to be significant) Arithmetic. High-speed, high-precision arithmetic. Sure - as I said I could not answer the question and really just wanted to add some basic information about visual processing that I myself found interesting and very counter-intuitive. I found it difficult to square the FPS analogy with what little I know of visual processing. so I'm glad to see that others have taken the time to try to answer the question :) In short, yes. At a basic level, paper is made up of many proteins. Proteins are known to have structure, in this case you would be manipulating the tertiary, or geometric structure of the proteins. Repeated folding will cause the "inter-protein" bonds to weaken. Thus, folding and re-folding paper many times will essentially break the bonds between proteins along that fold and will eventually cause a tear/rip.

This is a VERY basic explanation of a change in physical state. It's worth noting that there's also such a thing as a [hash collision]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_(computer_science\)) in which two distinct passwords hash to the same value.

So for some ridiculous example, it's possible that abcdefg and 1234567 could both hash to the same value under some made-up hash scheme that only exists for this example, making both of them valid passwords for the system.

It's that vulnerability that makes brute force attacks mildly easier. Thank you for your submission!

It's called visual acuity, typically about 1 arcminute (1/60th of a degree).

I can easily spot a human hair at the distance of one meter however. Which is closer to one arcsecond, not an arcminute. Nerve impulses are electrical in nature, but it's different than electricity in a wire. In a wire, the electric current is electrons moving from atom to atom. But in a nerve, it is a difference in electrical charge caused by the flow of sodium and potassium atoms into and out of the cell. The nerve impulse itself can really only travel inside a single neuron, though you can detect it externally. Even transferring the signal to another neuron is done with a different method, by triggering the release of chemicals that travel across a small space and stimulate the next cell by binding to receptors instead of directly transmitting an electrical signal.

If you want to tell that a neuron is firing and then do something about it, you basically put a probe on it and sense changes in electrical charge, and then fire off some other signal (electricity down a wire, light over an optical cable) when you detect the impulse. it wont make it through any subsequent orbits.

When i think about this, i assume that there is a singularity, as for what actually occurs, thats a mystery.  If we consider a photon travling tangentially to the "sphere" that is the singularity at a distance away from it that is still within the event horizon, than the gravitational field will cause the photon to travel in a path curving inwards towards the singularity.  

In normal orbits, this means the object is in an eliptical orbit and will speed up as it approaches the body it is orbitting.  With the photon, this is impossible, it is already at its maximum velocity, the speed of light.  If it went to "whip" around the singularity the same way an object "whips" around the body it orbits when in an elliptical orbit, the photon would never make it any farther away from the singularity.  This is due to the gravitational strength here being higher than it was at the original location of the photon, and yet the velocity of the photon being the same.  Thus the photon would just fall into the singularity and that would be that.

TL;DR: It is impossible to orbit more than once while within the  event horizon.  

PS: I don't know if its possible to have multiple degrading orbits between the event horizon and the photon sphere, before falling into it or being thrown out to infinity. The original statement was wrong. You should not be getting downvoted for asking a question here, even if it was based on a false pretense.

Which is pretty rare in snowstorms. But in a snowstorm the "Warm" air usually is in the 30s and very cold air blasts in over the top causing convection to take place. With the warm air moving upward electricity is generated in the storm.  another great one. these are the type of writers who can make science accessible to anyone, yet not reduce it down so it becomes boring to those who are in the field. &gt; the Earth is orbiting where the center of mass of the sun was 8 minutes ago

This is incorrect and is addressed in the [thread linked above](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kjp6z/does_gravity_travel_at_the_speed_of_light_if_the/cbpol6w). Exactly. The way I think about it is events things that haven't reached us yet haven't *really* happened yet, since even causality can't travel faster than the speed of light. I have the feeling the 5% claim is some form of anti-nuclear rhetoric.

Nuclear fuel is very energy dense as you pointed out and is one of the cheapest electricity sources, I think.

If it was merely 5% more energy than it went into extracting and processing it, it would be quite expensive. Cheers mate havent been to hyperphysics for over 10 years atleast. The easiest way of accepting this, is by extending the implications of *c* being the information speed limit in the Universe. If gravity would be allowed to propagate faster than *c*, you can quite easily invent a system that allows you to communicate faster than *c* as well, which is strictly forbidden and breaks causality. This is only ever a factor in directed beaming,  which is not heavily used and really it's not the antenna that is less sensitive but it is being calibrated to focus the radiation pattern to where more users are, not directly as a function of more users.  Mass  Weight Maybe just a slightly different way to ask the same question, but is there a limit on the frequency we can detect in other objects? If our neurons fire at 100 Hz, does that mean anything above that is indistinguishable - or is it more complicated than that?

I'm asking mainly because I've gotten into arguments with several people who say that it is impossible for the human eye to tell the difference between a 60 Hz or 120 Hz monitor. The "humans see at 60 fps" concept is very prevalent! Apologies if I was unclear. I was referring to the actual hair and nail proper, not the follicle or nail bed. This reminds me at least superficially of Giulio Tononi's "Integrated Information Theory" of consciousness. I have no clue about multidimensional calculus and such, but you might find that interesting. Wow!  Great response and thanks for the cool links....a little above my pay grade, but very interesting.

As a follow up, if light is emitted in a sphere radiating out and away from a centralized location, wouldn't we need to envision that sphere as the result of individual beams of photon creating the illusion of a sphere?  And if so, wouldn't there be a point far away where the beams would be spread out enough to see them individually?

Finally, if a star's light encounters no impediment, will the photons travel infinitely or will they eventually run out of gas an blip out of existence?

 Waterspouts (tornadoes over water) happen often along coastlines and large lakes.  Thousands a year globally. There were 66 over a 7 day period alone on the great lakes during the 2003 season.  Any compounds in the plants are destroyed and Carbon, Sulfur, Nitrogen are released to create alloys.  I happened to see one of my mom's old driver's licenses upside-down.  Seeing the face, I was almost certain it was my sister's license.  Just shows how my brain detected the similar features of their faces without being able to recognize who the face belonged to. What kind of masochist are you doing physics in imperial? 

Anyways, a better way to do it would be to get the mass of the ice moon, figure out how much gravitational potential energy you have on the surface then change that all into kinetic energy to find your velocity in the center of the moon, ignoring friction and drag. what does the warm air bring to the table? I see no logic or evidence to suggest that theory. Morphine works by mimicking endogenous opioids in the brain. Schizophrenia is a disease of anatomy (i.e. abnormally sized ventricles) and dopamine. There isn't much in common between them. Amphetamines, on the other hand, work primarily on dopamine which in turn (after prolonged and heavy use) can alter the brains natural dopamine system resulting in similar symptoms to schizophrenia. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as "amphetamine induced psychosis". Yes and no. 
In simple organisms, [we've recently developed ways to measure neuronal activity in the whole organism](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n5/abs/nmeth.2434.html).  So, in a sense, yes, you could poke a zebrafish and see what neurons fire.

In more advanced animals, we have to limit our field of view to a particular part of the body.  In humans, this type of imaging is not possible for ethical and engineering reasons.  So no.

But from a scientific standpoint, we have developed experimental paradigms to uncover the answer to your question.  In other words, you can record from single cells across the brain, and see which ones respond when you poke a person.  While that doesn't give you a physical count of neurons, it helps you understand the system.  Since the signal from your skin must travel through many neurons before it arrives at a 'pain' center, can work your way through that "circuit" experimentally.  Technology like optogenetics allows you to stimulate certain populations of cells to see what role particular intermediary cells might play in the whole circuit. 

To get back to pain though, we don't understand what causes pain.  We know how poking you leads to neuronal responses, and which regions of your brain are more active when something is more painful.  But we don't know why some people experience more pain than others, or what part of your brain is responsible for constant pain, and many other things related to pain, because it is difficult to experimentally operationalize.  How do you ask a zebrafish about their pain? V-Sauce works through it.

 Yes, brute force means to try every possible permutation until you find a match.  That may sound infeasible, but don't forget that most passwords are relatively short, and modern computers can easily perform [millions of hash comparisons per second](http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat/).

There are also tools that combine rainbow tables and dictionary attacks to drastically reduce the number of comparisons.  Here are two:

* [John the Ripper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Ripper)
* [oclhashcat](http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat/)

Another thing to consider is that an attacker trying to gain access to a system doesn't need to obtain the password for a specific user; all the attacker needs is a password for *any user on the system*.  This is known as a [Birthday attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack), and it works like this:

* User "alice" has password "kouMaeW2"
* User "bob" has password "Nocah4ho"
* User "chuck" has password "password"

The attacker obtains the hashed password list for the system and runs a password cracking tool against it.  Many tools have a list of common passwords, sorted by frequency, so they will immediately recognize the hash of chuck's easy password "password".

The attacker authenticates as chuck and uses an exploit to [escalate their privilege](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation) to an adminstrator.

In other words, a system is only as secure as the weakest password.

This is one of the reasons that many systems now require mixed upper and lower case characters, numbers, punctuation, and a minimum length for passwords; they are trying to make it more difficult for a password cracking tool to guess weak passwords quickly. Most people would contribute most kinds of bonding the the hormone "oxytocin" though there are many factors that influence that kind of behavior. Many solutions in computer programming are part of security through layers against a determined adversary, a non-security-expert implementor (programmer, sysadmin, etc), accidental mistakes made along the way, or all of the above. Some of them are exercises in future proofing, as we have learned long ago that "good enough" doesn't necessarily matter, as systems are left in place much longer than originally anticipated.

From worst to best, and I'm using md5 but please use uniquely salted [SHA-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) or [PBKDF2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) or [bcrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)

* You have an [unsalted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29) password hash, for example:

    echo -n 'password' | md5
    
    5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99

You simply download the [rainbow table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) for MD5 and start iterating passwords. As you find a "hit" you only start iterating passwords whose hash result begins with "5" then "5f" etc. You know that the password field is limited to N-characters (even a very high number) so the field of possible passwords is going to be shrinking dramatically as you find hash bits.

* You have a statically salted password hash, where the salt is the same for your entire password catalog. 

    echo -n 'mysaltissalty-password' | md5
    
    mysaltissalty-$806b0800409894bce073f46b687cf1c5

Now to get the keys to the kingdom you have to generate a rainbow table once for "mysaltissalty-", and then apply the previous process. This is obviously a lot more work, but only has to be done once. Common (non-random) salts have rainbow tables available, but not many. This is out of the realm of the casual attacker, but not from a funded one, or one with access to a giant compute cluster (say, a botnet.)

* You have a uniquely salted password hash, where the salt is unique for your entire password catalog. 

    echo -n '2ojsajf0913n-password' | md5
    
    2ojsajf0913n-$3d7288053c19a7ae86cc7539b2970123

Now you must do a pure brute force attack against every password hash on which you may have gotten your hands. This is the highest cost operation for this basic single pass mode.

* You have a uniquely salted password hash, where the salt is unique for your entire password catalog, and you hash it 1000 times. 
    
    echo -n '2ojsajf0913n-password' | md5 | md5 | md5 | md5 | md5
    
    5$2ojsajf0913n-password$28321fce1596b4e8acd485f81a73be15

Same as above, but with 5 times the work. (Pretend we did it for 1000 iterations, and added the salt back in each time.) This is meant to prevent future advances in computing power from making your hash obsolete before it can be rotated.

Bear in mind that this is all to protect against the improbable, but it is not impossible, and as security through layers. Many times breaches occur due to one weak point in the system granting a sophisticated attacker inferences about points in another part of the system which are more strongly secured.

None of this is intended to prevent a [rubber hose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis) [attack](http://xkcd.com/538/).

 You're both wrong, and the poor guy getting downvoted is the only person getting it right.  True, the transmitter on a cell tower high a much higher total RF power output, but if I have 100 W and can dedicated it to a single 10 MHz channel vs. a few vs. many channels each having 10 MHz, I'm absolutely varying the amount of transmit power available per channel.  When performing link budget calculations for each customer (cell phone), this contributes to the S in the S/N of the tower-client link.  The cellphone has a much lower transmit power but that power is dedicated to a single channel. what does escape to infinity mean?
 Great answer....thanks.

So how do we reconcile the idea of seeing a star's past when we see its light?  

If we stand on earth and see a star's light, we are seeing the light that left 500,000 years ago (for example).....now if we look through a telescope, are we seeing 500,000 minus the magnification of the telescope...so say 250,000 years ago? A very qualified "yes". 

Newton's Laws are not fundamental laws of the universe. They are very good approximations of what happens at the scale and velocities where everyday life happens. They quickly fall apart at very small scales, very high speeds, or under high gravity. 

So, it would contradict the approximate model of the universe you are using. It's not "violating" anything, it's just saying you picked the wrong model and should be using [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) instead.  It is really the ratio between the rotating object and the motion of the observer, but this would make sense. Engine vibration likely have a large range, wide enough to observe this. I dug into this after seeing propellers do this while in another turbo prop. I thought it shouldn't be possible and felt a matrix like moment. Also the planet would be crushed and shredded long before getting to the event horizon so... This is interesting, it would be very interesting to correlate the harmonics of the notes with the frequency of the LCD or other strobing displays. I bet cell phone based tuner users have observed this. The visual cortex is retinotopically organized, meaning that spacial information is preserved by the physical structure of the brain. Neuroscientists use the term voxel to describe the smallest unit of visual input, If I remember correctly. There is an overall calculation to somewhat describe the visual field, but it's not necessarily the same as a monitor's resolution, it's more like a camera's resolution, which indicates the density of visual receptors that would receive input from light from the lens.   To explain: the orbital velocity needed to maintain a stable orbit would need to exceed the speed of light.   The eye is capable of perceiving stimuli subconsciously at a certain speed, and consciously at a certain speed. I can't remember the exact speeds, but I think 100ms is near the threshold of conscious perception of stimuli. A word flashed on a screen very quickly, for example. How do you know what's food and what isn't? Thank you for your answer. Leave the black hole's immediate vicinity/influence and continue off arbitrarily far into the distance. 

As opposed to a highly eccentric orbit, which could take you out to a considerable distance away, but would still mean eventually returning closer. That was a good explanation, slightly related, can you explain how this also affects the saturation of a gas and solid in liquids of varying temperatures.

A cold liquid can also hold more dissolved gas, likewise a warm liquid can hold more dissolved solids. Is it the same principle at play here too, or is something different at work? damn you must be an eye doctor or something. &gt; envision that sphere as the result of individual beams of photon creating the illusion of a sphere?

You can model the radiation being given off by a star as spherical waves, the photon model isn't all that necessary. In some sense, sure these spherical waves are made up of photons, but if the photons are being given off in all directions radially, why use harder math for indistinguishably the same physics?

&gt; will the photons travel infinitely or will they eventually run out of gas

Photons don't need gas to keep going, if I throw a baseball in intergalactic space, it's going to keep going forever as well since nothing is going to change its motion. Now the bigger question is whether or not you'll actually measure these photons. Due to the metric expansion of space, the distant light from distant galaxies are redshifted (lower energy) because they're receding away from us and pay a relativity toll.

While some distant light simply hasn't had enough time to reach us, there are even more distant objects for which their light will never reach us--as the rate of expansion scales with distance. If you want to read up on expansion, it's a very rich topic and we've had some smart people writer interesting things in the FAQ which you can find in the sidebar. I don't have a link, but a gaming enthusiast compiled a bunch of information a while back, and the math pretty much showed that you can gain useful information that you actually have time to process up to about 300 FPS.  The information gained decreases at an exponential rate as you gain more FPS, though, so after about 120 FPS, the information gained is pretty inconsequential. Gravity is an infinite range force, so to truly "leave" the black hole, you'd need to move infinitely far away to no longer feel it's pull. That's what you technically mean by escaping the black hole. The same can be said of anything though. If you move far away from things, they still pull gravitationally, it's just a tiny amount. To truly leave the influence of an object, you must be infinite distance away. Doing maths, you often put the centre of the black hole at the origin of your co-ordiantes, and so escaping to infinity means moving infinitely far away from the black hole.

TL;DR. It means you can move away from the black hole. I think it is semantics, because it boils down to how you define "work". If the only criterion is that it provides a self-consistent theory capable of making predictions, then effective gravity "works". But like you said, it is very unsatisfying, and certainly not the last word. But I take your point that I could've given the wrong impression. http://www.centuryinter.net/vansmith/Page1.html
The diagram in the circulation section is good. Whales crazy http://imgur.com/ZrJBMZi I'm not sure why it was you, and not the strictly wrong information you were replying to that got the down votes. Ah!  Thanks.  It was late and I couldn't reconcile 24 minutes and 89 mph. Perfect read for those with a casual interest in neurological disorders: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Mistook_His_Wife_for_a_Hat Depends on how you define down ;) The difference between 60Hz and 120 Hz depends on the characteristics of the monitor and the display you are presenting, rather than limits of the visual system.

For example, the [flicker fusion rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fusion_threshold#Technological_considerations) is a frequency when something is turning off and on becomes perceived as continuous.  It's not a single number, but dependent on the light and technology used to deliver the light.

Similarly, motion blur and other "features" will enhance perception.

The best way to think about vision is not to think about discrete frames, but an evolution of perception over time.  For example, if the maximum firing rate of one neuron was 1 Hz, that doesn't mean the whole system operates at 1Hz, because there's no global clock to synchronize it like in a monitor.  Some cells may be firing every second, but another cell next to it might be delayed by a half second... 

Now, there are perceptual limits - hard rules about what you can and cannot perceive.  But in vision, these are strongly dependent on the environment and type of display.  A good example is [contrast sensitivity](https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/PenetrantTest/Introduction/contrastsensitivity.htm) - at some point, you will perceive an alternating patch of light and dark as gray, but where that exact line is depends on where you are positioned, how much light there is in your room, and how much light is coming from the display.

My advice would be to stop getting into arguments about visual system limits. Thank you No, this is incorrect, but for pretty subtle reasons outlined [here](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/grav_speed.html) and [here](http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9909087v2.pdf). 

Earth orbits the current(1) position of the sun. If the Earth orbited the 8-minutes-delayed position (retarded position) then the Earth-Sun system would not be stable, as gravity would not be a central purely central force and would not conserve angular momentum. 

It gets subtle because in general relativity, gravity is *not* a purely central force, but has velocity-dependent terms. Very roughly speaking, GR predicts that spacetime curvature depends not only on mass, but on energy and momentum flux. So, the effects of gravity felt on Earth depend not only on where the Sun was 8 minutes ago, but also on where the sun was going 8 minutes ago, in a way which works out to act like the effects depend on the *current* position. 

(1) technically, an extrapolation of the retarded position Because all food is composed of the same basic groups of organic molecules - carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids (fats) - all of which your dog can smell and thus know it smells like what they are genetically programmed to like / need.

That said, your dog has probably just learned to associate you and things in your hand with food.  I'm reading a great book by Kip Thorne:  The Science of Interstellar.  Thorne is the theoretical physicist behind the quite accurate science portrayed in the movie.  The book definitely makes you think.  But Thorne does a great job explaining relativity, space-time, and the behavior of black holes. And it's fun. Thank you for your submission!

What's smaller than that? And smaller? Still smaller? What is the absolute smallest measurable increment of time? Let's call that T.
___
Have you ever seen a visualization of the 4th dimension? Basically you live outside of Space and Time. You can be anywhere, anytime. If you examed something, it would kind of look like a worm, where the tail is the creation/starting of the worm, and the head is the death of/end of the worm.
___
So, now we know what the 4th dimension looks like and we know T is the smallest form of measurable increments of time.

This is how we see. Anything we look at, that is NOT in motion (this isn't true because time is always moving) then your FPS is basically 0, nothing is moving.

But lets say something starts moving. Our FPS would be the smallest measurable increments of time over the period of that thing moving.

We do see in the 4th dimension, just limited by the decay of things and we have a measuring scale of 1 second, minute, hour, day, month years, etc.
___
TL;DR: Whatever is the smallest measurable increment of time, is how much FPS our eyes see. If radioactive materials weren't dangerous, you wouldnt need the shielding whch would cut down on 99% of the weight Popping a pimple exposes it to air. It's like a small wound in your skin that can let in external bacteria.  In general, I think most dermatologists will tell you to avoid popping pimples so your body can heal them faster.  That said, sometimes that pressure release is irresistible. Thanks.
Again.

Fascinating subject.  And of course, it seems that every answer leads to a hundred more question.

Seems I need to do some homework.  :) Just had eye surgery and one eye is covered right now. Seeing double though, a lot of the time. And seeing these quadrupleish. Mooooooosh.  You shouldn't shoot from the hip in /r/science. Also the planet would disintegrate and not fall into the hole like in golf. To recharge the USB device. I assume the water in the food [sublimates out into vapor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_%28phase_transition%29) and then condenses at the edges of the empty spaces in the container. Also keep in mind that your freezer doesn't maintain a constant temperature. Things already in the freezer might melt slightly when you put warm food in. I agree with this pretty much completely. Still I think it's worthwhile to try to figure out the mechanistic aspects of perception - as far as possible. It's possible to study how the eye or brain works and get an incredibly detailed description of the neural correlates of vision. But when you talk about "seeing" in the most general sense, it includes much more than just the visual information, and that's when we get to the realms of subjectivity and philosophy.

We know a great deal about how visual information is analyzed and how different features are processed by different brain areas etc. But it's probably not a coincidence that it's the "binding problem" of visual processing (how are all the features combined, resulting in a unified conscious perception) that still eludes scientists. On the last sentence:

With first person video games, I've always wondered why they limit your FOV to looking straight ahead. Surely it would make more sense to create a very wide environment that forces you to view the gameplay more like a real world, thus making it a more immersive experience?

Saying that, not everyone has a large TV, so I guess that's a limitation. There still nothing more frustrating than a tunnel-vision FOV. There's got to be a compromise. I'm not exactly sure what you're asking. But Yang-Mills theory is basically a generalization of the principles that we use to understand the electromagnetic force. Because these principles were so successful with electromagnetism, it seemed natural to try to apply them to the other forces - the weak and strong nuclear forces. This generalization has largely succeeded, with the Standard Model being the crown jewel of modern physics.

"Mass gap" generally refers to the gap between the energy of the ground state and the energy of the first excited state (i.e. a particle) of the theory. Such a particle is said to have a mass. Actually it isn't that difficult to do. As long as there is some way to automatically launch the application when the thumb drive is inserted it can do anything it wants. Including running in the background and installing itself to any other drives on the system. I've seen this technique used in malware as early as 2008, and I'm sure others have used it before then. So if he had the ability to create something like that in the first place then he could've easily added that functionality to it also.

Heck there was a worm application going around back when we used floppy's that used a similar trick. It used the boot-sector of the floppy to autorun when the floppy was inserted.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoned_%28computer_virus%29 Maybe this has been discussed before somewhere, but it just struck me and I haven't had a chance to look it up yet....but, is that what Buzz Lightyear means when he says "To infinity, and beyond!"?  If so...damn them Pixar folks were deep. Is this what speggettification is? I've heard that space can bend at whichever speed it want ( warp drive , expansion of the universe)  and that gravity is just bent space. Why then is the gravity exerted by the sun's curvature of space bound by the speed of light? Aaah, I see! Thanks for the explanation! guest account with next-to-no permissions to do anything. ;-) &gt; As for movement, in the relatively late stages of processing there happens a split between information on "what" and object is and "where" it is in space (presumably including movement). These parts of visual information are even processed by anatomically clearly separate pathways. So as you can see the brain works entirely differently than a video recording with frames :)

Basically the only bottleneck is the brain and the whole nervous system. Eye itself detects light, that enters/moves/shift at light's speed. So in theory there is cap, but very, very hard to measure or detect and it's most likely subjective/personal.

This being said, the more FPS a game has the "better" you see. The one thing that the other posts have not mentioned is the tidal forces that are place on an object that is near any mass.  The forces that are in place when an object gets close to a black hole are so large that the side of the object that is facing the black hole would be pulled exponentially harder then the side facing away from the black hole.  This would cause the planet to be ripped apart and destroyed.  [The Roche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit) is what is used to determine the minimum orbital distance of celestial bodies.  Depending on the size of the black hole and the size of the planet would determine the Roche limit.  I can guarantee you that that limit is well outside of the event horizon.

A good show that simplifies black holes is "How the Universe Works: Expanded".  There is a specific episode on black holes.    I read somewhere (I don't remember where) that the human eye can differentiate two independent objects if they are separated by more than 0.5 mm.  Unsurprisingly, a nerve impulse needs to travel within a nerve fiber.

Yeah, that maybe sounds a bit tautological but give me a moment. The way the transmission of neuronal signals within a nerve works is not via electron transmissions like in most used electrical conductors. Neither is a photon based conductor like glass fiber applicable. A nerve depends on so called action potentials. the prerequisite is a phenomenon called a membrane potential. A membrane potential is a very specific distribution of ions (electrically charges particles) along the cell membrane of a nerve. The main involved ions here are sodium ions (positively charged) and potassium ions (positively charged) as well as chloride ions (negatively charged) and organic anions (negatively charged). These ions have a specific distribution along the membrane depending if you look inside the cell or outside the cell, a balance which is upheld by a) permanently opened potassium channels and b) a pump that exchanges sodium and potassium ions for energy, the so called Na-K-ATPase. Two forces counteract each other: the accumulation of same electrical charges within one side (similar to a magnet, similar charges repel each other) and the concentrations of same particles on one side (you need more energy the more you want to concentrate a particle on one side of a membran as opposed to the other). Both of these aspects combine to form the so called electrochemical potential. The bottom line is that during the resting membrane potential, the inside of the cell is electrically negatively charged and filled with potassium ions (but the organic anions which can't escape the cell far outweigh the sum of the charge of the potassium ions, hence the negative charge), while the outside of the membrane is positively charged and filled with sodium ions (the only relevant counter charge here is chloride ions, but sodium outweighs). 

During action potential, voltage gated sodium channels (meaning channels that open when exposed to certain charges) open when exposed to a voltage higher than the opening threshold and let sodium ions cross the membrane because of the electrical and chemical gradient. the influx of positive charges inside the cell causes the voltage of the cell to go into the positives, a process called depolarisation. Neighboring voltage gated sodium channels are then activated from this increase in voltage/potential and the signal gets transmitted along the membrane in one direction. An action potential is then ended by closing of the sodium channels due to positive voltage and the Na-K-ATPase pumps out all sodium ions that are still within the cell, causing the voltage to into the negatives (repolarisation). If you were to [plot the graph of the action potential](http://www.uic.edu/classes/bios/bios100/lectures/action_potential.jpg) (voltage over time), you would see a base line starting at -70 mV, then forming a spike with the peak at 30 mV which then goes down to -70 mV again (and even overshoots a little into -80 mV, called hyperpolarisation). During the entirety of the action potential, another one can not be caused at the same time in the same place (refractory period), which makes sure the information only ever travels in one direction and not in the direction the information came from. (And guess what! there are even more mechanisms to increase the speed of transmission, but I'm not sure if my description is concise enough that I should risk complicating my post, so just ask if you're interested)

Now the thing with action potentials is that their amplitude has no effect on the information they carry; an action potential either is or isn't. In computational terms, an action potential would represent a bit, and the lack of action potential would be similar to a 0 bit. Information is therefore encoded in the patterns and the frequency of action potentials reaching whatever terminal structure is calculating them into a full information (the upper limit of frequency is the length of the refractory period of an action potential because no new action potential can be caused within the refractory period). The information transmitted in nerve fibers is digital, if you will. (note that this doesn't apply to every single type of nerve fibers! some nervous networks like the retina work depending on the amplitude of voltage and are therefore analogue. Sensor potentials and synaptic potentials are amplitude modulated as well. This is really just taking about transmission within a singular fiber!)

You don't need to fully understand the process, but you should realize what goes into neuronal transmission is a rather complex amalgam of biochemical and biophysical systems concipated unlike any other technical conductor we artificially use. The "medium" of transmission is the action potential traveling across the resting membrane potential, the integral structural element are the gated and non gated ion channels as well as the Na-K-ATPase pump. But you can still stimulate nerves with electrical stimuli because they would open the voltage gated sodium channels and facilitate action potentials (nerve transmission is still loosely based on electricity, but via the aforementioned mechanisms). However, nerve fibers are definitely not optical systems. I think the answer is actually yes, but only briefly. 

Imagine an object already in a stable orbit but outside the event horizon of the black hole (not hard to imagine just look at our galaxy).  

Next, consider that the black hole has now attracting some additional matter to it, perhaps a large amount, that extends its event horizon outside the existing stable orbit.  Now the event horizon is just an arbitrary boundary that we made up, the object doesn't care or see any effect.  

At first anyway.

It will orbit the black hole just as it did, but each period on its accelerating phase it will be limited by the speed of light and its orbit will become shorter as it comes closer to the black hole with each period.

Since most matter doesn't enter a black hole exactly on plane with the singularity, many objects trapped inside the event horizon are expected to behave this way. How about Dynamic Range, can we quantify that? Will camera sensor technology ever match or surpass our natural ability?  Not really, spaghettification is about tidal forces, the fact that there is more gravitational acceleration occurring for objects (including atoms) closer to the mass than those further away because gravity follows an inverse square of distance, so when dealing with objects of extreme mass, at close distances gravity can exert a force that overwhelms all other forces, including the forces that keep atoms together. &gt; ...and reinstall a new OS and start fresh.

for the truly paranoid, don't forget to reflash the BIOS/firmware of your devices too ;-) look up "thunderbolt firmware hack" for an example of such shenanigans.

**security rule zero: never give an untrusted third party unsupervised physical access to your electronic gadgets.** :-) Related question: If it's possible for light to achieve a stable orbit above a black hole, could light accumulate along that orbit, creating a "wall" of light? How much energy could potentially be stored around a black hole in this way? Well sure, you can stick a wind turbine on top of your car, *useful* is a different question.

Say you have a ballpark power coefficient (Cp) of 0.3 for a small wind turbine with 1m^2 frontal area. If you're traveling at 10m/s, the power generation is 1/2 x Cp x density x V^3 x area = 150 watts. That's plenty to charge a laptop, but it's not going to be much use in moving a car. what about quantum entanglement then? Within the event horizon, "all roads lead to Rome."
 Games need high FPS because that helps with input latency (delay from button push to game showing animation of its response to the button).  TV is only 30 FPS because higher than that isn't noticable because it doesn't respond to you so you don't anticipate action the same way.  Dat "cinematic" motion blur. You can't communicate with it, and whether it counts as instant depends on how you look at it If the sun did something like instantly moved 1AU, then I can't say what would happen, because that is simply non physical.

If the sun is moving at a more or less constant velocity, and travels a distance of 1AU, then we would be orbiting its new position. Not one delayed by ~8 minutes.

The reason for this is that it gravity depends not just on energy, but also on momentum, and the momentum of the sun, eight minutes ago, which is reaching us now, determines where the sun is now. As you mentioned, damage to the muscle tissue is required for strength building. Why? Because the individual myofibrils, with their component sarcomeres, become over-stretched or may even break during intense exercise. This sets off a chemical cascade that not only involves remodeling (and strengthening) the muscle, but also causes inflammation. Another factor would be the high degree of oxidative stress and the large amount of reactive oxidative species created by mitochondria in actively exercising muscle. This is another cause of inflammation. 

The actual strength building process and hardening of the muscles due to increased muscle mass does not happen immediately after a workout. The notion that muscles are firmer immediately after a work out is due to inflammation. There is a large amount of blood in the area around the exercising muscle, supplying oxygen to ameliorate any [oxygen debt](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/oxygen+debt) any to replenish muscle stores of glycogen. 

You might be wondering why the inflammation makes your muscles feel harder, especially as things like bug bites do not feel firm in most cases. It is because many muscle groups are compartmentalized within very dense layers of fascia, forming muscular compartments. This is almost like a compression sock for your muscles. It increases the muscle group's ability to generate force, but the muscular compartment's fascia (covering) is not very "stretchy" which is why it feels firm. 
By way of analogy, car tires are filled with air, but also feel firm.  You know how I can settle this debate?

Go into a game like call of duty or quake for instance.  Set the fps to 30, then to 100, then to 125, then to 250, then to 333 and keep raising it.

Then tell me the eye can only detect 30fps. Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been automatically removed because you did not include a question mark "?" in your title.

You have an object. That object takes up an amount of space. That object is surrounded by a fluid - maybe air, maybe water, maybe something else. That fluid has a density. So, for example, water has a density of about 1000 kg/m^3

Now, the object has displaced the fluid; where you have object, you can't have fluid. Where I'm sitting now there is a me-sized lump of meat, rather than the air that would otherwise fill the space.

The important thing here is that buoyancy is controlled simply the difference between the weight of the object, and the weight of the fluid that would otherwise fill the space.  If the object is heavier, it sinks, if the object is lighter, then it will float upward and the denser fluid will flow in below it to fill the space. Gravity is like that (heavy things sink).

So, if I have a 1 cubic meter lump of rock with a density of 2500 kg/m^3 it's going to sink ^^^^^like ^^^^^a ^^^^^stone in water. It weighs 2500 kg, rather than the 1000 kg that the displaced water would have. In fact, we don't even need to know the volume - we can just use density (because density tells you how many kg of something there are in *any* volume). If I have a piece of wood with a density of 900 kg/m^3 it will float. 1010 kg/m^3 it will sink.

Buoyancy itself is considered a force which works opposite to gravity, so something which floats is buoyant. Anything which sinks can be described as having negative buoyancy. Something which is exactly the same density as its host fluid can be described as neutrally buoyant. An example of this might be a fish in the sea - it can bob along inside the water column within sinking or floating. Why wouldn't you just use an alternator?  A wind turbine would just be a convoluted way of converting your engine's power into electrical power: as the incident air would slow your car down. What about an unstable orbit that is only decaying very slowly? The earth "knows" where the sun is because its momentum shows up in the gravitational field.  Thank you for your submission!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* I see, so it's only a hypothetical scenario to describe what it would take to escape the black hole. My understanding of black holes is minimal, though I'm interested to know what these tidal forces are about. In addition to Overunderrated's answer, unless you're driving through a windstorm, almost all of the air spinning the turbine is coming from the car's motion. As a result, the energy that the turbine is pumping into your electric gadgets is ultimately coming from the car's engine.

If you're going to harness the car's engine power for charging, you may as well get a car charger and plug your gadgets into that. You should also point out that it's easier and more efficient to draw power directly from the drive train. 1920x1080 is the max a a human can see, no difference after that. account information has to be stored *somewhere*, and it's a lot easier for the operating system (OS) if that somewhere is a standard place -- so it usually is.

normally, the native OS protects this information from access by just anyone, but if you temporarily boot from some other OS, then your hard drive can appear as "just some more storage" to that OS, and then specificially written programs can pilfer the data that would normally be off-limits, and then do some analysis on it to extract "secret" info. Of course if you run as a standard user, then even if the low level windows bits and bobs installs the driver for the USB pen, the currently logged-in session will still not have access to the area where the passwords are stored and you'll be safe. The neat thing is due to relativity we would see the planet slow down and as it actually crossed the event horizon it would appear to simply stop moving. It would begin to redshift more and more until it just faded away.  I think the easiest way to explain it is using Newton's Second Law. Since Force = Mass x Acceleration, then if both forces are equal and opposite, both Mass x Acceleration must be equal. So in the case of the gravitational force between you and an asteroid, your mass is much less than that of the asteroid, so proportionally, your acceleration would be much greater relative to the asteroid. Both experience the same force, it just affects you in a more significant, noticeable way. Just curious, can light have a relatively stable elliptical orbit around a black hole? Best to have a short USB extension cable with the data lines cut. Wow, TIL. Thank you for such an in depth explication. 

So let's say that a stray neutron star went wizzing through the solar system at a high velocity. From what I understand, as long as the star kept a relatively constant velocity, we would feel gravity in a different direction than where we actually observed the star to be, since the gravity will be pulling with an offset force? Doesn't this depend on the mass of the black hole? A supermassive black hole would presumably have very gentle tides at its event horizon since tidal forces at the event horizon would go as 1/M^2.  There isn't one answer as some people's eye process information faster than others. Some parts, of some human eyes can see 200Hz.

And something like 1-2% of the population (US survey) can see the blinking of many modern car LED.  A larger percentage reports headaches from them - so they are aware them, but can't actually see them.) Dark-focus, or resting point of Accomodation (RPA) has a focal point of ~67 cm (Leibowitz and Owens, 1978).
This is measured with a laser optometer. Did I not read somewhere that in a rotating black hole there are paths that exist within the event horizon that things going the speed of light could orbit without falling in (but not escaping of course) &gt; The low-level USB drivers talk to your BIOS directly and can install the code needed to use the USB drive (Plug and play).

Not on Linux. :-)  You're still vulnerable, though: the "USB drive" can also pretend to be a keyboard and type things at your machine, for example. Yes, this is called the Photon Sphere:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere

Note however that even though there is this "wall of light" around the black hole, you wouldn't see it, because the photons that compose the photon sphere are in orbit around the black hole, and as a result they do not travel to your eye or telescope. I really like the N64. But they never used that slot enough. Nintendo always stays true to themselves. But they lose me when I can't use a game machine to launch a DVD or BR. 

This does not stop from buying Nintendo, but it does bug me when I can't sit at my couch and use the same machine to watch a movie.  Plutonium is dense. More dense than lead. That's still a huge lump of stuff.  Hi, I'd just like to mention everyone is wrong. Black holes have never been proven to exist. So we don't know. This is a very clear and easy to follow explanation. Thank you for taking the time to write it. Photons generally travel in straight lines, obviously this isn't the case with black holes but regardless: Above the photon sphere, a photon's trajectory will merely be curved by the black hole. Below the photon sphere it's trajectory will curve inwards to the point where the fall into the event horizon, at which point the photon will essentially be gone.

Imagine a whirlpool, but with photons. You can row a boat past one, and it might turn you a bit, but if you get to close, you'll go round and round and round and die.

The link provided by iorgfeflkd below does a pretty good job of explaining it. To prevent bulk dictionary attacks. That's fascinating!  Definitely an advantageous piece of "software" in the brain. I'm probably describing it incorrectly, but this is how I understand tidal forces in a black hole; something falling into a black hole is experiencing more gravitational attraction on the surface nearest the hole while the surface farther away is experiencing less. The resultant region of shearing gravitational attraction is what does the spaghetting. Since gravity propagates as a wave can refer to the two differing areas as tidal forces. Leaving orbit and flying off into the vacuum of space. Not the bookcases, though. Certainly is.  From an efficiency perspective however you'd be better of harnessing that energy straight from the engine like an alternator does.

Many large aircraft actually have something exactly for this purpose.  Called the Ram Air Turbine, it's a fan that can be extended into the airflow in emergency situations such as the aircraft running out of fuel.  The Fan turns a turbine to generate power for systems on the glide down.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_air_turbine
  Not at all. He just means its moving away from the black hole. It's just escaping the effective influence of the thing. yep, called waterspouts 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterspout
 Yesssss, precioussssssss... Is it someone we knowses? Is this still true of rotating black holes? Could a black hole's ergosphere rotate an object effectively faster than light allowing it to orbit within 1.5 radii? Yes, but it would increase your fuel consumption and be less efficient than plugging into the cigarette lighter that runs off the alternator. fucken space dawg I get the description, I'm not sure if I would use the term "tidal forces" to describe it though, acts more like quick sand. Are photons actually being "stored"? Doesn't this mean, if something falls into the photon sphere, it would be bombarded with photons? Well likely Beryllium Copper. BE itself is too soft. This isn't resolved.  Gravitons have never been observed.  The curved space time interpretation accurately describes macroscopic interactions.  But since all the other forces are mediated by force carrying particles and quantum field theories accurately describe the atomic and subatomic realms, many suspect gravity should/could be quantized as well. &gt;where light can orbit in a circle

Can or does? Does all light orbit there or does some stay there and some fall in? If the latter, what makes some light fall in while other photons stay in orbit? Yes. For instance, superfluidity cannot be described using classical fluid mechanics, which is based on Newton's laws. Although "wrong" may be too strong of a word. Perhaps betters words for classical physics are "incomplete" and "limited" (although useful for many problems). This is a really great "ELI5" (more like ELI16, but that's how it goes).  Thanks for explaining it. Are there any ideas on what happens to things passing through the photon sphere? Is there enough energy there to cook you (or worse) after turning into spaghetti?  I can't imagine any significant protein content making it through a pulp and paper mill... paper is made primarily of cellulose, a polysaccharide.  This is also true for the gravitational effects of a single hydrogen atom.  I've always wondered, how does the alternator harness the drive train's power without overtly hampering the fuel-efficiency?  The other 2 answers so far are correct, I'd just like to contribute with a small detail:

&gt; reenter the earth's atmosphere,

Actually they never left the atmosphere. They separated at an altitude of 45 km while the conventional edge of space (the Krmn line) is at 100 km.
 You'll find out in 8 minutes, but probably not due to the change in gravity.  By "disappear" you seem to mean "become mass-less".  That would mean converting the mass of the Sun into energy via E=mc^2  .  That's a prodigious quantity of energy.  That much energy, even in some sort of beam that's not pointed at us, is going to have widespread effect on the solar system.  It would be a bad day. Thank you for your submission!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* Does this mean that the gravity of another nearby super-massive object can "dent" the photon sphere and break it up? Why do:

engine -&gt; drivetrain -&gt; wheels -&gt; ground/air -&gt; propeller/turbine -&gt; generator

When you can do:

engine -&gt; generator?

Each additional step adds complexity and reduces efficiency. Also, your car already has an engine -&gt; generator system with a battery for storage built in... I think most of the hardening effects are primarly due to the differences caused by oil vs water vs etc, and the trace elements in these mixtures would have little to no effect. You'd have to do a study to see if any of these have a real impact on hardness vs plain water / oil /etc quench. Jesus christ this is the best website in the world We tried it both ways (dryer versus hanging clothes indoors with dehumidifier) and it uses about the same amount of electricity. A smart dehumidifier only turns on when the humidity in the room gets too high. The only issue I take with this response is that we don't actually know what occurs inside an event horizon.  While GR can model inside a black hole with the right co-ordinates, there is no way to test if the theory is still valid at that point.  

So I would simply say it's unlikely there are orbits in the black hole, but it's impossible to say for sure. Sorry! I meant to say that basal cell carcinoma arises from the epidermal stem cells within the hair bulge. This is what I was taught in lecture by a dermatologist black-and-white; seeing through the literature available though it seems that the cell of origin of BCC is still very conflicted between interfollicular basal cells and hair bulge cells, and in fact the different morphologies of BCC may be attributable to different cells of origin altogether. See [here](http://www.nature.com/milestones/skinbio7/full/skinbio20144a.html) for a brief summary of what's known (under "cell of origin"). &gt; Only at the photon sphere can light make an orbit that returns to the same place.

Does that mean a photon can't orbit a black hole in a non-circular (elliptic) orbit? In physics we learned that escape speed is independent of direction, it's different for black holes? That makes sense. I mean the time and pretty spent mining for it, The warm air brings convection. The upward motion of the warmer moist air through the cold dryer air above creates (in simple terms) the charge necessary for lighting. This generally happens at the boundaries between them (mixing zone).  Relativity. Sinking objects still experience positive buoyancy. It's the difference between buoyancy and gravity that determines whether it sinks. Even sinking objects have buoyancy pushing them up, it just isn't enough to beat gravity If you reach escape velocity while pointing straight into the earth's surface, you are not escaping.

However, a vertical launch has the same escape velocity regardless of what country launches the shuttle. That's what the phrase means. It can, as long as the periapsis (lowest point) is outside the photon sphere. I think the important part is that glucose is a lot more dense of a material than ethanol. Molar mass of glucose is 180.1559 g/mol and molar mass of ethanol is 46.06844 g/mol.

This means that if you start with 1 mol of glucose, you are starting with approximately 720kCal. If you turn it entirely into 1 mol of ethanol, you end up with approximately 322kCal of ethanol.  It varies from human to human due to eye geometry, some people are "near-sighted".  The default for "normal 20/20" vision is at infinity.  There are little muscles in the eye that deform the crystalline lens by pulling on it.  As you get older, the lens gets stiffer and you can only see the resting focal distance.  It's called [Presbyopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyopia ), and it's the reason old folks need reading glasses. How am I taking this too seriously? You said that you don't want to be immortal for much the same reason that a suicidal person says they don't want to live, and that made me pretty friggin uncomfortable. This is easily proved wrong, or at least a gross over simplification. The speed of light is absolutely fast enough to escape our gravity, but if a rock sped at the speed of light directly at the earth, then it would not escape. It would crash, and be painful. It's called that because it's the force that causes tides.  Not really, Venus has a very thing atmosphere.

Lets put some numbers. Venus' atmosphere is 4.810^20 kg, which is 93 times the atmosphere of Earth. The mass is 4.86810^24. This means that the atmosphere is only about 0.0098% of the planet. Far from a gas giant.

On Earth most of this mass is distributed amongst the atmosphere, the oceans, all living things (we are made mostly from CO2 and H2O) and a notable bit underground (which we humans have diligently been digging up and releasing back to the atmosphere). The load from the alternator is just small compared to the load of getting the car down the road quickly.  People can get fuel economy improvements by disconnecting it. Well think about this: the reason that's true is because an object will gain energy/speed if it is travelling back towards the star/planet, unless it is already travelling at the speed of light. It can't go faster than light, so direction is important at relativistic speeds. Yeah, in a way it is different in general relativity. In classical mechanics any orbit around a point mass that doesn't escape to infinity is stable. In general relativity there are "orbits" that spiral in to the point mass. So it could be the case that for the same object, same place, same speed (therefore same energy), some directions escape to infinity whereas some spiral in. The photon sphere is not stable, meaning that it isn't practically possible for photons to occupy the needed trajectories longer then a few trips around the black hole. They will soon either escape, or fall into the black hole. &gt; I can guarantee you that that limit is well outside of the event horizon.

Not necessarily. The largest black holes we know of are billions of times more massive than the Sun. For a planet the size of Earth, that puts the Roche limit at about 5x10^11 m by my calculation (just a little closer than Jupiter is to the sun). The event horizon, though, is at about 3x10^12 m.

... Not that a planet could orbit there (for reasons explained in the other responses), but there are certainly black holes for which you could fall through the event horizon without really noticing that you'd done so. There is a buoyant force,  but the buoyancy property of the object can be described as positive or negative with respect to the ambient fluid.  If the ball is falling straight down then all the gravitational potential energy it loses when it falls goes into increasing it's downward momentum. If there is a 45 degree ramp, then the ramp converts half of that potential into horizontal momentum. By the time it gets to the bottom of the ramp it has much less vertical momentum than it would had the ramp not been in place. The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) is essentially our "heat signature" of the big bang. It's almost completely uniform in temperature. Everywhere in the universe should see a similar CMB.

 Also a lot of finite global geometries don't have centers--spherical for one. However, evidence suggests we live in a flat-infinite universe, so center is still meaningless. &gt; I believe it does mean we all "came from the same person".

Not possible, you need at least 44 individuals for a breeding population. This is the correct answer, pressure inside a building nominally should be kept higher that outside using fans and blowers and monitored by pressure transducers (usually a very small difference we're talking inches of water above atmospheric pressure).  This allows for outward opening doors to be easily pushed open in the event of an emergency, also helps to keep dust and other particles outside from entering the building. &gt; Only at the photon sphere can light make an orbit that returns to the same place. 

Again I betray my rusty GR, but is it possible to point to a term in the metric and say, "the lack of stable orbits is this guy's fault?" Perhaps because the angular part of the metric is dependent on r (which I mean to be there is an r dependence in the coefficient of the dPhi)? Is it as simple as saying, "This Christoffel symbol is nonzero, so that restricts stable orbits?"

 Would these orbiting photons increase in number over the lifetime of the black hole? 

Following on from that, is there anything to stop a black hole being completely encapsulated in a sphere of photons orbiting at 1.5 radius?  Pretty sure the answer here is no.  During an elliptical orbit, there are times when the orbiting body goes faster (when it's close) and slower (when it's far away).  Light travels at a constant velocity so it would only be able to orbit circularly.  IANAP(hysicist) What if the Perigee is within the event horizon but the Apogee is far outside of the event horizon. It can, but it precesses a lot and the orbit is deformed from an ellipse by relativistic effects. It is notoriously difficult to develop quantum algorithms. Even after decades of research we really only have a handful that have obvious powerful uses. 

The first is Shor's Algorithm. This lets a quantum computer factor integers in polynomial time (i.e., the amount of time it takes to factor an N bit integer is some polynomial N^x ). The best known algorithms on classical computers for factoring integers are exponential (i.g., the amount of time it takes to factor an N bit integer is some exponential function x^N ). Its not proven that the best you could ever do with a classical computer is exponential but people believe this to be true enough to base a serious amount of asymmetric crypto on this assumption. 

If quantum computers become more practical in the future then encryption based on the hardness of factoring will no longer be feasible. Fortunately, people have been preparing for this for ages and there is an entire field call "post-quantum crypto" that tries to come up with schemes that are secure even if quantum computers are everywhere. 

The second famous algorithm is Grover's Algorithm. This algorithm lets you look through an unsorted list for a particular item in sqrt(N) time where N is the length of the list. A classical computer obviously cannot do any better than N (because it has to check every element in the list in the worst case) so this is a proven fundamental speedup that quantum computers have. It turns out that you can turn a lot of problems into "search this list" so Grover's Algorithm gives a polynomial speedup over classical computers for a gazillion interesting problems. 

This doesn't have nearly the implications for encryption. It effectively halves the key length of crypto schemes (doing 2^N tests now becomes 2^N/2 ) but this is trivial to beat by just doubling key lengths.  An AA and a UV-Vis (as well as an IR) measure light from a lamp. In all of these, you typically measure the light without a sample present (blank) and then again with a sample present. Then absorption is calculated.  Should have said "only beyond the photon sphere". You can have a circular orbit on (or outside) the photon sphere, but if you want an elliptical orbit you'll have to be further out even at your orbit's closest point. I'm talking about outside the event horizon, where light doesn't fall in but gets severely bent by gravity.  Mercury. It would just look really cool in fountains. Imagine the bellagio with mercury but the money you save from disconnecting it will only be a fraction of the cost you would have to spend on new car batteries.  Your engine's crankshaft is connected to, and powers, a network of pulleys.  The belt that drives all of the pulleys is called the serpentine belt, because it snakes all around your engine bay.  There are lots of systems that tap into this mechanical power by having a pulley that rides on this serpentine belt (power steering, air conditioning, coolant pump, etc.).  Do a google image search for serpentine belt to get a picture of what I'm talking about.  The alternator is one of these devices and it is basically a small generator that generates voltage and current via mechanical power input.  The electrical energy comes from mechanical energy, yes, and it does reduce fuel efficiency, but not by much.  Most 12V outlets are fused at around 15-20 amperes which means at MOST you can draw 240 watts of electrical power.  This is around 0.32 horsepower, so, not a big deal compared to the power output of the engine. An elliptical orbit would require the photons' speed to vary, so I suppose that would not be possible. There seems to be a series of things going on for me:

* My brain sees the features that suggest a face very clearly
* It sees multiple sets of some of the most distinct features very close together
* My brain perceives this as a problem with information being sent by the eyes, and tries to fiddle with the bits controlling my vision, trying to force a "correct" picture.
* Because the correct picture involves something that my brain perceives as being incorrect, it keeps sending signals to my eyes trying to get them to adjust or focus or otherwise try harder to get a clearer picture.
* The above feedback loop eventually starts causing eyestrain, all in the span of milliseconds/seconds.

**tl;dr-** brain thinks the TV is not getting a proper picture so it keeps adjusting the tracking and timing on the cassette player, which doesn't result in any clearer picture and causes stress on the cassette. Is that exactly 1.5 times the radius of the horizon? It's because a wide FOV requires a huge screen, otherwise you're squishing all the important information into a tiny spot in the center of the screen. The other option is a fisheye view, which honestly helps immensely (I know AvP had that when you played as the alien). A fisheye view will compress the sides so objects resolution is dependent on where they are (like your real eyes). But it looks a little weird, I'm not sure how well perceived that would be. Also a wide FOV would significantly increase GPU requirements, as you're rendering more of the scene. Are light orbits perfectly circular? If not, does the light undergo the same kinetic to potential to kinetic energy conversion we see on physical objects in elliptical orbits?  

If a star sized, super stress resistant mirror was dropped into a black hole held at 45 degrees from normal, would we see a flash brighter than a star as it passed through the 1.5 threshold? Impedance is a complex number whose real part is the resistance of a circuit element and the imaginary part is the reactance of the circuit element.

&gt;what does it represent exactly ?

It represents how a circuit element will behave when you send a signal through it (how it will resist/react to electric signals).

&gt;does it have to do anything with resistance ?

Yes. Like I said above, the resistance is the real part of the impedance. But impedance is more general because it includes the reactance as well as the resistance. That wouldn't be stable. It's an unstable orbit. Any pertrubation would change their trajectory. Thank you for your submission!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* The ISCO and the photon sphere are at different distances. The photon sphere is at r = 3M, but ISCO is at r = 6M. But if the photon sphere is inside the event horizon then there is no escape... This made me think of what would happen if a small rock at (near) the speed of light hit the Earth, then I remembered there's a [relevent xkcd](https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/). Hey! I have prosopagnosia! I can tell people apart by their hair style usually, but faces are something my mind just cant hold on to. The photon sphere is at exactly 1.5 times the distance to the horizon (for a Schwarzschild black hole). The part that's confusing is why doesn't that fade like gravity normally does? Why is it either pulling in or not? Say there's a really big shell of really dense material with a planet floating in the middle somewhere. The planet feels no net gravity from the shell, so it just floats around, and let's say it has some satellites orbiting it.

Now, say the shell slowly gets compressed (under its own gravity, or however else) until it gets to a density that causes an event horizon to form around it. At that point... Do we have any idea might happen from the perspective of the planet? I imagine it still feels no net force, and I imagine the satellites would continue to orbit the planet until the black hole finished collapsing... I don't know if that's right, though.

Whatever the case, I guess you probably wouldn't call that orbit "stable". You charge the battery externally.  A lot of people involved in racing do this.  Furthermore, it is cheaper to charge your battery with the electricity you pay for at home than the electricity you pay for at the fuel pump.

Either way, I still would not do it. That makes no sense. An elliptical orbit implies a variable speed, yet the speed of light is fixed. Or am I missing something? Thanks, that's interesting The photon sphere is outside the event horizon. A light wave has to be travelling on *just* the right trajectory to get into a circular orbit at the photon sphere. All light certainly does not do that. &gt; To truly leave the influence of an object, you must be infinite distance away.

Aren't there black holes and other celestial objects whose gravitational influence has not yet reached Earth because the changes in gravity caused by their formation has not had the time needed to propagate over the distances involved? &gt; a stranger insisted that I put his USB drive into my laptop so he could share some movie files with me

Uh... Why did you let him do that? I mean security aside, that's weird. Wot.

Just wot.

Are you forgetting the single greatest user of a cars power system?  Charging the battery after using the starter.  This can be in the order of 100A just after start up. The radius of the photon sphere is 3/2 times the radius of the event horizon. You are missing a key point.  Matter (or the sun) can't just disappear, so it is an arbitrary question.  Anything that happens to the particles of the sun is limited to the speed of light, and thus the effect of that objects gravitational effect on the universe around it So in Interstellar, they wouldn't have actually seen the proton sphere around gargantua? If the periapsis is inside the horizon you're not coming back out again. Here is an exceptional piece that examines fuel efficiency and the effect of the alternator.

http://delcoremy.com/documents/high-efficiency-white-paper.aspx It's my understanding that they always travel in straight lines unless they encounter matter.  If traveling through empty space and the light's travel is bent, it is because the space is being curved by gravitational effects. Only most towers only have one channel. They usually use TDMA or CDMA, they do NOT divide phone into multiple 10MHz bands and communicate to them at the same time. Instead they either divide them up via time and rapidly switch between them or they give them all different codes, mux all their signals together with those codes, and then transmit the muxed signal (requiring the phone to receive the entire signal, and demux their portion out). It could be argued that power is somewhat dependent on channel utilization, but an individual phone can also use up a large chunk of the channel, it's only slightly dependent on number of phones. When you think about it, it's not that unusual that it ends up to be a distance like that. Both distances are calculated off of light speed, just one with the photon pointed outward, one with it going in circular motion. I'd tend to expect some nice relation between the two. Why isn't it stable? How can the photons lose their orbital velocity? I don't think dense is the right term since it implies something about volume. What you are saying is that it's a larger molecule. If you combine the two sets of numbers you gave you should come up with OPs original number:

720 kCal/mol / 180 g/mol = approx 4 kCal/g
322 kCal/mol / 46 g/mol = approx 7 kCal/g

All that still doesn't get at the heart of OPs question though. Why does ethanol have more energy per unit weight than glucose? The reason is that the average bond in ethanol is more energetic than the average bond in glucose. "average bond" isn't really a valid concept, but it sort of works in this explanation.

Here's a table of bond energies ([source](http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/cact/c120/bondel.html)):

[ethanol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol#mediaviewer/File:Ethanol-2D-flat.png) has 1 C-C, 1 O-H, 1 C-O and 5 C-H

[glucose] open form(http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Glucose_chain_structure.svg) has 5 C-C, 5 O-H, 5 C-O, 1 C-H and 1 C=O

Bonds are affected by neighboring bonds, so this is a little simplistic, but the bods in glucose don't have as much energy as the bonds in ethanol once you normalize for the mass of the molecules involved. The processes involved in going from glucose to ethanol took away on average some less energetic bonds and actually increased the energy density of the molecule. Tidal forces are the correct scientific term here. &gt; I was thinking of a solid sphere.

When people are talking about the shape of the universe they are referring to what the intrinsic metric is. They are not referring to things like solid spheres.

&gt; Edit: The center of a surface sphere exists in a higher dimenaion, but it does exist by definition. No center, no constant radius, no sphere.

Read up on Riemann and differential geometry. We're taking spacetime to be intrinsic--i.e that higher dimension you brought up *doesn't exist*, it is literally not included as mathematically. If you wish to invoke an extrinsic viewpoint, you have to invoke math structure which has no physics motivation. Intrinsic geometry is entirely self consistent, so we don't have to invoke centers to curved spaces.

This is especially important because [manifolds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold) can easily "cross themselves" when you try to project them externally. You may be thinking of "liquid" as a necessary intermediate phase between "solid" and "gas". It is not. Particles of a solid can (and do!) pop directly off of its solid surface, and the particles so liberated are called a gas. Conversely, particles of a gas can (and do!) attach directly to a solid surface, becoming a solid in the process.

The reason why some substances prefer to pass through a liquid phase and others avoid it entirely will depend on the background of the person answering the question. Thermodynamics experts will say something like: the liquid phase has the highest molar energy (corresponding, roughly, to lowest entropy) at all temperatures, so it is always unfavorable. Electronic structure experts will say something like: there is no energetic minimum corresponding to weakly-bound particles of this substance. I think it's difficult to say if they happen frequently.  Many of the tornadoes that are in the observed record come from identification through eye-witness reports, radar, and characteristics of the damage path they create.  Basically none of these three sources are available over the open ocean.  Tornadoes typically form in regions of high convective available potential energy (CAPE), which are areas typified by a shallow layer of very warm, moist air near the ground and capped by a deep layer of dry air.  I wouldn't have thought that you could generate high CAPE over the open ocean, but [this example](http://imgur.com/G7zeC1k) plot of CAPE has some significant values over the Gulf of Mexico.  I'd imagine CAPE is available in this region because dry air from the Mexican plateau is migrating over the ocean to create the appropriate conditions.  There is more to tornado formation than CAPE, but it's very important. At some point the forces that hold the atoms in the hypothetical object together would be overcome by the differential of gravitational force being exerted on opposite ends of the object.  The object would be stretched until gravity became stronger than its atomic bonds, at which point it would be pulled apart. I would love to answer but I'm not sure I understand what you mean, can you elaborate please? Hmm, interesting comment, but I don't know that I fully agree... If we wish, we can view GR+SM as just another QFT on flat space, just a theory with a massless graviton spin-2 field interacting with all the other fields in the only consistent way. And the "only around fixed background" thing isn't really a real issue as well. Born rule and so on is not a problem at all, the state of the graviton field is simply a part of the wave function, and there is no ambiguity about different backgrounds either. 

The problem with for example a QM-grav double slit is "only" that when perturbations of the metric gets big, the non-renormalizability comes into play and we can't compute stuff. Although orbits in the photon sphere are not stable. A rock (or any other massive body, i.e. an object with mass) could not travel at the speed of light. 

As an object's velocity (v) approaches the speed of light (c), its relativistic mass must approach 0 because 


m(rel) = m(rest)/(Sqrt. (1-(v^(2)) / (c^(2))))
- 
Where m(rel) is the relativistic mass and m(rest) is the mass of the object at rest. Thanks for the answer, even if it's a "no one really knows". I suppose science wouldn't be as fun if we already had everything figured out. Unstable just means that if you alter the trajectory of the object ever so slightly, it will leave that orbit.

This is in contrast with a stable orbit, where small perturbations will not cause the object to leave its orbit. I assume there's a bunch of sines and pi's along the way that somehow cancel out to 1.5. There are hypotheses that inside of a blackhole is A) unlimited, B) finite but massive, C) a spacetime 'firewall' prevents you from even entering. D) none of the above 

Being able to provide any sort of answer about "orbiting" around a singularity depends on so many unknowns that its fundamentally unanswerable at this point. 

For more information, I recommend reading this article http://quantumfrontiers.com/2013/08/29/whats-inside-a-black-hole/
 &gt; a vertical launch has the same escape velocity regardless of what country launches the shuttle

Is it true for non-rotating Earth, or for rotating Earth as well? My impression was that because of rotation vertical starts are not truly vertical, and so countries closer to the equator would have an advantage. Was I mistaken? Thank you for your submission!

*[I am a bot](/r/AutoModerator/comments/q11pu/what_is_automoderator/), and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* It's not that they can't escape, it's just that there is no stable orbit bellow; they'll either spiral in or out, or just have a nearmiss with the horizon and come out very soon. If that's true this is a really good explanation. The alternator does not draw 100 A to charge the battery. The high expenditure of battery power in starting the engine is replaced by a slow trickle charge over a car's journey, and by some back-of-the-envelope calculation it takes some 10 minutes to completely replace the charge used to start the car. Why doesn't what fade like gravity? There is no such thing as an orbit within the event horizon.  

The event horizon is the point at which all of space is warped so much that all paths lead to the singularity.  

Within the event horizon there is only a single direction, toward the singularity.  

Even if you were to turn around and blast in, what one would logically consider, the opposite direction you would just be increasing the speed with which you are approaching the singularity.

Hope that helps. Yes, the atmosphere is also a sphere, so as long as 'vertical' means 'radially outward from the earth's core', then the escape velocity is the same no matter where on the earth you start.

Obviously getting to an equatorial geostationary orbit is harder the further north or south you are. The *maximum* speed of light is fixed, thatfor c is defined as light in a vacuum. I assume, it goes slightly slower elsewhere, [and even slower in laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_light). I found the referenced study but it doesn't appear to match how people have quoted it.

The study had pilots sit in a dark room then flash a bright image at them for a brief period.  The pilots were then able to tell you what was on the image.  This isn't frame rate because the pilots can use the after image to support their deductions.

I don't have the link as I found it on mobile, looking now. Everything is different for black holes I would guess the parameters need to be very precise, the space needs to be very quiet, no ripples; any ripples will make the photons swerve and derail. That doesn't mean it can't.  Those are fair points, but skill prediction with fMRI is not entirely unfeasible and has been demonstrated already on a smaller scale than what the OP is looking for. 

For example, Supekar et al. (2013) did resting state fMRI and structural MRI on a group of children before they received a week of math tutoring. They found that functional connectivity measures and some structural measures predicted future individual differences in math improvement as a result of the tutoring, and that this prediction was better than any behavioral measures such as IQ or working memory tests. 

Similarly, Tan et al (2011) showed that activity in caudate and fusiform task predicted how well kids would learn a second language that they hadn't learned yet. 

I suspect that the combination of resting state fMRI (which allows us to measure patterns of intrinsic connectivity among brain regions) with machine learning techniques will yield some predictive power in terms of predicting various kinds of cognitive aptitude.

That is completely irrelevant to the subject at hand. OK, you'er correct in the most pedantic way, but it's safe to assume /u/Medichamp meant "asymptotically close to the speed of light" I hope you don't mind the question, but:

In regards to the light orbiting the black hole, if you got into it's path and observed it, what would you see? The black hole, or the source from where the light came, from however long ago? I think what they saw there were gases that were orbiting the blackhole (I haven't watched the movie, but from a few screenshots, and trailers and stuff, I think I know what you're talking about; and besides, you can't see photos unless they are entering your eyes, so while they are going around the blackhole you wouldn't see them). Yes, but then you're not leaving it! You've never been under their influence to begin with. its simply if-else statement.
first the if condition is taken care of and then it proceeds towards else  Wouldnt you have to hit the sides (assuming the ice ball is rotating to keep a perfect sphere/oblate spheroid) due to the pendulum effect where something oscillating back and forth, without touching anything, would be unaffected by the globes rotation causing you to constantly hit the sides of the tubular hole There's also a good chance that the volume of a planet is larger than the volume of a black hole. The back of your head. Wouldn't the caveat be that as long as it maintains escape velocity it will still escape?  How to achieve that seems like a different discussion. Unless I'm misunderstanding the initial statement made higher up (which is likely) they were saying that an object can't orbit a black hole at any distance. It either gets sucked in or can drift freely away. Is that the case? If so, why does the gravity from a black hole act differently than the gravity from something like a star. So, just thought of this based on your answer... If light is advancing directly toward the center of the black hole at the speed of light, does the pulling force of the black hole cause it to go faster, or does it just keep the constant speed? Would make sense to me that it would go faster, but that whole "no going faster than the speed of light" thing says it wouldn't. Just curious. My cars engine is rated at 140HP, which is 100kW. So lets say the battery does draw 100A, that's 1.2kW, and the alternator is very efficient (over 90% easily). You are drawing maybe 1.5% of the engines power.

Car engines put out a huge amount of power, load from the alternator is pretty much nothing.

If two particles are identical, there's a symmetry there: it means that no matter what your physical model is, if you switch one with the other there should not be any difference. This is important in quantum mechanics because it actually matters whether two situations are the same in every way: there are different statistical rules for identical states than for different ones. You may have heard that in quantum mechanics it matters whether you measure something. To be more precise, it matters whether there is a persistent record of what happened. If an atom can go around a barrier two ways, in some sense it goes both ways, and the adding between those two cases is an example of wave interference. But that only happens if there was no way to tell which way it went! If one of the paths had some labeling machine that added a label to the atom that says "this atom went through route A", the interference effects will disappear because now there's a way to tell the difference between the two paths. This happens even if the label is completely inaccessible to us; if it is ever possible to see it by physical means then this experiment will tell us about it. In a similar way we can be sure that any two electrons are truly identical and have no hidden secrets that all electrons don't share. This is ultimately because they are all part of the same "electron field" that exists everywhere, and it does not contain information like "I have electron A and you have electron B", instead it just says "there are two electrons, you have one and I have the other" which as you can see, respects that symmetry of switching the electrons.  Do other things have event horizons? Does this remain true for stars? I know that, but in order for that effect to cause an elliptic orbit there needs to be a spherically non-uniform distribution of mass around the black hole. Black holes happen to be notoriously hostile to non-uniform distribution of mass in their vicinity, though. Because quantum physicists are scared of pilot wave theory and all the complex math that would ensue in having to deal with a superfluid 'ether', which you know, they hate 'ether'. IMO.
 I read that it would take a decade to detect a graviton even assuming a Jupiter-sized detector.  

Why would gravitons be so rare and hard to detect, given that gravity seems so pervasive? The equation for the Roche limit it's d=1.26*RM(PM/Pm)^1/3
RM= radius of primary (in this case the black hole)
PM= density of the primary
Pm= density of the satellite (I assume you used the earth)

When you calculated the Roche limit what figures did you use for density of the primary and the radius of the primary.  PM is the primary body density which would be infinite because it is a singularity.  So how do you divide infinite by anything.   It's derived [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere#Derivation_for_a_Schwarzschild_black_hole). You can also argue that since OP mentioned _weight_, rather than _mass_, different orientation of magnetic domains on the platter would lead to different weights under the Earth's magnetic field.

And similarly, since different orientations of magnetic domains would have different potential energies, by the same mass-energy argument you applied later there would be a mass difference as well. Well... probably in that case. So far I'd been assuming theoretical ideal conditions. We'll just see about that 
 That.... was a surprising but in retrospect completely logical result. Good link. Is the event horizon structurally part of the black hole? So its a perfect sphere thats motionless and frictionless, all one material and the size of the moon? Roche limit [can also be calculated using masses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit#Rigid-satellite_calculation). Note that the Roche limit clearly can't actually depend on the density of the primary (the thing that's being orbited) for the spherically symmetric case, since the gravitational field outside of such a body depends only on its mass. That only applies to light, since light can't slow down to achieve a stable orbit further than the photon sphere, it will either escape or fall in anywhere else.

Matter is a different matter.  The photon sphere is, for matter, the inner most place it can orbit, but because matter can slow down it can achieve a stable orbit around a black hole further away. Okay, check out how weird this is:

I kept trying to force myself to see her going counter-clockwise, but couldn't do it. As I moved the mouse up to the tab to close it, my eyes spotted the favicon, which was a tiny version of the .gif. 

My eyes decided she was spinning counterclockwise.

Looking back down at the gif, I couldn't make her go clockwise anymore. I don't really think that spending an unfathomable amount of time completely alone watching the universe disintegrate into entropic soup has any analog to any human experience.  Keeps it at constant speed but it gets blueshifted. Think you better start on that A+ level physics now.  Yes! You are correct. I sincerely apologise for my error, it is friday and I am scottish, so... you know.

I will amend my post. Mass-less, friction-less ropes does not exist, yet such ropes are sufficient for our toy pulley exercises in physics classes.

The existence of a rock moving at the speed of light was not the point of the thought experiment, and it is not invalidated by it. I've seen this with a bunch of times, even to the point where the numbers seemed to float or spin in different directions. Concentration would reveal them to be sitting perfectly still, but just casual glances would give you a sort of "numbers floating in water" feel. What is meant by escape to infinity? &gt;An elliptical orbit implies a variable speed

Not necessarily, you can still have an elliptical path without changing speed, that's just not possible for usual keplerian orbits. And light isn't going to follow those rules exactly.  I figured. Usually a chemical affects the quench speed, which is a big thing, but it's not normally that specific
 How is that possible if you head is not emitting light, and not reflecting it all exactly back into the path of the orbit? What makes you think the alternator is 90% efficient? &gt; You can also argue that since OP mentioned _weight_, rather than _mass_, different orientation of magnetic domains on the platter would lead to different weights under the Earth's magnetic field.

That depends on which definition of weight you're using, but I'll give you a technical point there.

&gt; And similarly, since different orientations of magnetic domains would have different potential energies, by the same mass-energy argument you applied later there would be a mass difference as well.

Since this depends on the orientation of the drive, plus the drive is very well magnetically shielded, we can't draw any real conclusions about a change of potential energy from storing one bit value to another. So in general, the point remains that while you need to increase or decrease mass or energy present for certain types of storage devices, this is not true for magnetic storage. In other words, there are (very minor) things you can say about a flash drive that's all 1s versus all 0s, but you can't say the same about a hard drive. /r/cringe  depends on the size of the planet/object.  

Tidal forces means the differential in pull between the near and far side of the object.  The larger the object, the more tidal effects on it in any given gravity field.  Inversely, the closer you are to a gravity source, since gravity increase logarithmically as you approach a mass, the greater the differential as well.  

 OP May be referring to the [Millennium mathematics prize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_existence_and_mass_gap) to prove that Yang-Mills theory is well-defined and has a mass-gap. Right. But to move radially away from the core you'll actually have to cancel out some of the momentum you have on the equator. You'll be burning a bit retrogradely, and so will spend more fuel to reach the same vector of speed. I think I got it now, thanks! Thanks for the answer. I do know of horseshoe crabs, hydras and other living fossils which have remained unchanged for millions of years. I'm also aware of certain species in isolated areas like the Kakapo parrot in Oceania that specifically developed a very prohibitive mating ritual as a result of relatively weak external pressures. When you say:
&gt;  In these populations random mutations will still happen but unless they are advantageous they tend to just die out.

what I'm curious about is this - if the mutation is not disadvantageous to the organism it seems like there would be no reason for it to die out. Given enough time - on an evolutionary scale - would that mutation lead to speciation? I think this migh help me refine my original question:

Does speciation happen with nonexistent or weak environmental pressure? The star's gravity is actually the same as if there were a black hole in its place, *if* you exclude the interior of the star. It's only near the event horizon that the relativistic effects get noticeable, and the star doesn't exhibit those because it's not dense enough to have an event horizon so gravity doesn't keep increasing as you go into the star The stance is that the Earth is approximately that old and the value is related to the age of the Sun and by extension the rest of the solar system as well. Gravity is the Honey Badger of physics... just sayin' &gt;a rock sped at the speed of light directly at the earth

A rock moving at the speed of light would have infinite kinetic energy. If the rock could survive then it would escape out of the other side of the earth. I was asking more out of personal curiosity than to refute what was being said.  I'm not nearly knowledgeable enough for that.

I mean, it makes sense to me that even if you could get ahead of the gravity from that particular black hole via FTL, it would constantly be chasing you and therefore you would have to keep traveling infinitely to stay out of its influence.

But that just might be my poor layman's interpretation. optical systems were just an example.  the main reason why i asked is related to prosthetics:  how would one create, say, a functioning prosthetic hand, that follows the brains instructions?  the nerve impulse from thr brain travels to the point where the hand was severed; after that, something would have to 'read' the impulse, or (my question) allow that impulse to continue on to the specific mechanism that has replaced the musculature.  it seems that directing the impulse to the isolated destination would be more efficient than a computer that would receive the impulse, translate it (or however that would work), and then activate the appropriate mechanics. Yes. As we use light to communicate, light will always *eventually* catch up. The problem is we must pay the toll of relativity. Our signals will be (depending on orientation) be red or blue shifted and intrinsically our clocks will differ and accuse the other as slow. Check out the FAQ in the sidebar for more relativity fun. &gt; I understand that in AA, what is being detected is the photon emitted from the atom when the electron drops to a lower state of energy (after being energized by the emission source).

That is [atomic emission spectroscopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_emission_spectroscopy), not [atomic absorption spectroscopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_absorption_spectroscopy), to which UV-vis spectroscopy is related to. In AAS, what is detected is the spectrum of your light source after it has passed through the sample. By comparing it against a blank you can see which wavelengths of lights are attenuated (i.e., absorbed by the sample), and from that you can form an absorption spectrum.

In emission spectroscopy - what you described - you're directly detecting the emission from the sample. The sample is excited by whatever means - say, from heat - and you detect the emission spectrum, which would be similar to the absorption spectrum.

Because the purpose of the two types of spectroscopy is different, you'll find the instrument setup to be different. Since in absorption spectroscopy you're trying to detect light from the lamp after it's passed through a sample, the light source, sample, and detector are all in line. Contrast this to fluorescence spectroscopy, which is one type of emission spectroscopy: the detector is [orthogonal to the excitation light path](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Fluorimeter.svg), because you _don't_ want to detect the light source, but rather only the fluorescence from your sample. &gt; At a basic level, paper is made up of many proteins. 

Paper is mostly cellulose fibres, not proteins. [XKCD has a cool visual that describes how our vision actually is](http://xkcd.com/1080/) This is the explanation my math teacher gave in high school, although he said it doesn't really matter nowadays.  Well, you are right.

But then thats a bit like saying "Id use a condom to prevent sperm from getting inside and impregnating you. But then I dont want to sleep with you because we only do it to get you pregnant."

So... if your goal is to transfer data then you cant really cut the data line off.

And as far as I understand it if you want USB with all its functions you have to deal with the fact that it accesses some low level functions... Not a physicist or anything, just browsing this thread... please can you explain that last answer. I've no idea if that's a real or sarcastic answer. I really want it to be real and would love to understand why. The event horizon is defined as the invisible "border" where attraction becomes so intense nothing can escape. So, no, nothing within the event horizon could maintain a stable orbit as it would be pulled in towards the singularity. Light from the back of your head would reach your eyes. Keeps getting farther away from the black hole. You're right, the photon orbit is unstable. So what causes the drag to bring down the Apogee Thought experiment: you achieve escape velocity, but you are pointed down. Can you find the article that says that? That would be really interesting. Heat exchange is a function of surface area. Air is a fairly poor conductor, so the surface area we're concerned with is the area of the container that is in contact with water - that is, air inside the container is considered to be an insulator.

So if we're looking at, say, a 1/3-filled cylindrical container, you'll find that there is a much larger surface area for heat exchange when it's on its side, therefore it'll freeze faster. But of course, this only holds true when the container isn't full. How does light *barely escape* when travelling straight out from a black hole? Isn't the speed of light constant? If it barely escapes, isn't that the same as saying that it was slowed nearly to a stop? It's this one! :)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius#Relativistic_circular_orbits_and_the_photon_sphere Could you explain to me, for example in my double slit case, how the Born rule actually works? I'm afraid given the well documented history surrounding the "problem of time" in QM-GR, just saying "the gravitational field is simply part of the wave function" doesn't really address the issue. If you have a spin-2 field and an electron wave function you can treat them both quantum mechanically, but both those fields are still defined with respect to some clock and fixed background geometry that you are not treating quantum mechanically. The fact that you have problems "when perturbations of the metric get big" is just another way of saying that you cannot treat the GR field quantum mechanically when the effects of GR are classically important! You can take a fixed background and calculate a low-order scattering amplitude, yes, but you aren't describing what I think people like the OP are thinking when you say "GR".   Althought possible, has not yet been proven. Gravitational lensing has been measured in our Sun (but it's very weak). This effect has never been observed near a black hole. If possible, near a black hole, the effect would pretty much cause the image to be distorted or duplicated. Try looking up for Abell 2218 - the gravitational field there bends the light from galaxies behind it and create several arcs of light. My believe is that images would not be easily seen or be understandable. I would imagine that they would remain in orbit and because of the relatively small mass of the planet, the black hole formed from its compressed mass would have a very small event horizon probably smaller than the radius of the planet's initial surface. No. The Photon Sphere is extremely unstable. This is because photons cannot adjust velocity if their orbits are perturbed even slightly (They actually shift frequency). For a photon to remain in orbit around a black hole the initial trajectory would have to be exactly at a 90 angle from the surface of the Event Horizon. At light speed even the slightest difference in angle would cause a rapidly decaying or expanding orbit. Not to mention if any debris was falling into the black hole it would diffuse the orbiting light and ruin your mirror experiment. &gt; Our signals will be (depending on orientation) be red or blue shifted and intrinsically our clocks will differ and accuse the other as slow.

But what does that mean?

Let's say I am flying away from earth at 99.999% the speed of light.  At that speed clocks on earth will run noticeably slower than clocks on my spaceship.  But because I am moving away at that speed the signals to me will be red shifted and data will appear to arrive more slowly.

With no fiddling and watching the raw data stream will I (on the space ship) see the video in fast forward, real time (normal speed) or slow-mo?
 Not really. I mean I'm not sure if even slightly eccentric orbits occur with photons or not, but it wouldn't require a change in a photons speed. 

If that were the case any gravitational influence at all would change the speed of a given photon and that's not the case. If you think about gravity classically then your conclusion would make sense. But thinking relativistically it does not. The photon follows the curvature of space time at the same speed regardless of what object is causing the curvature.

 Ohhh...so pulling on it adds energy and the only place for the energy to go is into the wavelength? You would be a pile of flesh and broken bones, perhaps in a crater. Transistors have three connection points (source, drain, and gate).  Each of these points is connected somewhere else via a wire.  These wires are metal deposited onto the surface of the silicon. This is crazy. As I suspected, trigonometry everywhere. Not enough energy - the sphere is unstable. Hmm... So does light go at the speed of light there? Like keys let's say there is light going outward of the black hole, right at the event horizon. If it gets caught it will go speed of light one way, instantly, or the complete opposite way, speed is light, instantly? It is fading like gravity normally does. There still would be an extreme amount of gravity at that distance. It's just the gravity has faded just enough to allow light to orbit the blackhole. There is still pulling. If there wasn't any gravitational pulling, then the light would just leave in a straight line.  Black holes are much more symmetrical than that large galaxy. If a black hole exists, the edges will have images of the observer in them, but yeah they will be pretty thin and hard to see indeed. in addition, since the car is not always moving, the wind-powered accessory system is likely to need a buffer (eg. battery + charging circuit), adding more weight (though negligible) and complexity to the whole system, further reducing efficiency. Go play Kerbal, then you'll really understand.  The planet's compressed mass would certainly create an Event Horizon smaller than its initial size, unless the planet were a black hole to begin with. They don't lose their orbital velocity. It's just gravity from other objects nudge the photon very slightly. It's these very slight nudges that eventually means the photon will leave orbit. It happens extremely fast though just because of how fast a photon is.  The potentials created by the action potentials are enough to be transfered to an electrical conductor because the process is electric in nature. This is already in progress and there were a couple of successful experiments showing off completely artificial prosthetics moved by nervous input. The hard part is properly wiring the hand and avoiding immune reactions. &gt;I've been reading about relativity as of late and find it fascinating, however I'd like to know, if an object is going *incredibly fast,* would it be possible to have any sort of communication with it?

Sure. There's no good reason why not. You might have to wait a while for your answer, though, due to the object flying a substantial distance away before being able to send its reply.

&gt;Barring said object going at or beyond the speed of light, would relativity have any noticeable effect on perhaps radio communication with the object?

Yes. Either you or the moving object would need to change the frequency your equipment operates at, to account for the differences in velocity and subjective passage of time. If the object is also passing close to you, changing its angle relative to you at a significant rate, you may furthermore have to continuously adjust the frequency of your equipment while transmitting/receiving. I would be interested in seeing an end-to-end energy and emissions cost analysis of nuclear. The construction and mining/extraction costs must be massive and not likely greenhouse freindly. One key cost that I would like to see factored in is long term secure waste management (transport and warehousing) of spent fuel.  You'll see the video as if it were in slow motion, essentially. Yup. I mean sure, you could pick up one of those pretty much _anywhere_. I've got one in my backyard. To add the earth (and all the planets...the whole solar system) formed at the same time.  So the sun and Earth and Venus and Saturn, Etc. all formed at the same time.  If that's how you want to look at it. The even horizon is the point where the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light. So you would have to be travelling vertically away from the black hole at the speed of light to get away. The photon sphere at 1.5 times the radius is the point at which the orbital velocity is the speed of light. If you were to go closer to 1.2 times the EH, you would need to go above the speed of light to maintain the orbit, or you eventually get sucked in to the black hole. If photon have no mass why it can't escape from black hole? The "Dark side of the moon" isn't perpetually dark. It's just that one side of the moon is always facing us.  The other side still gets light from the Sun, we just never see the reflection.  In addition, the Appollo missions never landed on the far side of the moon, they landed [on the side facing us](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Apollo_landing_sites.jpg/800px-Apollo_landing_sites.jpg).

We also routinely make measurements of the distance to the Moon by bouncing lasers off of mirrors left by the [Apollo 11 crew](http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2004/21jul_llr/) It is not an 'at least' figure. We have good reason to believe that the Earth formed at the same time as the rest of the Solar System, and no good reason to think it is any older. Because the space is curved inwards. You would eventually come to a stop at the center, correct?  Any objects we see near black holes are outside the event horizon. See our [guidelines for posting](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_avoid_hypothetical_questions_that_require_speculation).

Even though this question doesn't posit an impossible hypothetical situation, it still demands speculation. For 7 marks, demonstrate how your kinetic energy upon impact is related to your initial height above ground, and then calculate how many chunks will you explode into upon impact. How do you measure distance, time, and therefore velocity near a black hole? 

Stable orbits around a black hole have constant angular momentum with respect to proper time (or proper affine parameter if you want to be pedantic about null geodesics). The Schwarzschild solution to Einstein equation accurately describes the gravitational field due to the sun, and the sun permits elliptical orbits. I'm not sure if periodic elliptical orbits exist for light-like trajectories. That's because speed is always independent of direction. Velocity, however, is not. Check out [these past threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=eye+motion&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all). Here is why we do it, and it's more than just "convention" (though a little).

If you allow yourself to do arithmetic using the rational numbers and then add in square root, you get a number system that is bigger than just the rationals. This number system has the special structure of a [Vector Space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) over the collection of rational numbers. An example of a vector space is the 2D plane. As you may be aware, we can express every point in the plane as a pair of real numbers (x,y), telling us how far left/right we are (by x) and how far up/down we are (by y). We can kinda do the same thing with our number system of square roots. Every number in this enlarged number system can be uniquely represented by a pair of rational numbers (x,y). 

The way we do this is as follows: Say I'm working with sqrt(d) and I want to find (1+sqrt(d))(sqrt(d)). This is some number in my new number system, so I should be able to represent it by some pair of rational numbers. So if we just multiply this out we get sqrt(d)+d. I then say that (d,1) represent this number. Here d represents the "rational" part (left/right) of my number and 1 represents the "square root" (up/down) part of my number. So (x,y) means the same thing as x+ysqrt(d).

Let's see what this means when I try to *divide* in my new number system. I want to divide 2+3sqrt(2) by 1+2sqrt(2). Whatever this is, it is a number in my new number system, so all I need to do is find the two rational numbers that represent it. By definition 2+3sqrt(2) divided by 1+2sqrt(2) is the same thing as (2+3sqrt(2))/(1+2sqrt(2)). The only thing that's really stopping me from writing is as x+ysqrt(2) is the pesky guy on the bottom. I'll then use the rationalizing the denominator trick to get rid of the root in the bottom and get (10/7)+(1/7)sqrt(2). This says that the coordinate representation of this number is (10/7,1/7).

So "rationalizing the denominator" is the same thing as doing the actual arithmetic to divide a number with radicals. 

-----------------------------------

I can extend this to multiple radicals. If I allow myself to have sqrt(2) and sqrt(3), then I'll get a 4-dimensional space, where (x,y,z,w) corresponds to x+ysqrt(2)+zsqrt(3)+wsqrt(6). Doing arithmetic here means getting things into this form. Now what if we were to take this idea from our happy little perfect theoretical and put some real world application. There would be friction from the sliding so wouldn't you eventually come to a stop in the center?  

But of course in actual reality this hole would not hold up and would crumble in on itself, killing the poor unfortunate slider.  Assuming there's something to remove energy from your equation then yes (like brushing the sides of the chute, or if there's an atmosphere, the wind resistance) you would eventually come to a stop at the center. Based on (this)[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/blkhol.html] The event horizon of a black hole with 1,000,000 solar masses is ~8872 km.  Based of of that the Roche limit of the earth orbiting the same black hole is 7.7x10^7 km.  This puts the Roche limit well outside of the event horizon. 

If I am misunderstanding something please explain where I am going wrong.  I studied this in college but that was a very long time ago so I may be mistaken. We can see things outside the event horizon of a black hole.  When a black hole pulls material in it tends to heat up...a lot.  As a result a "feeding" black hole can be quite bright.  The most exceptional examples of this are [Quasars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar) which are exceptionally bright (brighter than whole galaxies).

Once material has passed the event horizon of the black hole then you will never see it again.

It is possible to orbit a black hole.  If our sun magically *poofed* into a black hole the earth would continue to orbit it same as it does now.  You can get an orbit for light outside the black hole too called the [photon sphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere).  It is a very unstable orbit for the photons though so mostly they will eventually fly away or fall into the black hole.
 &gt;arbitrary

I think you're using that word a little too loosely. I'm not sure what that scene was intended to portray, but it might have been an [accretion disc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disc). The atmospheric pressure [decays exponentially](http://www.regentsprep.org/regents/math/algtrig/atp8b/exponentialresource.htm) with height.

On top of that, the boiling temperature of water as a function of pressure is [not linear](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/2000px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png), so it won't change linearly with height. No, it means it has been redshifted nearly to zero frequency. thanks for the answer, needed this for a science project. this really helped me, thanks again :) &gt; For more open-ended questions, try /r/AskScienceDiscussion In a peak year, a lot of people are infected and therefore develop immunity, which limits spread in the following year. In an off-peak year, many new children are born with no immunity, which leads to an increased rate of infection, leading to a peak year.

Many infectious diseases show such cycles, with somewhat varying cycle duration, largely determined by the reproductive rate of the pathogen, degree of immunity conferred by surviving an infection, and various environmental factors. Typically when a physical thought experiment had something made of ice, it's a stand in for "neglect friction" http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=gravity+infinite&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all When he says barely I think he means something moving at anything less than the speed of light can't escape, it is only possible to escape if you are travelling at c.

Might be better to say it's barely moving fast enough to escape if that makes sense? It gets really redshifted and thus loses most of its energy from the perspective of an observer very far from the black hole. Has anyone tried giving them shrooms?  No, i heard the brain only re-uses stuff in dream's and never makes anything up on it's on. The faces of people in dream's are always going to be someones face you've seen somewhere(in the streets or whatever, you don't have to know the person.)That's also why you almost always wake up when you die in a dream, your brain doesn't know what it feel's like to die so you wake up. weird things happen to spacetime near a blackhole, it travels at c in its own referenceframe Um, I notice a striking difference. Isnt it 8k that truly reaches the limit of what the eye can see at 5m? After getting a 4k tv and my eyes getting used to it I think even 1080p looks blurry for a little while when switching back from 4k. Sure.

The expansion you are talking about would only delay or stop a gamma ray burst from reaching us that was formed further than our horizon (about [46.5 billion light years](http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/03/01/how-big-is-our-observable-universe/)...yes that is older than the universe but since it is expanding our horizon is bigger/older than that...read the article).

Any gamma ray burst inside that horizon will eventually reach us.  Imagine Alpha Centauri blew up...we'd get the gamma ray burst big time.  Be glad it won't since such a thing would probably kill all life on earth.
 No, because if something else were to have an event horizon (i.e. light would be unable to escape) then that would make it a black hole.  You're right, because the force component acting on the ball in the downslope direction goes as sin. I think what s/he meant was that the planet starts off *inside* a structure that eventually becomes a black hole. So the "shell" shrinks in radius until, to an observer outside, it is a black hole. But inside the shell, s/he is saying there is no fundamental reason to believe that the planet would care (until or unless the shell keeps collapsing and eventually crashes into it).

I think the answer has to do with the fact that space is so heavily bent around the boundary of the black hole that directions in space / time actually swap positions. I don't have enough expertise to be sure, but I expect that you may be able to have two different descriptions of what's going on with the planet -- one from the planet and one from the outside -- that seem wildly different but are actually equivalent. The planet sees itself moving through space, whereas an outside observer would understand the planet as moving through time (or as "inevitably" falling to a point at the end of time which is equivalent to center of the black hole). 

There are actually credible theories out there, if I remember correctly, that suggest our own universe could actually be inside a shell that to an external observer would be a black hole.  Fucking photon radial geodesics. With all due respect, you are talking your ass off. That we don't know what happens at the singularity doesn't mean we don't know what happens inside the event horizon. GR is clear in this respect and the theory doesn't present any issues in the event horizon. Once you cross the event horizon on a Schwarzschild black hole you have a finite amount of time before you go into the singularity. No possible stable orbits allowed. [speculation]

 This makes sense. Thank you. &gt; and the sun permits elliptical orbits.

But not of photons. I was talking only about photons. &gt; By "disappear" you seem to mean "become mass-less". That would mean converting the mass of the Sun into energy via E=mc^2 .

They probably don't mean that, because "energy" is not something you "convert into". "Energy" is a property of a system, not some physical object.

Also, it's not only mass that gravitates - the energy of a system also contributes. This means if the system is suddenly converted into massless particles (by whatever method), while conserving energy, nothing will change in terms of gravitation. Science makes educated assumptions. As far as describing how objects perceived are stored in memory I do not know of any scenario that can confirm such assumptions. What was described was a complex system of where information goes. As far as I understand we only have a vague knowledge of what parts of the brain do what. There is certainly no verifiable evidence I have ever heard of the supports what was said about how/where visual information is stored/processed. Then what about when a stove's fire is blue? What's happening there? It seems to turn orange if it isn't that hot - when it's igniting it sparks up orange and if you drop a bit of water in it, it turns orange for a few seconds. As an illustrative example, if the earth were magically replaced by a black hole of the exact same mass, located at exactly the center of the earth, then the moon and all the satellites and space junk we've launched would stay in the same orbits they're in now.  A black hole is not special in this regard. Anybody correct me, im not an expert, but dont we have a few other ways of getting these estimates?

oldest found continental crust &amp; estimated cooling time?

also I thought I remembered something about mantle isotope jazz? Sr maybe? No. The telescope just acts as a bucket that catches more light than your eyes. That's what magnification is. The light still has to to travel the exact same distance from its source to your telescope.  Ah cool, that makes sense, cheers. &gt; exemption errors

 For most objects, energy is kinetic energy,1/2 * mass * velocity squared (.5*m*v ^2), plus potential energy, mass * gravitational acceleration * height (m*g*h). Total energy is conserved in general, so as height increases (and thus potential energy increases), kinetic energy must decrease. The mass stays the same so it is velocity that decreases to account for this shift.

For light, which is massless, energy is expressed by Planck's constant * frequency (h*f). Obviously, Planck's constant is constant, so the only thing that can change is frequency. Thus, light just gets more and more red shifted instead of slowing down. Ok so why arent black holes glowing spheres? After development wouldnt there be enough light hit at exactly 90 degrees to start orbiting the hole so that all we saw at 1.5 r outside of it would be a glowing swirling ball of light? Or are there just too many deflections off of other particles entering the hole? 

Could there be light rings like saturn has with actual rock? Apparently there is a least one [fringe case.](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/423608/planets-could-orbit-singularities-inside-black-holes/) Woah touched on a lot of stuff here. I'll answer a couple of these.

First off, you use the word "frequency" when you should be using the term "radio". Radio is electromagnetic signals that travel through the atmosphere or even free space. Frequency is a property of radio waves. You can think of it like watching waves crash into the beach, how often this happens is called it's frequency. The same concept applies to radio waves.

Second, AM and FM are simply bands identified in the radio spectrum. They are arbitrarily defined and aren't inherent properties of radio. Not all radio waves are in the AM or FM bands. in fact there are LOTS of bands of radio waves outlined by the FCC. The FCC is the government body responsible for defining who can use what bands of radio.

There is, in fact, many different bands of radio waves that consumers can use. [Here is the chart if you'd like to look at it](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/United_States_Frequency_Allocations_Chart_2003_-_The_Radio_Spectrum.jpg)! As you can see there are lots more bands than just AM and FM.

Now, on to how remotes work. It's not just as simple as listening to the radio transmissions of a remote and then just repeating it. Remotes use a system called "[Rolling Codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code)". Basically there is an algorithm that both the remote, and the car's computer both share. After a certain period both the remote and the computer change the code they are transmitting and listening for respectively. If they don't match, it won't work.

[Here's another wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_keyless_system) that explains them too!  Immensely so Woops, this is a terrible question in regard to the sub rules, my bad. :/ Dude someone on this sub said we knew the number of protons in the universe. I often wonder how much is just people talking out of their ass with a heavy dose of science-babble.  Yes, it's constant in the local frame of reference. 

The closer the light starts from the event horizon the longer distance it needs to travel to escape it due to the massive curvature caused by the black hole. Light that starts its escape just slightly above the event horizon could take a near infinite time to escape. For "theoretical" outside observer it would seem like the light is almost not moving at all (..but of course we can't observe light that doesn't reach us). I recall reading that as the mass of the black hole grows the event horizon might actually catch the light ray sealing its fate.

Which begs the question, can the event horizon grow faster than light in local space?





 Once the event horizon forms, the matter in the shell is forced to continue falling/collapsing inward, so it would collapse onto the planet and destroy it.

The question of what happens to the planet in between the formation of the event horizon and being destroyed by the infalling shell is really interesting, though, and I don't know what the answer is. As for the hoax part the best proof for it being real is the Soviet Union. At this time we were in the middle of the cold war so the Soviets were probably watching this closely. If it was faked the Soviet Union would have made sure everyone knew. If you're interested, here's a PBS NOVA episode about sinkholes that premiered a couple of days ago that does some decent explaining of their formation, though it's mostly about the effects they can have on people: www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/earth/sinkholes.html  And it gets redshifted because it travels a really long distance to escape due to spacetime curvature near the event horizon. Ah found it on the WP [Black Hole Article, Singularity section](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole#Singularity)

It cites
Carroll 2004, pp. 257259 and 265266

Text says: 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of a charged (ReissnerNordstrm) or rotating (Kerr) black hole, it is possible to avoid the singularity. Extending these solutions as far as possible reveals the hypothetical possibility of exiting the black hole into a different spacetime with the black hole acting as a wormhole.[59] The possibility of traveling to another universe is however only theoretical, since any perturbation will destroy this possibility.[60] It also appears to be possible to follow closed timelike curves (going back to one's own past) around the Kerr singularity, which lead to problems with causality like the grandfather paradox.[61] It is expected that none of these peculiar effects would survive in a proper quantum treatment of rotating and charged black holes.[62] 
&gt; 
 ... Because any photon that gets reflected off the back of you head at 90 degrees would make a perfect orbit around the black hole and you'd see it as soon as it completed the orbit. Time would be running faster on earth than it would be for you in your ship. Which would mean that the video would seem to be running in fast motion.

However, in this particular example you're also moving away from the earth. Which means you'll be receiving the transmissions much slower than they're being sent from earth.

I THINK that they should cancel each other out and the feed would appear to run at normal speed. I'm not 100% sure of that though so I'll wait for an expert to calculate it properly.

That's also assuming that the software can handle playing a fast motion file coming in at a very low bandwidth. More likely it would end up looking like a youtube video with a poor connection. All choppy and hanging while it waits for more data to come in. There's a vsauce video that discusses this. I'll edit my comment to include it once I find it. Actually the clocks on earth will run noticeably slower than the clocks on your spaceship because you're stationary, and the earth is moving away at 99.999% the speed of light. You'll see the video in slow-mo, as will they.

Well, assuming you're moving at constant velocity, at least. If you're accelerating, then depending on how far away you are from Earth, it's possible their signal will never be able to catch up with you - or from a general relativity perspective, the Earth is behind the event horizon generated by the universe-permeating gravitational field causing you to feel as though you're accelerating. That is correct. A small black hole, such as one that resulted from a collapsing star, will tear apart a planet before it reaches the event horizon. A supermassive black hole wouldn't. It's interesting to note that the basic SIR epidemiology model will produce such oscillations simply by adding a constant birth rate. [Here's](http://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/rsmith43/MAT4996/earn.pdf) a paper that does exactly that for measles (see Fig. 1.4).

Disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with the author; I just Googled around until I found a paper I liked. This happens today. When we communicate with deep space probes, (which by the way are going pretty fast but nothing like 90% of the speed of light), the comm link in both directions is red-shifted, and so we have to tune the receiver to be at a slightly lower frequency than the transmitter. 2 microns Thank you so much! Here. http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/usefultables.php#id--The_Boom_Table
 They reach the Earth quite often. That's how we see them and know that they even exist. Spacetime curvature IS gravitons. Or so the thinking goes. Thanks.  I get the bucket analogy.  That helps a lot.

 [Yes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_migration). Hot Jupiters probably formed farther away from the star and then migrated inward. I had a similar misunderstanding about black holes too.  Crossing the event horizon does not mean the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light.  

Inside the event horizon space time is warped such that there is no direction you can travel that does not point to the singularity at the center. Every direction you travel leads deeper into the black hole. There literally is no way out except perhaps for some sort of quantum tunneling  Check out [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrGV7zKEdtU) which explains it.

An alkaline battery consists two two half cells that's undergoing [these redox reactions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_battery#Chemistry). Note that there is water as the product of the first half-reaction, and water as the reactant in the second half-reaction. As the battery is discharged, water is produced in the first half-cell (the inner cylinder in the [Wikipedia article diagram](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Alkaline-battery-english.svg)), and water is consumed in the second half-cell (the outside compartment). So the charge state of the battery will affect the density of the respective half-cells, and therefore the structural characteristics. So you couldn't see the photons unless you were travelling inside the orbit of the photon sphere? http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/autofocus2.htm

Basically, older cameras would actually emit a sound to determine distance. It doesn't happen anymore, at least commonly. Every Moon landing was on the daytime side of the Moon. Where did he hear they landed on the night side? That doesn't beg the question, it leads to or raises it. Fuck yeah, Science! See the [/r/askscience guidelines on soliciting medical advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s4chc/meta_medical_advice_on_askscience_the_guidelines/). This is question better suited for your primary care physician. We couldn't detect them if they weren't reaching earth. &gt; it would have the same speed and kinetic energy as the falling one when it hits the ground.

If we don't ignore contact friction, then the ball on the ramp will be moving slower when it gets to the ground. Not because it will have lost energy, but because the ball is rolling, so some of the original potential energy has gone into rotational kinetic energy instead of linear motion. The total kinetic energy will be the same but the speed will be lower. It is normally much easier to work with a number that has radicals in the numerator than the denominator, because of how adding fractions works. He wasn't kidding that the road to get there is complicated haha. :P Well, any light in that orbit wouldn't be seen by you, because it's orbiting. Rockets carrying human payload has a specific [human-rating certification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-rating_certification) that is more stringent than other rockets. DNA is more stable than RNA so much of the time DNA is used to make the probes, but DNA is not always the target. RNA (which changes in both how much of it is expressed at a given time and in a particular cell, as well as if it's expressed at all) 

Explanations for how a process work are often simplified. They simply want to demonstrate proof of principle. Can this technique detect a sample containing a particular sequence of DNA/RNA? In practice researchers are not always confident that the given sequence is there.

The highlights of this [nature review on FISH](http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization-fish-327) give a few examples of how FISH is used. They are:

4)Using Collections of FISH Probes to Paint Entire Chromosomes

Using FISH to Analyze Interphase Chromosomes

5) Additional Applications of FISH in the Clinic and Research Laboratory
Exciting new applications of FISH that extend its range continue to be developed. For example, cytogeneticists now use comparative genomic hybridization to detect quantitative differences, like copy number variations, in the chromosomes of their patients. Recently, investigators have also been able to increase the resolution of FISH by using stretched chromatin fibers (Parra &amp; Windle, 1993) or microarrays as the target. With tools such as these, cytogenetics has been able to move from studying whole chromosomes on the macroscopic scale, to studying the DNA of which these chromosomes consist. If the light is orbiting the black hole, then it can't reach us so we can't see it. Just curious - is there a quantifiable amount of energy lost? As in, does the amount of energy the light has asymptotically approach zero? Is this analogous to massive things having kinetic energy (and in the case of escape velocity, just enough kinetic energy to escape the gravity well)? It would be just like falling into a black hole, from what I understand. Relative movement of the objects aside, it's a collision between a black hole object and a chunk of regular matter. The shell can be understood to be a super-thin layer of black holes surrounding the planet. Those black holes would draw each other closer together in a more or less uniform fashion, causing the shell to constrict around the planet until it was incorporated into the mass of the forming singular object made of the black holes. The collision of two black holes, or of matter falling into an event horizon are both often studied subjects in the field, but I'm mostly clueless about the particulars of that. Well, since there are different size black holes, I don't see how the consensus isn't B). &gt; For more open-ended questions, try /r/AskScienceDiscussion I see it as a similar reason to simplifying fractions or turning "improper fractions" into mixed numbers.  Think about it, what's easier to understand mentally, 1/3 of something or 166792/500376 of something?  Or what about 52/3 of something?  Well that's 17 and 1/3 of something, that makes more intuitive sense right?

Similarly, what is 2/sqrt(2) of something?  Well if I "get rid of" the radical in the denominator I get 2sqrt(2)/2 or sqrt(2), or "each person gets sqrt(2) of something".  From basic experiences you are used to splitting things among objects that you can count.  In many cases division is taught that way (12/4 is 3 because you split 12 things evenly among 4 people).  Splitting something among an irrational amount of things isn't intuitive and this process helps you see what the value might be intuitively.  I don't know how you would split 2 among sqrt(2) things but I know how to split 2 sqrt(2)s among 2 people. Completely identical (with individual variance, of course).

"Anatomically modern humans" date in the fossil record back [to 200,000 years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomically_modern_humans), so a 1000 year jump is nothing at all.

Variation in nutrition, exposure to infectious disease and lack of modern medicine would have increased the percentage of humans who suffered from diseases which can affect stature, bone density or optimal development, but the anatomical blueprint would remain the same.

There is some evidence that Paleolithic (pre-farming) humans were more robust (sturdy, powerful) compared to modern humans which are gracile (slender). This transition is also 10,000+ years ago, however. You are right in saying that there are simply too many deflectors. Light moves at such a great velocity that any amount of angle less than or greater than exactly 90 would ruin the orbit very quickly. Also you have to keep in mind that even for a black hole that has relatively little light scattering matter falling in, any change in mass of the black hole will change the radius of the Event Horizon, thus changing the size of the Photon Sphere. 

In principle it would be possible for a black hole in a vacuum to have perfectly orbiting light around it, but in the natural world such a thing would be very unlikely due to the miniscule size of a photon and the extreme precision of angles required.

As for your question about rings; no it would not be possible for a black hole to have light rings. There is only one, exact distance away from a black hole that light can orbit (1.5 times the radius of the Event Horizon), and only one, exact angle (90). Any deviation and the light would not orbit. There's no magic going on there, it does detract directly from fuel efficiency.  It's just a very small factor compared to everything else that effects efficiency. &gt; For more open-ended questions, try /r/AskScienceDiscussion Why does distance matter? Redshift is due to the source of the wave moving away, not how far away the source is. People who suffer from bipolar disease experience both polarizations in mood: depressive episodes and manic episodes. Both poles = bipolar. Not really - an event horizon is a property inherent to a black hole. It's what makes an object a black hole. No offense, but that doesn't really explain how or why.  That's just saying what commonly accepted rule you would break. You're misunderstanding - they're saying that an object inside the event horizon cannot orbit a black hole. 1.5 times the radius of the event horizon is the minimum distance you can conceivably orbit at, and at that distance you must be traveling with an orbital speed (sideways) equal to the speed of light.

Gravity from a black hole actually behaves the same as gravity from a star - in fact, gravity from any distributed mass behaves the same as gravity from a point mass of the same mass located at the center of mass of the distributed mass, as long as you are far enough away. So if the sun were replaced by a sun three times the volume but the same mass, we'd remain in the same orbit. If the sun were replaced by a black hole the mass of the sun, we'd remain in the same orbit. Far away, gravity doesn't care what you are or what you're shaped like - just how much mass you have.

 Just to throw some more math out there, you can prove for the case of a uniform spherical moon (or any spherical mass), where the gravity is the only force acting on you (i.e. frictionless), and with a uniform mass density, that the time it takes to move along any cord would be 187950/sqrt(p) where p is the density of the sphere. So in the case of an ice moon you would get that it takes ~102.5min. I'd call that a spiral shaped orbit. It doesn't just drop strait towards the singularity, it keeps moving sideways, and curves around. What about a highly elliptical orbit, formed by a highly energetic mass? I assume the orbit would decay but maybe a planet with the proper initial trajectory and velocity could follow such an orbit many many times, with the minor axis within the event horizon? OP asked for the exact speed, not an upper limit.  If you're kitty pride, then you will escape after falling through and emerging on the other side. Otherwise, collision. All that is a bit much for me..
How does the boiling point of water vs. say ethanol change as pressure decreases? how are they comparable?  
I am not a chemist There's only one light speed. The propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a medium is rather erroneously called light speed - it's got little to do with it, it's a macroscopic effect.

Propagation happens in fits and starts: a photon moves with light speed, then it gets absorbed by the electron, sometime later it gets re-emitted, rinse and repeat. At any given time, a photon either exists and moves with light speed, or it doesn't exist. On top of it, a photon may be moving at a given moment in the direction other than the average direction of propagation.

There are *no* photons that move at a speed other than light speed. It should probably be noted that in the old days, radio-based remote control devices did not have rolling codes. For instance, on garage door openers, manufacturers used a single frequency, and a simple receiver that only listened for *any* transmission on that frequency. The theory was that the product would be distributed enough that the closest guy who had the same garage door opener would be far enough away that he wouldn't cause you any problems. 

In practice, this didn't always work - it wasn't terribly unusual for someone to discover that their garage door opener also opened the garage door on the house down the street. 

Then they moved to a multi-code setup. You'd flip a series of tiny switches in both the remote and in the opener itself, and that would "pair" the two. Now if your remote opened your neighbor's door, you could just change the switch settings, and his door would no longer listen to your remote. This, too, was problematic, because it could be brute-forced. A thief with the same brand of remote as you had could hide in the bushes and sit there flipping each switch in sequence, pressing the open button after each change. Eventually he'd stumble onto your settings and get your door open.

Then they finally graduated to the rolling code system you talked about. I mention garage door openers because the technologies are remarkably similar -- modern keyless entry systems even use a common garage door frequency, 315 MHz. 

BTW, very early keyless entry systems from German manufacturers used infrared, not radio signals, to control the system, as did some mid-90's Chryslers. 

Also BTW, less-early keyless entry systems used a unique code from the manufacturer rather than a rolling code, but thieves started using code grabbers to intercept the code the fob sent. They then waited until you were away from your car, sent that code, got it unlocked, and pilfered your stuff or stole your car. Hence the transition to rolling code.


 The only physics education I possess is wikipedia- and reddit-based. I do find it absolutely fascinating, though. I should be working, but I'm reading about fermions and bosons,  spin specifically.  Baking powder is baking soda plus some acidic agents, such as cream of tartar.

Baking soda is sodium [bicarbonate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate), which can act as a weak base. The other part of baking powder is an acid (e.g., cream of tartar is tartaric acid). When these are dissolved in solution, the acid protonates the bicarbonate to yield carbonic acid, which decomposes to yield water and carbon dioxide. This is why you use baking powder to [leaven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leavening_agent) your baked goods - it rises because carbon dioxide is produced in your dough.

Hydrogen peroxide is also a weak acid, so it also contributes to this. More importantly, hydrogen peroxide [spontaneously decomposes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide#Decomposition) into water and oxygen. In the presence of nucleation sites - like a powder - this would speed up the decomposition.

So your bottle swelled up because oxygen and carbon dioxide is produced. Never mind an actual planet would disintegrate due to gravitaitonal shear, and possibly stresses from extremely high velocity in such an orbit. I worked in a lab that does 3D FISH. Although nearly all of your cells have the same DNA, it is actively used in some but left inactive in other due to modifications to the histone proteins that coil DNA. Additionally, much of DNA contains regulatory sequences that bend and twist conformation to bind transcription factors to activate genes. Using fluorescent DNA probes we can highlight several areas of DNA at once and see if they are close to each other and facilitate binding of transcription factor or are distended and inactive. Of course this is a bit of an approximation: the orbits would be *much nicer*. At the orbital distances, any gravitational inhomogeneity of the black hole would be orders of magnitude smaller than the effects the inhomogeneity of Earth has. How small would a black hole with the mass of the earth be?  I'd imagine that'd be incredibly small.  I wouldn't imagine you could create a black hole with such little matter. It's sad to see you're getting down-voted for asking for a source/explanation on a science sub. Well, you'd see the reflected image 2x days in the past, since the light has to travel there and back again.

That said, there's no way to actually build such a mirror or to be able to see the image of the Earth in it. I suggest asking this in /r/AskScienceDiscussion since it doesn't have a definitive answer. If you mean with the sentence "the default vision is at infinity" to answer the question what the resting focal distance is. This is incorrect, and was believed until the paper of Leibowitz and Owens (1978) was published.

&amp;nbsp;

Also most presbyopia patients have still the possibilty of a distant focus at infinity, in most cases only the near focus is affected. To a first approximation: yes. Nevertheless, stars are IIRC much more gravitationally homogenous than rock planets, never mind black holes. The density variations of the Moon make low orbits (say &lt;15km) unstable. Such variations on Earth make it necessary to use the geoid for highest accuracy orbital predictions, IIRC. That along with solar wind and other effects, of course. This question made me think of a question, and I'm asking you because I've seen you on this subreddit many times. My question is this, if objects bend the fabric of space, wouldn't newtons 3rd law predict an equal and opposite force on the object(planet for instance) from the space that it is bending? As mentioned, there are ways to stimulate neurons in the brain. I don't believe we currently have a good enough idea of the structure of low-level auditory areas of the brain to stimulate them in a way which would give you anything resembling the kind of audition you'd want.

Your options are basically direct stimulation by implanting electrodes in the brain. This is possible, and has been done in vision where we have a better model of what specific neurons are doing in low-level visual perception. This, however, involves incredibly invasive surgery, so it's risky enough that so far as I'm aware, it's only been done by people who were specifically interested in seeing whether it was possible or not.

The other option is to stimulate neurons from outside the brain. This can't be done with any real precision. The only technology I'm aware of would be Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), where a magnetic field is created by a device outside the skull. This basically disrupts whatever processing was going on in the cortex at that area of the brain. It can be used to basically remove your ability to move a specific body part, or to disrupt other abilities which are carried out in the neocortex. I don't believe a technology like that would ever let you stimulate neurons in a specific way so that you'd get something like an "in-brain MP3 player" Excellent answer. While the Gauss laws can be seen just as initial conditions, in terms of the independent information they provide to electromagnetism, they also hold true for all points in time and not just at the initial time. For later points in time, the Gauss laws can be seen as mathematically redundant, but they still hold true and are still useful numerically. If you build a numerical solver that solves Maxwell's equations, you can get away with only applying the Gauss laws at the beginning and then ignore them, and you will still get the right answer to within some numerical error. But if you apply the Gauss laws at every time step, you reduce the numerical error since they still hold true. wut I agree about the environmental fit, but there will always be competition for resources within a species in the natural world. If you take away external pressures - as has largely happened for humans in the western world - you still get variations in birth rates so some genes are passed down more and some less. What you get in time is less winnowing of previously maladaptive traits since these traits no longer have a bearing on the ability to have offspring. Keep in mind that eventually environental pressures factor back in due to population growth and limits to resources. Thank you for your submission!

A planet could occupy that position briefly, but it would quickly be thrown out of equilibrium. Some of what joalr0 said is valid. It *is* true that there is no way to test if the theory is still valid inside of a black hole. We assume it's valid, but we have no way of telling whether it is. Not quite sure what you are asking but remember light, while fast, has a finite speed.  *Everything* you see is how those things were in the past.  For most things, such as stuff you see in the world around you, that time differential is so small as to make no difference.

But when you look into space the distances mean those time differentials are noticeable.

So yeah, if I was two light days from earth then I would see the earth as it was two days ago. If it exploded yesterday I would not know it till another day passed.
 It's a concept. It "exists" only in our minds. Thanks man
 Here is another question.... How do we know we aren't already well inside a blackhole? Information is retained right? Surely with everything being relative then proximity to the centre of a blackhole doesn't really change much about day-to-day life. Thank you for your submission!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* The universe isn't expanding faster than the speed of light. If it were you would not be able to see any stars.  Check out [triple point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_point), the point in temperature and pressure such that all three states of matter can exist in equilibrium.

Also, what you described would be the solid/vapour transition line in a [phase diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram). At those temperatures and pressures, solid and vapour will exist in equilibrium. The outermost layer cools and solidifies, then flakes off due to it's solid state rather than compressing like the hotter, more malleable inside. Light doesn't slow down. I know GR is clear on this, I said as much.  But since no information leaves a black hole, we do not have any experiments to actually confirm the GR is still valid inside an event horizon.  

It's MOST likely valid at that point, and we have no reason to doubt it except near the actual singularity where we require a theory of quantum gravity to make sense of it.  However, no theory in science should ever be considered fully confirmed unless it's tested.  The concept that GR is still valid inside the event horizon has not been tested. It's cold metal. It's not soft like the rest of the ingot because it's on the surface and has lost its heat to the outside world. It would be soft when hot like the rest of the metal, but it's not as hot, so it's solid and brittle. There are many options:

* You could also use a cloud storage service like [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/)

* For direct computer-to-computer transfer you can use an established file transfer protocol/system like [FTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol). Common web browsers have (good) FTP plugins available. I recommend checking this out.

* For cases where you want to share a version controlled repository of data with multiple people you can use [git](http://git-scm.com/). [Github](https://github.com/) offers a really web service around git and is sort of the de facto file share system for people working in teams on software development.

The most important thing to remember is to never let anyone connect any hardware to your computer unless you know *exactly* where it came from and trust the other person.
 And there's not enough displaced light to be visible?  Rust. Rust doesn't soften when heated, so it flakes off as the steel is shaped. Yeah, it's [Prosopagnosia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia). You're thinking of Doppler redshit; what is discussed here is gravitational redshift: as you climb a gravitational potential well, you lose some energy. True. That is also why short-sighted people cannot focus a far away image even if it is reflected on a mirror. Thank you for your submission!

Open-ended questions are not suitable for /r/askscience. Fruits often are mostly water and sugar. Both is not very useful for the seed. The nutrients are in the seed itself. For example a seed of corn. 

It's a teeny-tiny corn plant with leaves (cotelydones) , root and stem (hypocotyle) and a so called endosperm. It consists of starch. This are basically very long sugar molecules which are broken down to glucose to feed the little plant and help it grow.  Assuming that the billet is steel, that scale is iron oxide, and other oxides depending on the exact alloy, which are basically ceramics and therefore do not not soften at those temperature.  Eh, I don't know that that's really a great way to think about it. The name tidal forces comes from the fact that it is the force behind the tides on Earth, where the water on Earth has a force exerted upon it by Earth's moon which pulls them towards it, causing the water levels to appear to rise to an observer on that side of the Earth.

In the context of a black hole, it may be easier to think about objects orbiting planets. The [Roche Limit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit) is the theoretical distance at which solid objects can no longer orbit another larger body, because the tidal forces tend to pull them apart. In practice, it depends upon the composition of the object, but within the Roche limit, there is so much force acting upon one side of the object that it pulls it apart from the other side, breaking it apart. Spaghettification is this taken to an extreme, wherein the force is not just breaking rocks into chunks, but is so strong that it starts pulling molecules and atoms apart.

Also, FWIW, I took a minute to do some calculations to try to explain the whole distance thing a bit better and because I was curious. Voyager 1 is the furthest man-made object from Earth, and we can calculate how much force Earth's mass is exerting on it.

* On the surface of the Earth before it was launched, it was about 7100 N, easy to determine given its weight (722kg)
* When it crossed the Martian orbit, 54.6 million km from Earth, about 9.6*10^-5 N, or equivalent to the thrust of the NSTAR ion engine (thanks Wolfram)
* Currently, at 130AU from the Earth, 8.2*10^-10 N, or about 1/100 the force exerted by the nucleus on an electron in a hydrogen atom. Not zero, but of no practical import. [There is no dark side of the Moon](http://science.howstuffworks.com/dark-side-of-moon2.htm). The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth. It rotates about its own axis as it orbits the Earth but it takes the same amount of time to perform one rotation as one orbit, so the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth - the *near side*.

The Astronauts landed on the near side of the Moon, so that they could maintain radio contact with the Earth and they mostly walked around outside while the Sun was shining on them.

[If you look at these pictures](http://www.clavius.org/analyze.html) you'll see that they were all taken in bright sunshine, with strong shadows being cast on the surface of the Moon.

It's also worth pointing out that flash photography predates the Moon landings by almost 100 years. Nothing. They don't destroy matter. Your body produces heat. In order to remain at a constant temperature, it has to lose heat to the surroundings at the same rate heat is being produces. Since heat flows from warm things to cold things, In order to do this, your body has to be warmer than the surroundings. Lol redshit  Have you taken a look at the [Wikipedia article on natural selection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection)? I always had the impression that at least European humans were shorter, do you know if this is true? (I find a lot of older buildings seem to be built for shorter people) Latency absolutely is a problem. If we ever had a moon base or a mars base latency would make the current internet be unusable.

Right now, serving a website from the UK to Australia is noticeably slow, hence the widespread use of CDNs to ensure users hit a nearby server.

RTC like video chat, VoIP, and extending the definition slightly, online gaming are all hampered by this.

There isn't a lot of ways round this - a user in Sydney talking to a user in London will always have the speed of light to contend with, even if a fibre optic cable was dug connecting the two directly through the earths core! Because you need to go to fucking school.
Seriously?? Fuck man.. In fact, there is no centre, the Big Bang happened everywhere. This is a common misconception, with a [good answer](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/f24pw/did_the_universe_actually_start_out_as_a_single/c1cpt8b) in the FAQ. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0o6hQLcSRc) video explains it well. Just one clarification that thought might be misunderstood from my comment. In a spacetime that satisfies some technical conditions that roughly can be understood as being static (i.e. the spacetime is not changing with time), there is a meaningful definition of Energy for particles in it and it is conserved. So essentially the kinetic energy converts to potential energy and viceversa as we are used to.

See this reference for the redshift equation in a Schwarzschild spacetime (from which it is easy to obtain the energy of a photon): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_redshift#Exact_Solutions It's mentioned in the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithobraking). The outer surface (which *is* oxide scale) is hot enough to be luminous at an orange colour, so it is at a temperature of about 3000K, and assuming that the billet is steel, at such temperatures will have lost  of its strength. They were, but this can be linked to variation in nutrition as he mentioned. Naturally if a rocket is carrying a person, significant care will be provided so the person will travel/return safely. There are many factors to co side for eg g forces.  However launching a rocket in itself is an extremely expensive procedure so yes they take just as much care . OK, I think this makes sense. Does this have any relation to time dilation in a gravity well? Why would you be increasing your velocity if you were pushing "away" from the event horizon. You said all paths lead to the center of the singularity, can you elaborate please? During the last ice age, the glaciers rolled through Canada first, so the bigger badder glaciers made bigger badder lakes. You can see a bit of the lake carving still in Minnesota. This could have easily been answered by Google. Like...really dude?  You can create a black hole with as little matter as you want, at least until you get down to the scale where quantum effects need to be accounted for.  One with the mass of Earth would have a radius of just under 9 millimeters.

The reason you don't see (or don't notice, at least) tiny black holes is because they evaporate very quickly due to Hawking radiation.  Using the formula given in [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation#Black_hole_evaporation), it looks like an Earth-sized black hole would take 5.7*10^50 years to evaporate.  For something a little smaller, a black hole with the mass of a space shuttle on the launchpad would evaporate in about 11 minutes. Far more glacial activity - the farther south you go, the fewer glaciers there were to carve out those lakes No. WTF? No. &gt; Actually the clocks on earth will run noticeably slower than the clocks on your spaceship

Then why do the clocks on a space shuttle run slower than ones on earth? Is it because they're orbiting the earth and not moving at a constant velocity? The speed of light puts a fundamental limit to how fast you can send one packet of information from point A to point B. But you can always send more packets of information at once in order to increase the information transfer rate. Put crudely, if you lay two data lines between New York and Boston and use both lines at once, you can send twice the information per second even though each individual signal is still going the same speed. Also, there are more ways to increase the amount of information sent at once than just laying more data lines, such as frequency multiplexing. 

The bottom line is that the physical travel speed of an electrical or fiber optic signal is a completely different thing from the information transfer rate (although they can be related). 

Now, if you are referring to near real-time back and forth communication, so that one packet of information cannot be sent until one packet of information has been received and analyzed (such as a phone call with a lot of back and forth talking), then yes, the speed of light limit becomes more of an issue, because sending more packets of information at once won't help in this case. For instance, if you were in Boston and called on the phone a friend in Sydney, if you asked a question of your friend, the shortest amount of time you could ever hear the response in is 0.1 seconds because of the speed-of-light limit. But this is so short that I doubt you would notice it. In contrast, the shortest amount of time it would take to send a single packet of information from Earth to Mars is about 3 minutes. So a back-and-forth phone conversation with your friend on Mars would be no where near real-time. Well the most basic principle about General Relativity is that, where ever you are. Regardless of your speed, **you always experience the same physics as someone of the outside.   
If you use a mirror in that Train, the Light would have to bounce from the mirror and reach to your eyes in the speed of light.  But from the outsiders perspective, if someone would see all that.  
They would think that the speed of light is 1.5 times, why? because the Light has to travel at the speed of light + the speed of the train, to reach your eyes.  
Obviously we know that this isnt true, because we **have to**  the speed of the mirrors Light at the speed of Light.   
So how do can we fix this? Well at that speeds the effects of **special relativty** are starting to play a bigger and bigger role.   
You can even [calculate this easily yourself] (http://www.1728.org/reltivty.htm), by putting the right numbers in it.  
(for e.g. half the speed of light is 150.000.000 m/s and 150.000 km/s) with this you get a relatistic change factor of 1.15 .  
Now we are left with the Question what this Factor actually means, it simply gives you the Factor of how much your Train **increases in mass** at that speed. This means a 100 metric Ton Train is going to be **1.15 Times heavier** at that speed.    
But what about your live broadcast? As is already said, its the basic principle of general relativity that whichever speed or perspective you are looking at something **The Physics seems for the outsider and the insider the same, regardless of perspective** Could you explain why the gravity of the binary star system creates an unstable equilibrium as opposed to a stable one?

Also, during [fermentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation) some bacteria can perform [substrate-level phosphorylation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substrate-level_phosphorylation) to directly convert ADP to ATP. It's more about the atmosphere.

Venus' air is 96.5% carbon dioxide.

It would be pretty good for plants if not for the tempreature.

At 452^c mean temperature, there aren't any plants we know of that can survive that.  Let alone surface water for them to hydrate.  Doesn't mean there aren't extremeophiles that can. Very thorough and well typed answer. Thank you. Yes, it's because of glaciers in past ice ages. Canada is further north than the US meaning more glaciers to carve out lakes. I believe tidal forces (the difference in force on the near side versus the far side) would rip the planet apart pretty quickly.  The smaller the black hole, the more likely the planet would be to fall apart. For chord, you're solving for the intersection of two conic sections. That's a quartic at worst, if I'm not mistaken, and can be [solved by hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartic_function#Solving_a_quartic_equation), so pretty easily in just about every programming language out there.

Read the page I linked to for the details. I don't quite understand what you are getting at. If I understand you right, this is exactly what GPS does: it uses radio frequency signals to determine the location of a transceiver. GPS can definitely locate objects to an accuracy better than 50 meters.

If you mean a local system, then radar or lidar systems do what you have in mind.  If you were falling towards the center at 20mph, then turned around and boosted 40mph in the opposite direction, you would still be headed towards the center. 

You would now be traveling at 40mph though. Besides the fact that "less dangerous" is slightly ambiguous, the question is testing your application of Newton's third law and momentum change.

The two scenarios are identical, because the same amount of force is applied to your vehicle in both scenarios, and the same impulse is experienced. Would the orbit of a planet change if the star it was orbiting was replaced by a black hole of the same mass? but how would such little matter create the gravity necessary to create a singularity?  Or is gravity a by product and not the cause?  I was under the impression that black holes were created when mass was greater than the strength of the atomic bonds and it collapsed upon itself.   Somebody just saw Interstellar At any one time half the moon is illuminated, and half is dark. The parts that are lit and dark are always changing. The images of the dark side of the moon were taken during a New Moon where the moon seemed dark to us but the other side of the moon was lit by the Sun. About photon spheres, it is like a spherical laser wall because so much light is orbiting it? Hypothetically, could a spaceship moving at close to the speed of light on it's approach to the black hole achieve an orbit within the  photon sphere by accelerating/decelerating into the orbit? The equations that define the spheres diameter presumably assume no other forces acting on the photon except gravity. I see what you did there You're using positive and negative reinforcement incorrectly. See [this simplified chart](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Operant_conditioning_diagram.png). Hijacking this thread to ask another question:

We know the equation for the Roche limit is R=2.44r(pM/pm)^(1/3). With a singularity being infinitely dense and with zero radius, how would we calulate the Roche limit? We know that, if a black hole exists and the roche limit is infinite, then the entire universe would be dust - but if it's zero, then objects would be capable of orbiting a black hole at any distance (within the laws of physics). Or would it have to be calculated using limits/calculus/etc? There was a lot of work done to determine the maximum round trip delay for a voice call.

There is a story about one of the early researchers setting up a controlled delay device on his phone. When his wife called to ask him to pick something from the store on his way home from work and it took him more than X ms  (200? 500?) to respond, she interpreted that as his not wanting to do the errand and triggered an angry response from her. Unfortunately I can't find that story just now.

A couple of things I did just find online say that 200 to 250 ms is the limit on delay for a conversation to feel natural. So 0.1 s should be okay, but really it's already getting close to the limit. If you get a satellite connection between Boston and Sidney instead of fiber optic, be prepared to have patience if you want the call to go well. Edge effect is when you see differences between your observations from wells on the edges of microplates and those on the inside. One reason for this is the temperature gradient across the plate. The edge wells are not fully surrounded by other wells, so the heating and cooling rates may differ from the centre. This can lead to the edges evaporating more quickly. This is especially an issue when you are using 384 or 1536 well plates. You can work around this by not using the edges and putting water in these wells, or using a plate specifically designed to reduce this effect. The equation for the [Schwarzschild radius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius#Formula) is r= (2Gm)/C^2
where:

G is the gravitational constant;

m is the mass of the object; and

c is the speed of light in vacuum.

The equation for the radius of the [photon sphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere) is r= (3Gm)/C^2

So, yes. The photon sphere is exactly 1.5 times the radius of event horizon. But I'm a lawyer, so I couldn't begin to tell you why. Relevant [what-if.xkcd](https://what-if.xkcd.com/20/) Yes, definitely. The apparent motion of of the sun is caused by the rotation of the Earth. If you travel West at a speed relative to ground that equals the rotational speed of the Earth, then you cancel out your motion due to Earth's rotation and end up motionless relative to the sun. You could watch a sunrise for six hours straight. This is easily done with an airplane. Anyone who has traveled a lot can attest to this.

Note that if you circled the entire world in this way and landed where you took off, you would land at the exact same time that you took off, but one day later, because you crossed the international date line. Looking at it more physically, it would be one day later because the Earth has rotated exactly once relative to the sun since you took off. &gt; Doppler redshit

*redshift It's not a simple matter of more care being taken.  It's a matter of the very rockets themselves.

When designing a rocket for human spaceflight, many things need to be taken into consideration that a cargo rocket would not necessarily have to be concerned with in its design.  Things like, intrinsic redundancy, in-flight abort procedures, alternative orbit plans, etc.  Furthermore, the vehicles designed to be launched with humans aboard generally have to be designed to survive the return trip.  All of these things drastically increase the cost of rockets designed to transport humans.

While it's certainly important for a company putting non-human payload into space to have a high success rate, there is not quite as much pressure in the design phase for the things mentioned above.  In a cargo rocket, a cost/reliability ratio can be evaluated and considered.

Think of it this way: the launch company can take out an insurance policy on launches to recover their customer's costs in the event of a failure, and the cost of this insurance would be based on any information available to the insurance company, such as success rates, reliability considerations, etc.

No insurance company can recover lives, though, so factors like cost/reliability become meaningless for manned missions. The stronger the pull (based on the size of the black hole), the more blue shifted it gets? I can solve **A** chord, that's not that big of a deal.  What i want to do is make a number of chords around the interior that form a polygon of equal length sides, alternately a series of points that have the same length of line path between them So, it's not 1.5 after all! It's 3/2! Pretty much. Objects under acceleration are subject to general relativity, and without going into the math (because I don't know it off the top of my head) between general relativity for acceleration and special relativity for velocity, it's ensured that when an astronaut returns to mission control, they'll agree about how much relative time has passed. &gt; So, yes. The photon sphere is exactly 1.5 times the radius of event horizon. But I'm a lawyer, so I couldn't begin to tell you why.

That's going to be a problem for you when I murder someone with a photon sphere and then hire you to defend me. So if we could move faster than light but still be affected by the black hole we could orbit at a closer distance?

 That's why we hire expert witnesses. I was under the impression that dark energy wasn't a repulsive force but the name given to the phenomenon of space time being expanded... Or some such. Very cool, hadn't though of those possibilities, thanks!

Follow-up then... How do we know Earth's mass!? This seems even more impossible to prove than the answer to my question you just answered, ha.  not for you

pretty sure the only thing that could do this is a sr-71 or a space ship Yeah, I wasn't super happy with my wording, but I didn't really know how else to describe it to get my point across.  I guess just pretend I said praise and criticism instead. You can't really violate universal laws of physics. That's what makes them laws. If you did seem to manage to violate a law, it would just show that the concept was not really a universal law and scientists need to find a better idea to treat as the universal law. In thought experiments, you can violate any law you want, but it typically leads to nonsense. So depending on the inner structure, the magnetic field would behave differently, so we can pinpoint its material / temperature etc? Thanks! There is no real consensus because they are all mathematically/theoretically valid hypotheses considering how little we know about quantum gravity and/or black holes. 

Consider this, during the [very early universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe#Very_early_universe), are conditions of the singularity similar to that? Would it be like playing the very early universe, in reverse, as the singularity collapses and gets denser and denser? No. What about rockets carrying worms? What do you mean escape to infinity? I thought at relativistic momentum an objects theoretical mass increases. Hypothermia occurs when your body temperature goes below 35.0 C. If we were cold blooded, that would mean any external temperature below 35.0 C would result in hypothermia. However, humans are warm blooded, and convert some of our digested energy (calories) into heat. One calorie is the energy required to raise the temperature of one cubic centimeter (1 ml) of water one degree. The average adult human has 4.7-5.5 liters of blood, giving us a result of ~5000 calories to raise your body temperature by one degree. However, we also receive energy from the heat in the air around us, and our skin acts as an insulator, helping us to maintain our body heat (severe burn victims often experience hypothermia). Obviously, we don't need to consume anywhere near that many food calories to survive, averaging around 1,300 to maintain basic bodily functions, such as digestion, brain function and temperature regulation. Adding in movement and speech, you get ~2000 if you don't put excessive strain on yourself. Of course, this is if you're in a room temperature environment (~24C). Lower the temperature (outside calories), and you need to increase the number of food calories you consume. At 37C outside temperature, you would need only minimal calories to regulate body temperature, bringing it down to ~900 calories for an average person doing only basic movement. So, assuming this is a linear process, for every 13C you drop, you require an additional 1100 calories. 

However, water freezes at 0C, which causes tissue damage (ie; frostbite), so the safest temperature you can survive in naked is ~5C without suffering tissue damage, provided you consume ~3610 calories and don't exercise too much. Pluto and Charon are basically like this. Simply put, because science isn't religion: We would study the violation and update any laws accordingly. It would be an exciting time for science! I don't know if I've seen any models of their relationship.  But it's good to know, thanks. thank you very much!  this topic is something that i have been curious about for many, many years! The best answer to your question is probably based on the [cosmic microwave background](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background). The "temperature" of the universe is currently about 2.726 Kelvins (very cold).

I'm not *quite* knowledgeable enough about thermodynamics to answer the second question, though I imagine the answer is no, at least not in outer space. This hurts my brain Is this a reference?  Photon Spheres are blacklisted. Would you mind elaborating on the deeper reason?  A factor would be how close they were to the star, which might make their mutual orbits un-stable. Arclength along an ellipse is given by the famous [elliptic integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_integral). The inverse functions are called [Jacobi elliptic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_elliptic_functions). To do it this way, you'll need to slam your head against your desk for a while until you've worked out exactly which function you want and get some software that can compute values.

It might be easier to go for chord length and write a program that does a kind of search algorithm. Something like: Start at a point, take a circle of radius r and find the next point where it intersects the ellipse counterclockwise, repeat until you come back around and see how close you got to the first point, adjust until it closes up. Doesn't that mean that the photonsphere is infinitesimally thin? Since going a bit towards the black hole would result in an orbital radius of 1.49999 R and going a bit out would be 1.500001 R? I'm guessing the human-rating certification involves more cost to enforce, hence as much care wouldn't be taken on non-human rockets. But it still seems odd to think that we aren't doing *everything* we possibly can to ensure that no rocket ever blows up The guardians might take you to the citadel and encase you in pink crystal. You may even meet your dad! But if the Litch is there he would melt all the crystal before he tried to kill you.

That's what you get for killing a dream master like Prismo though. I'd like to tag a related question onto this: Is there a point where light can neither escape, nor get pulled into the blackhole (just stagnant in space)? Or is the event horizon the exact line where light can *barely* escape, but as soon as that line is met, then light will start getting pulled into the blackhole? I like the insurance explanation, I hadn't thought of it this way. Cheers Pluto and Charon are exactly like that.

 But there isn't an event horizon *inside* the shell, is there? Within your description, it would then seem more like getting hit by a naked singularity.  

That also doesn't seem totally satisfying, though.  The point of the shell example seems to be that the energy required to escape outward from the outer surface of the shell has nothing to do with the energy required to move around inside the shell, right? So if the Earth's mass were redistributed into a sphere, you'd need to jump at 11.2km/s to escape outward if you stood on the outer surface. If it were a Jupiter sphere, you'd need 59.6 km/s. But in both cases, if your feet were planted on the *inside* of the sphere, there would be no net pull on you toward your feet, right? You can go exploring the interior of either of those spheres for free, energy-wise. Just push off the inner surface with a velocity of at least 1/infinity.

So now say you keep increasing the density of the sphere or shrinking its radius.  The escape velocity outward from the outer surface approaches (and then exceeds?) infinity. But the energy required to escape inward from the interior surface isn't approaching anything, is it? It's still just 0 (or 1/infinity).  So falling from the outside toward the outer surface -- approaching the event horizon -- means moving into a well that is more and more difficult to climb out of the further you fall. But approaching the inner surface from the inside doesn't seem like that at all. You can get to within 1mm of it -- probably even touch it? -- and still go zipping off toward some other place in the interior, away from the inner surface, just as easily as if you were at the center, right?  So it's difficult to understand how the experience of approaching the inner surface would be like falling toward an event horizon. increasing piqued my interest It's the, "point of no return," so to speak. The event horizion is a globe a blackness from which nothing, not even light, can escape. This is due to the gravitational effects of the singularity, in the center of the event horizon. The singularity is an infinitely small point of MASSIVE density and is what causes the gravitational effects that make a black hole act like a vacuum. Surrounding the event horizon, in an active black hole, is an accretion disc, a swirling mass of extremely hot matter that is orbiting the black hole. The accretion disc is matter that has been destroyed by the tidal forces of the black hole.

The event horizon causes the black hole phenomenon that we think of when we think of a black hole, but it itself is a byproduct of the mass of the singularity at its center. 

&lt;/not an expert, just have a fascination with astronomy and astrophysics to the best of my ability to comprehend it&gt; Rather simple observational physics [here's a step by step](http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=207).

In a nutshell, M = (R^2)*Fgrav / G*m, where  Fgrav/m, G, and R can all be measured or calculated from surface observable data. From there it is plug and chug...

 That has to do with how we handle heat and cold and our nutrition.  The important part of photosynthesis isn't the splitting of water, it's carbon fixation. Plants are able to take CO2 out of the air, break off the carbon, and make sugar.

We have already figured out how to take nitrogen out of the air and fix that, forming fertilizer (the [Haber process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process), which is considered one of the greatest achievements in human history.) Figuring out artificial photosynthesis would be an achievement of similar scale. All great points! Pretty much exactly what you said is outlined in the articles I linked too. I just thought I'd summarize since I didn't want to write a novel. :) http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Worms_in_Space No. It's an artificial construct predicted by the math, it has no real physicality. The photosphere is just a theoretical construct, it is to unstable to exist in reality. Partly because it would be disturbed by anything in the vicinity. The drugoon would take you to the shadow proclamation  Yes. He asked why.  No not really. Caffeine is a stable substance, it can even boil in pure form at about 400 degrees and even the hot vapors are stable. Boiling it in water for a long time might produce some sort of hydrolysis but considering the bonds an extremely small (not measurable) amount would actually react. If the water was acidic or basic enough the reaction might take place. Again, this would be a chemical reaction with water, not a decomposition. Hi FiveAlarmDogParty,  

&gt; what would the temperature be there without any influence? 

There is no such thing as "no influence", because anything interacts with the surrounding and there isn't any remote place where something is protected form anything else. Assuming there was something with no interaction at all (which is an idealized state and not possible in our world), the temperature would be 0 K or -273,15C. With modern laser cooling we can achieve temperatures of a few billionth Kelvin. The avarage radiation temperature of the universe is some 2,7 K. That means a body with no near heat source would reach this temperature via the radiation crossing around the universe. Some places may have lower temperatures due to other processes like expansion of gas. One of the is the [boomerang nebula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomerang_Nebula). Keep also in mind that only matter can have a temperature. Space itself can't have a temperature, because space isn't made of particles (and the definition of temperature is the movement of particles in a volume). 

&gt; is there anything known to actually give off 'cold'? Sort of like an interstellar air conditioner?  

Well, that's a question of definition. In a general sense, the answer is no. cold isn't something, cold is the absence of heat. We experience something as hot, when it gives off more radiation than we do. And we experience something as cold when it gives off less radiation than we do. So actually cold things aren't a source of coldness, but instead we are a source of heat. Simply said, heat is just a temperature gradient between two things and of course, if there's something that has a high temperature, then something with a lower temperature will absorb some of the energy and warm up until the reach equilibrium with the heat source. When there is no temperature gradient, no heat will be transferred. The event horizon is just the point of no return, it isn't some physical structure. yes Gravity affects all particles no mater if they have mass or not. It's worth mentioning that (if we ignore general relativity for a second) time dilation applies equally both ways. We see the clocks on the space shuttle as running slowly because they're moving relative to us, but they also see our clocks as running slowly because we're moving relative to them. Neither perspective is preferred by the laws of physics.

The reason why their clocks are actually slower when they return to Earth is because the people on board the shuttle experience acceleration that the people on Earth do not, and this acceleration is not relative. If it gets inside the event horizon it wouldn't be able to get out. The minor axis need to be at least the radius of the photosphere. The diameter of a circle is also exactly 2 times the size of it's radius The orbit is unstable so it doesn't exists at all in practice. Yes. that is possible. It keeps moving away from the black hole until it hits something else. Yes, thank you. As with all things in engineering, it's a matter of "good enough" for the given cost. The orbit is unstable so it doesn't exists at all in practice. You can't see photons unless they are hitting your eyeballs. It's largely due to the fact that a large part of Canada is underlain by old igneous and metamorphic rocks that make up the [Canadian Shield.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Shield)  Water doesn't really seep into crystalline basement rock the way it can with a sedimentary basin to form aquifers.  

For example, look at [this map.](http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/i2781/NorthAmericaTapestry.jpg)  Notice how there's a lot of lakes in the region of Canada that's colored in red (the Canadian Shield) but not as many in the region colored in green (the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin)? 

Of course, the other big factor is the glaciers you mentioned.  Continental glaciers, or ice sheets like those found in Greenland and Antarctica today, scoured most of Canada (East of the Rockies) flat and stripped away much of the soil that was on top of the Canadian Shield.  Water collected in the numerous large scale groves and indentations in the bedrock by the glaciers after their "retreat", hence there are countless lakes. radius_swartzchild(rs)=3*G*m/c^2
radius_photo_sphere(rp)=2*G*m/c^2

rs=Xrp

3*G*m/c^2=X(2*G*m/c^2)

X=1.5 He probably meant converting the mass to energy and then beaming it out somewhere else Yes, they're called "[Rogue Planets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_planet)". I don't know anything about them you won't find on that wikipedia page though, it's not my field. I thought c being the same in every reference frame was a central point of relativity. Wouldn't it be traveling at c in all reference frames not just it's own? That partially depends on the definition of light beer you are using.  The term "light" can refer to either beers with a lower alcohol content or a lower calorie content, and these two things can apply separately or together.

If the beer is light in terms of lower calories then the alcohol content is probably already the same as a "full" beer.

If the beer has a lower alcohol content then you would need to remove some water relative to the alcohol, but that isn't the easiest thing to do.  The normal method of manipulating water/ethanol ratios is distillation, and in this case you could distill the beer to get a 5% ethanol beer but you would likely lose all the flavorful compounds in the beer as well.

You could potentially use molecular sieves of the correct size that would absorb water over ethanol, though if you wanted to double the alcohol percentage then you would need to remove half the total water.  A water semi-permeable membrane could also do the same thing.  It should be feasible but it would be messy and relatively expensive.  Additionally, the flavor of the beer is going to be drastically changed if you double the concentration of every component.

The easiest method would be to simply increase the alcohol content directly, such as by adding 95% ethanol (often called everclear in the US) or a high alcohol tasteless spirit like high proof vodka.  If you wanted to increase the alcohol content of 300 mL of a 2% light beer to 5% you would just need to add 10 mL of 95% ethanol. Thanks for the detailed answer! Did the glacial retreat have an effect on the topography of the United States as well? A spaceship is in very deep space far from any massive body, it sends out a bright flash of light and we examine the front of light moving away from the craft at 1 second: it is a large sphere.  Since nothing can travel faster than light, not even information, the sphere can be said to contain all possible futures for the craft.

If the thought experiment is conducted in the vicinity of a large very massive body the sphere is no longer a perfect sphere, it is pear shaped with the large end bulging toward the center of mass.  The craft has the majority of its possible futures in the vicinity of the center of mass.

If this is done just inside of the event horizon of a black hole what was, in the first example a sphere, and in the second a pear shape is now so profoundly distorted that no light escapes the hole. There are no possible futures for the craft other than in that hole. Assuming your head is aligned exactly along the plane of the photon sphere, you'd only see a portion of the back of your head. The side that's inside the photon sphere would appear as blackness and the side outside of the photon sphere would appear distorted by the varying gravitational force exerted on the photons as they reflect at different angles from different parts of your head. The eye that's inside would not be able to observe any photons while the other eye would observe some distorted image of the portion of your head that is on the outside of the sphere. 
 I'm not sure what exactly you mean by "what was said", but I assure you there is evidence for how and where visual information is processed. What I was describing wouldn't be basic textbook material if there was no evidence. Here's a little I was able to quickly find.  The thriving field of visual neuroscience pretty much started with the seminal studies of Hubel and Wiesel already in the 1950's (see for example http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2718241/ ). The hypothesis of parallel streams (the what and where pathways) is supported by the studies of Ungerleider and Mishkin as well as Milner and Goodale among others (see for example http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-streams_hypothesis although the references cited there are not freely available). The modularity of the visual cortex (i.e., certain cortical areas process information about specific visual qualities) also is supported by a wealth of evidence (see for example http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_modularity although the same caveat applies as above). 

The storage of visual information (memory) is an altogether different (and arguably even more complicated) issue, but has also been very extensively studied.

Of course, as you can see from the Wikipedia articles, there are always many competing hypotheses, conflicting lines of evidence, and alternative interpretations of evidence. So as in all science and especially in neuroscience, there is no "final truth" or a complete picture of how and where things are processed; only variable amounts of agreement. What I was describing seems to be generally accepted as being the most likely way visual processing is organized. Redshift is related to the speed. Because the gravity well is so deep, the actual space is warped immensely. Getting away from the singularity costs most of it's energy hence the redshift. 

Source: IANAS The gravitational force is F=GmM/r^2 and is felt by both in the same way. The real difference is from the acceleration. The big body, from the second law has MA = GmM/r^2 -&gt; A = Gm/r^2 which is small because m is small. The same rule goes the other way. radius_swartzchild(rs)=3*G*m/c^2

radius_photo_sphere(rp)=2*G*m/c^2

rs=Xrp

3*G*m/c\^2=X(2*G*m/c\^2)

3/2(G*m/c\^2 * c\^2/G*m)=X

X=3/2(1)

X=1.5 Gravity is basically the warping of space-time. Think the gravity experiment with the sheet of stretched rubber. When you remove the sun, space-time wouldn't take 8 minutes to bounce back and reach us, it would all happen at once... Or rather the speed of light. 

Actually, I would expect a ripple effect as well.

 does that mean that there is a firewall there? Can someone explain the firewall thing? [The Naked Scientists did a pretty good explanation of the phenomena here.](http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/questions/question/3465/) I won't profess to be an expert in this area, but I think they cover it in basic detail.

What's interesting is that the two phenomena you're describing are not related except in the stars. Bashing your head can cause malfunctioning in the part of your brain that interprets visual signals through trauma, while a rush of blood might be depriving your eyeballs of oxygen by sending blood carrying oxygen elsewhere. Both result in stars, but one affects the brain, the other affects the eyes.

It's a neat question, and maybe someone can expand on it. The Naked scientists did have someone with an advanced degree answer it, though. The gravity would crush us, and the physics as we know it would not work. The definition of a law is that it can't be violated. If it can, then it isn't a law, and we need to reconsider. It depends if it moves, but any object not moving at all gets pulled down by gravity, so it gains speed. Sort of;  what's magical about an event horizon is that it's diameter is larger than the physical size of the massive object; in theory you could have a massive object who could have an event horizon, but that boundary is below the surface of the object, just like there's a speed at which you could orbit the center of the earth at a distance of 2,000 miles when the radius of the earth is 4000 miles.  It's hard to do when you're colliding with the object itself. Science has failed you. I'm sorry. This makes a lot of sense, thank you. Sounds like the [Twin Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox).  The solution is the person who accelerated breaks the symmetry.


 Another interesting piece on the moon landing hoax is to watch the Mythbusters episode on the subject.  They tested what they could manufacture (thus fake) and what they couldn't.  They found a key thing they could not fake, nor was it obvious: how astronauts walked in the videos.
http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/moon-hoax/ If you passed through the Photon sphere, would you see anything? the event horizon is exactly that, light outside it can escape, light inside it can't Yea, but the moon predates flash photography by about 4.5 billion years! Checkmate atheists.  This thread has been linked to from elsewhere on reddit.

 Ah that makes sense, thanks.  Yes. You can think of it as being akin to the surface of another more conventional object. Anything inside the event horizon is part of the black hole. As for your second question. If I'm not mistaken heat can only flow from an area of more heat, to an area of less heat. This means, that your air conditioner would actually receive positive work (i.e. heat), not give it out. Such objects to exists in the Universe, where phenomena like gas expansion cooling takes place. Yes, it's a mathematical curiosity. No photon would be in a stable orbit for long. Thanks for the answer. That was what I thought that if it rotated faster the temperature would be way lower but I guess its not that simple It can't, which is why black holes form from stars, and not planets or asteroids. To elaborate on what /u/Sly_Si said; a singularity with the mass of the Earth would have an event horizon with a radius of 9mm. The unlikelihood of an Earth-mass black hole forming is another matter. TIL, thanks!
 At the photon sphere, something can maintain a stable orbit if it's revolving at the speed of light. Inside an object could only maintain a stable orbit by revolving faster than light. Things can still escape inside this radius, but only if such a large enough component is devoted to outward acceleration that a stable orbit becomes impossible at subluminal velocities. To expand on /u/chrisbaird's comment: as thought experiments go, we can only use physics to predict what will happen in situations where physical laws hold. If the laws stop working, then we simply can't predict what will happen.

If you actually try to ask questions like "What if we violated conservation of momentum?" by plugging into a mathematical structure that conserves momentum, you'll encounter a contradictionand that doesn't tell you anything about what will happen. It just tells you that you did something wrong. Damn man you explained that so well that was awesome Yes. Lower orbits take higher speeds, so to go at an orbit just below the photon sphere would require travelling slightly faster than light, which is impossible. Equally, to go in an orbit just outside of the photos sphere requires going slightly slower than light, which can be done by very fast moving objects but not light, since light must always travel at exactly 'c'. No because the orbits of the photons are not stable. Actually  there is evidence that people can learn in their sleep, so i think is reasonable to think that is possible to learn while dreaming. I suggest you to read this http://www.jewishjournal.com/thedashboard/item/neuroscience_study_quit_smoking_in_your_sleep &gt;The photon sphere is exactly 1.5 times the radius of event horizon. But I'm a lawyer, so I couldn't begin to tell you why.

The derivation in your photo sphere link tells you why. You'd need to multipy the schwarzchild radius equation by a factor of 3/2 if you set the two equations equal to each other.

 If you took the Earth and smashed it to half the size, the gravity *at the surface* would increase because the surface is now much closer to the center of mass of the Earth.  In fact, it is much closer to nearly all of the mass of the Earth.  Though the gravitational potential at the moon (or any particular distance from the center of the Earth which was not originally contained within Earth) would remain essentially unchanged.  If you continued smashing Earth smaller and smaller, you'd end up with a black hole with enormous gravitational potential *at the surface* because there is so much mass concentrated so near that surface. Let's use traffic as an example of why we can't "do everything we possibly can" to save human lives:

Studies find that if cars were prohibited from ever going faster than 13 miles per hour, there would be virtually 0 car accident deaths every year. Are you willing to never, under any circumstances, drive above 13 miles per hour, and to have that absolute speed limit enforced globally? If not, then you are essentially saying that every single mile per hour you add to that speed limit is worth thousands of human lives each for the sake of increased efficiency.

It's the same thing with engineering anything related to people: absolute, 100% safety is either impractical or downright impossible, which means, purely for the sake of statistics, a price needs to be placed on a human life when designing something for safety.

It sounds dark, but without it, nothing would ever get done. I think about this stuff a lot too, I think one day I'm going to try DMT to truly explore these ideas The question is hypothetical,  of course matter can't just dissappear If it's displaced then it's not orbiting, it's just travelling through space the same as any other light.  Sure, it's a pretty broad topic but here's one article on the [glacial history of Connecticut](http://www.trincoll.edu/~cgeiss/tr/tr1/tr1_p6.pdf).  Most of the states along or reasonably close to the Canadian border owe much of their present topography to the effects of the last ice age.  its the same concept. The cold liquid will keep the gas cool while the warm liquid will keep the solid warm.

If you put a really cold solid in a warm liquid, they will reach an equilibrium temperature. Equilibrium temperature might not be a correct term, but there will be temperature that the system will eventually reach.  What happens when an object approaches the photon sphere? My description might make it seem like an orb of light, but it really isn't. It's just a region where this *could* happen. If something approaches the photon sphere it'll just keep going. oh, squiggly line. Thanks for the link, I'll check it out! Great answer thank you! &gt;online gaming

Funny you should mention this. It's sort of a meme that nobody likes Australians who play on American servers, and vice versa, because the ridiculous latency can give players an advantage. I've seen high-latency players pop in to a room and kill someone, and pop out a moment later, with no opportunity to react. The photon sphere is just where there is enough gravity to trap photons without pulling them in. Just beyond the photon sphere, the photons would shoot back into space. Just inside and they're trapped in the black hole. If I understand your question, then the photon ring is the closest or smallest circular orbit possible within the confines of the speed of light. In other words. The photon ring is the closest something traveling at the speed of light could get to the black hole and form a stable orbit. A mile further out and the orbit would only be temporary and the object would eventually escape (even if it took a millennia). So gravity is fading, just that is the point of no return for orbit. Just like the event horizon is the point of no return for everything else.  I understand that if you could crumble the mass down enough it would form a black hole, but would it really be possible to happen in the real universe? That's what I thought.  I was under the impression it'd take much more mass to start that reaction.   You would get a crappy signal. As the distance between the station and the train increases, it would take more time for the signals from the train to reach the station (or broadcast tower) which would a varying signal.

If the TV crew inside the train were taping a clock, it would run at a slower rate than a clock that a person, who is watching the tv, is looking at. 

Observers moving will always experience time passing slower relative to a stationary, or slower moving, observer. 

 Yeah basically it's never going to happen without an external source of energy, such as in a particle accelerator. More precisely, the person accelerating sufficiently to return them to the starting point breaks the symmetry. Well, there's also the reflectors installed on the Moon.

And recently, photographs of the landing sight showing trails left by the moon buggy, the astronauts and their equipment. Space itself warps from mass. A black hole is named as such because space warps so much it is basically a hole. Once you cross the event horizon, every direction points towards the center. Any accelerations accelerates you towards the center, as you have no other direction to choose from.

Kinda hard to wrap your head around. The consequences of warped space are counterintuitive. But if such a black hole were to form, would it be stable? I imagine trying to form an Earth-mass black hole is like trying to compress a beach ball; you can compress it a bit, but the pressure from inside the ball will eventually surpass the pressure you compress it with, and it starts to expand. Is it a faulty analogy? (I think it probably is.) Additionaly, can black holes of any size form? Sure. It'd be like the earth and the moon, except for the same size instead of different sizes. What if you were connected to something that was far beyond the event horizon? could it pull you away if it had enough energy? So the term "Butter face" means nothing to them? Fascinating. &gt; Be glad it won't since such a thing would probably kill all life on earth.

If we are sufficiently unlucky the entire planet will get evaporated. Though there are no stars anywhere close enough that can do that, as far as I know. Well, I won't say it's impossible to take a planet and crush it into a black hole, it sure is damn tricky.  We have not yet, to my knowledge, managed to create even any microscopic black holes in the LHC with extremely high energy collisions with very tiny masses.  Smashing a planet would require a pretty absurd amount of energy.  The most likely way to get a black hole is pretty definitely to put a bunch of matter all in one place so that its own gravity does the crushing, as happens when the core of a sufficiently massive star collapses. If it has an event horizon then no matter can escape, it will be stable. As with all black holes, it will eventually completely evaporate and disappear from Hawking radiation, in 5.7*10^50 years as /u/Sly_Si said. Not for very long! XD I can't answer your question itself, but I can point out that the easiest method for detecting extra solar planets is by observing a given star's position to see if it is orbiting the center of mass of a star-planet system. This effect is much easier to detect for massive planets which are close to their stars. So our selection of exoplanets is biased by this fact. Systems like this may very likely be much more rare in the universe than in our observations. I think only recently are our methods of detecting exoplanets reaching the point where we're capable of discovering lots of planets that aren't "hot Jupiters". But these systems do still exist and I think their mechanics are very much an open area of research.  &gt; they'll agree about how much relative time has passed.

They won't.

The objective times experienced by each will be different. 

If each of the two people had high precision atomic clock, the two clocks would differ by some amount we can detect. [Here](http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/videos/PR_E12_proper_nosat_3fps.gif) is an image from New Horizons, en route to the area now. Charon has a mass of ~12% that of Pluto's and they are separated by less than 20,000 km (for reference, Earth's radius is 6,371 km and Pluto's is 1,161 km). Thank you for the link i will check it out . No significance at all, only the length matters. It only matters if there's another arrow to combine it with.  Which is incredible. You can do this on Earth, point a light up and measure the wavelength at both the top and bottom of say a building and it loses some energy.  That's why I said "relative", and not "subjective". They'll agree on how much time has passed for themselves and for the other. Also, remember this body temperature only refers to your *core* temperature - your skin and extremities will be varying amounts cooler.

*(PS just for people that use non-disgusting units, we're talking 37 degrees C.) Nope.  Even if all the conductive pathways in the processor were superconducting, then there would still be energy loss in all of the semiconductors.  Every one of the billion transistors in the processor would convert a little bit of electricity to heat as it switched.  On top of that, you encounter a lot of parasitic effects - unexpected resistances, capacitances, inductances, etc., which can negatively affect things.  
  
Is it possible to run a CPU that doesn't heat up above room temperature due to really good thermal control?  Sure, but you'd ultimately need somewhere else to dump the heat (e.g., liquid nitrogen cooling). Aaahhhhh ha haaaa. You seem to be mistaking spacetime for some kind of basic three dimensional space. 

Spacetime does not give a flying fuck about our innate understanding of reality. 

In order to understand any potential answers to your perfectly reasonable question, you will first have to become Stephen Hawking. Continuing on OP's question, can a planet orbit or some other object outside the photon sphere? If physics doesn't work normally inside of a black hole, is there any potential that an object could be inside this radius orbiting the black hole and appearing to move at the speed of light to observers but violating the prohibition inside that radius? Neutron stars are created when gravitational force overcomes nuclear force and fuses protons and electrons so maybe that's what you're thinking of. You could theoretically create a black hole out of any amount of mass but not by the same process as stellar black holes. 

Remember how they were saying the LHC could create tiny black holes?  I'll have to check those videos out!

I think I overstated how certain we are that the universe is infinite and flat - I recalled reading about the [WMAP analysis](http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html), which has determined that our universe is within 0.4% of spatial flatness. But I'm no expert, and in re-reading the [corresponding wikipedia article](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe), I realize now that spatial flatness doesn't mean our universe couldn't be e.g. a torus... Interesting side note: anomalies due to errors in silicon try to be corrected in the metal layer first ie. the wiring between transitors or functional blocks. This is done to avoid creating new dyes which is expensive relative to changing the metal layer. From what I understand, that's not possible. The difference in gravitational forces between what's inside the event horizon and what's outside the event horizon are so drastically different, it would get pulled apart no matter what it was Just a thought... but for something to have enough energy to pull you out of a black hole it would require the same or more energy as said black hole. So if you had a hypothetical rope that was strong enough to pull what you dropped in out, you would simply be dragging the two black holes together until they merged.  OK. 

The phrasing was not clear to me. It may not be clear to others. Would it be possible that a photon emitted by infalling matter could be travelling exactly tangentially to the event horizon and exactly at the right distance and be frozen in place forever? (if the black hole had constant mass)  Is it possible that we just haven't seen light travel far enough to slow down? Everything must slow down when forces are applied and even in space acting against your speed Yes, it was the accretion disk lensed around the black hole.  Probably a flash of light on all sides just as you cross the horizon.  Thanks for the response! Interesting point, I'll definitely keep an eye out for future research in that area. For clarification;
When you say Earth-sized, are you meaning of equal mass of earth, or the same radius of earth?

You started with Earth-sized, but then said the same mass of a space shuttle on a launchpad.
It's hard to compare size and mass, especially when talking black holes.. He also has no knowledge of their existence to even be discussing it. He also has no knowledge of their existence to even be discussing it. You're right, but I was answering in the context of OP's question.  Can you motivate that differently? I understand what you mean, but I have no idea why that would happen. Why wouldn't you be traveling at 60mph? Or 20mph but on a different path? Well, I am not a professional in this area, but if a human baby grew up in a world with only crawlers, it would only crawl. It is a learned behaviour. It may invent walking, but it is not a genetic trait.  Also I would say that light can slow down. If black holes can suck in light, then if you had a gravitational force pulling on the light with equal force in the opposite  direction, the light should stop, however long before being sucked in. Sorry, you're right. It's always the simplest things that slip my mind.  If it could, it would probably be a poor place to live. &gt; The gravity would crush us

We'd be falling "with" it... Does it matter that you're "close" to something super-massive, if you're going with the flow. Skydivers don't experience much gravity, they "feel" weightless. Does this mean that if you point a light downwards, it will get blueshifted? Thank you for your submission!

Possibly extraordinary conditions, but most likely not.  Just wanted to make sure that was the way I understood it. I asked the same thing up higher. My thought is that a photon on the event horizon travelling in a direction exactly perpendicular to the event horizon would remain in place forever (assuming the black hole never changes in mass and no other disturbances)  No. The object's mass always remains the same. You might be referring to relativistic mass, which is an outdated concept.  Of course! Far as my knowledge goes it doesn't seem impossible. Now if only companies wouldn't always make end-users local Admin's on their workstations... Dangerous shit. See the [physics FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/physics):

[If light has no mass, how does gravity affect it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1heqk0/if_light_has_no_mass_then_how_is_it_affected_by/)

Gravity doesn't suck in light by accelerating it or changing its speed. It affects the trajectory of light by bending the space it travels in. The local speed of light is constant at c. Nothing we have observed suggests the speed of light changes. In fact, modern relativity _relies_ on the fact that the speed of light is constant in all local reference frames. I think that's the idea That's exactly what it was. It was based on simulation data from Kip Thorne's group. What about elliptical orbits? Are there any mathematical constructions that allow a photon to be in an elliptical orbit around a black hole?  This is actually a really good question. I did a bit of reading and it seems that there isn't a perfect answer out there as to why babies who are "expert crawlers" (ie they can get around just fine crawling) would choose to make the transition to an initially less stable mode of getting around.

[This paper](http://www.psych.nyu.edu/adolph/publications/Adolph%20EtAl%20HowDoYouLearnToWalk.pdf) seems to suggest that babies who walk get around more than babies who crawl. Again, this is speculation but it seems to make sense that babies would naturally transition to the most efficient way of getting around (walking), even if that means being a little unstable at first. And I suspect (although again this is speculation) that this happens by instinct rather than by learned social behaviour.

If a baby was actively prevented from walking then it might be different. But I would imagine that if left alone, it would probably develop the skill by itself, even if it never saw anyone else doing it, (although it might revert to crawling at some stage to "fit in" with or mimic the people around it)

But again, this is just part speculation - I don't think there's a definitive answer out there for this (at least not one that I could find!). I'd be interested in what other people thought. A 'planet' is more definition then law. There is no upper limit on how big a black hole can get, but there are limitations on the rate at which mass can flow into it. In order to get mass into a black hole, you have to bleed off a lot of its energy (otherwise it will just orbit), and the only effective way to do this in most circumstances is to emit radiation. However, this radiation then exerts a pressure against other infalling material, thereby slowing down the rate of accretion. This sets up a balance known as the [Eddington Limit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington_luminosity). This is not a hard limit; it can be exceeded by a factor of a few, but it does give you a ballpark on the maximum rate of accretion. AGN accretion rates are commonly on the order of solar masses per year. Thank you for your submission!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* Ops mom is too large and dense for a black hole Something always being around does not mean it's safe. As for fish and vaccines, that is an incredibly low dose. It's poisonous in large doses. correct me if I'm wrong but that's assuming there is no gravity or pull of any kind right? in which case would you not continue through and out of the other side and not stop until you reached head on gravity? It's through Proprioception. The parietal cortex can give you the relative position of your own body parts without the help of any other sense.  the one thing i actually want to know the answer to! I haven't heard of that before. Why is Earth's gravity so inconsistent? This is one of many hypotheses trying to explain dark energy. In my cosmology course, this idea has been brought up, but there is no evidence to support it (yet). If I had to put my money on a hypothesis for dark energy's source, I would probably choose the antigravity one. You're keen to notice that electromagnetism and gravity have very similar mathematical relations, it's the reason I wouldn't be surprised if antigravity exists in the form of dark energy That's bullshit. You ain't no physics person. You just a bitch Yes, in fact they are more common than stars! It's a lot easier to accumulate the mass required to create a planet than a star. Rogue planets are very plentiful in our universe, I've heard estimates of 2x as many rogue planets than stars in the Milky Way.  I believe that General Relativity predicts that you would observe temporal dilation as a result of massive the gravitational gradient within a black hole. We do not observe such dilation, thus we are not inside a black hole. This is the same effect that has to be taken into account for accurate GPS timings. http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html Seems like they would be a bit on the chilly side... No. An elliptical orbit requires the speed to vary, which cannot happen with light. In some ways it does. If you look up at the sky during the day you can point to where the sun currently sits in the sky and that tells you where the sun was 8.3 minutes ago, and also where the planet was accelerating towards 8.3 minutes ago. The Earth accelerates towards the point 8.3 minutes (20 arc points i believe?) ahead of the Sun's current position. In 8.3 minutes the point at which the planet was accelerating towards will become the new position of the sun in the sky as the light reaches us. The relationship between gravity (the point we are falling towards) and light (the photons that reach us) are therefor directly related and the same.  By this question, do you mean everything we know of, us, the solar system and the rest of the known universe is within the event horizon of a giant black hole?  nothing with mass can exceed the speed of light but tachyons have no mass so theoretically they could. We will hopefully find out this year if if that's possible via that tritium experiment who's name I can't recall It makes sense that there would be plenty of 'independent' gravitationally collapsing molecular clouds that would not have the requisite mass to achieve stellar fusion, but could achieve anything from a brown dwarf to a Jupiter or possibly even a rocky terrestrial planet that roams 'free'.  Though I would also assume that many of these could be captured by large passing stars.
 Still in need of an answer ?
Take a look at the Kandel or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system

Btw, not sure if I'm understanding you correctly but your senses are not a construct of your brain in the metaphysical sense, most of them are hardwired circuits and quite real. Pain projections are actually one of the fastest feedback loops in our spinal cord. I'm a physics student, I hope I will know why eventually! what if rogue object of equal size or even bigger collides directly with the black hole? The idea essentially comes from Dirac's equation. Dirac was trying to figure out a way to describe *relativistic* particles in quantum mechanics. Up until then the equations were only known for *non-relativistic* particles. After some clever manipulations, Dirac came up with an equation that we now know as the [Dirac equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation).

The point is that one then wants to solve that equation, and the solutions represent the different states of the theory. Some of those states corresponded to the system having just the right kind of energy and momentum to describe relativistic particles - so we identity these states as *particles*. But that was only half of the solutions. The other half of the solutions had the same momentum, but *negative* the energy. This is really weird in quantum mechanics, where you want there to be a "ground state", or state of lowest energy. In Dirac's theory, however, it seemed like the energy of the system could be arbitrarily big and negative, which means there is no lowest energy state. This is a disaster, because once you allow the electrons to interact with the electromagnetic field, for example, the possibility arises that electrons can radiate away energy indefinitely, thus lowering their energy, and keep doing this forever without end.

So how did Dirac solve this problem? It's brilliant actually. He invoked the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that no two fermions (the kind of particles which the Dirac equation describes) can occupy the same state at the same time. Dirac then postulated that all of these negative energy states are actually *already occupied* by a [giant sea of electrons that permeates all space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_sea). Then a positive energy electron couldn't lower it's energy, because in doing so it would have to occupy one of the negative energy states, and these states are already occupied - there's no more room for new electrons with negative energy!

But wouldn't we notice a gigantic sea of electrons all around us? The reason we would never detect these electrons is essentially because with negative charge *everywhere*, it's the same as negative charge being *nowhere*. Maybe that's not convincing, but mathematically it actually checks out (using Maxwell's equations, which were well established by then).

However if one of the negative energy electrons managed to be excited into a positive energy, then there would be a "hole" in the sea of electrons. This hole would appear to have positive charge, and the same mass as the electron. So we would detect this hole as a new particle with charge opposite the electron and the same mass. This is the positron, and it was eventually discovered. This was a major triumph for Dirac, and the discovery of "anti-particles".

That is essentially the folk history version of it. Today we understand anti-particles somewhat differently, but the essential story is the above. Today we don't think of the world in terms of the Dirac sea. Rather we just say that these "negative energy electrons" are, in fact, positive energy states of a different particle - the anti-particle, i.e. the positron. Something else that has been around for a long time is uranium. Is that therefore not dangerous? Such an argument is necessarily flawed since it's based on the assumption that evolution should and have introduced perfect protection against  all possible toxins we sometimes are exposed to. This may be extremely complex, costly or just unwarranted.

To answer the question, no it isn't. Mercury has a nasty ability to bind covalently to sulfide groups present in proteins. These bindings affect the folding patterns, which in turn almost definitely will affect the functions of those proteins negatively. When bound, mercury will most often not let go and new protein is needed to restore function. In that case, why is a black hole entirely black? There's the accretion disk and quasars and the like, but besides those, if even a tiny fraction of the photons that entered an orbit around a black hole were thrown out again, that would still leave quite a bit of visible light that would ultimately reach us, right? Don't the various photo-receptors used by space agencies read effectively zero on black holes? Wouldn't that imply all the orbiting photons are swallowed? Oh right that makes sense. Oh dear looks like I've mixed up kinetic energy and speed again. Does the existence of an ergosphere allow pseudo stable orbits of masses/photons though, seeing as it will accelerate/blueshift them?  ok, my bad, thanks for clearing that up That reads like a textbook, solid work. Possibly, but space is so large and gravity falls off so much that it's unlikely to be perturbed by another star unless it's a very dense birthing region of space. Also creating a stable orbit around a foreign star would be difficult and would likely result in an extremely elliptical orbit. In fact it's entirely possible the sun has planets many times as far as Pluto but we may never notice them due to distance, how elliptical their orbits may be, and they could be too small.  [Relevant video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN-FfJKgis8) isn't this dependent upon the wavelength/energy of the photon though? How can it be so well defined? Firstly, just because something has always been around, does not make it safe. 

Secondly, you need to differentiate Mercury the element from mercury-containing compounds. Having an atom of a certain element in a compound does not mean that that compound will have properties of the element. A trivial example is Sodium  and Chlorine gas vs. Sodium Chloride. Sodium is very reactive and would cause burns if you ate some, and chlorine is a toxic gas, but when the atoms of these two elements are bound in a crystal structure, or their ions are dissolved in water, they are fairly harmless (table salt).

Lastly, you must consider dosage. Almost anything (well just about anything I can think of, including water) is toxic when you have too much of it. So the question isn't if Mercury is bad for you, but *how much* Mercury is bad for you, and *how much* Mercury are you in contact with depending on your environment and diet choices. Billions have 9 zeroes, at least here and there - and some black holes are [really heavy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_massive_black_holes), like 40,000,000,000 solar masses.
 Healthy bones actually have a bit of flexibility. When bones are too rigid, they become brittle and more prone to breaking.

If you wanted to deform healthy adult bone, you'd have to do something pretty extreme, like breaking it and resetting it (for example, in foot binding). It would take a lot more than normal sleeping patterns to flatten the skull of a healthy adult.

The pressure of your own weight wouldn't be enough to flatten the bone, even doing it night after night. And most people sleep on a soft surface with pillows, which would further cushion the pressure. Not to mention, people move about when they sleep, they're not lying rigidly in one place and keeping pressure on the same spot. 

 I have a similar question. If a guy is brought from birth till adolescence without any female contact (not a single word mentioned too about the female of a species existing) and he sees a female, what would he do?  Thanks, that's amazing! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_poisoning#Mechanism

(putting this in case someone thinks I'm sexist for only seeing things from a male point of view)  Earth's mass is not uniformly distributed (or dense). 1) Due to changes in density. All of Earth is not not made of single uniform material (in the case of a Black hole it's uniformly dense) and the surface is not the same distance from the center. So as you move around the surface of the Earth the amount of mass under you at the time and it's distribution changes.

2) Also the Earth spins and the pull on you changes according to where you are on the surface because of counter acting centripetal force. Mass isn't uniformly distributed around our spherical planet like it would be when compressed at the center of a black hole, hence variations in local gravity levels above Earth.

visual phenomena like movement.

How do we know the big bang wasn't the formation of our black hole?  

We can't.  It is kind of like something I read the other day saying there is no way to know we aren't in some computer program, like the matrix.


I'm not an expert, but to the people saying gravity would crush us and other such things, how do we know the universe in which our black hole resides does not have different physical constants?  Maybe gravity is much, much weaker there.  Plus we don't know what happens at the center of a black hole.  The matter and information taken in could spew out into another universe, theoretically. Bare in mind that your phone will charge much more slowly if you sever the data lines, because USB by default is limited to only 100mA of current. Most phones and tablets can charge at 1-2A from a dedicated charger or 500mA from a computer, but they need to communicate with the charger or computer to make sure it's safe first.

Now I think about it, it would be possible to put the circuitry to do this into the cable itself, so the cable would pretend to be a phone to the charger, and pretend to be the charger to the phone. That way they charging could be set up without any communication between the charger and the phone directly. I'm not aware of any products that actually do this though. Black holes aren't actually holes as they are sometimes depicted in pictures or documentaries. They are spherical as it is impossible to have a hole in a three dimensional space. It's actually independent of it. I believe it's because of different composition and thickness of the earth's mantle Fight Club was more or less dead on. If anything the movie came out better than the book. If anything gets sucked into a black hole, where does it go? [ELI5] Just wanted to add a minor tidbit to rouge_oiseau's otherwise excellent answer: there is another additionnal factor.

Most of Canada was glaciated. When the glaciers melted, they left behind layers of poorly sorted sediment all over the place (mostly till and clay). This makes for very poor drainage, and also contributes to forming and maintaining so many lakes.  Genetic testing for identification purposes relies on markers within the nuclear genome, so if, for instance, a three parent offspring is trying to track down its parents through genetic testing, the father and the nuclear mother will be identified as the parents of said offspring.  As far as tracing maternal lineages, that is done using mtDNA, so in terms of maternal lineage the three parent offspring will be traced to the "donor" mother.  While mtDNA plays a larger role than previously thought, we won't see anything out of the ordinary from a three parent child.  While the sequence of mtDNA will be slightly different than what it would ave been without the cytoplasmic transfer, the function of the genes will remain largely the same (with very slight differences, perhaps, depending on how the alleles differ between the donor and receiving mother).   Heh, that's an interesting question. It makes sense, if there is point a and b, if you're inbetween a and b then gravity overcomes light and it cannot escape. If you're past b then light is not overcome and escapes. Some point in there should be the exact equilibrium. However, if that were to happen the light would be moving at a speed of 0, which can't happen. I'd be interested to hear an answer. Does the entire object need to stay out of the event horizon to escape, or just the center of mass and/or bulk of mass?  &gt; No insurance company can recover lives, though, so factors like cost/reliability become meaningless for manned missions.

As much as that is true, insurance companies are happy to put an actual price on human lives just like anything else. They've been doing that ever since their existence. Yet, I'm sure the price on an astronaut when you take into account all the training that goes into them is more than say the insurance of driving a car. So, the math end result may be different from what I initially think.  &gt; redshit 

I would go see a doctor if I was mister Doppler.  &gt; No insurance company can recover lives, though, so factors like cost/reliability become meaningless for manned missions.

Given that I can insure my car against several deaths, as well as all manner of other issues, for $100/month, I highly doubt that insuarance companies value human lives higher than a $300 million satellite.  what if rogue object of equal size or even bigger collides directly with the black hole? some of it would be absorbed and most of it would bounce off? Correct me if I am wrong but dosent time slow so much that nothing actually get past the event horizon?  If it were aimed exactly perfectly at the black hole then the whole thing would fall right in. In practice, this never happens. *Someone* has recently watched Interstellar .... The speed of light is fixed absolutely. A real layman explanation of the reason that light is slower in a medium is that light hits particles along the way, bounces backwards then hits another and bounces to it's original trajectory. It always moves at the same speed, but in certain mediums it ends up traveling a further total distance because of these bounces, thus taking longer. Technically, every GRB ever detected has reached earth, just not with enough intensity to do any damage.  That's really well put. Could the eye see higher resolutions if a camera where implanted to feed into the optic nerve or visual cortex (not asking if  this is possible with today's technology, just if it is possible at all)?

&gt; Superficial BCC is characterized by a proliferation of atypical basaloid cells that form an axis parallel to the epidermal surface and demonstrate slit-like retraction of the palisaded basal cells from the subjacent stroma. Inertia -- the liquid wants to stay where it is.

A glass is a rigid body, a fluid is not. When you rotate a glass containing liquid, what would make the liquid turn with the glass? The only force it can impose on the liquid is by friction of the glass on the boundary with the liquid. For a fluid like water in a glass, the viscosity is low enough that it nearly slips along the moving glass edge. If you have an extremely viscous liquid, like honey, or you can try this with an unmixed can of paint, the liquid will rotate with the container. Yes you can still develop a tolerance to acetaminophen or ibuprofen, they will still operate through their mechanism of action but the effects will diminish through repeated dosing just like all substances. Interesting thought. I read through this article on calculating hash colision probability. http://preshing.com/20110504/hash-collision-probabilities/

It looks like with current computing power, hash collision isnt an issue unless youre using 32/64/160-bit hashes. 

If you use the function k^2 /2N for 256-bit hashes, and for k lets say we have the hashing power of the entire bitcoin network, at it's peak, for one year. N=1.158x10^77 k=1.129x10^23 

1.129x10^46  
___________  
2.316x10^77

is equal to 4.875x10^-32

0.00000000000000000000000000000005% chance of hash collision for 256-bit hashes given a fairly large sample size. /r/nocontext They worked out the lifetime for two separate black hole masses. One earth mass and one space shuttle mass. Mercury is a Heavy metal.

Not good for Biological organisms 

The atoms of Mercury interfere with the operation of brain cells.

Mad as a Hatter, They used Mercury.

One thermometer can make an entire lake dangerous to humans.

Lead is a similar heavy metal. Nasty stuff.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* I think the assumption is that something external squeezes it until the density is great enough that gravity can do the rest of the work. Obviously squeezing something like this is *way* beyond our technological capabilities... When you think of a black hole think of a place that gravity is so strong that all the molecules cores could be touching. There is no space left inside, everything is solid. Short answer: yes.  But be careful not to apply the rule/idea too broadly.  It's something we're only beginning to understand.  Here's a link with a nice easy explanation of the study you're referring to:

http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/nutrition/

And a couple things you may want to read up on broadly are [epigenetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics), specifically multi-generational effects, and [maternal effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_effect). The closer in an orbit is, the faster an object needs to go to maintain its orbit. The orbital speed of Sedna varies greatly due to its extremely eccentric orbit, but at its farthest (937 AU away), it's traveling at an exceptionally pokey speed of less than 400 meters per second.

Well the closer you get to an object, and the higher the mass of that object, the faster you need to orbit to remain stable.

Just above the event horizon, the velocity required to maintain orbit is just under the speed of light. At the event horizon, it is the speed of light. Below the event horizon, it's greater than the speed of light. would you be able to see the orbiting light? Surely not if you couldn't see the source of the light? If there is air in the chute, then it should technically be possible to use arms/hands/legs to push against the air such that you won't hit the side. I wonder if the air friction would cause you to not make it all the way (lost speed). Yes it would be interesting to see how near speed of light object would react in orbits close to 1.5x considering that due to relativistic speeds, their mass would be increasing.  You could have a near 1.5x event horizon orbiting particle that weighs as much as a sun.  Alright... here's one for ya... two black holes, about to collide.  I'm a fraction outside the event horizon of one of them.  Where do I go once the event horizons of them collide and I'm caught in the middle? Thank you so much for your answer. 

I'm always forgetting my moka pot on the stove (my [zombie stove-top espresso pot](http://imgur.com/aQiiwu9) that will not die) and I was concerned that the over boiled coffee would loose its potency. Now I can drink my burnt coffee in peace of mind. Vaccines now only have trace amounts of thimerosal and contain 1 microgram or less of mercury per dose since 1999. That is less mercury than a fish sandwich. Yes, it's called the Schwarzschild radius. Anything less than that 9mm will be unstable and would probably explode quite spectacularly. Once you pass that limit, however, all bets are off. the speed of light was chosen for being an arbitrarily fast speed, and yes, it wouldn't actually be able to move at the speed of light, but it seemed the easier thing to say then very very fast. Can I please get a ELI5 of what escape to infinity means?  That's the histological morphology (wherein terms like basaloid are purely descriptive rather than indicative of pathophysiological origin). Note that the article doesn't contradict what I said:

&gt;BCC is held to derive from basaloid epithelia located in the follicular bulges, in the anagen hair bulbs and the follicular matrix cells, and in specific basaloid cells of the interfollicular epidermis.7, 8, 37, 59 The cells of origin are held to be pluripotent progenitor epithelia in adults or epithelial germ cells in the case of those neoplasms arising in childhood (ie linear basal cell nevi). BCCs manifest a keratin profile similar to that of the lower part of the hair follicle60 and that is therefore distinct from that of the adjacent epidermal basal layer epithelia.60 In particular, and held to reflect their derivation from basaloid epithelia, BCCs express keratins type 5, 661 and 1462 and also alpha 2 and beta 1 integrins63 in a fashion that does not correlate well to tumor subtype. The expression of CD10 supports derivation from the folliculo-sebaceous unit.64 Key to our understanding of the pathogenesis of BCC has been the unraveling of the molecular basis of the nevoid BCC syndrome. Interestingly, the photon itself doesn't think that it's travelling very slowly at all.  &gt; and as a result they do not travel to your eye or telescope.

That is suuuper fascinating.  While cars are certainly a more contemporary example, this question was huge during the industrial revolution. Trains were a huge source of tort common law reform. 

Tort law had to contend with the contemporary notions of strict liability and warranty with the inevitable injuries inherent to normal behavior in a modern industrial society.


The standard answer now is that the cost of the precaution has to be weighed with the cost of the risk. This is called the hand formula and is given by: PL &gt; B

A simplification is to give a human life ~2m USD value and go from there. We could all drive around in tanks, but the loss in productivity from the slower speed and increased gas consumption would exceed the savings in lives.  Different people place different credence on classification systems - as a clinician I'm more concerned with histopathological classification as it is something we can easily qualify and manage. Others (such as yourself) enjoy molecular origins as their favoured classification. I didn't state you wee incorrect, I just provided you with a broader clinical article for a different context. The ergosphere of a rotating black hole drags space around with it, meaning it has two photon spheres around its rotational axis - one in the direction of rotation and one against it. &gt; We experience something as hot, when it gives off more radiation than we do. And we experience something as cold when it gives off less radiation than we do. 

Is that accurate? That would mean that 98.6 degrees (F) would be experienced by me as a "neutral" temperature, since it would be equal to my body heat, but that is not the case. Isn't biology a factor in cold/heat perception, the body wanting to be in a temperature where it can function ideally? (phrasing as questions because I'm not sure about any of this, hopefully someone who knows more can respond) Bees

Queen vs workers. All female and genetically similar, but royal jelly contains chaemical and hormonal triggers which send the queen down a different developmental pathway. There is also the much heavier, and difficult to quantify PR cost of being the group that got a astronaut/cosmonaut killed... They can and they do. Ok. That makes sense. Thank you! Tolerance requires there to be an interaction with the body instead of the thing causing the pain.  Opiates interact with receptors in the body where acetaminophen (one hypothesis, since exact mode of action is unknown) is thought to work by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins (responsible for inflammation and localized pain).  Stopping prostaglandins production is less an interaction that could cause tolerance (since you can only make so much) than binding to receptors (which have many functions). 

I hope that helps, if not maybe somebody else can offer more. Find the arc length, divide it into the number of points you would like ... Also- the gravitational forces would be so strong you'd never even get close to something the size of a planet holding together. Sorry I didn't see this ... DO THIS. If a photon was 1.2 time the swarzchild radius, it would either fall into the black hole or escape, depending on its direction. There is the theory of primordial black holes (PBH), which were formed in the very early dense state of the universe. Theoretically these could have almost any mass, the mass of the earth or of an asteroid (those would be of microscopic scale).

Naturally PBHs were not observed yet, it is hard enough to detect the big ones. We would have to be 'lucky' and get hit by one of those. Two good examples of glacial scarring in the United States are our own Great Lakes and the deep harbors in New England, like in New York City. There are bits of exposed bedrock in Central Park there that show deep grooves where ice (and the rock embedded in it) slid across during recent glaciations. No, but the black hole's gravity pulling space time around does allow for two photon spheres around the axis of rotation I would imagine any double planet, or planet/moon combination, would have difficulty maintaining a stable orbit if they are too close to a star.  As the two bodies orbit their center of gravity, the one closer to the star could have it's orbital path perturbed eventually causing both to lose stability.

Is this why Mercury and Venus don't have moons? Blacks were more like baboons. It would spin really really fast The trick to understanding an "orbit" is to realize that the thing that is in orbit is actually always falling directly towards the (or star or planet or whatever). The same way if you drop something on Earth, it falls towards the Earth.

The difference with an orbit is that it just happens to have enough speed that it _misses_ the thing every time. Imagine if you threw a ball so fast that, before it touched the ground, the Earth had already curved away beneath it. Then it just keeps falling, and falling, and falling towards Earth.

The only reason that the photons (or anything) will move out of orbit is if their perpendicular speed changes--for example hitting other particles, atmosphere, etc. That's fine 1 million 1 trillion it doesn't matter the Roche limit is a ratio equation.  It will increase along with the event horizon, but the event horizon is orders of magnitude smaller then the Roche limit. Meaning the Roche limit for the earth is well outside of any black hole.  We would only feel it if the gradient was really big, but gradient is a measure of change. We could be inside a super massive black hole that is really far away. Because of the distance the gradient would be really small and all objects in out vicinity would experience the same time dilatation, so no experiment would be able to detect it(you can only measure time dilatation by comparing it with a another object whose time isnt dilatated).
Also we would not fell the gravitational pull because we would be in free fall, the same way that astronauts feel no gravity on the ISS.
There would be no change in physics laws because we have always been inside the event horizon so the laws we know are the ones that apply here, maybe outside of the horizon physics laws are completelly different. What is anything, really? Oh yeah, I didn't mean to come across like I was pointing out an error. Just throwing out some extra details that I thought were interesting. That's actually pretty awesome. I didn't know that. You're ripped in two.  The mass of the Milky Way is on the order of 1 trillion times the mass of the Sun.

A black hole of this mass would have a Schwarzschild radius of around 20,000 AU (i.e., 20,000 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun), which is a little but under a third of a lightyear. Why would the black hole 'evaporate'? where does it go and what happens to the mass that the black hole sucked up? also what keeps the black hole from just continuing to grow? i understand that the black hole would stop increasing in size after it sucked up it's galaxy but shouldn't it just stay around until gravity eventually pulls in to another black hole? sorry about the amount of questions but everyone just got me thinking now.  A tachyon would need imaginary mass. Hey this is a question that really builds upon the OP's question:

&amp;nbsp;

How exactly is the escape/orbital velocity calculated?
Because based on my understanding, when working with relativity, an object travelling at the speed of light should have infinite momentum, and therefore, should be able to escape an object with an infinitely strong gravitational field 

&amp;nbsp;

(although I haven't done the exact calculations, and admit there might be a possibility that the energy required for escape approaches infinity faster, as the distance to the blackhole decreases- than the momentum function of speed) The photon sphere and the firewall are not really related. The firewall has to do with radiation originating from just outside the horizon. I was assuming that all the photons were travelling parallel to the field lines, which would make them fall into the black hole, but if they were within a certain angle of the normal then they would be able to escape.  Well, that's just [not true](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_light) The Earth's radius is roughly 4000km. That means for an orbiting body, the closest part of earth is 8000km closer than the furthest part. Since the strength of gravity is inversely proportional to the distance between two objects, squared, the force from the closest part of the Earth is appreciably stronger than from the furthest part.

For estimations of the kinds of things most people would care about, it won't make a big difference, but it definitely has a lot of nuanced effects. The Earth's radius is roughly 4000km.

For estimations of the kinds of things most people would care about, it won't make a big difference, but it definitely has a lot of nuanced effects. Can you elaborate on 2 a little?  Do you simply mean gravity changes(as the centripetal force)? Yes. But in Interstellar the illuminated halo around Gargantua is actually the accretion disk + gravitational lensing. The disk is situated around the black hole like the rings on Saturn, but because of gravitational lensing, the light from the part of the disk obscured by the event horizon is bent around Gargantua to be visible above and below it, giving it the appearance of having a halo. Ooh, yea, it's definitely that. Now I learned something... The impact of mercury exposure on health depends on the chemical form and type of exposure. Elemental mercury isn't readily absorbed though the skin which is why casual exposure to the liquid metal isn't too dangerous. On the other hand, [organic compounds of mercury can be very dangerous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_poisoning#Organic_mercury_compounds) since they can be readily absorbed into the bloodstream. [Dimethlymercury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethylmercury) is very dangerous, and was effectively banned as a reference material for NMR. The most well known recent case of poisoning occurred at Dartmouth in 1996 resulting in the tragic death of Chemistry Professor [Karen Wetterhahn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Wetterhahn). Thanks! though how much of a chance would there be if such a star existed within the minumum "kill zone"? also, would the width of such a GBR be equal to the diameter of a star? ELI5 question but how big is that in terms of our solar system? Thank you for your submission!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* Yes, it is called the Photon Sphere...  r =3GM/c^2 We are not spherical.  Terra is an oblate spheroid.  Kind of pear shaped.  From decades old physics recall. that's not an orbit; that's powered flight if you were perfectly between two identical black holes as they merged *and* you weren't torn apart because they are super massive *and* the symmetry was absolutely perfect *and* you (and everything inside you and the rest of the universe save for 2 black holes) didn't move, you would stay stationary, feel tremendous forces pulling you in half, and then the new singularity would form on you.  I'd like to add an important bit here: those tiny saccades don't really improve the quality of the image on your retina. They're MUCH more important than that. In fact, if you could completely stop your eye from moving, you wouldn't see anything stationary! Without getting into too much detail, this is because the retina is designed to respond only to CHANGES in the light that strikes it, rather than responding to every bit of light that strikes it. So to keep refreshing the image on the retina, the eyes employ tiny eye-movements (called micro-saccades) that create small variations in the retinal image. This way, even when you're looking at stationary objects, their edges won't disappear. Just to add to the other answers... The event horizon is not cosmic line in the sand. If you passed it, you would not know it.  Someone went and saw [Interstellar](http://movietube.cc/watch.php?v=lq85UpnQMZI) Idk tried it on Universe sandbox, just ended up getting flung away I wiggled a pointy object in front of my blind spot in an attempt to mess with my brain and now I'm feeling sick...

I'm not a smart man. Lets say you rewind the universe to a fraction of a second after the big bang when it's the size of a grapefruit.  If you're an outside observer you can't see the grapefruit universe right in front of you, and you never will.  The universe is creating it's own space to expand into, so any outside observer is eternally cutoff from seeing it or determining where the 'center' is.  If you're inside the grapefruit, there's no edge, no center, no boundary to coordinate your position from.  As you move 6 inches in any direction you'll find your self right back where you started without having crossed any areas of extra density, temperature or pressure that might signify a 'center'. any cell can become cancerous. So pretty much everything can become a cancer. My understanding was that Hawking explained that the only thing relevant to a black hole was the relative concentration of the mass.  So, whole star clusters could be inside the e.h. and still be intact as a cluster.  If superceded, then how, please? Do you have a source for that? Obviously you would continue falling toward the black hole, but how would thrust in the opposite direction actually accelerate you further? My understanding is that the the area within the event horizon is defined as the area within which the gravity is strong enough that light cannot escape, but I don't know of a theory stating thrust in any direction counts as thrust in the direction of the singularity. I love ice cream.  You rock dude. First of all, once inside the event horizon of a black hole, there is a finite amount of time until you collide with the singularity. 

Second, inside a blackhole, all light paths converge on the singularity, meaning you can only see light from things that fell in after you. 

Third, the area around the singularity is subject to intense tidal gravitational forces that would rip matter apart.

Nothing we observe conforms to these statements. You wouldn't be able to see stars in the sky, much less the light from your computer screen, if you were inside a black hole. 

you would know, trust me.  What do you mean? You will go all the way through even under the effects of gravity.  Kinda, yes and no. You could think of standing at one of the poles during its daytime as achieving this. The speed needed to keep up with the sun will depend on the tangential speed of the Earth at that latitude; this is about 1036 mph at the equator and, well, 0mph at the pole, though the sun is not _directly_ overhead.

Your best chance at chasing the sun when it is directly overhead is to do so at one of the [tropics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer): those dotted lines on maps that are a little way up and down from the equator. This is the highest point on the Earth at which the sun can be literally directly overhead, which happens during one of the solstices (summer for the Tropic of Cancer, winter for the Tropic of Capricorn). At this latitude, the radius around which you have to travel is not as large as the equator, but you'd still have to go about 952 mph to achieve it. This is about 25% more than the speed of sound (Mach 1.25), so you'd have to be doing it in something supersonic, but the Concorde could easily have done it.

That covers speed, but not range. Concorde's range was around 4500 mi, so not nearly long enough to fly the 23,000 miles or so that it would take to fly around one of the tropics at 60,000 feet. As far as I know, there's no plane that can sustain flight at Mach 1.25 for 24 hours. The [Global Flyer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Atlantic_GlobalFlyer) performed the most recent nonstop circumnavigation of the Earth, but it took almost 3 days to do so.

If you get _off_ of the Earth, you can certainly claim that placing something at the L1, L4, or L5 [Lagrange points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point) would count: your object would, from the ground, appear to move over the surface of the Earth one time per day, keeping the Sun at a constant, direct "overhead" position; however, the closest point (L1) is at 932,000 miles of altitude, so I'm not sure if that qualifies. Still, we do have some satellites [at that position](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_objects_at_Lagrangian_points#L1)

It seems like it would be _possible_ to build something to fly at Mach 1.25 for 24 hours, probably with aerial refueling (which sounds like a nightmare to contemplate doing at supersonic speeds), but if we exclude objects at L1, then _it's never been done_. You can be the first! What books are you finding the example of the Treponema pallidum in? A microbiology textbook? I'm assuming that if there's enough wind resistance to change your orientation, than you would lose speed when you reach terminal velocity which would limit the distance you get to on the other side of the planet tremendously [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_ascPKbCdA) brings up some valid points... they raise the possibility that the Jovian planets did indeed form further away from the star, and at some point migrated toward the star. What we are seeing is the end of their life before they get torn apart by tidal forces.

Its actually quite an interesting podcast on planetary migration in general, particularly in the context of our solar system and the ice giants. But they do touch on the "hot Jupiter" thing. Thank you, I was stuck and this gave me a new path... How far away would the tidal forces be sufficient to pull a planet apart?

Or if you can give some indication of the tidal forces. It seems to me that there is significantly less benefit in loving one and staying with one partner than not loving and branching out and expanding your genetic diversity. Why have we evolved to love our one partner? Before computers were widespread, it was often necessary to preform computations by hand. When doing this, it is often helpful to have a standard form for numbers, and one obvious choice for a standard form would be to have either the numerator or denominator be an integer. The denominator is the better choice here because it is much easier to add two fractions with integer denominators than irrational ones (think something like 1/(7 + 2) vs (7 - 2)/5 - the latter would be much easier to add with something else).

It also helps in trig to have a standard form for numbers, because you often have to identify certain angles in order to preform computations.  It's noteworthy this "cost" put on lives has many sides, one of which is the public perception. That's one reason for the airplane industry being as safe as it is: they know people are irrationally fearful of airplanes (since crashes are reported everywhere), so they go above and beyond to avoid crashes. I was talking strictly about changes in total force on an object as it moves around the surface of Earth. As the Earth is spinning about it's axis the objects on it's poles are spinning but that spin is in an independent plane to the pull of gravity so it doesn't counter act gravity. As you move towards the equator you are spinning about point that is at the intersection of the perpendicular line between your position on the surface to the axis of rotation. This force has a partial component that acts against gravity and hence you counter act gravity more (but gravity is also changing as the shape of Earth itself is almost bulged at the equator due to this very spinning and hence force of gravity is also higher at the equator). When you get to the equator, the force due to spinning is acting completely against gravity to counter act it the most.

[Someone did the math on which effect matters more. Taking into account both of the above effects, the gravitational acceleration is 9.78 m/s2 at the equator and 9.83 m/s2 at the poles, so you weigh about 0.5% more at the poles than at the equator.](http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=310) /r/ALLofTheContexts We can only perceive the higher resolutions at quite short distances. At standard TV viewing distance the point where resolution is not perceivable is surprisingly low.  Does this mean that a black hole's center would be perfectly spherical? Thanks everyone for your answer! It helps a lot! An interesting example of this is who were the "tallest people" 150 years ago - it's wildly different than today's statistics. From what I remember, Western European males were between 5'4"-5'8" on average, Japanese and Chinese were 4'11"-5'6", and the Dakota were 5'8"-6'1". Of those groups, only the Dakota's average height hasn't radically changed. I'll dig for a source and add it in a later edit. Why on earth would something having "always been around" suggest that it is in any way safe?  I am genuinely fascinated by the assertion. No, it would be like trying to run infinitely along the inside of a cylinder We will never know-
 &gt;My understanding is that the the area within the event horizon is defined as the area within which the gravity is strong enough that light cannot escape, but I don't know of a theory stating thrust in any direction counts as thrust in the direction of the singularity.

You're thinking of it in a Newtonian fashion, that's not how stuff works near black holes. It would be better to think of gravity as the distortion of space-time produced by a large mass.

The real situation is that all possible paths that light can take inside the event horizon are warped in towards the singularity. Therefore the forward [light cone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone) of any particle leads to the singularity - moving forward in time means moving towards the singularity. If the object is inside the photos sphere, it cannot travel fast enough to orbit. If it is inside the event horizon, firstly no observer outside the black hole would ever be able to see it. Further, an object cannot actually travel through the event horizon to get into this position, since at the border time dilation is infinite, meaning it can no longer move at all. Only radical empiricists assume nothing, not even light can never escape from a black hole.  A cosmological singularity is also a gravitational singularity and the currently leading cosmology promotes black holes do indeed allow light to escape.  A better question to have asked would have been, How? Awesome, thanks! No. Physics works just fine inside a black hole, it only breaks down at the singularity. Spacetime inside the event horizon is understood very well, except at that point. Gravity is NOT described by the simple equation that Newton came up with and that you included in your post; that equation is an approximation that works reasonably well when dealing with situations like the Earth orbiting the Sun.

The description from general relativity can be summed up as 16 equations which describe the relationship between the geometry of space-time and the energy/matter content of the universe.   Included in the energy/matter content is the pressure.  When one works out the equation, it turns out that pressure (which one might think of as something pushing out) actually contribute to the overall attraction.   Tension on the other hand (which one thinks of as pulling things) turns out to "push" out.  (this is all greatly simplified.)     It's very counterintuitive but, in all situations where we have been able to perform actual measurements, it has been verified. It was a simplified explanation of how having an increased acceleration in another direction might bring you towards the center of the black hole faster

Obviously this is impossible  It is only the simples Coulomb electrostatic equation and Newton's approximation for gravity that have the similar relations.  If one goes beyond those approximations, i.e. using QED for electromagnetic attraction and G.R. for gravitional one, the mathematical relations are completely different.

Hint: you left the best possible answer off your original list... and it is coincidentally the only possible answer for a sentient observer. How did we create a medication like acetaminophen and have little idea how it actually works? My rational mind says that I trust physicists and that this is is true... which I do believe.   but I would be lying if part of me wasn't screaming "bullshit!" every time I read something like this. But why is it exactly the speed of light? Is it always the speed of light? Is it constant between larger denser galaxies and smaller less dense galaxies due to having more objects? 

Furthermore because of that does the speed of light change between galaxies because of this? I understand that c is defined by light in a vacuum but if dark matter exists then wouldn't lights speed be altered by the excess gravity? Do light and gravity effect each other?

I don't see how a smaller solar system with a less dense galaxy that only contains 'earth' and 'the sun' would have the same constant gravity across the system as ours if there are less objects to be effected by it, or is this just the effect of gravity? For a force exactly the speed of light why can't we detect it? 

Can we prove gravity isn't much faster than light but have proportionately smaller 'particles' to make up for it? How do we know gravity is a constant? How can a black hole possibly exist if gravity is the speed of light, considering if it were then it would never actually be able to swallow light and it would only be able to visibly store it? What about different wavelengths of light? Are there different wavelengths of gravity?

Honestly I could ask these questions all day.

Is there a simple answer to all of these questions to do with their properties? Is what I'm asking reasonable? No, it's either a non-dimensional point singularity for a non-rotating black hole or a zero-thickness ring singularity for a rotating black hole. According to most interpretations of general relativity, matter at the centre of a black hole is compressed to zero size and infinite density. What do you mean, "escape to infinity? "

Also, any diagrams on what this means? Just a couple simple circles would be good. "Bi" means "two". "Polar" can refer to opposites or extremes. People with bipolar disorder (and this is somewhat simplified) alternate between both "poles" of mood - depressive episodes and manic episodes. Common-or-garden clinical depression is sometimes referred to as "unipolar depression" to distinguish the two - in that case, people with the condition only experience one ("uni") pole of mood, i.e. depressive episodes.

I'd be happy to elaborate further if that doesn't make sense. How do we know we are not currently being sucked into a black hole? Giving an object/spacecraft enough energy to pull away from the event horizon is like giving a weapon enough power to destroy an indestructible object.

If the weapon could destroy the indestructible object, the object would not be called indestructible in the first place.

If the rocket could pull away from the horizon, the spot it pulled away from would not be called the event horizon. Hawking radiation.  Short version is, normal vacuum has 'virtual particles' showing up all the time, in pairs, annihilating each other, and leaving the universe unchanged.  But if that happens precisely on the event horizon, and one of the particles escapes, then the universe must 'balance the books' by deducting mass/energy from someplace.  In this case, the black hole.  In effect, the black hole is radiating away energy, giving it a temperature of sorts.

It is a _ridiculously_ slow process, involving wholly unreasonable time scales.  The 'temperature' for stellar black holes is a fraction of the cosmic background (3 K), so it's really not even operating on them yet.  And the bigger the black hole, the slower the evaporation.  Estimates are that the last black hole would succumb sometime around year 10^(100).

On the flip side, it accelerates for smaller singularities.  Micro-black holes, with mere planet-level masses that may have formed in the hectic conditions of the Big Bang, would be evaporating right about... now.  IIRC, once they drop down to about 2 tons, the evaporation accelerates exponentially, and the rest goes more or less all at once.  I.e., it becomes a 2 ton total mass-energy conversion bomb (42 gigaton of TNT equivalent yield). By accident, or trial and error.

For example: we have a very poor understanding of a lot of drugs related to mental health (e.g. lithium for bipolar, SSRIs for depression), we just know that they seem to work in some cases.

Another one: Viagra was originally intended to improve cardiovascular health by causing muscles to relax and improve blood flow. Turns out it has side effects. you are misunderstanding. read WyMANderly's response Not an expert, have only read "The Theory of Everything" by S. Hawking. That being said, I think it's the exact point where light either escapes, or gets pulled in. It's an explanation I got from a different source, but it's by far the most "ELI5" explanation I have ever encountered for the concept! Hold the phone here. So you're saying...light can *orbit* something? _ well, ibuprofen is an nsaid, which means it will stop swelling, which will lessen pain. on the other hand, something like hydrocodone is an opiate, which works by antagonizing (activating) the mu opiate receptor in the brain. there are a few effects that taking a drug like that has, one is down regulation. this happens in g protine coupled drug receptors. another reason, is the rest levels of the neurotransmitter will lessen in the brain. The eli5 way to think of this is the drug in question will spike your neurotransmitters to a higher than normal level. your body will react by lowering the ammount of neurotransmitter to try and normalize it. after the drug is metabolized you now have less of the neurotransmitter normally, so taking the same dose will yeild much less of an effect. this also leads to drug after effects (with, normally illicit drugs causing a crash afterwards, which is why people get perscribed drugs that deal with blocking reuptake or metabolization rather than neurotransmitter releasing adgents) 

when it comes to tollerance though, its mainly the downregulation of g protine coupled receptors. the lower levels of neurotransmitter is a very short term thing, normally withing a few half lifes of the drug.

so, you build tolerances to things that effect the mind. things that reduce swelling (nsaids like ibuprofin) effect the body more directly, not the mind (over simplification, as ibuprofin crossed the blood brain barrier, and deals with cox inhabition). The easiest way to describe this is to ask him what he thinks is happening during a new moon. This is when the "dark" side of the moon must be facing towards the Sun, because the non-illuminated side faces towards us. 

If necessary, you can prove to him that the moon does not show much of a different side toward us at different times by noting that you can always see the same craters on its surface. (i.e. the Man in the Moon is always there in the middle of the side we can see.) Yup.  See, matter gains or loses velocity as it changes rises or falls in a gravity well.  Light can't do that, since it's always at the same speed.  What it does do, is gain (blueshift) or lose (redshift) energy.

So if the gravity well is deep enough, such as that of a black hole, then the last thing an infalling observer would see behind them would be the cosmic background radiation blueshifted from microwaves all the way up to the visible spectrum. Does the dark side of the moon get more or less sunlight? I think its more because it doesn't have earths shadow? Which would make it the easier side to colonise. You made statements about how information is stored and processed in a casual manner as if it is pure fact. Unlike most science, neuro-science on the level you are discussing is very complex and all information as to a conclusion should be available. As it is not, the situation lends itself to seem too convoluted for any person to state that the brain creates defined data structures in certain portions of the brain. What you are describing seems to be an attempt overlaying modern digital computing structures to brain processing. This does not seem testable in reality though. Where is there proof that information such as edges / color / etc are stored in certain regions and why is it irrefutable? This proof has not been presented. Due to lack of evidence one may dismiss your claim. I would rather question it. I believe that the wording or understanding (yours) of that statement is flawed. Don't bull shit me, what type of precious metals are in this thing and how will you extract them, if any. PS I don't know jack about comets besides the obvious facts so excvcuse my ignorance. Either that, or what we see in the far distance is beyond the event horizon, which maybe isn't percieved as a barrier as it's just stuff that is further away in spacetime. That the degree of compression is meaningless to perception. I believe that the technical term is "USB vasectomy." &gt; Is that accurate?

Well, no. When i wrote this, i was thiking of something really hot and cold, like a glowing piece of metal and ice for example. You're right, our perception plays a big role in how we experience temperature.  

Your text suggests that you are thiking of something to touch, like surrounding air or an solid object. But keep in mind that the primary heat transfer in that case is not via radiation, but conduction. Even things with the same temperature feel different warm and cold, because the conduct heat with different strength (like air and metal for example). The blackbody radiation from a 37C (98,6F) body wouldn't be experienced as noticably hot.  

Note also, that your skin isn't your body temperature. This temperature is measured inside the body, that's why you put a thermometer as deep as possible in your mouth instead of putting in simply on the skin. If you could open up yourself and put a hand in your body, it would actually be quite hot.  There are plenty of deaths caused by people going under 13 miles an hour. Low as in? It has to be higher than 8K, because you can clearly tell a difference from 1080p to 4K(2160p) to 8K(4320p). Well put. &gt; temporal dilation

We measure it at what we see it as, from our perspective. What's to say we aren't running very slowly compared to other relative perspectives in the distance sky? Tl;dr: We know the strong nuclear force has a mass gap. We currently explain the strong force using a Yang-Mills theory, and have a ton of good evidence (numerical and analytical) that Yang-Mills correctly describes the mass gap. However, there is no rigorous mathematical proof - such a proof would put our theories on better grounding. Also, it is probably the most realistic quantum field theory which has a chance of existing to arbitrarily high energies.

The problem is so important because we model the strong nuclear force by a Yang-Mills theory, which we call quantum chromodynamics (QCD). 

To specify a Yang-Mills theory, one must specify a [simple compact Lie group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_group#Compact_Lie_groups), and one can also have the degrees of freedom (called "gauge fields") interact with other particles. QCD has an SU(3) gauge group which interacts with the quarks. The millennium problem is to prove a "mass gap" which holds for *any* gauge group, but you don't need to consider anything besides the gauge fields (in fact, if you couple to enough fermions, it is predicted that there *isn't* a mass gap).

Now, the "mass gap." The classical gauge fields in classical YM theory are massless - they create particles which travel at the speed of light. In contrast, evidence has shown that the quantum YM theory displays [confinement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement), where you can only have massive bound states of gauge fields, which have mass through their binding energy and E=mc^(2). This is especially important in our own universe, where the interaction of the gauge fields (called gluons in QCD) and quarks prevent any free gluons/quarks from ever being seen on their own in our universe. They always bind into higher-energy states like protons/neutrons/glueballs.

The existence of the mass gap has enough evidence to convince essentially any physicist (the very-related effect of asymptotic freedom got a physics Nobel prize in 2004), but like almost all quantum field theories (QFTs) in 4 spacetime dimensions, there's no rigorous proof. This gets to the other important part in the official statement of the millennium problem:

&gt; Existence includes establishing axiomatic properties at least as strong as those cited in Streater &amp; Wightman (1964), Osterwalder &amp; Schrader (1973) and Osterwalder &amp; Schrader (1975).

There have been rigorous mathematical constructions of QFTs in lower dimensions, but there is good evidence that many QFTs we use to describe our own universe (such as QED or electroweak theory) don't exist in the sense that they are "effective" descriptions of better theories which fail at high enough energies. YM theory is very well-behaved at high energies, so it is hoped that it's our best chance at a consistent QFT to all energies. Why don't you *show* the knowledge you say you have instead of talking about it? That's how it works with things that have mass.  Light doesn't have mass.  It gets to do things differently  The "size" of a black hole is always referring to the radius of its event horizon. He's talking about the nature of the singularity itself at the centre, which is a different thing altogether. Spacetime at the event horizon isn't actually all that weird and we think we understand it pretty well. Things only get really messy once you approach the actual centre. Thank you for the elaboration.  :) It's infinitely improbably that any light hits at PRECISELY 90 at PRECISELY 1.5 r Describe to me an object in this universe that isn't moving. Thanks, that was helpful! They crawl without having to see other people crawl.  They cry without seeing other people cry.  Our bodies have evolved to walk, not crawl.  Kids and babies are experimental, they spend hours everyday just thinking about what their fingers/arms/legs can do.  Babies will walk once they are strong enough to do it, not once they figure it out.   There would be noticeable lensing. Yup think that's about the long and short of it.

I do wonder though if that isn't infinite and that each relative perspective closer and closer to the singularity, even the surface of the singularity itself, still feels spacetime in much the same way we do.

If you're travelling deeper in, then your planet might be big enough to experience a gradient that would be a problem, but if you exist at that gradient, then it's just all relative again.

Where it gets weird is the X-rays being emitted, or so we believe, even if information is retained surely this signals that at some point matter becomes energy. Walking is most certainly instinctive, and would present itself as obvious, even if their entire environment of other humans were pretending that walking never existed. I say pretending because it would be self evident.  People skip and hop and are always experimenting. The social ramifications of everyone crawling and thinking it was normal might cause the person to feel it was strange and even unnecessary and might not develop it to the same level as we do now depending on the strong nature of their personality.  No problem. I had a pretty rough day at work and researching/writing this down really helped me clear my thoughts! Short answer: Not necessarily. 

Longer answer: Boiling occurs when the temperature of a liquid teaches the saturation temperature that corresponds to the local atmospheric pressure. How the saturation temperature varies with pressure will be highly dependent on the characteristics of each individual liquid.  They would be pretty negligible on a planetary scale, even right close to it. 6 That doesn't mean all states have the same energy.

For example, a magnetic dipole which is parallel to the overall magnetic field is in a lower energy than one which is antiparallel to the field ([image](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/magnetic/imgmag/magdip.gif)). You know nothing about it. STFU. I'll defer to the Old Norse Gods on this one. tolerance is usually the result of receptor down regulation. all three of the compounds/compound classes you mention target/bind to synaptic receptors which have negative feedback mechanisms to reduce surface expression. acetaminophen and ibuprofen's main method of action is through inhibition of an enzyme of which there is no observable negative feedback mechanism to increase enzyme production and induce tolerance. doesn't hawking radiation count as light? I am assuming that you mean a person hit by an automobile not in an automobile.  But, I would suspect the statistic is accounting for automobile to automobile collisions... A much larger black hole would eventually radiate down to that size. Thank you for your submission!

Orbitals of atoms mix to form new ones that electrons in the bonds occupy, and electrons are fuckin greedy and take all the space they can. In water, the 3 p orbitals and 1 s orbital mix to form 4 sp3 hybridized orbitals. Those bastard electron pairs in each orbital move as far away as possible from each other, and apparently 109.5 degree bond angles maximize the distance. Free electron pairs that are not in bonds are even more fucking greedy and take up more space, so the H-O-H bond in water is actually a tad bit less than 109.5 degrees from the 2 lone pairs on water. To expand on the other answer, tidal forces are due to differences in gravitational strength. The difference between the gravitational strength on one side of a planet/object/etc falls off approximately* as 1/r^3, where r is the distance between the center of your object and the center of the star/black hole. This gets negligible really fast. The mass has an effect as well, but it's proportional to the first power, so the distance has a much larger one. It's an impossible scenario, which is why it's hard to get a good grip on it. The gravitational forces involved in creating and maintaining a black hole mass would force the soubrette to collapse in on itself long before it ever had an event horizon to worry about. The closest approximation we can use is a spherical plane of black holes with nearly touching event horizons surrounding the hypothetical planetary system. At equilibrium it will operate as described, but I'm not sure such a system could be at equilibrium at all. The same gravitational forces that would collapse a single solid sphere-shell would also be at work on this pseudo-shell, and eventually would result in the same outcome, a single, solid mass at the center of the former sphere.

As that sphere collapses, the ability to move around inside the sphere freely would still remain, but coming in contact with the event horizon(s) of the outer sphere would give you nothing to push off of, so you would just float into the super-dense matter of the sphere and join with it. As a side note, the innermost orbit for massive particles is 3 times the event horizon You are correct in that it's not spherical, but OP's argument stands, or even enenhances.  &gt; No. The innermost orbit is the photon sphere, at 1.5 times the event horizon [...]

Is that only true for Schwarzschild black holes?  According to [Is there life inside black holes?](http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.6140):

&gt; "Bound inside rotating or charged black holes, there are stable periodic planetary orbits, which neither come out nor terminate at the central singularity. Stable periodic orbits inside black holes exist even for photons."

 There actually are physical maps of your body in your cerebral cortex, one for sensory information and one for motor. They're called "homunculi", and they're generally laid out with adjacent parts of the body next to each other on the brain, although not perfectly mirroring the body. [(Sensory homunculus picture here)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus#mediaviewer/File:1421_Sensory_Homunculus.jpg)

These maps were originally worked out by a neurosurgeon named Wilder Penfield, who would electrically stimulate different areas of the brain in awake patients and have them report where they felt the sensation.

In the sensory homunculus, you have more space devoted to more sensitive regions (like the lips and hands) and less space devoted to less sensitive regions (like the trunk). Mice have a similar map in their brains (called the "rodunculus"), except that their whiskers are the most highly represented -- in the mouse somatosensory area, each whisker can be seen individually [picture](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v16/n8/images_article/nn.3454-F8.jpg). And the platypus has a similar map, called the "platypunculus", that devotes a huge amount of area to the beak, its major sensory organ. Thank you for your submission!

No, we don't provide medical advice here. You need to speak to an actual doctor about personal situations like this.  with respect to blackholes, if someone says size, they mean mass because by definition blackholes have no volume (i.e. singularity)  I mean, there is free rotation occurring within molecules if we're talking about sigma bonds, which is formed by two overlapping hybridized atomic orbitals. But when this rotation is observed the bond angles are still fixed in their positions. Atomic orbitals hybridize and overlap, forming a symmetrical angle based on how many bonds the central atom is forming. The angle is formed with the minimum possible electron repulsion. In pi bonding, if you want to get into a little more organic chemistry, there are two parallel P orbitals that form a bond with each other, which make the molecule unable to rotate freely. So sometimes they rotate and sometimes they don't. But when they do rotate, they maintain their angles to combat electron repulsion, they aren't just orbiting freely. s/he wasn't saying earth or a space shuttle could spontaneously form a blackhole--just that if you compress the mass of those objects enough, it could form a blackhole (same mass) Check out our [Biology FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/biology). You will need to define what distance and screen sizes you are talking about. If you are talking computer monitors then you (and most people) probably can, though 8k may be pushing for all but the largest of screens.

If you are talking TVs then probably not. 1080p on a 50" TV at a typical viewing distance of 3-4m is well higher than what people can resolve.

Simple digram of it here;
http://carltonbale.com/1080p-does-matter/

RED talk about this in regards to cinema (much larger screens with a higher viewable angles than most home setups) and the resolvable resolutions even on those screens is quite slow. Keep this is from a company that specialises in ultra high resolution cameras... they have a vested interest in talking up resolutions!

A good talk about this here as well and the complexities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I5Q3UXkGd0

In short.. the eyes are actually quite poor with massive blind spots, spots and inconsistent resolution and very little of the "image" is even in focus. Once you take all of that into consideration the effective resolution is only about 8MP.

The rest comes from are rather advanced image processing and our brain lying about the rest!

However all of that said... there is a few other factors can still means 8K looks better than 4k (and 4k looks better than 2k... though on a monitor most people should be able to see the difference).

Games for example have pixel aliasing problems (errors in the placement/intensity/colour of the pixel). You can use Anti-aliasing but these are all performance optimised and are far from perfect. This means that running at greater resolution can have a much greater effect in reducing aliasing errors.

Also most high res screens are not all that good at colour reproduction (largely because people buy mostly on price) and the higher resolutions can help hide that with dithering and so forth.

However you do have to understand that all those two reason mean is that the source mater is flawed and you are just using increased resolution to hide it. As others have said, the orbit is unstable, and photons wouldn't orbit there for long before being perturbed and flung out of orbit. You wouldn't really find a ton of photons there, it's more a mathematical concept than anything. "Matter is a different matter" nice Are we assuming that the rider stops shifting his weight st some point and is just waiting to see what happens? You can orbit my butthole sucker  With that in mind, is there a lower limit for a black hole to remain stable over time with hawking radiation taken in to account?  Moreso, would a black hole eventually reach a size where 1: it's no longer black ... just really really dense, and/or 2: the mass of Earth? The proton electrochemical gradient is maintained across a membrane, not a cell wall. In the case of mitochondria, it's across the inner membrane and in the case of bacteria it's across the cell membrane. Jizz In My Pants. You may want to re run your experiment pal Current technology doesn't allow us to directly control gravity in any way.

We can simulate reduced gravity by using large pools and employing buoyancy.  We can fly people on special aircraft that briefly (30 seconds at a time) fly in an arc simulated weightlessness.  We can put people in centrifuges simulating higher gravity.  But we can't make a "room" in which gravity can be changed.
 &gt; As an illustrative example, if the earth were magically replaced by a black hole of the exact same mass

interesting fact:  the swartzchild radius would be about the size of a marble in that scenario  about the size of a marble (seriously) I was aware Earth's gravitational field wasn't completely uniform, but I thought the difference in strength was minute.  Is it enough to factor into our equations for artificial satellites? In order for you to perceive light/photons, they have to reach your eye. Photons in orbit are perpetually travelling around the black hole; they never have a chance to do so. Any light you DO see is not in orbit, so no glowing ball of light. It may well have been curved AROUND the black hole, but that is all. Look at something like a highly exaggerated convex lens with a giant black spot in the middle. Speaking from an evolutionary perspective, my guess is that since performing these tasks come with a very high risk of injury (breaking bones, straining/ripping muscles, etc) we have built-in protections that prevent us from doing that.  But, if it comes to a life and death point, our bodies release these protections assuming that you're better injured than dead.
 Wouldn't it really suck if, even with 1: huge number against odds, we still get hit by a rouge planet? Can someone explain why the normal relationship between escape velocity and orbital speed at a given distance from the center of mass is that orbital velocity is less than escape velocity but for a black hole that relationship does not hold?  It wouldn't happen by itself. To be clear, /u/iorgfeflkd doesn't mean an object will drift away freely and not be affected by the gravity. The object would escape because it's trajectory takes it close to the black hole, and then it slingshots away. Imagine an object in this trajectory making perhaps almost half an orbit, then gaining the velocity to escape the gravity well. Plant seeds can be carried on the wind, in the water, and even by animals. These islands aren't as isolated as they seem. They're hard for land animals to reach. Not so much for other forms of life. Going off of a few orbital dynamics classes here (and sorry I'm on mobile so no links):

The Earth is not very round. Google the geoid. The Earth's spin pulls mass out at the equator and creates a slightly heavier "belt" which can mess with orbiting bodies. Additionally, geographic features like mountains can cause smaller similar effects. Also, because the Earth's spin axis precesses (with a period of around 28,000 years, I think?), the orientation of that heavy belt also changes.
Finally, the Earth's density is not constant; deposits of heavy metals and such can create pockets of slightly higher gravity. There are probably more things but those are all I can recall at the moment.

When we say that gravitational forces act on/come from the center of mass of an object, this is usually a very good approximation but is not exactly what happens. If the Earth were perfecty round and of uniform density, a black hole of equivalent mass could replace it and orbiting satellites wouldn't know any better (gravitationally, that is; electromagnetic interactions would be different). The satellites would then follow unchanging orbits in the shapes of perfect conic sections, though if you want to get more in-depth, the Sun, Moon, and other planets would actually perturb them too. With the actual Earth, many more time-changing forces act on satellites to mess up their nice orbits. One way of measuring high temperatures or temperatures that you can't physically touch is measuring it's radiant energy. As things get hotter, they glow more and more. Even things that don't glow visibly still give off electromagnetic radiation in longer wavelengths like infrared. By measuring the frequencies and intensities of radiation given off by an object, a reasonable measurement of temperature can be achieved. Oooh nerdgasm. To some extent we can look at living species to infer what extinct dinosaurs may have sounded like. We can explore traits that wouldn't preserve in the fossil record using [phylogenetic bracketing](http://archosaurmusings.wordpress.com/2009/12/06/the-extant-phylogenetic-bracket/). 

Basically, we look at related animals on [either side of the tree](http://palaeos.com/phylogeny/images/epb.gif) from the organism we're interested in, and if those animals possess a trait then it was probably present in the common ancestor of all those animals, so the organism we're interested in most likely does as well. This works pretty well for extinct dinosaurs, because [birds are living theropod dinosaurs](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1lb9q3/are_birds_taxonomically_considered_dinosaurs_or/cby8604/) and crocs are [archosaurs](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/archosauria.html) that fall outside of Dinosauria. Traits that both crocs and birds possess are likely ancestral to all archosaurs and therefore would be present in dinosaurs unless they were secondarily lost.

Crocodylians are surprisingly [vocal](http://crocodilian.com/cnhc/croccomm.html) - and social, in fact. Just like we've made assumptions about dinosaurs, we've made assumptions about crocs. They are more like birds than we give them credit for. But I digress! Crocs do roar and [bellow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s_jrCoWQp0) using their larynx. They also hiss, and their bellows actually have a subaudible component to them. The wavelength of these subaudible sounds corresponds to the distance between the keels on their scutes, creating the "water dance" they use in their mating ritual (and the dancing water is made up of [Faraday waves](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/05/alligator-mating-physics/)).

Most of birds' unique vocal abilities are due to a [syrinx](http://www.hearbirds.com/content/syrnx1.htm), which is an organ that sits at the base of the trachea. It's not the same thing as a larynx; it's a different organ. Birds do have a larynx, but the degree to which they can vocalize with it is limited (and poorly understood). Not all birds have a syrinx. No New World vultures (like turkey vultures) do, so they're limited to grunts and hisses. 

The syrinx of songbirds is extremely complex, allowing for the wide variety of sounds. Birds make [a ton of vocalizations](http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdcommunication.html), from hisses to warbles to squawks. Some [can haz cheeseburger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTnVvAb3BRk).

We know that not all dinosaurs had a syrinx; it evolved at some point in theropods. It's present in all bird groups, so it was likely present in their common ancestor. It seems to rely on the [presence of an airsac in the clavicle or collarbone](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08912960903033327) (sorry, paywall), which is part of a system of air sacs connected to the lungs of many reptiles. As far as we can tell that clavicular airsac first arises in [enantiornithines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiornithine), which are dinosaurs that are so birdlike that they're generally just called birds.

Earlier non-avian dinosaurs probably vocalized more like crocs than birds, but of course their morphology was quite different. Some animals like *Parasaurolophus* had weird hollow chambers that might have [been used for vocalizations](http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/dinosaur/2011/02/how-parasaurolophus-set-the-mood/). Given the amount of diversity we see in the sounds modern archosaurs can make, and the variation we have in extinct dinosaurs, there was probably a great variety in vocalizations. However, we have no way to test for that in most fossil species.

This is based on an earlier answer I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1x1jdt/did_dinosaurs_actually_roar_or_is_it_just_a/), so check out that thread for additional discussion. It's because the two hydrogens make [half a tetrahedron](http://witcombe.sbc.edu/water/chemistrystructure.html). Actually it's 104.5 degrees, because of the way the lone pairs of electrons on the opposite side repel the electrons of the hydrogen atoms. Additionally they were smart enough to take [really nice cameras with a variety of film stocks](http://history.nasa.gov/apollo_photo.html) along for the ride.   1. So, if there is an area where light can orbit a black hole, is that what is represented in the [portrayal of a black hole in Interstellar](http://i.imgur.com/d6nCch9.jpg)?  

2. If so, since photons are massless, could they orbit without collision and therefore have a spherical orbit that would completely conceal the black hole?  

3. Or, because a black hole is not perfectly spherical, and it's gravitational pull is not perfectly even, where would the light band ultimately form relative to the black hole?

4. Finally: Because light is moving so fast, would it's orbit decay so rapidly that it would only orbit for a very short time?  So orbit is mathematically possible, but it's duration is barely observable? I'd love for someone with more rigorous training to chime in here (I'm a mathematician not a physicist), but I understand it as follows. If we were in such a black hole field there would be a consistent force of gravity towards the (distant) center. We might not feel it normally since we would be in "free fall", but general relativity indicates and experiments support that time flows differently as you get deeper down such a gravity well. We would thus observe that time flows more slowly as you head in a particular direction. That differential would certainly show up in the redshift pattern if nothing else.

Of course if you're assuming some sort of "all the mass in a black hole get's dumped into a parallel universe with different spatial scaling etc" where there is no sense of a local "center" of the black hole, then what I'm describing doesn't apply. However, in the scenario of multiple spacetime continuaa with different relationships I'm not sure if there's a sense in which it is meaningful to say that one is "inside" another. The steel is chipping off small pieces of the flint. The chipping/striking force creates friction which heats the small pieces to the point of glowing. They have to make calculations for time passing slower for satellites moving at high speeds than it does for us on Earth, so I assume orbital trajectories need to account for gravitational disturbances too. I can't claim to know for certain.

May I ask from where your interest in these questions comes? 1. So, if there is an area where light can orbit a black hole, is that what is represented in the [portrayal of a black hole in Interstellar](http://i.imgur.com/d6nCch9.jpg)?  

2. If so, since photons are massless, could they orbit without collision and therefore have a spherical orbit that would completely conceal the black hole?  

3. Or, because a black hole is not perfectly spherical, and it's gravitational pull is not perfectly even, where would the light band ultimately form relative to the black hole?

4. Finally: Because light is moving so fast, would it's orbit decay so rapidly that it would only orbit for a very short time?  So orbit is mathematically possible, but it's duration is barely observable? That's fascinating! Ok, first off, keep in mind I'm just a highschool student with an interest in this subject with no qualifications whatsoever, so if someone more qualified corrects me, believe them over myself.


What would probably happen in my scenario is that you could only see in a very limited angle. Within the event horizon, everything moves directly towards the singularity, light included. As a result, the only way you could view anything is to look directly away from the singularity. Even doing this, the angle from which you could see things is extreme small (Looking at millionths or billionths of a single degree). 


I've done a small album using the wonders of paint to try to explain this if you don't quite get it from my horribly basic explanation.
http://imgur.com/a/i2Oda


TLDR; this is one of the reasons we know we are not within an event horizon of a giant blackhole; if we were, the angle of which we could observe things would be ludicrously low. 


Again, I have no qualifications, just an interest in the topic, if you disagree with me, Ill edit your ideas in. Both coconuts and grass seeds float on seawater to new habitations. Fauna too, on tree and seaweed rafts.  Seeds are blown by wind and are carried by birds. Bond angles (and distances) are not strictly fixed.  The atoms in molecules do 'wiggle' a bit.  There are various types of 'wiggle' for different molecules.  These are called the normal vibrational modes.

 Casual interest mostly. The new Cosmos answered this exact question.  Nothing could have survived the early formation and asteroid bombardment of the Earth, so dating the oldest continental crust will only get you part way there.  They realized that they could measure uranium-lead isotopes in meteors since they formed the same time as the Earth Check out [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1zj8ub/was_calculus_discovered_or_invented/) for a big discussion on the topic. So yes, as everyone agrees, we try to make rockets that carry people safer. But OP asked a slightly different question: do they have fewer accidents?

Here's a table with different launch vehicles, and the number of successes and failures. You can't go by raw numbers, because some have flown lots of times and some only a few.

http://claudelafleur.qc.ca/Spacecrafts-index.html#Table-11

If you look, there are some rockets that aren't human rated that have better success rates than some that were (looking across countries). The world looks very different at different wavelengths. That's because materials respond to different wavelengths of light differently. For example, your black sweater might absorb visible light (that's why it looks black), but reflect radio waves.

That's how radar works. We can hardly see (non-stealth) airplanes against a bright blue sky, but they light up like a Christmas tree when we bounce radio waves off them.

But yes, if you could see FM radio, radio towers would look like very bright point sources of light.

Here's a decent visualization, when someone overlays the WiFi spectrum with our visible spectrum:
http://www.nextnature.net/2013/08/wi-fi-visualization-surrounded-by-waves/ This isn't actually true. An event horizon is just a delineating boundary in space-time where we can't observe what goes on beyond. It's just most commonly used in regard to black holes.

See things like cosmological/particle horizons. 1. So, if there is an area where light can orbit a black hole, is that what is represented in the [portrayal of a black hole in Interstellar](http://i.imgur.com/d6nCch9.jpg)?  

2. If so, since photons are massless, could they orbit without collision and therefore have a spherical orbit that would completely conceal the black hole?  

3. Or, because a black hole is not perfectly spherical, and it's gravitational pull is not perfectly even, where would the light band ultimately form relative to the black hole?

4. Finally: Because light is moving so fast, would it's orbit decay so rapidly that it would only orbit for a very short time?  So orbit is mathematically possible, but it's duration is barely observable? This is why 72 degrees feels the most comfortable.  At that temperature you will produce, and lose, heat at the same rate without sweating. See this statement has always bothered me. With black holes, the closer you are, the gravitational influence increases dramatically with changes in distance. And for example, people use that same example but use the sun as a black hole instead. But the Earths orbit is elliptical around the sun. So it is significantly closer to the newfound blackhole at sometimes more than others. 

That difference in distance, is the gravitational influence really the same as the suns, but as a black hole with one solar mass? I'd gladly risk my life for a ticket to space. Note that that is fairly new, and didn't exist when any of the existing rockets were fielded. Note also that SpaceX isn't being required to comply with it. Because black holes can absorb matter not just mass. &gt;is there a lower limit

The smaller it is, the less time it will remain before evaporating by Hawking radiation. The size of micro black holes that the Large Hadron Collider might be capable of producing only last for a small fraction of a second.

&gt;where 1: it's no longer black ... just really really dense

[Neutron star](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star). &gt; I recall reading that as the mass of the black hole grows the event horizon might actually catch the light ray sealing its fate.

Suppose it grew because something collided into it from the opposite side. Wouldn't the information of this collision having happened need to travel at faster-than-light speed to be able to catch up to the photon? I research on black holes a few years back and I think that if a black hole had Earth's mass, it would be approximately the volume of a basketball. It's thought that [Hysterical Strength](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterical_strength) comes from adrenaline.

It may also have something to do with how delivered muscular power is modulated under normal circumstances.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction

&gt; While nerve impulse profiles are, for the most part, always the same, skeletal muscles are able to produce varying levels of contractile force. This phenomenon can be best explained by Force Summation. Force Summation describes the addition of individual twitch contractions to increase the intensity of overall muscle contraction. This can be achieved in two ways:[10] by increasing the number and size of contractile units simultaneously, called multiple fiber summation, and by increasing the frequency at which action potentials are sent to muscle fibers, called frequency summation.

&gt; Multiple fiber summation  When a weak signal is sent by the CNS to contract a muscle, the smaller motor units, being more excitable than the larger ones, are stimulated first. As the strength of the signal increases, more motor units are excited in addition to larger ones, with the largest motor units having as much as 50 times the contractile strength as the smaller ones. As more and larger motor units are activated, the force of muscle contraction becomes progressively stronger. A concept known as the size principle, allows for a gradation of muscle force during weak contraction to occur in small steps, which then become progressively larger when greater amounts of force are required.

&gt; Frequency summation  For skeletal muscles, the force exerted by the muscle is controlled by varying the frequency at which action potentials are sent to muscle fibers. Action potentials do not arrive at muscles synchronously, and, during a contraction, some fraction of the fibers in the muscle will be firing at any given time. In a typical circumstance, when a human is exerting a muscle as hard as he/she is consciously able, roughly one-third of the fibers in that muscle will be firing at once, though this ratio can be affected by various physiological and psychological factors (including Golgi tendon organs and Renshaw cells). This 'low' level of contraction is a protective mechanism to prevent avulsion of the tendonthe force generated by a 95% contraction of all fibers is sufficient to damage the body.

So when you get all that adrenaline, combined with a powerful intent, it might be that the signal sent by the central nervous system is so much stronger than any signal you'd be able to muster under normal circumstances, that this gives you a "strength you never knew you had." Yeah right.  On many islands, the plants and animals can often evolve into dramatically different species of long extents of time (excellent examples can be found in Madagascar and Australia). I believe what you're thinking of can be better explained by pollen, seeds, etc. being carried across oceans by global wind and water currents. Oh, I see what you're saying: That if you not only added thrust in the opposite direction but somehow managed to fully reverse course (while inside the event horizon), you still would be brought back to the singularity, rather than being able to leave the black hole. Is that indeed what you meant? This only happens if the ball material has a high coefficient of friction with the ground material, and the ball is highly elastic. For example, it will not occur for a ball made of solid ice thrown against a frozen lake, but it will occur for rubber balls.

The reason that it happens is that at the point of impact, the surface of the ball is moving in one direction, and on impact it encounters friction from the ground. This friction causes the ball to locally compress in the direction of the spin (aka tangential compression), which you can easily see if you hold a small rubber ball (like a superball) in your hand against the ground, and you try turning it so that it would rub against the ground.

Because the ball is highly elastic (specifically, has high tangential compliance), its surface acts as a spring, so the local compression immediately bounces back, forcing the ball to begin turning the opposite way, and thus reversing the direction of spin.

For balls with high degree of elasticity and high friction (superballs are again a great example), you can actually cause the ball to not only reverse the direction of spin, but to reverse the direction of motion, jumping back in the direction it came from.

If you want links to academic papers, see [Superball](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=spinning+super+ball&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8) on Wikipedia. There's also [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS-n_1Zdtv4). That was a great answer to an obviously loaded question. Why these junk questions aren't just deleted is beyond me. No, because the light never reaches you to be visible. It would be like expecting to be suddenly hit by an object in a stable orbit around the earth while observing it from the moon.

The reason we lasers are visible from oblique and parallel angles in some form is generally through either rayleigh scattering (being scattered by molecules in the air itself) or being heavily scattered by particulate matter in the atmosphere (smoke, fog, dust etc). I believe it can. As long as the broken part contains meristem (undifferentiated cells). From what washes ashore and bird poop, often full of undigested seeds. But if you weren't at the same distance, at the same speed as those photons, you would either be not in their path to observe them, or falling into/escaping the black hole, so those photons would never, ever reach you.

 &gt; But from the outsiders perspective if someone would measure the speed of the bounced light.
&gt; They would think that the speed of light is 1.5 times, why

No, they would measure it as light speed exactly. It's the same in all frames of reference, regardless of origin. Do you mean taking a branch and planting that in the ground? Cause they can do that. Or are you talking about uprooting it and then putting the whole thing elsewhere. I think a major reason is how different they use water. A normal trees is almost always bringing water up through the roots and up to the leaves so if you break that flow the tree is in trouble. The cactus on the other hand holds on to a ton of its water without much going to their leaves (thorns) so they aren't as dependant on always getting water I'm having trouble with telling whether you're asking what I think you are or not, but the Event Horizon isn't the same as its surface.

Gravitational pull in the earth will decrease in the direction it was originally pulling once you travel from the surface to the center. This is due to there being parts of the earth surrounding you from directions other than the one that gravity was pulling in, causing the net force to be less.

That wouldn't be the same for the event horizon of a black hole, because the event horizon isn't the same thing as the surface. *As far as I currently know* the event horizon is the point where light is no longer capable of escaping. Inside the event horizon resides the actual mass of the black hole, and inside of it you can still be outside of the black hole itself, thus having the gravitational pull be stronger due to being closer, not fading away like it would when getting closer to Earth's core. If such a star were to exist within the kill zone, we would notice, since it would have to be really damn bright and really damn close (...relatively).

What do you mean by "width of such a GBR"? Thinking of it as a "cylinder" of a sort, if I were to guess? Why is the photon sphere 1.5 times the size of the event horizon? Doesn't that imply things can have an orbital velocity faster than the speed of light? Are the deposited wires on the reverse side of the chip? Why doesn't it orbit while falling in? Like a coin in one of those donation-funnel things.. Correct Like when the moon was created?

http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/moon/collision_ejection_theory.html What are bends? How likely is it that dark matter is substantially composed of primordial black holes?  Yah.. The little old ladies who generally run people over and they get stuck underneath of the vehicle until there's not much left. Yes. In a vacuum, if you set an object to rotate on multiple axes (axes within axes, like gimbals) and then set it free, it will eventually stop wobbling and its axis of rotation will stabilize. This behaviour is fairly simple to model in any physics simulation, even Kerbal Space Program (I tested it and yes KSP models this fairly well). Is the amalgam mixture dentists use for cavities like this? No.  Next. Statistically it's the opposite; manned missions have a higher rate of fatalities than unmanned missions. The video equipment required to fake it was pretty unlikely to have been available [either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_loUDS4c3Cs). I also watched Interstellar recently... They are actually not fixed.  What you see when you see that water has an angle of 109.5 is actually the equilibrium angle or basically the angle with the lowest energy.  

Now one thing to keep in mind some bonds are far more rigid than others.  single bonds for carbon-hydrogen molecules can be fairly flexible, but if you have a sp2 carbon those bonds tend to be much more rigid due to the double bonding structure.  Around our oblate spheroid planet, you mean. ;-) Isn't there an aspect of artificial selection (natural I suppose actually) since taller people (men especially) are seen as more attractive? Scandinavians for example are much taller than peoples of other lands.  &gt;If we ever had a moon base or a mars base latency would make the current internet be unusable.

Light takes about a second to travel between earth and the moon. You would have a ping of 2000ms if you were surfing the internet in space. It would be annoying, but totally useable. 1.) The important thing in limits is that as "whatever you input into the function" approaches a point of interest, the output approaches some value. In 1D, you can only input a single number, (x), into your function and you can only approach a point of interest from either the positive or negative side. In 2D, your inputs are pairs of numbers (x,y). So even though you are putting in two numbers, your putting in one point. As this point gets closer to the point of interest, say (a,b), then the value of the output will approach the limit. You can approach this point in many different ways, but the important thing is the distance that you are from (a,b). Don't think of it as two things approaching two separate things, think of it as single 2D thing approaching one other 2D point.

2.) [Here](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/177067/lhospital-rule-for-two-variable) is a good discussion for limits of indeterminate forms in two variables. How can we say with any certainty? I thought we don't actually know any of the physics beyond the event horizon. For instance, how do we know spacetime doesn't curve into weird shapes, or forces or extra dimensions come into play that we have no way of seeing? So the wording of the question is misleading. Of course ATP synthase is located within the cell membrane. This is how a constant proton gradient can be controlled within the cytosol, which is hypertonic to the outside the membrane. However, this uses a cell wall to keep protons from running willy nilly. To clarify: How do you maintain a proton concentration gradient without the cell wall? Right, but what keeps the proton concentration greater outside the cell if doesn't have a cell wall as a back stop? Clever... bases were sets of more than two constants relate. I doubt they would be captured. If a rogue planet were to approach a star, it would be coming in from ~infinitely far away, so when it got close to the star it would reach escape velocity anyway and just slingshot back around the star. I could be wrong though, I don't know much about rogue planets. Prove it.
 No one knows what happens inside of an event horizon. This is basic knowledge.  Please read the wiki for black holes. I know that this will break all things physics but go with me here... IF matter (let's say a planet in this case) could move faster than the speed of light then it COULD orbit within the event horizon correct?  The limitation is that once the orbital velocity required for orbit exceeds the speed of light there's just no way to increase the velocity to overcome gravity.  IF you could exceed the speed of light you could maintain orbit though correct?  Or are there other known things that could stand in the way? Epigenetics is the "interesting" answer to this question (and is a fascinating subject, with many interesting examples in the wild).

But another answer that fits the question is poisons and teratogens. Lots of poisons, if ingested by the mother, will affect the baby in development, causing phenotypic changes anywhere from minor abnormalities to horrific birth defects. What the fuck did you just try to ask? Tidal forces would rip that shit apart anyway. Not on these timeframes, no.  I could see the argument that taller people could have more babies, but it's not going to be noticeable over a couple thousand years (especially when you consider that a good deal of human heights are due to environmental factors, not genetic).  If a generation is 25 years, then 1000 years is just 40 generations.  That's absolutely nothing on an evolutionary scale. It's good to see people answering OPs question. I was going to give an answer of my own, but this page explains it really well: http://survivaltopics.com/flint-and-steel-what-causes-the-sparks/ Yep. Medical Microbiology by Murry I don't know how technically minded you are but if you want to read a paper about the concept here you go, http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.1487v2.pdf.

If not and want something easier to digest, http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/02/140218-black-hole-blast-explains-big-bang/ On a vaguely related note, think for a moment about the cost and complexity and added weight required for human-occupied flight.  Things like breathable air, food, water, human waste disposal, instrumentation displays, windows, comfortable seating, restraint, space-suits, and the list goes on and on.

As well as spacecraft,  a lot of this can also be said for drone aircraft vs. human-occupied aircraft. [Some groups claim that amalgam is unsafe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_amalgam_controversy), but the official position of most dental associations worldwide is that although there is some mercury exposure, there is little risk associated with it.

From the wiki article:

&gt;[A 2003 monograph on mercury toxicity from the World Health Organization concluded that dental amalgam contributes significantly to mercury body burden in humans with amalgam fillings and that dental amalgam is the most common form of exposure to elemental mercury in the general population, constituting a potentially significant source of exposure to elemental mercury, with estimates of daily intake from amalgam restorations ranging from 1 to 12.5 g/day, with the majority of dental amalgam holders being exposed to less than 5 g mercury/day.](http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/cicad/en/cicad50.pdf)

Surprisingly, there are not many studies available on the potential risks of long-term mercury exposure from dental amalgam. Many dentists are starting to err on the side of caution and avoid using it, mainly because modern composites and polymers are proving to be comparable in cost and effectiveness.

 Or we could, you know make driving tests not be "okay let's go around the block in minimal traffic then parallel park" and make sure the driver knows what they're doing like pilot training With long or short thermometers  I absolutely understand that and all the things with the photon sphere.

But don't things get more complicated than that if things have mass? Intuitively, one would assume that the Lorentz factor is a better metric than the speed of light. Or is it really that different whether a body is moving at a *gamma* of 100 vs. a *gamma* of 100^100?

If that is not the case, what about acceleration? Can't some added pro-grade or retro-grade acceleration lead to a solution? More easily, the space-craft could just accelerate outwards (as if naively trying to flee), effectively reducing the acceleration of the black hole - maybe even to extents where it would be equivalent to orbiting earth. It is because there are 4 domains in an oxygen atom in water, 2 bonds and 2 pairs of electrons. This forms a tetrahedral structure, and when accounting for some more complex interactions between the hydrogen atoms, 109.5 degrees is the lowest energy state for a water molecule. [The top comment here written by /u/RobotRollCall explains this brilliantly.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cosmology/comments/1fu87z/can_you_actually_get_sucked_into_a_black_hole/) Following the math from that article, N isn't the bit size of the hash, but the number of total possible hashes, which equals 2^bitsize

for bitsize=256:

N = 2^256 = 1.15792089 * 10^77

Assuming your k value is correct @ 1.129 * 10^23 attempts per year

Our probability is then approximately:

1 - (e * ((-1.129 * 10^23) * (1.129*10^23 - 1)) / (2*(1.15792089 * 10^53 )))

Which is over 1.0. Given precision errors in the computer math, and the fact that it's an approximation, I feel comfortable stating the probability is nearly 100%

Using k^2 / 2N to simplify doesn't remove the need to use 1 - e * k^2 / 2N, it's just a simpler way to write (k*(k-1))/2N

The reason for that is because k(k-1) is **damn** close to k^2 for large k.

So let's just plug in the above values for

1 - e * k^2 / 2N

That gives us 1 - e * ((1.129 * 10^23 ) ^2 ) / (2 * (1.15792089 * 10^53 ))

Which according to wolphram is *0.9999998503856* probability of a hash collision.


It's important to note that this is related to a well known mathematical problem called the **Birthday Problem** which can also be applied here.

The **Birthday Problem** basically states that for n people, there is a 

365! / (365^n )(365-n)!

chance that two of them will share a birthday.

Instead of birthdays, we have 1.15792089 * 10^77 distinct *things*

Now, this would be ridiculous to calculate (and precision errors galore), but it could be represented as

(1.15792089 * 10^77)!  / ((1.15792089 * 10^77)^(1.129 * 10^23) * ((1.15792089 * 10^77 - 1.129 * 10^23 ))!)

Which Wolfram parsed correctly, but tells me is indeterminate.



Now I'm not 100% confident in **my** math, so if I run into my favorite math professor at school on Monday I'll have him look over my math and let me know how dumb I am.
 The speed of light is kind of a big thing to "if" away. The path a photon takes in a vacuum is a geodesic -- a straight path through spacetime, which appears curved to us because spacetime itself is curved by gravity. When the photon can't orbit the planet, that means that spacetime is so warped that there literally is no geodesic path through spacetime inside of the photon sphere that describes an orbit. If matter could move faster than the speed of light, I think that would mean that the literal shape of spacetime was different than it is, and the answer to the question would probably depend on how you decided to warp spacetime when you constructed your hypothetical. Wow I read this as "Can a planet exist outside of *our* solar system?" and I thought to myself "Wow is this dude that dumb?" Not to mention that when a star system forms most planets are not in stable orbits. Most of them fall into the star or are flung out into space.  So you're right about a few things, and confused about some others. Firstly there is no special receptor which cannabis and only cannabis acts on. Why would the receptor exist in the body if it served no natural purpose, and historically never did? Cannabis acts on the same receptors as a group of neuromodulators called endocannabinoids. The receptors are CB1 and CB2, and are activated by endogenous (made within the body) compounds including anadamide, and 2-arachadonyl glycerate. CB2 receptors have more to do with inflammation and immune function, but are also present in the brain. CB1 receptors are generally more likely to be found in specific regions of the CNS, such as the limbic cortex, hippocampus. amygdala, cerebellum, and several regions of the striatum. 

You are correct in that receptor activation blocks calcium influx. The only way in which you would consider them competitive to endocannabinoids is that they work on the same receptor, but the receptor is what controls the downstream events, not the ligand which activates it. In this sense, cannabis is an agonist. 

I'm not sure that there are any direct effects on K+ channels; blocking calcium channels may alter the membrane potential, but really the inhibitory effects are due to decreased release of neurotransmitters in general, but especially glutamate, as it is a principle excitatory neurotransmitter. Post-synaptic neurons being overstimulated by glutamate synthesize an endocannabinoid which diffuses back to the presynaptic neuron to reduce the amount of glutamate being released.

The key component here is that calcium is required in order for neurotransmitter-filled vesicles to fuse with the pre-synaptic membrane, which releases neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. CB1 receptor activation closes calcium channels = less calcium available for this process. 

You asked about muscle paralysis. That isn't really what's going on here. The reason people who smoke feel slow is because of the action of cannabis in some of the brain regions I mentioned, especially the cerebellum and regions of the striatum. 

You asked about lipid solubility and detection in urine over extended periods. As you mentioned, THC is lipophillic, and fairly hydrophobic. This means that it cannot exist in high concentrations dissolved in water, or it would precipitate out as a solid. It CAN exist in much higher concentrations in lipids, which is where it hangs out. When you smoke, the drug quantity gets distributed amongst the various parts of your body, but not necessarily in equal quantities. Imagine an empty glass of water, and an empty swimming pool. Say it rains for 10 minutes. Obviously, more water is going to end up in the swimming pool. Please ask if you want more detail on this concept.

You asked about drug testing. THC is metabolized in the liver to a large degree, often by hydroxylation reactions, and also by carboxylation. Both of these make THC more water-soluble, but it is still largely excreted in feces. The increased hydrophilicity as a result of hepatic metabolism allows the drug to be excreted in urine as well, although this is not the major route of elimination. As the drug is eliminated from the bloodstream (as described via metabolism and excretion), the concentration of drug in the blood falls. This creates a concentration gradient, which pulls more of the drug out of the fat where it has been hanging out, since it is more fat soluble than water soluble. 

I hope that wasn't too verbose and answered your questions. This is an area of research that I am currently working on (actually with mice who lack the CB1 receptor via genetic engineering) so hopefully I got that right :) 
Here is a [paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2689518/) you can check out as well.

 I'll try and put lines in between the dots...

When you hit your head and see stars, it's because there was blunt force trauma (which can be mostly harmless, dangerous, lethal, or lead to future neurological complications) that "messed with" your visual cortex, causing optical "artefacts" (for a lack of a better word) due to minor over-stimulation.

When you get head rush (standing up too fast, holding your breath and then taking a deep breath, being upside down and then inverting quickly, et cetera) and see stars, it's because the nerves and cells working in conjunction with your brain, optic nerve(s), and eyeballs were temporarily deprived of blood, and thus oxygen.  When this blood, and oxygen, is very suddenly replenished, it causes over-stimulation of the aforementioned eye-related units.  Because of this, you don't always see stars.  I, in particular, happen to see a grid of dark blue dots that quickly fade away.  The same result can be accomplished (and I do *not* recommend you try this) by closing your eyes and *softly* rubbing your fingers across your eyeballs very, very slowly with a very, very small amount of pressure.  These closed-eye visuals that you experience are due to the pressure stimulating the cells in your eyes.

Didn't even have to do that for my license. Another one: what is now known as the birth control pill was originally prescribed to alleviate PMS symptoms.

Again, turns out there was a side effect. my Mom said when she was a kid in the 60's they would put a teaspoon of mercury on each kid's desk so they could play with it No. Mountains and oceans. As far as I know, the event horizon doesn't even exist according to the world formost theoretical physicist Steven Hawking. 
He invented the event horizon theory and years later admitted it was "my greatest mistake".

I could be misinformed as the article I read was years ago and I'm not really much of a physics buff. &gt;Obviously we know that this isnt true, because the speed of the mirrors Light has to be the speed of Light.  
  
If you would actually read the whole sentence, i would explain it right why it is measured exactly as the speed of Light. But not only that, im also explaining the effects of special relativity on that particular train. Negative charges repel, so when two overlapping electron orbitals get too close to each other their negative charges repel and they push each other out of the way. But overall, the angular momentum of the molecule is conserved, meaning that if one orbital pushes another orbital around the molecule, that orbital will push another one, and another one, and so on until they've pushed each other 360 degrees around the nucleus. At this point, the last orbital hits the first orbital, imparting it some angular momentum. The net change in angular momentum for the molecule is zero, so we say that it is conserved. All of this orbital interaction around the nucleus happens at very high speeds, so it appears to a macroscopic observer that there is a fixed angle between these orbitals. Thats conservation of angular momentum.

A bond is just overlapping electron orbitals. In a Lewis model for water, there are two sigma bonding orbitals each filled with 2 electrons and then two nonbonding p orbitals on oxygen, also filled with 2 e- each. So oxygen has four orbitals around it that all mutually repel each other and the angular momentum of these orbitals is conserved. The p orbitals have higher e- density than the sigma bonds, because they are not shared with hydrogen. So the p orbitals repel the bonds slightly more and push them together. This is why water has a bond angle around 107 degrees. 109.5 degrees is for a perfect tetrahedron in which all e- density is shared equally between four bonds, like in methane. Yes. From a desire to understand, mutually assured.  Slightly off topic but hasn't it just been proven that light can be slowed down in air or a vacuum by restructuring the photons? The light then continues off at this new slower speed forever. Isn't this similar to what happens when it moves through a medium like water or through a prism and is broken down into its constituent colours?

Why do people post questions that can be so quickly answered by Wikipedia? Also, given how society has worked in the last few centuries, even if taller men would be deemed more attractive, shorter men would still have the opportunity to eventually procreate, slowing down the height increase a lot. 

In natural selection the undesired aspects usually ends up killed or permanently celibate, which is less likely to happen with us, especially with just the 1000 year time frame.  Listen. Your question is not answerable because whatever occurs beyond the event horizon can never be known. If you know what an event horizon is, then you should know this question is not answerable, so why are you asking.  That is a picture of a [Sun Dog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dogs). Kind of similar to a rainbow, the light is sunlight refracted by ice crystals in the atmosphere. Here's [another good site](http://www.wwu.edu/skywise/a101_rainbows.html) with a bunch of different solar effects. Plants on remote islands (the original ones anyway, humans inevitably bring more) come from seeds and spores dispersed by the wind and water or bird transport.  Almost no remote, tiny islands were ever connected to any other landmass.  In most cases they form when a volcano uplifts a mountain straight out of the sea.

Often the plants on islands are unique species, because once a stray seed shows up its' descendants evolve.  But some plants are such good dispersers they can spread across entire oceans.  The most famous example is the coconut palm, with a native range across a huge stretch of the Indopacific.  Its seeds can float for months before reaching shore.  

 Mars is a different story though.

In reality there would be CDN endpoints on the Moon, so the 2s latency would be masked for some browsing - you are right that it would be usable.

RTC would not be real time though and would be hard. Okay, good to know, I figured I was probably oversimplifying something, my hard science knowledge is pretty limited.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* Just checked, ~17 minutes latency between earth and mars. That's kinda depressing.  As you say, skin contact with liquid mercury is not particularly dangerous (although it's not *recommended*, either ...).  However, another source of danger from liquid mercury is that it has a non-negligible vapor pressure at room temperature (there's always some mercury vapor floating around), and you can absorb some of that by inhaling it.  

Still not as bad as organomercury compounds (the mercury people worry about in fish is [methylmercury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylmercury), far more easily absorbed and thus much nastier-especially since it tends to stick around in the bodies of various animals, instead of getting filtered out by the kidneys).   I don't understand, if a black hole has infinite mass, then why is it's gravity weaker further away from it? Aren't mutations occurring though? For example all humans used to be lactose intolerant but now most of us can handle it, due in large part to farming. Mars is crazily far away - popular culture seems to have tricked everyone into imagining it's a little further than the Moon. We got it from a tree, then reacted with acetic anhydride to potentiate it My mom told me that as a kid, the doctor or dentist would let them briefly play with liquid Mercury in their hands. The 50's were a different time for sure. I'm curious how much vapor would exist from short term exposure? The mercury-containing compound that is most dangerous is methyl mercury. You can ingest elemental mercury - it is not absorbed by the body at all (~0.01% absorbed).

[Source](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408440600845619) I thought once you were past the event horizon it didn't matter if you went faster than the speed of light because all directions in space led toward the singularity? Am I the only one here thinking that this didn't answer OP's question at all? To the middle of the black hole. Isn't this kind of just being obtuse to avoid the point of the question? We're not talking about some weird binary system where you can either go directly away from or directly into the object you're trying to escape from. We're talking about moving at, say, a tangent path to the object, or anywhere between that and straight away from it. &gt;So, if there is an area where light can orbit a black hole, is that what is represented in the portrayal of a black hole in Interstellar? 

No, that's just an accretion disk.

&gt; If so, since photons are massless, could they orbit without collision and therefore have a spherical orbit that would completely conceal the black hole? 

Photons aren't going to conceal anything. If they're orbiting the black hole, then they're not going into your eyes, and they're not affecting what the black hole looks like. For objects a long way away (or objects so hot that no material could survive) I believe it's almost exclusively done by measuring thermal radiation, as already mentioned.  You obviously already know about fluid-expansion thermometers.  Some methods of temperature measurement include: [resistance thermometers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_thermometer) (the resistance of a particular conductive material changes with temperature, and thus measuring the resistance can be used to measure the temperature), [thermocouples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple) (when two different conductive materials are joined, a voltage is created that varies with temperature, and measuring this voltage can be used to measure temperature), [pyrometers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrometer) (these are just specialized devices for measuring thermal radiation and converting it to a temperature measurement), and [Langmuir probes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langmuir_probe) (electrodes used to determine characteristics of plasma, which can include the temperature of the plasma).   It is all dependent upon the accuracy of the measurements.

If it is an unobstructed transmitter and you have sensitive equipment you could establish an [RSSI]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_signal_strength_indication) and monitor that to determine ranging.

Super duper sensitive equipment could measure a doppler shift in the transmitted signal and with 2 receivers you could ploy exact position.

A third way would be GPS style, get 2 super precise clocks synced up, the farther way the transmitter is the farther out of sync the transmitted time is compared to the receiver Other redditors have provided a decent explanation for what applications FISH can be used for so I won't go into that. I've had to do a few microarrays myself and they're used primarily to examine the gene expression changes in a biological system, for example, I used microarrays to test for gene expression changes in leukaemia cells that had been treated with a certain drug. The microarray results will basically tell you what gene sequences hybridised on the chip and so the experiment will require a control condition to compare with the experimental condition to see what changes have occurred as a result of the treatment. Of course this is just one way to use the microarray and it can be used for different types of analysis as well. Sorry, I should have clarified that.  By size I mean mass. In physics, infinity is defined as "very far away" Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been automatically removed because you did not include a question mark "?" in your title.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* To be very clear here, DON'T DRINK MERCURY.  Would this make time go faster on such a planet (a la *Interstellar*)? Mad hatter, Nuff said.  No, in fact it is actually harder. Similarly to leaning a language, a child's brain is much more pliable and soaks up new information like a sponge.  &gt; Another possibility is to consider a white hole in the bulk rather than a black hole. With this scenario, it is possible for the universe to be inside the horizon at any time up to the present since all matter eventually emerges from the white hole horizon. 

&gt; In this picture one may interpret the pressure
singularity as a holographic description of the Big Bang that takes place at `a&lt;10^-10`

&gt; the universe is inside the horizon at the present time but (given that its expansion is now dominated by the cosmological constant), it will expand indenitely and eventually intersect the horizon in the future. 

&gt; In the context of DGP brane-world gravity, we have developed a novel holographic perspective on cosmological evolution, which can circumvent a big bang singularity in our past, and produce scale-invariant primordial curvature perturbations, consistent with modern cosmological observations.

&gt; This yields an alternative holographic origin for the big bang, in which our universe emerges from the collapse a 5D "star" into a black hole, reminiscent of an astrophysical core-collapse supernova.

Neat...  Let me speak to how extremely cold temperatures are measured.
I'm assuming you mean cold things like Bose-Einstein Condensates and things as cold as the [current record](http://ltl.tkk.fi/wiki/LTL/World_record_in_low_temperatures) of 0.000 000 000 1 degrees above the absolute zero.

&amp;nbsp;


Temperature is a measure of the energy content of matter. The energy then relates to the motion of the atoms that constitute that matter. The lower the temperature, the lower the energy, the slower the atoms. 

Matter brought to very low temperatures are confined in a potential, meaning if they are trapped in some region by a force.  The spatial extent of the atoms in that potential relates to their temperature.

&amp;nbsp;


Take for example the atmosphere on earth, which is about 10 km thick.  Ten kilometer is how far atoms at the temperature distribution of our atmosphere can move against the confining gravitational force.  If the temperature of the air were ten times smaller the atmosphere would be only 1 km thick.

&amp;nbsp;


This same principal is used to measure the temperature of ultra-cold systems in magnetic traps. The size of the chilled atomic cloud is determined by illuminating the cloud with laser light, which is strongly absorbed by the atoms, and they cast a shadow.  With the help of several lenses, the shadow is imaged onto an electronic sensor similar to those in digital cameras.  Since the magnetic fields are precisely known, the size of the cloud is an absolute measure for the atoms' energy and temperature. This of course encounters a quantum problem since measuring the temperature increases the temperature.

&amp;nbsp;


Another technique to determine ultra-cold temperature is to measure the kinetic energy of the atoms.  For that, the magnetic trap is suddenly switched off by switching off the current through the magnet coils.  In the absence of magnetic forces, the atoms simply fly away, and the cloud expands ballistically. The cloud size increases with time, and this increase is a direct observation of the velocity of the atoms and therefore their temperature. This approach has the benefit of inferring what the temperature was before you interacted with the matter.

You can read more and see pictures of atomic cloud shadows of Bose-Einstein Condensates that were used to measure their temperature [here](http://cua.mit.edu/ketterle_group/Popular_papers/Ultralow_temperatures.htm). Actually, if you just Google "Bose-Einstein Condensates" and look at the images, they are dominated by these types of cloud snapshots. Hopefully these images make intuitive sense now. However, assuming that a blackhole is constantly, or at least will eventually gain more matter, and also that when things orbit they tend to decay slightly.

Wouldn't the added mass of the blackhole keep pushing that exact orbital range out so that nothing could ever hold that orbit for more than a short period of time?

 But that doesn't matter. You can calculate the earth's gravitation pull on other objects by thinking of it as a point mass. If the earth's density isn't uniform, it just changes the position of that point mass. The orbit of any moons or satellites should be the same path - just with an altered point of rotation.

And the original question should be answered like this: The stronger the gravitational pull of a planet, the faster an object needs to travel to not get sucked in. If an object is orbitting inside the event horizon of a black hole, it experiences such a massive inward pull that, in order to not get sucked in, it would need to orbit faster than the speed of light.

Since this is impossible, all objects simply get sucked into the black hole once they pass the event horizon.

I'm not a scientist nor do I try to pose as one. I'm just a little concerned at how willing people are to obfuscate the truth around here (Giving over complicated, off topic "answers") as long as they sound smart. &gt; Matter is a different matter. 

Bullshit, matter is a constant. Never created nor destroyed.

Then who was phone?

 Probably not a whole lot.  The plot in [this paper](http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~eandrei/389/NISTIR.6643.pdf) implies that the vapor pressure should be about 1 Pa at room temperature, compared to atmospheric pressure of 100 kPa (100,000 Pa), although it's still far higher than the vapor pressure of most other metals at room temperature, which (IIRC) tend to be on the order of 10^-lots Pa if they can be measured at all.  The main problem is that mercury is a chronic, cumulative poison.  More is worse, so less is better, and better safe than sorry (especially if there's no particularly good reason to be exposing yourself to it).  

Liquid mercury is [actually remarkably nontoxic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_poisoning) considering how bad absorbed mercury is for you- it's just very hard to absorb.  Ingestion of liquid mercury only results in something like 0.01% absorption into the body, and there have apparently been a few cases where people tried to commit suicide by intravenous injection of liquid mercury, which also failed to produce toxicity (!), although it does cause damage by physically blocking blood vessels.   I wish this was /r shittyaskscience. I learned about this from watching the tv show andromeda.  Although your brain can only use images and information you already know consciously or subconsciously, you can learn in the sense that you can gain the experience of a particular situation. For example, I have no tattoos, however I recently had a dream that I had a sleeve of tattoos on one arm and I really enjoyed the attention it brought. I had never thought about that before.  Wooo, facts!!! Hah!! Finally I can answer a question related to my work. I make chips... well, one small part of the process.

Modern CPU process nodes can really be broken down into two main components - transistors, and interconnects. Transistors everyone has heard of and talks about here pretty regularly - the new 14 nm process node has on the order of [1.9 billion transistors on a 133^2 mm die](http://wccftech.com/intels-14nm-broadwell-u-processors-launched-28-15w-core-family-updated-iris-6100-hd-6000-gpu-core-core-i75557u-leads-pack/), depending on the latest released product. Interconnects are just as hard to make but are rarely talked about.

So - You have fabricated a bunch of transistors that are turning on and off very effectively, but how do you get that information to the user? The answer are interconnects. The die stack is built up with a series trenches and via layers that are filled with particular conductive metals that allow information from the transistors to be accessed.

Because there are so many transistors, you need a lot of repeating stack layers.... think more than 7-8 for something modern. You can imagine these trenches (connects that move along a layer) and vias (connects that move between layers) a lot like the trunks, branches, and roots of a tree - they are all connected, but intertwining and very complicated. At the top, you have the minimal number of connections needed for effective I/O (which I am not very familiar with... so I will not comment about).

So, in this way you can have a bunch of different transistors all connected together. I'm excluding a lot of information here to keep it simple. I'm not sure what you are looking at in that picture - those don't look like transistors though, unless it is a very old CPU. In this case the interconnects/higher level stacks have all been dissolved/washed away to allow you to look at the transistor structures. You're thinking of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and willow bark (salicylic acid). Acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) is another drug entirely. It's synthetic (an aniline-derivate) and got popular only the last 60 years when it was discovered that it was safer than the traditional competitor, phenacetine. "...there is no dark side of the moon, really... as a matter of fact, it's all dark."

oh, shut up. you were all thinking it. Best explanation so far  It's worth noting that this is less of the case now than traditionally, even though it still happens. Today we are very focused on finding substances with high affinites to pre-selected selected specific targets; we often start with a mechanistic hypothesis and then search for a drug to act through it. Starting a sentence with "I mean" makes English teachers act violenty. Another example is dry ice. CO2 has a liquid phase, but it only exists at high pressures; the temperature range of that liquid phase gets narrower at lower pressures and is gone entirely at normal atmospheric pressure. So if you get a block of frozen CO2 (dry ice), and let it warm up, it'll *sublimate:* it'll go directly from solid to gas without going through a liquid state.

Other than that, the transition is a lot like when you melt ice into water. Both phases exist side-by-side at the melting point / sublimation point. Because there is a nonzero heat of fusion, there is a little bit of stability; chunks of material can't randomly flipflop between phases. Right, my bad, I typed this out half asleep :) Which brings me to my next question: What if two black holes with the exact same mass collided, what would happen? Yes, but this isn't anatomical, it's based on the enzymes we produce. Blue eyes are another recent mutation, but again, that's not anatomy. Before we were how we appeared commonly today, some othe the biggest anatomical changes were the shaping of the skull and our teeth.  &gt;  We can fly people on special aircraft that briefly (30 seconds at a time) fly in an arc simulated weightlessness

A plane can also fly a shallower arc that simulates reduced gravity, but I don't know if that is ever done. 45 seconds of Martian gravity doesn't sound that useful. There is actually a thermodynamic argument that any computation, no matter how it's implemented, *must* produce some heat. Not very much heat (we're a long, long way from reaching this limit in anything we have the technology to do) but some.

(Strictly, it's *forgetting information* that has to produce waste heat, but it's hard to perform a nontrivial amount of computation without forgetting some of your intermediate data.) In the new Cosmos series, they explain this in a very simple way and it's fascinating. Given that they don't have a star that gives them light they are practically invisible to human eye. They can be seen with infrared cameras though. Correct me if I'm wrong, I have only read a little astronomy. For the record, the Mercury 7 astronauts were basically not insurable.  They could not get life insurance for them by any traditional means.  Kind of makes sense since there would have been no reasonable way to calculate the risk, and therefor the cost.

They were eventually able to obtain $100,000 policies on them as part of the exclusive (essentially advertising) deal with Life magazine.

 Would this increment the size of said black hole? Acutally 2/3s of us still can't handle it. Basically only Europeans and Africans can. I was using it as a point to prove that to at least some degree direction matters to escape the gravitational pull of another object.  But it's irrelevant to what he was asking. What happens to time on the surface of the photon sphere?

I once read an interesting idea that the existence of the photon surface on black holes in four dimensional spacetime suggests that our universe may be the surface of an object in a universe with even more dimensions. It helps me imagine how our universe might not have an edge. Not sure how supported the theory is though. With this theoretical matter which can exceed the speed of light, the event horizon of the black hole is effectively smaller, thus maybe the 1.5* rule still applies, just to this new smaller event horizon.  

All the Event Horizon is, is the point/sphere at which the speed necessary to escape is the speed of light. Within the Event Horizon, Light [and everything else] cannot escape, because it cannot move fast enough. Thank you for your submission!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if you have any questions or concerns.* You could do this using multiple receivers, very accurately synchronized, comparing the time of reception of signals from the ball. (Alternately, you could use directional antennas though, in the abstract, that works the same way.) With bucketloads of well-calibrated equipment behind the walls of the room, you could localize the ball to sub-centimeter accuracy.

Measuring signal strength works, but it's very hard to get reliable results that way. My gut guess is you could get position to within 6-10 feet?

I once worked with someone who was doing this for a stage performance, though. If I remember correctly, their system placed both a sonar transponder and a radio transponder on the performer. I forget whether the performer emitted sonar pings when triggered by radio, or reported by radio the exact time it received pings from the senders in the walls, but whichever way it was, this allowed them to measure *sonar* time of flight accurately enough to localize within, oh, 20cm or so, on a reasonable budget, and this was good enough for their show. Sonar is easier here because it travels much slower than radio, so you don't need absurdly-good timing accuracy.

There are other approaches to this problem; in general terms it's often called "localization". I apologize if I'm asking a stupid question, but what is in the middle of the black hole? Objects can definitely orbit a black hole like everything in our galaxy does. It all depends on an objects mass. If a star is massive enough it will pull away, just like how we haven't been pulled into our sun. However, once past a certain point (the photon sphere), it's over. The gravitational pull is so strong within the event horizon that not only do objects get pulled in, but also destroyed along the way.
Imagine if our planet's gravity was a billion times stronger than it is now...yeah. The singularity has *infinite* mass, which is still a concept that we don't fully understand. Where does everything go? What's beyond the singularity? What happens after you die? How many dimensions actually exist? We are so clueless. Brilliant explanation thank you! Basically like the difference between Sweden and N. Korea SpaceX developed their own safety guidelines with help/approval from NASA. Quite a lot of work goes into testing to make sure it's safe enough for humans. Pilot training is very expensive and takes a long time so it comes back to the original point of deaths vs dollars. 

In Australia it's 20 hours in dual command and 5 hours in command, minimum, with a licensed instructor.

A car instructor costs $1 per minute times 60 minutes per hour times 25 hours = $1500. If you pass first time. Sure, this might reduce road deaths, but it would also make it harder for poor people to get a license.  I only read the first couple answers so maybe someone has already told you this, but it's quite obvious that no one here should be answering your question at all. The only answer available to you is a big fat, I don't know. We don't know what happens within the event horizon because we cannot see inside of it. As much as these dipshits want to tell you that they seemingly know the answer, they cannot. If it is not observable, the best we can do is hypothesize, but no answer can be given to your question as of the moment. An event horizon is a location beyond which any event that occurs can have no effect on the observer (you can't see any event beyond an event horizon, in other words, a horizon for events). The universe also has an event horizon. It's not just black holes but gravity in general. The [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation) that describes gravity imples that the gravity reduces according to the square of the distance. This applies to all gravitational fields, not just ones made by black holes.

Now in your scenario, when the sun is exerting a graitational force, if you measure the distance from the earth to the side of the sun facing it, you get one distance, if you measure from the earth to the side of the sun facing away from it, you get another distance.

If we're only considering gravitity generated by the far side and the close side you'd see there's a little more force exerted from the close side and little less from the far side.

When you have all that mass right in the center, neither do you have a part significantly closer, nor further apart.

In fact, in both cases, the only thing that mattered is te *centre of mass* of the star and its mass. If you draw a line from center of mass of the sun to the center of mass of the earth, and know their masses, you can calculate the gravitational force.

The Earth is already pulled a bit harder when it's closer but that's why it has an elliptical orbit. The sun being replaced with a black hole of one solar mass doesn't change anything because neither its center of mass, nor its actual mass have changed. Because Bonds, James Bonds.  'Dark side of the Moon' refers to radio darkness. It's on the side opposite Earth and thus can't communicate with Earth. It still gets sunlight. Another interesting matter is that while it exists, the blackhole is also absorbing the cosmic microwave background, so it's receiving a little energy.

So later in the article they suggest that it would have to be at least 0.8% the mass of the earth to actually evaporate, because above that it will receive more energy from the microwave backgrond than it loses due to hawking radiation. The Schwarzschild Radius of a black hole is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole, at a ratio of 3 km per solar mass. So yes, any addition of mass to the black hole will cause the size of the event horizon to increase. Yeah, a cylinder. unless it just radiates like a supernova, because usually in documentaries they show GBRs as a beam of light. If no light escapes a black hole, then how do you know what goes on inside it? We don't know for certain. General Relativity predicts a singularity, but quantum mechanics also has to come into play on small scales and we haven't yet reconciled the two theories. At any rate, something pretty dense. So, what you are saying as that they were anatomically different? In a way, the toxicity of tylenol -is- an analogue of the tolerance response to GABAergic drugs like alcohol. Both drugs are processed by proteins in limited supply. When GABAergic drug substrates are consumed we become resistant to the effects of GABAergic drugs. A tylenol metabolite destroys liver cells, so when the protein substrates which detoxify tylenol are consumed the effect is potentially lethal.

All these interactions are basically points of control for more complicated biochemical interactions. All of them tend to have some sort of biofeedback control, but many of the systems involved have variable susceptibility to outside influence and variable criticality to the functioning of the organism. For instance: a few hundred micrograms of an acetylcholineesterase inhibitor will kill you because acetylcholine is everywhere in the body and controls all muscle function, but cannabinoid agonists are absurdly nontoxic because the receptors and systems they control have little to do with basic biological functioning.  Also are black and white tones, colors, or shades? I don't know where to ask this question and google tells me all answers are right and wrong at the same time. In addition, dental schools are teaching students to use composite whenever possible because it requires much less destruction of the tooth as compared to an amalgam filling.  On average, they will have fewer accidents than rockets bearing humans... Probably because, as a rule, rockets that are rated to carry humans are tested unmanned at least once, and probably a lot more than once.  ...Not that I'd recommend it. Sure we can't see inside it but the math is still the math. Fact is the questions makes no sense because all paths within the event horizon lead towards the singularity. The concept of an orbit is not applicable. Sure we don't ACTUALLY know what occurs inside of a black hole but we don't KNOW lots of things. Doesn't mean there aren't more and less likely things or that we should just not bother hypothesizing. Anatomy is about structure, the number and general shape of bones and tissues. I am 6'6" 200#, but I am not anatomically different from a male thats 5'10 300# or  5'5" 120#. I think I understand you, but I am not positive. Could you tell me if this analogy is accurate.  Imagine a clear, plastic piece of graph paper that was designed to somehow expand when heated.  Then imagine sprinkling some material on this paper. The places where the material rests don't expand under heat because the stickiness of the material prevents it.  Is that right?  

I never knew that.  It is super cool.  

So, if you created a numerical matrix that held a representation of the effect of expansion in geometric coordinates then you would see positive numbers where dark energy is the dominant force and negative numbers where matter gathers.  And space expands only in the areas where it is positive. There is a mathematical separation between our solar systems and the no man's land between them Speak for yourself. Anti-infammatories like those don't do shit for me. I wouldn't call it a tolerance since I rarely use them (only when directed to by the doctor). They are exactly zero percent effective at reducing the swelling cause by nerve damage in my foot, which is constant and permanent, going on 4 years now. At which point does the event horizon grow? Just when the mass enters the horizon, before that or after that? No, the laws of physics break down within black hole. They are kind of mysterious you know! &gt;Within a photon sphere it is possible to imagine a photon that starts at the back of your head and orbits around a black hole only then be seen by your eyes.

lol So the just before he or she falls in, the entire sky would glow in many colours? That might just be where you are in Australia, it wasn't the case for Tasmania. We had to have 50 hours of driving before we could go for our test and I think it's even higher now Well, the gravitational potential from a nearby object could alter the local shape of the event horizon, but only once the object is inside the event horizon will it cause a uniform increase in the radius of the event horizon. This thread seems to be turning into a black hole q&amp;a so I figured I would ask something as well. Do we know for sure black holes contain a singularity and that they don't just lead somewhere else? How do we know the matter that goes into a black hole doesn't just spit that matter out 1,000,000,000 light years away? Haha yes! I would love to see a scifi based off of a rogue planet shooting earth out of orbit Unfortunately no. Within the event horizon space is warped so drastically that all paths lead further downwards toward the singularity. You can't travel fast enough to remain in the same spot. Kip Thorne once said in a book that one way to think of it is that, within the event horizon, spacetime is warped so badly that time itself points towards the singularity I.e. All objects move into the future, and within the event horizon the future points towards the singularity. Thank you for your submission!

It's not in vaccines anymore and only ever was present in trace amounts. Perhaps what I will say does not fit with 'extremes' of temperature but they are better than 'normal' mercury or alcohol thermometers.

For 'high' temperatures, you could use a thermocouple - a device in which two wires of different metals are fused at a single joint. Depending on the temperature, the voltage across the two wires will indicate the temperature to a reasonable degree of accuracy.

Thermocouples are quite good for 'high' temperatures, but no so good for 'low' temps. 

A device that is good for low temps is what you call and RTD - resisitive thermal device. It contains a certain type resistor made from materials that have a change in resistance that can be directly correlated to the temperature. Thank you for your submission!

Are you saying that a lack of nutrition does nothing to the shape of the body? Where the hell did you go? I had to merge on freeways and shit.
