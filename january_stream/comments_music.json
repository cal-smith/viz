The stand alone complex is on a different timeline than the movies. The movies are on a different timeline than the manga.

I think this is why most people are upset about arise, along with the change in character design and voice actor. It is a strong departure from what people think of GiTS.\n\nI personally don't think the writer is all that great. He can write an enjoyable story set in a cyberpunk setting, but i don't think he can write something unique that will stand out. He also wrote the second season of psycho pass which for the most part went no where and seemed to be a set up for the movie. Mardock Scramble is his original story which was something that i enjoyed watching, but wasn't really a memorable story.

(aka main story = spike's story)\n\n11 Again another episode of team work, suspense when the crew actually faces a true threat that nearly wipes them out.\n\n12/13 Fight Vicious/blah/blah/blah i explained this a lot already\n\n14 Changes the repetition of the chorus with a more ed based episode, and going away from it's serious overtone so to say.\n\n15-23 Again \"filler\" or the verse while they add to the character they don't add to spike's \"story\" or the chorus but support it\n\n24 Again builds up the story, with spike having to deal with the main meaning of the song, loss and how we deal with it with ed and faye both leaving the crew of the bebop. This showed spike someone who hated kids,dogs and women on the ship in the end now misses those three exact things being with him. A foreshadowing of what to come\n\n25/26 The final chorus, is the collision and conclusion of this song the chorus changes it up mixing what happened all these times and adds the tune of the final fight with vicious with the song ending with a fade to the great abyss.\n\nBut hey that's just what I think, I could just be a crazy old man!", "score": 1},{"body": "&gt; No, but I would if you said you liked Linkin Park.\n\nBut The Hunting Party was a decent record...", "score": 1},{"body": "Lateralus is drastically different.

The songs on this album emerged out of sessions in which band and Brian Eno experimented with free-form sound collages and long jam sessions. It originally was just supposed to be a low-key 6 song EP. but ended up a 10 track album. This album saw the band incorporate electronica, hip-hop, psychedelic rock, industrial rock, funk, synthpop, krautrock, noise rock, and even disco elements into their sound. Lyrically, it was a concept album about mass media and technology overload in the modern age and life in a dystopian, futuristic society, inspired by cyberpunk and science fiction works and the real-life 90s technology boom, the invention of the internet and rise of 24 hour cable news, uncertainty about Europe's future following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the formation of the EU, and start of the Bosnian War that occurred at the time.\n\nThe songwriting delves into themes of commercialism, post-Cold War politics, corporate advertising, mass media manipulation, over-reliance on technology, propaganda, futurism, superficiality and image, voyeurism, obsession, pornography consumption, sensory overload, societal disillusionment, monoculture, media-triggered nostalgia, death of a parent, unfilled desires, affluence, dependence, hedonistic lifestyles, the consequences of unrestrained indulgence and gluttony, post-apocalyptic life,  total societal collapse, fate, unrequited love, estranged relationships,dystopia, religious fanaticism, social isolation, survivalism, and judgment day.\n\nNeedless to say, the album was not one of U2's commercially successful, however many critics applauded the band for their experimentation. Today it is overshadowed by the critical and commercial success of its predecessor \"Achtung Baby\", the failure of U2's next album, the highly anticipated, \n, ironic and sarcastic \"POP, and the unfortunate bland, safe, and MOR pop rock that the band has put out (and is what they are associated with today) ever since out of a misguided desire to be commercially successful and accessible to the general public as possible as they get older/less relevant.", "score": 1},{"body": "The *First* one?

It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way.
