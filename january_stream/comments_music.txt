This was nice. Thanks for sharing. No joke, this is the only anime that put me to tears, and I don't even watch anime much.  The shinji being a bitch thing is so tired. 

He is a 14 year old kid with no mom and the shittiest dad in the world. He gets thrusted into a new and very scary situation even just in a social context, and that is forgetting the super traumatic and dangerous mech piloting he is expected to do. 

Its easy to look at shinji and call him a whiner when you look at the show like its a video game. There is a huge psychological toll in using the Eva. Every single time he joins the Eva he has to psychologically synch with his mom's soul. Then he fights enemies that tend to fuck with them psychologically as well. 

Shinji's responses to the situation are the ONLY realistic ones. He is a hormonal teen in a SUPER fucked up situation.

The FLCL not making sense thing is just as tired. Its a little more subtle with meaning than most anime, but most anime hit you over the head with shit. Clicked hoping for Proxima Centauri, was not disappointed :D  Or Busdriver's *Perfect Hair* which is one of the best hip-hop albums of the 2010's easily Oh man, this whole soundtrack. This submission will only enjoy a brief moment in the sun before the hordes of reddit downvote it away on the name U2 alone, but people really ought to give it a shot.  The whole damn thing is fantastic, probably the best example of a band completely changing their style and making a masterpiece along the way.

Also, the album is ridiculously dark.  _Love is Blindness_ on this album has a very similar vibe to _Hurt _ off _The Downward Spiral_ - so spare and so hauntingly quiet after the cacophony that preceded it. New Upcoming MIAMI Artist  Gotta catch em all. That's a fair interpretation, pretty much what I took from the Beatles song as well.  Solid answer, thanks. Damn it, this was the perfect contextual comment. Where did I go wrong?  yeah but you'd miss out on " SMOKE SMOKE, FAYE FAYE! HUFF HUFF, FAYE FAYE!" Greatest band in the world Failure is a great alt-rock band from the 90's. Unfortunately, they're not really a similar sound to Tool, so a lot of people might find them out of place opening for Tool.  Mazzy Star is the name of the band. The woman's name is Hope Sandoval. Ah, where to begin with these guys....so many great tracks. Raschuache (spelling?), Star Slight and Pattern Against User are probably my personal favorites. Each album had its own unique feel as they continued to evolve and I'd say each album is a must-listen if you're a fan. 

There's a great alternate/single version of Catacomb out there as well. Bit more raw and less produced than the album version. 

And what a great album to go out on! (Relationship of Command). 

Mars Volta and Sparta (the bands they formed after they split)  both had some really great tracks...but neither of them measures up to At The Drive-In. 

Edit- oh and "Initiation" from their debut album is goddamn brilliant.  Samurai Champloo if you haven't already. I think he meant the final episode? Cause he said "bang" Seeing this song played live is an amazing and exhausting experience. Or the rampant rumors that he ordered the murder of 2pac.

Don't like this? Message me! Thanks! That does sound like a bad fit. I'm very aware of that, but thanks for making sure. If you're serious, you totally missed the point of this episode :/ My name is Mac'em.  I am a rapper from Memphis TN!  But i was rasied in lare teens in Arizona, so I am from the 4'Z in AZ. It's a jazz-rock song.  Neither folk, blues, nor bebop, although it is named after a Muddy Waters album Big yes to that. I'm not even an anime fan but I love it. And if you try the dubbed version and it doesn't grab you then try the subbed version, it's much cooler. That's because it was a pickup band (if you could call it that, moreso just a collection of artists Kanno assembled) created expressly to record the soundtrack for Cowboy Bebop. Don't know if it's been posted here already but:

Some of these are admittedly a stretch, but I don't listen to a lot of brass outside of prog rock bands with three drummers and a synth. I'll look through the M-Z half of my library later.

As a teenager, though?  Good Charlotte. I had a minor obsession.  They are completely different genres. Kinda useless to compare. Even trying to argue which more intimately suits the creative vision of each respective series is little more than subjectively opinion, imho.

The sound of Samurai Champloo has a tighter overall artistic theme, but that doesn't necessarily make it instantly objectively better. Diggin! Also Blackfield.. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfield Okay first, the guy I said this to hasn't seen it, so spoiler.  Second, regardless of how appropriate it is, the whining is annoying, especially if you don't know what's going on. And finally, everyone else in the anime has gone through some messed up shit and they don't whine every fucking second, or abandon their duty or whatever shit Shinji does.  It's justifiable, sure. But he is a whiny little pussy.  Which is fine. It is however, the biggest complaint from most people, which was why I bothered to mention it.

FLCL doesn't make much sense on purpose, it's crazy and disjointed. You can get what is going on after multiple viewings. It's one of the reasons I like it.  

These are shows I recommended over all other animes (given that he loves bebop).  Criticizing a show doesn't mean it's bad, it's just a description of how it is. I didn't feel like writing an essay. I've seen Kanno do this at Otakon. Also did Tank twice and, since it was Baltimore, the national anthem. And also since it was Baltimore, there were folks like me in the simulcast room who did the O.  I completely disagree. A ton of anime series opening and endings fit in with the story or a particular character.  

In the case of Shiki No Uta I think it's clear it's from Fuu's perspective and the lyrics tie into her longing to find the sunflower samurai. I think it is on Xfinity On demand. &gt;alto-sax just doesn't get enough love

I think they're musically exceptional live, but the vocals were a lot better when the were the Cookie Monster kinda instead of the cleaner stuff they do now. I think that's why Troy sounds best  he's mostly still yelling/straining.

Their newest album is hit or miss for me. I eventually warmed to The Hunter, so maybe I will to OMRTS too.

Brann is a Swiss fucking watch. Yeah. It's a pretty amazing part. Large sound to this song. Many layers of depth to it.  

Great female vocals, great atmosphere. Not to mention the lyrics are really emotional. (I know/ 'Cause we're together now/ in my dream) Queen and Rascal Flatts. Was Gabriela Robin actually Yoko Kanno? I was just answering the question. My favorite band IS Radiohead and my least favorite song by them IS Creep. I don't really like the lyrics or the melody.

Drumming and singing on key is a pain.
The Hunter was so much fun, there wasn't a bad song there where I find OMRTS a  bit harder to like.   If you guys want to hear crazy shit then research the making of Siamese Dream. Like it was said BC basically wrote the album and was like play this. The whole band hated those sessions. Apparently they all contributed to MCIS in some way. But yeah. Billy Corgan didn't bother me as a teen when I was angsty but now I'm just like eh okay then. *listens to Mellon Collie* Closing?! How dare you! I don't want it to end... \*sobs* I love watching videos of them live! Its too bad i havent them yet though Wait what timezone does this sub use?

My favorite track from the remix album. If we're talking composers, one of the rising stars right now is Hiroyuki Sawano.  Definitely check him out, every single one of his soundtracks he's done has been utterly phenomenal. "Blood and Thunder" era Mastodon is straight sludge metal. It wasn't until *Crack the Skye* that they went prog, and even then it was prog metal until *the Hunter* where you could really describe it as equal parts rock and metal. This is prog rock?? probably 311 around when Soundsystem came out.  bought all the albums including omaha sessions and the live album.

EDIT: actually around the same time (or maybe even earlier) i was really into Korn and Deftones and bought all their albums.  I remember walking to Sam Goody after school and buying White Pony the day it came out.  Korn I kind of fell out of liking by the time Issues came out.

Issues and Soundsystem came out the same year so I must have bought the first 3 Korn albums before I really got into 311 because Soundsystem was the 1st 311 album I bought.  Deftones I was obsessed with but they only had Adrenaline and Around the Fur out at the time which is why I bought White Pony the day it came out.  I wasn't as into Deftones anymore when White Pony came out (I love White Pony but didn't get into it as much as the other 2 albums) but I was really into Tool by then (bought all their albums) and started getting into Pantera and Slayer (ended up buying all of their albums except the independent ones by Pantera and I never bought South of Heaven by Slayer for some reason).

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMusic) if you have any questions or concerns.* International tour too pleasethanks. The Prodigy are generally considered big beat... but there's too many electronic genres, I don't know the fucking difference anymore I don't really watch anime, I saw this show when I was in junior high and it had a big effect on me. I still listen to the soundtrack many years later. Smh.. Actually no. But it's extremely close and basically the gist of what I'm talking about. It's funny you linked that. I checked iTunes and YouTube while I was posting and checked that version out as well. 

The filename I believe was "Catacombs (Alternate Version)"

Note the S in it. This was back in 2001 and I was a freshman in college and it was still the Wild West of file sharing - post-Napster - but we were all using Kazaa and Song Spy (ha remember fucking Song Spy??) and digging up all sorts of obscure shit. The version i have on an old external somewhere is probably a leaked early demo of it or something.  I really wish I knew.

I do remember that less than a year ago he had some sort of breakdown, uploading various tracks with really offensive names and starting to cuss out anyone talking to him on Twitter. The offensive material was removed and he cleaned up his act without any real explanation of what happened, but seeing these latest posts by him it really makes a bit more sense.

Unfortunately, that sense is that he's a complete and utter douchebag.

His music is incredible, I'll never stop thinking that, but it's quite clear now that he's pretty much the furthest away possible from the kind of person I'd like to know.

As for whether or not it'll stop me from listening to his music in the future.. I haven't yet decided on that. You really can't go around saying that anything is good or bad objectively. It's a completely personal description. You can say that they're popular or that they're technically skilled, but to say that anything is good or bad based upon a majority preference is wrong, even if they're the most popular in their genre. 

With that said, why the hell don't you like Radiohead Poonchow? How do I fix this? Yeshh! :) Good, I've never heard the English dubs by man alive they are usual horrific. The only one I have liked is the GITS: Standalone Complex series, great in both languages.

I tried watching *Cat Shit One* in English (by accident). Nearly cried at how shit it was, then when it was in Japanese, it was so much better it's stupid. Ok I'm gonna be critical here, don't take it the wrong way.

But first off, you take a wonderful piece by Yoko, and hack it apart.  For what reason??? Why change such a wonderful track.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fen2-CJ4nA

It just misses on every note.  Completely wrong tone, and just piss poor acting.  It sounds like something some college kids put out while drunk.  This is honestly one of the worst dubs I can even think of, second only to the gut wrenching One Piece dub.  (Starship Yamamoto aka "StarBlazers" is up there too) You're gonna carry that weight... HOLY SHIT GUYS IT'S SLYFOX! I FOUND HER OUTSIDE OF /r/TheLastAirbender or /r/korrasami ! Y U NO HAVE BEBOP IN ALL SOUNDTRACK? Most of those characters are adults. Rei doesn't count for obvious reasons and Asuka is fucked up in her own way and her overconfidence and bravado comes fro just as insecure a place as shinji's emotional responses. The adults also don't have to experience anything close to what the kids experience. 

Calling a teen a pussy for being emotional under insane duress is the most bullshit internet tough guy keyboard warrior type thing in the world. 

I didn't think you were calling it bad. You were just making incredibly overdone and cliche 'critiques' about both shows. Shinji is really refreshing in a genre full of bullshit over the top Mary Sue main characters. Most anime character's are just mindlessly secure and confident in any dangerous situation.

They only ever existed to create that body of work. Weird, the only character I could see Keanu playing would be Vicious. Arctic Monkeys for me. I got all their albums and have probably at least half of their b-sides all on my phone. Pretty much my go-to music for anytime of the day. Love every single one of their albums. Not super into hip hop but as for my understanding the hook is just the musical piece or little riff that gets you into the song. They're just usually in the chorus or in an intro because the versus are used for rapping and during that point you mainly want to focus on the words/flow.

And they aren't really aggro.  You're right, I can't!  He's added. Linkin park Yeah, that's what a hook is, but I have just heard hip hop fans call a CHORUS a hook. Too many times to not assume there is a cultural difference in nomenclature. yeah, it's just a sample of billy's vocals i think. Broken record much? Various genres. If you don't like one, try another and it will probably be quite a bit different.

You are a failure. Please stop saying stupid things, it makes you sound crazy.

 I like Stagger Lee, O'Malley's Bar, Hiding All Away, The Carny
it's way too hard to pick just one Go to strugglectyrecords.com to watch 
The Wake Up Call music video directed by LazerBeam The Legendary Cold Survivor From Washington State! The Beatles. They opened a lot of doors to me and they were my first real exposure to what music should be. That band means a lot to me. Yup, which is why sadly I'll never get to see them. Cool that they all came together for a cartoon and they did an amazing job. Is Akira on this list?  I'm looking into a lot of these for my anime introduction lineup, I'm a huge fan of bebop and I very much enjoyed Ghost in the Shell.  After I'm done with Champloo I'm either gonna go to Baccano or Evangelion but I'm strongly considering Akira just because of its continuous references in my circles and because when I glanced at it I really liked the anime style from. Nick Cave - The Curse of Millhaven, O'Malley's Bar
I don't really know much of murder ballads outside of Nick Cave You know that feeling you get when you say words over and over again where it gets to the point where they are essentially meaningless? Yeah, that's happening right now. It's making me a bit giggley. In general, I've never been a fan of anime - but Cowboy Bebop was the exception. [Egg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(band), one of the founding groups of the Canterbury scene.  Gotcha, then all I have is conjecture which I think is all most people are gonna have, they're just synonymous in hip hop, I've heard both used enough to not assume there is a distinct nomenclature just in the hip hop community  You are wrong, your arguments are invalid, and your argument techniques are rubbish.

Does he whine? Yes? Complain? Yes? Not make moves on girls who are obviously hitting on him, especially when everyone could be dead at any second? Yes. Abandon his responsibilities for the safety of the entire human race? Yes. If you watch rebuild he is even worse, letting his shitty feelings be responsible for mass destruction, TWICE.  Everyone else does their job, except Shinji. It's understandable, very human and a major plot point. But he is a pussy. You can rephrase it as "overly emotional" or "sensitive" or "psychologically broken", but there it is. I forgot about this song. Bmore represent. KLK was very good, although it the plot premise was essentially a parody of shonen anime, but that's exactly why it was good. soooo good Thanks for answering. That's what I thought. I have not heard anyone talk about any other musical style using these two words with the same meaning. What about "Call Me Call Me", the song that plays when Ed and Ein leave the ship?  The feels. the bar should lift straight up and swing away toward the right of the turntable.  The first bit of this video will demonstrate

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnt9AKQhop4 No problem. Back in the day, one side of an LP were less than 30 minutes. 45's were only 3 about minutes long. Record players were designed to be able to hold, and play a stack of 7 or 8, which is what that "arm" was used for.

The arm should easily pull straight up. Once it's up it will pivot out of the way. A stack of albums were then placed on the spindle, then the arm would pivot back, and rest on top of the stack, holding them in place. When one album finished, the tonearm, (needle), would automatically raise and swing to one side allowing the next record to drop onto the turntable. The tonearm then swings back and gently drops onto the record.

Hey, I found you a video on youtube, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SUpUKIK2Q).

In fact there seem to be an entire series on these old Marconi phonographs. Have fun with it! Hey I already texted you but if you didn't get that ill post this.

Hi, We are big Wys Brass Band, we are a funk and jazz group that  has played at local venues. We have won many different competitions, and we were wondering if we could record at your studio.

Mogwai Thing is though, I don't think you can have a perfect work on that merit because everything has flaws. Bebop is Jordan, crass and rude with some beginning parts that weren't as cool.  Well, that pushed me over the edge to finally buy the Blu Ray set.  Well played. except for the guys in the van chasing ein. thank you they are so talented. Thanks for that link. Going to listen to this later, but I can already tell from the first song that this is my shit. I want to say One Piece, but I feel that's Tim Duncan.

Maybe Toradora. This is the show I've watched so many times i wish i could eternal sunshine my memory. It'll be back. They never stop showing CBBB. Akira itself is a film so I consider it something else entirely. There's no anime tied to it, so just spend the block watching a movie like you can.

He says it's too clear, the darkness and grain are what contributed to the film noir feel. Hanoi Rocks He died the way he lived; like a real cowboy.

R.I.P. Spike Spiegel. I've always enjoyed the radio version too. So ridiculous.  Bebop was a quartet. For what it's worth, this is nowhere near the genre of bebop.  This is much closer to rock.

Calling this bebop would be like calling a cave drawing a renaissance painting. Evanescence Space Dandy was him just having fun with a silly cast of characters, and that's not a bad thing.

It's not up to the standard of Bebop or Champloo because it wasn't *supposed* to be. Not a band, and I didn't do it all at once, but the first artist I ever heard that I wanted to have everything by (and now pretty much do) is Mike Oldfield.  I heard Tubular Bells III when I was like 13 or so, and it was just so different from anything else I'd heard up to then that I was hooked.  And while I know that some serious chunks of his output over the years is uneven/downright bad, I get it all regardless.  Tubular Bells I-III, Amarok, Platinum, Incantations, Guitars, and on.  So many great albums. Wolf's Rain was great, but *those feels...* GUNS &amp; F@KIN ROSES....nuff said! I'm just going to go ahead and accept the fact that we have different opinions on this matter.  roses in the rain

a missed liason

and a hand grenade From the exact same area! I'll check you guys out! Plan on doing any live shows?

Edit - Seems like you've already been performing live. Good deal! I'm assuming the soundtrack, not the show - I just googled a download and found one off of tumblr. This was a while ago though. If you want I can post/PM a track list? That's actually why I'm asking what he thinks is great. Bebop isn't everything he mentions and also hits the things he doesn't like, so I'm curious if he actually does have other shows that fit the bill or if it's more of the usual where things don't live up to his idealized Bebop so therefore nothing can ever be as good. &gt;Mushroom Samba

Best show of my life. And I've been to several Dream Theater concerts. ;-)

Also, my splatter blue copy of In Absentia on vinyl is my pride and joy. PT is extremely dark overall. Just totally different kinds of music. Ditto If you are going to introduce someone to anime, use this one. Not really the largest discography, though... Same.  Keanu seems like a great guy, but I'd rather have someone who can actually act. Samurai Champloo

Akira

Anything made by Miyazaki, but especially Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind

Wolf's Rain

Puella Magi Madoka (hang in until at least episode 3, it's not what you think)

If you want something that doesn't take itself seriously, check out Space Dandy, or the risque but hilarious Panty and Stocking feat. Garterbelt. The first band was Led Zeppelin and then the Beatles. I got the hook and started to download so many discographies afterwards [Explosions in the Sky - The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdhdnrR3DmA9uSYVuYzGMFVfuIpGM_W69). The entire album is impossibly beautiful. 

Edit: fixed link I fear I'm not as well versed on this as I should be, but I think it's because chorus just became so synonymous with the hook in hip hop that they became one and the same. I should also probably point out that not every hip-hop hook is melodic. Many are just purely speaking/rapping.  Phil Collins. In my defense, I was 8 and it was 1990.

Also, [I've got two ears and a heart, don't I?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7aQ1qkCITU) This was a pretty good article but the title is click bait bullshit. People need to cut out the Nickelback hate. They aren't good but they aren't any worse than most pop musicians. For anyone who hasn't heard any of its music, let me get you started with [one of my favorites](http://youtu.be/nmuoRPTnb-4) One Piece is absolutely Duncan, that longevity.

Have you read the AoT manga? I think once they adapt the whole thing to the anime people's negative opinions will shift, character development has been getting better as the manga goes on From the 80's, probably Drowning Man (War), A Sort of Homecoming (The Unforgettable Fire), Disappearing Act (The Unforgettable Fire Super Deluxe Edition), In God's Country (The Joshua Tree), Heartland (Rattle and Hum). 

From the 90's: Ultraviolet (Achtung Baby), So Cruel (Achtung Baby), Acrobat (Achtung Baby), Your Blue Room (Passengers/Original Soundtracks Volume 1), Holy Joe (Garage Mix - Discotheque B-side).

Those are not very obscure; U2 fans will know them. But they are easy to find, and they're just great, great songs. I heart the nineties
 The whole catalyst of the anime is a really shitty television which distorts an image and causes some confusion amongst the characters. Really? You've mastered casual interplanetary flight, but your televisions are shit? Fuck off. This article was way too short. Can't you at least say why he got into a fight?  weezer! I first listened to their songs back in 1998 and saw them live for the first time few days ago. It. was. awesome. yeah i guess thats why that's the only one that comes to mind, i could afford it. If it counts for anything I have bought all their albums including Alex's solo album all at least twice. Funny, I just posted this song on my Elvis site just before I came onto reddit tonight. &gt; https://www.facebook.com/TheOtherElvisCostello
 This is really powerful stuff, I love explosions in the sky. Whoa, that has to be the most low-energy crowd I've seen for the performance of that song. Circa Survive- All Your Friends are Gone

Evanescence- Hello

The Antlers- Epilogue

Neutral Milk Hotel- Two Headed Boy part 2

Paramore- All I Wanted

Johnny Cash- You Are My Sunshine

Rise Against- Hero of War

May add more as they come to me. Ab-Soul ft. Kendrick Lamar - Turn Me Up.

The line is "Revelations say we either fry or fly, and it's hard to find God when you ain't ever seen him"

I love Ab-Soul. He always has great wordplay/lyricism in his songs. I'm not saying it doesn't correlate, it's just confusing to the ears after listening to nujabes all episode. I got really into Dream Theater as a young teen, now I can barely stand them. I download the discographies of almost every band I enjoy to some extent, because it's so easy to do so and I like to explore a band's music. Rush.  My dad had pretty much albums all of their albums they had out at the time on CD, so they were very easily accessible.  They are the sole reason I am into music today. Try

Modest mouse- Little motel
Radical Face- family portrait 

I know a lot of others but they aren't coming to mind ha Rage against the machine. Bought all CDs and will buy any new ones they release (here's hoping) also australian band hill top hoods.awesome Aussie hip hop band. Isn't that how it is for all kinds of art whether music, painting, or other? Impressionism, realism, romantic, etc. No one calls it that at the time, but it's all classified later on.  Silverstein [Zip Zop Bididy Bop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLwjDigdM6k)
 I love this series and I love the seat belts (the band behind the tracks. Fun fact: Chris Potter was also on the recordings. 

I have to point out though, that this isn't bebop and even the other tracks that have full big bad are really more fit to the hard bop era. A classic (one of many) example of bebop would be Charlie Parker.  Who would even think of that combo  Steve Blum outdid himself with that role. I've heard him in dozens and dozens of various anime, western animation, and games since first hearing it in cowboy bebop, but you can tell he really poured his heart into Spike Spiegel's character and nailed it. All of the cast did, really. Just a superb dub. From Abdul Hakim to the crazy space otter lady, from Roco Bonnaro and  his sister to the insane clown dude who hardly spoke- everyone was awesome. Tried to find a comment about Weeping Harp... found none. Makes me sad. Y'all muthafuckas can dig my potato. Damn, I'm starting to tear up. This and Samurai Champloo were just incredible. Fuck it, I'm gonna rewatch it. Screw midterms.  Strangely, the only anime-ish thing that has came close to me in terms of Cowboy Bebop feels, is Persona 4. Holy hell that game sticks with you. The anime... eeeeeeeh not so much. No rain - blind melon These god damn onions. Such an awesome anime. I know it's called Cowboy Bebop, but this has almost nothing to do with bebop.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09BB1pci8_o) is the first thing that comes up when you just search for bebop, and it's spot on.

This is really just pop, or really light, rocky funk. Kanye West is definitely heavier than Black Sabbath.

I'm glad someone is making music about it because I'm terrified of it. Oh, of course. I agree, completely. I'm not opposed to synth. I just don't really like the direction they took with the album. Indie hip-hop? HUH? Basically anything by Pinback  Nah man, the dub is better. The actress voicing Faye is completely wrong in the Japanese. Far to high pitched for the femme fatale character.

[See this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOy3AuB5PtI). AFAIK, this mostly applies to her background soundtrack songs, and not to her OP or ED themes. I wanna be the very best. Take this job and shove it! I ain't working here no more, my woman's done left and took all the reasons, I been working for!        Johnny Paycheck.  Don't want to ruin your image of her, but she's been accused of [plagarizing a lot of her background soundtrack work.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yupIJUbFNFg) SYL has to be one of my favourite bands on the planet. Rock on m8 i get that if people want to use them on shirts, or on other products she will be paid for it. but she also pulled that crap with spotify Just got the box set in the mail for old times sake... i duno, maybe its cause im prof. oak Honestly? I'm on listen number 3 now, and I still can't form a cohesive opinion. There are moments on the album--the chorus of "Make You Better" and all of "12/17/12"--where the lyrical honesty and raw self-reflection are truly unparalleled in their catalog. Their pop songwriting has never been better, and where their lyrical whimsy has been reigned in, they've demonstrated a new openness to experimenting with highly thematic instrumentation (the disco strings on "Cavalry Captain" come immediately to mind).

That said, I just can't fall in love with this album like I have their previous few. The things they stripped away for The King is Dead--the thesaurus porn, the whimsicality, the self-indulgent prog-bordering-on-metal-envy bent--those were the things that DEFINED the Decemberists for me. Don't get me wrong, The King is Dead is a brilliant folk rock record, but it was the contrast with their previous catalog and the freshness (and even rawness) with which they approached it that made it so great. 

This follow-up lacks the whimsy and excess of the early Decemberists, and lacks the surprise and unburdened earnestness of The King is Dead. Honestly? It just sounds...bored. Rote. Over-rehearsed, perhaps. I am glad they continue to experiment and continue to forge their own path regardless of expectations (the opening track drives that point home). 

But what's a band to do when the formula they've already perfected is perhaps what they're best at? Fair To Midland have some of the most amazing lyrics.  The singers vocals are also very unique.

My favorite is [Walls of Jericho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhFJvIZfB_s).  "String up your harp, play like today will last 5 minutes.  This wont take long, sing us a song that stops the silence.  Another tomorrow, shedding the shade we made yesterday.  Disguised as the lightning, dissolving all of the thunder, then.  Appeasing our monsters under the acrylic skies. 
Another tomorrow, Another tomorrow" He called feminists terrorists, and said women were like children. Nothing More - [God Went North](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0D9GePXQWA) [Rock]

About the singers struggle to accept the loss of his mother to cancer, causing his own faith to falter.  Near the end you can really grasp his pain and emotion. Undersea is such a magical EP. Every time I listen to it I go on an underwater adventure. Each of their albums seem to evoke different emotions but at the end its always soothing.  Greatest show opening of all time. Any genre, any era. Period. I like the orb, or some Pink Floyd, Brian Eno, anything ambient.  For me, it's all about tempo.  The beat has to be really slow or non-existent.  There's a lot of good down-tempo and chill stuff that actually has a faster tempo, this won't work.  Check out /r/chilledout and /r/psybient (I hope there's more).  Not everything on these will fit the bill but if you find something that works, explore more by the same artist and other artists on the label.  That's usually a good way to find music on your own.  I don't see how you can say that The Mars Volta didn't measure up to this. It's your opinion I know but holy shit the artistic value and musical skill that differentiates these bands is monumental. I don't know what your take was to listening to tMV's material was but you really need to listen to their albums through not individually as songs. NOTHING MORE.  They got a #1 billboard rock single in 2014 for "This is the Time", and they are killing it on their live tours.  They are rising up very fast and, I hope, will pave the way to a bright future for hard rock.

EDIT: They arent really a Classic Rock feel though, sorry I'm bad at reading &gt;_&lt;  Look up Airbourne, they are pretty sweet, hair metal 80's feel, but a new group. I just watched the Bebop movie last week. Love Cowboy Bebop series!

Whatever you call it, it's absolutely great. Relationship of Command is a mindblowing album, and personally much better than most of the Mars Volta stuff I've listened to. [I'll Be Ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78pH07RFqmY) - Nothing More [Rock] No, there's some pretty great ones recently. Death Note is amazing, and so is Darker Than Black. A lot of people like Attack on Titan, but personally, I don't find it that amazing. Code Geass (at least the first season) is also really good. Gorillaz did it for me. I still remember humming Rock the House when I walked home from school and getting chills when I first heard Dare at the library. They helped me forget about things that were going on at the time and the smile I would make when listening to them made it seemed like everything was okay.

I love my slayer! Not it but I do like this one. I couldnt pull up shazam because I was driving.  Bebop? Not even close, go listen to some Cannonball.  Sounds really cool! I'll give it a listen! Thank you! 311!!! Man, do you remember them eating all those eggs to cover up the void in their lives? Shit. I still get choked up... I've actually heard this but never looked into the lyrics the whole song is pretty deep. Thank you 432 hz I shit you not, I have had this song stuck in my head for the last three days, entirely unprompted. Weird shit.

For a metal band they keep the thesaurus handy! First discography I downloaded? Probably King Diamond. 
Fun fact: King and I share the same birthday. Also Donald Trump Did you maybe forget to have a heart and sympathize with the characters?

Spike is an exile/fugitive from his entire past. He wants to run from it because he knows what will happen if he goes back, and wants to run to it so he can finish what he started and maybe get a shot at a future. He doesn't let anyone know his inner turmoil because he just doesn't want to feel it, and Jet can only guess at it, despite being his trusted companion. 

Jet is pretty open about his shit to the audience. Spike knows somewhat about Jets past, but doesn't harass him much about it, because he more or less trusts Jet to do what needs to be done.

Faye is just a pain in the ass, but she almost has a reason to be. Out of time, out of place, out of pocket. She has had to grow into a survivor almost overnight to survive in this universe. She takes whatever she can and doesn't trust anyone, because how could she after some of the shit shes been through? Despite her jerking the Bebop crew around, she finds out too late that they are perhaps the only people she could call family left, but they've already begun to fall apart at the seams, Spike heading off to his destiny, Ed finally deciding to come back to reality and live with her father, and    Ein going with. Jet "stays" because he has nothing out there. He has finished with his job, his past has been resolved. He has nothing left but the Bebop. Faye has nothing, past or future. She doesnt know where shes going and the only people that can help her are just... done. They've pretty much given up, just like the bounty hunter tv show.

I dunno. There were just a bunch of aspects to it that I cant quite put my finger on. I have to head off now, so I dont have time to refine it yet.

His twitter, before he deleted it because of the flak that he got, claimed that feminism was terrorism. The song "Transatlanticism" by Death cab for cutie on repeat.  Or just anything by Explosions in the Sky Best line: "It's so erotic when your make up runs"  Radio stations often have a website with a playlist I'll always recommend this band whenever Cowboy Bebop is mentioned: Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band. They're seen as cheesy by the jazz community, but it doesn't make their music any less fun to listen to. Sing, Sang, Sung (somewhat of a parody of Benny Goodman's classic song Sing, Sing, Sing) and There's the Rub, both off of the album "Swingin' for the Fences" are good places to get started. Their whole discography is great, but this album is where I personally began listening.  Samurai Champloo, dude.  Dang you stole my song, I was gonna recommend Hero of War! This was way too far down ITT

This was the song that got me listening to all the others I listen to Piano music. Mainly Chopin, Debussy, or Mozart's sonatas. Unfortunately, based on my experiences with insomnia, music doesn't help much. Try exercising more during the day or taking a sleep-promoting drug like melatonin or valerian root. If that doesn't work you may have to resort to Ambien or another pharmaceutical grade sedative. Cannibal Corpse.  PoolShark - Sublime

(Brad Newell died of heroin)
 Never heard of Isaac Hayes, white girl born in '91, and thoroughly enjoyed this, thanks for the post Rise Against's lyrics in general are just great. The Good Left Undone is beautiful too. I wish I could believe you, but you're arguing a point that's impossible to prove, so this isn't going to go anywhere. Agree to disagree? The Black Cards. '09 me loved falloutboy and figured this couldn't be bad. Tenors get much more attention in the jazz world. Meh, once he deleted it, the record was gone, even retweets. Some replies are still there if you want some context. *He said son.. Have you seen the world?* We've got a show at Green street on the 28th of February if you're interested. We should get some presale tickets soon.  I tried that and I couldn't find a title to a song that I felt fit what I got from it. This was yesterday and I don't remember what time. Why should we get it free? It belongs to people. They made it. Or produced it. Or whatever. 

Just because it exists, doesn't mean we are entitled to it. Great song! When she starts singing something just clicks.  Need tears? Let me suggest: [Gary Jules' cover of Mad World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3N1MlvVc4) 
or perhaps: [All my friends - LCD soundsytem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXp1TQPf2pY) the only techno song that has ever made me cry.  Ha! That's most unexpected. I like it. James Blunt- Tears and rain
Matt Nathanson- Run
Ross Copperman- Holding on and letting go, They'll never know
Ed Sheeran- Autumn Leaves behind the screams - cky

breathe - pink floyd

beethoven and mozart  "Green Bird" you mean. It's not really music, but when I went through a rough patch and couldn't get to sleep, I listened to an audiobook of the Hobbit. The dude reading it had the most magical voice. That, coupled with the ethereal music and sound effects would send me to sleep without fail. Took me about 3 months of listening nightly to get through the entire audiobook. Only thing is that now, if I read the paper version, I read it in this guys voice, sound effects and music included (not necessarily a bad thing though!) "Treat her better boy. If having her by your side is something you enjoy. If having her in your life is really so important to you now" -Mac DeMarco

A song about "treating your girlfriend like shit" as he says. Yeah definitely my favorite band, wish they would come to my city though :( It's definitely underrated  in Japan.  No prob! I first heard the intro to this song on *The Interview* the other night. As /u/AstorSapolsky said, sludge metal is probably a better genre description.  I used this song as an example for an anti-war song and she was mad when I told her that it had swear words in it, until I made her listen to it.

Also, while we're opening and closing things, your mind looks like a triggered bear trap from a couple comments-if that says anything.

Now then, as a known musician (moderately successful), director, editor, composer, painter, animator and writer, I find that letting people enjoy my work for free is much more satisfying. 

Come to think of it, I should make a list of all my work. Then, since you're adamant, you can send me money all you want-after all, you've certainly seen my work, seeing that your internet is functioning.

'produced it'.  Do you know what a producer actually does?

This art/'pay me for it' paradigm is sickening. I suppose you believe that Michael Jackson was the only person entitled to listening to the Beatles for free since he 'bought the rights'?

Entitled is a strong word, Mr/Mrs. Lemon Demon. I think I'll quote your most insightful part of this discussion now...

"Or whatever" [Well, good thing the Internet Archive keeps a copy of everything](https://archive.today/DdaFC)

"This is going to sound nasty, but Ive always found that the more I treat a woman like a child, the stronger the relationship, the better the sex and the more often it happens. The more I treat her like an equal, the more she digs her claws in to manipulate and play games with me. I know that sounds misogynistic, but I swear to God its an honest observation."


 Somebody I Used to Know blew me away also because I felt that, as a pop song, it was drastically different and even somewhat complex.

You remind me I tried listening to some of the songs by Kimbra -the lady who sings with Gotye in that- after hearing a lot of praise, but sadly I found nothing that interested me. :( Her voice is great but her music not so much, IMO. It's a great song.  ACH-TUNG

Yeah definitely one of my favorites  If you discount everything that happened since about 1997 (i.e., since they stopped actually being The Smashing Pumpkins), then it's hard to find a bad song. Fuck no.  this is messed up. [Elizabeth, You Were Born To Play That Part - Ryan Adams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNM0G8vvOTk)

He wrote this song for a friend that lost her baby just before the due date. The lyrics can apply to all sorts of things, and it absolutely tears me apart. I don't like music because I just sing along. I have a great free app for my phone called relaxing melodies. It has like 20 different sounds you can pick and choose up to like 8 at a time I think. It plays all night long uninterrupted and still allows your alarm to go off in the morning. You fucking serious? I feel that every dub ever is done by Johnny Yong Bosch and that guy who voiced the english Alucard. In Japan voice acting is a huge industry and there are a lot of people whom to choose from. Tycho is a very good mellow ambient beat artist.
The Past is Prologue album is sure to help you with you insomnia, I used to play it for myself on nights I had trouble sleeping. That alto solo, right? Yow!  
Do you have the movie soundtrack? It's like yoko's White Album (as I mentioned in another thread). Also, Space Bio Charge is an astonishing compilation. She's like the Gershwin of j-pop! If you fall asleep listening to Cannibal Corpse, you'll either have the best or most disturbing dreams of your life. Maybe both at the same time. There's one thing I always loved about cowboy bebop that I would some day like to implament in my own creations, and that is the concept that everything, literally EVERYTHING is seated in the universe, including the music.

Whenever I watch the show, I imagine that the songs that play in the background are songs they could have easily been listening to that morning.  Just everything, the pseudo, near future, space cowboy vibe.  The idea that everything is the same as it is now, just in space.

It isn't science fantasy, it's real science fiction, and I don't see it done well most times.  But this nailed it, because it was not so much about a cohesive plot, as it was about 4 people, living their lives, even if their lives were extreme.  They weren't heros, they were just people, just like the people the hunted, just like the people they met.

It's a humbling show, and everyone should see it at some point in their lives.  Not because it's a good anime.  Because it's a beautiful masterpiece. listening to the entire said album, never gets old and sounds just as fresh as it did the first time i heard it many moons ago in 1989, not my favorite Cure album by any means as that would be Faith but close, maybe number three i reckon Podcasts always work really well for me.

[Astronomycast](http://www.astronomycast.com/) is particularly good. Both of the hosts have very soothing voices and you can learn about astronomy while you're lying in bed. The Strokes The song off "The Joshua Tree"...  
Gotta be "With Or Without You". Paranoia agent! Great overlooked show! I miss satoshi kon terribly. Sniff. Hopefully justice is served. The guy is a piece of work who's gotten away with a lot of shit for a long time  Best character in the show. :\^) Dude I know a blog with a bunch of bootlegs on it if you want.  Do you consider Meds one of the good albums or bad?

Meds is my favorite. Scrapped Princess. Stupid title, but my favorite series. Quite provocative, deep subtext. There is nothing that I hate more than a man's voice that is clearly a woman's voice and vice versa. Anything by Lights &amp; Motion. I would recommend "Northern Lights" god i wish i had been that soccer ball John Cage - 4'33'' Dat bridge on dat Bird solo. Dem chord subs tho. That's also fantastic music to wake up to. [Green Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJjnbhSTuqQ)

[Words that we couldn't say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdHHIVMJ_VQ)

[Adieu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws8X31TTB5E)

[Flying Teapot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKL88_jLYgM)

These songs want to make me cry just listening to them, even without thinking of the show.

I'll admit, I've sat in my room and stared at the ceiling contemplating my life with green bird playing on repeat

sometimes the right music can make a difference in your own life.  Cowboy Bebop has definitely given me plenty of that.

edit: and [Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03qBqP2I4p8)

I would only want this played at my funeral, if I deserved it.  I'll be honest, I strive to earn it. Kissanime is better, no intrusive ads or time limits. But the best way is to buy them legally of course. This is a fantastic song and all, from a monumental record as well, but anyone who likes this should also check out their first album Acrobatic Tenement if they haven't already. I think it's one of the most(if not the most) underrated albums I've ever listened to.  Have you checked out Grave of Fireflies? 



Or did you strictly mean tv show anime?  I have to put that on repeat if I'm going to fall asleep to it. One listen is never enough. at this point, any dreams would be great. I'll give it a try
 Shoegaze music Probably Tool. I had heard various things about them, both incredibly praiseworthy and incredibly derogatory, but I finally found a copy at Aenima available at a nearby CD dealer.

I'd basically call them a more toned down version of King Crimson, but they definitely surpassed my expectations. Now I'll have to check out Lateralus... I've always thought it was an octave pedal, made me go out and get one Fishbone THE REEEEEALL FOOOOOOOLLK BLUUUUUUUEEEEES! Ah, everytiem. Sufjan Stevens is probably pretty good for this. Wow this is amazing. Can anyone link me to great Japanese music like this. With all real instruments, emotions and groove?

 David Bowie Oh wow I can't see a SINGLE way that this is copyright infringement!

/s I've never heard this racist ass-munch perform. Is he worth a second thought? Something to do with mixing major and minor intervals I think. cowboy bebop is the name of the show, not the song. That progression is quite common in classical music.  i hope the op isn't referring to The Cure as bad punk rock...if that's the case you probably don't deserve to listen to them anyway (and most likely didn't as much as you think), if not, then carry on
 he's not racist, but yeah he has the best live show i've ever seen.

 [Danny Elfman's Music for a Darkened Theater. Trust me on this. I have the same sleeping problems you have and this helps.](http://www.amazon.com/Music-Darkened-Theatre-Film-T-V/dp/B000002OEB)
 I know that; but OP listed the genre as bebop.  Which it is not. Just like Heaven would prolly have been a better Cure choice but that's just me What phrase? Once again, I'll disagree; I actually love the characters in Bebop and I feel like you fail to recall a ton of the depth they achieve over the course of their show. I find it really interesting to see how each seems like an archetype early on and then exposition into their pasts both reveals more as to why they're like that, and more behind what goes on in their head. Faye, for example, walks out of the show a far different character than when she walked in. 

The characters in Bebop are actually near universally acclaimed...they are ridiculously fun to watch, and then achieve tremendous depth over the show. And I don't know if the two side characters in the movie are that interesting. The villain, maybe, but the woman whose name escapes me? I wouldn't say either was nearly as enjoyable to watch or interesting to learn about any of the three main crew members (Spike, Jet, Faye). But like I said, to each his own. I've fallen asleep listening to They Might Be Giants - John Henry more times than I can count. GOD thank you. I've forgotten how much I loved Piano Black. I've tried to find other songs like it, to no avail. :( Nope, haven't seen that yet. I just meant anime tv shows. My anime-seen list:

Cowboy Bebop
Samurai Champloo
Natuto (stopped at beginning of shippuden) Awesome. Hope was known for being bitchy during Mazzy shows in the 90s.  My favorite story is where a fan yells "I love you, Hope" and she responds with "If you love me, you'll shut the fuck up."  ;)  I have other bootlegs where she's cursing out the audience for being noisy and rowdy too.  When I saw her during her solo days, she was nice. It's unfair to try to compare them; they're completely different genres and try to evoke completely different feels. That being said, I will admit that SC deserves a top tier spot just as Bebop does. That really depends on how tired you are .your mind can make any song a bedtime song depending on the mood Bad Religion's [News From The Front.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZNqKgcmtic)
"Ignorance is the root of fear
And fear is the kindling of anger
War is the bringer of shame
But never has the burden lain so heavily upon the victim" this is fucking beautiful. Thanks! :) The Cure - Disintegration I was straight up obsessed with Boards of Canada when I was first getting into music. I listened to Geogaddi religiously.

Don't like them nearly as much as I used to, but I still think their music is enjoyable. Especially when you were raised by a single parent and then she dies in a way that can easily let you place the blame on yourself. I can't imagine.  Anyone know if there's any fake book style sheet music books for cowboy bebop music? Funny, I often listen to their *Pornography* album when going to bed. Obviously you're a die-hard Kanye West fan. I guess it's not racist to hate White people.
 what do you mean by "what phrase" "Time has told me not to ask for more,

Never listened to them since.  It's kind of hard to find tall lanky actors. i basically do that with every band i like. I remember the last day of school in 8th grade hearing dumpweed by blink-182 and imediately downloading their entire discography. I spent that entire summer before high school devouring blink182 and discovering other bands like New Found Glory, Sum 41, etc which basically set up my entire musical life the first two years of high school... Also when i read Butch Walkers book as a casual fan i immediately downloaded every solo album of his and even tracked down out of print rare cds of his old bands. spending even $100 for one.

- $=Love by That Handsome Devil Bizarre on the last verse delivers one of the funniest verses in hip hop #BITCH #IM #FORREAL I love this show more than life itself and I love some of the bebop tracks on it but this song isn't bebop music, it's a pop ballad.  Primus and Frank Zappa. Purchasing Zappa's back catalogue is kinda challenging. Shame - The Smashing Pumpkins

Street Spirit (Fade Out) - Radiohead

Unravel - Bjork

Atmosphere - Joy Division touche You stupid fuckers. Enya. Saying Enya in my book is a good thing. I know the old joke is that her music puts you to sleep but I like her music. It's very calming and relaxing. This is coming from a metal head.

Edit: also the song Asleep by Emily Browning. I can agree with ya there on the Pumpkins! [Waltz for Zizi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbip5oZVL94) 

Everything has a beginning and an end. Life is just a cycle of starts and stops. There are ends we don't desire, but they're inevitable, we have to face them. It's what being human is all about.
 I usually put on Hammock or some other type of post rock Fucked With a Knife sends me to dream land every time. I would actually liken it to afro-beat music ALA Fela Kuti NEW MUSIC 2015 First ELO song I ever heard when it was on the radio. I was working on a car with my dad in the garage. Big fan of ELO and Lynne since! Definitely Faith No More, but I'd be surprised if you hadn't already checked them out. Don't you ever leave me baby. Really? Styx and Billy Squier when I was 15 in 1986...then everything almost
if I like a band enough to listen to the whole album...I'll get their other ones.

 Oh god, the bells on Blue make me cry every time. Metallica Definitely the Offspring. First time I heard them was "Why Don't You Get a Job?" before I went into 6th grade from an older brother back in 2001. I then heard "The Kids Aren't Alright", and I was hooked. I can remember buying Smash, Americana, and Conspiracy of One CDs, as well as downloading their earlier stuff. One of my favorite bands for a while. 

I then got obsessed with Blink 182 and Green Day and later on into what I guess people might consider more mature like Radiohead and Pearl Jam, but I always remember the Offspring as my first taste of real rock music. 

Sadly, I've never had a chance to go to an Offspring concert and I feel like the window of opportunity to go see them is closing as they get older, but it is always fun to hear them on the radio from time to time.  Love 21P  My go-to has always been Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon, but for the past few years I've found NPR's late night broadcast of BBC news very relaxing when it's just barely loud enough to hear.

Cause if they don't, I'll be there.  Eh, I'm torn on Baccano! On one hand, I appreciate that they tried to go for the regional time-appropriate dialect, but on the other hand, a lot of the accents were of the quality you might here at a local amateur improv show. It just ended up being distracting to me. Eventually I got over it and stopped noticing it, but every once in a while I would come to a line that made me wonder what the voice actor was thinking.

2) Good Riddance (i know i know, its so overplayed.  But its a masterpiece.)

1) Basket Case

Edit:  Just went on a Greenday binge and remembered i really do like Jesus of Suburbia. Love how it changes all the time, sort of like Band on the Run (Wings).  Its in the mix for my top 5 GD songs for sure. Basketcase started it for me. That dude is seriously one of my heroes.

Seeing them in Helsinki, Finland. and when 'Blue' from the OST kicks in with the latin choir I liked the English cover version by Sapphire much more (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYUk-ISUTcI). Listening to West Coast got me very interested in Ultraviolence. I wasn't dissapointed. Last time I saw them was in 2010 or 2011. They were good then, but in 08 and 09 they were on fire. Shame I never saw them in the Iowa or S/T era. Stars of the Lid and Tim Hecker That was excellent, thank you. Pearl Jam - Comeback (live)/Tribute to the 9 that died at their show 10 years prior. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2QPX_DB8Vk Except for the other work of Watanabe. Samurai Champloo is the most obvious example, but everything else from Kids on the Slope to Zankyou No Terror shows the same obsessive attention to detail that makes Bebop sound so great.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMusic) if you have any questions or concerns.* I know it's not cool to list a really popular song as the band's best, but it's still got to be Basket Case. I love the music in this show, but I ruined the intro, [Tank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6jCJZEFIto), by using it as an alarm clock tone for a year or so. Now every time I hear that staccato intro start my heart jumps. I did the same thing to some Gang Starr song with loud horns, too. edit: it was [Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSszWXkDHa8). I think objectively it has to be Jesus of suburbia. It's their rock ballet, tells a story and has so many amazing changes and each section has a different feeling and emotion than the previous. netflix --&gt; add to queue --&gt; everything you just mentioned (including Champloo, even though I've seen it like 4x, it never gets old) LOL stupid spammers.  You fuckers truly are the bottom of the barrel. I think the intro riff to Girl's Not Grey is still really original, but other than that song I never listened to AFI. Anyone knows where in the Anime the drums from Fantaisie Sign (http://youtu.be/00vDy2lAwC8?t=48s) is used too? I remember hearing them somewhere in a different not so relaxing song. I agree. Even though it is super popular, it's probably popular for a reason.  That's what I was thinking as well. It's their Bohemian Rhapsody.  And fuck, Toys in the Attic... they were able to play with some different genre conventions pretty effectively in those one-off episodes. I think this is a story about a dead mother trying to reach out to her child who lives in a terrible world, telling him it's time to join him. Not a very happy story I think. lol thats exactly what it is, and much better in my opinion. Or at least not overplayed. Yep I-V-vi-IV [This video explains that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I).

Now if you really want to make that work, you can also do the minor key version: vi-IV-I-V.

Or if you really really want to make it work you imply it, but you never state it. Technically cuz cedric screams and sings. I never bought into that notion but I can see why people think of them that way they have other songs! i feel like people only listen to this one Was playing a good deal of recitals and stuff in my early teen years but got lazy and preferred to play the vidya since I was a lazy lardass back then.

Good lord, that bass player is doing work in that clip. The Black Dahlia Murder- "Climactic Degradation"
I know it's only supposed to be a lyric, but this song is so brutal I couldn't pick just a line lol

"Devastate leave them weeping in your wake,
a family's broken dreams with
gloved hand I separate,
mutilate them, carve them up, 
bring them to their knees,
the powers of a knife at hand,
If it breathes it fucking bleeds, 
mankind end time, disgusted with this race I pluck them from the universe pawns in my favorite game,
Cut them all down completely randomized, never a clue nor a trace is left,
identity disguised, 
I measure joy in suffering, with a rope and
blade I maim, 
humiliate these fallen souls, this earth of sick disgrace
climactic degradation, 
rapture in blood achieved,
Suffocate them, rip them, rape them,make them fucking scream
orgasmic mutilation, on terror I do feed,
annihilate this bastard race,
I'll make them bleed for me
I'm taking you down with me,
into this hell of hells,
Stabbed in the throat,
sputtering blood, my need is never quelled, you must stand here before me, my judgement ends in death,
I stand above your broken bodies face speckled in red,
How sweet it is to revel in your flesh, I won't stop until the last is dead." I REX DEZ NEWBZ! well at least you aint a karma whore This post has been removed. Self-posts should not consist of only a link. Please repost this as a link post, or if it's self-post Friday, wait until tomorrow.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMusic) if you have any questions or concerns.* Man, I love Yoko Kanno. I really, really love her work. The Seatbelts' discography played no small part in exposing me to a variety of awesome genres that continue to influence me today.

*However*, to say that Kanno borrows from other musicians is to put it very lightly. She straight up lifts very distinct parts from other recordings. Her original work is excellent, but a significant amount of her output is copied from existing pieces. A week or two ago I was in Whole Foods when I randomly heard [Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3yCcXgbKrE) 

It might not have the same effect on you, but this absolutely brought me to tears, perhaps because the song gave me an existential moment where I reflected on no matter how bad I might perceive things, there is still this beautiful Earth around me with people that do care for me. It really put things into perspective.

Runner Up: [Tom Waits - "Picture in a Frame"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwxD8quPCg). I read in the YouTube comments of all places that a teenager remembered this song because their father sang it to them when they were tucked in as a young child. That just did it for me. I plan on singing the same song to my future children.  Glad I saw them twice on their last ever tour. They are insane live. Panic at the Disco! 

I downloaded their full discography two years ago and even got as far as buying a cd. It's still the only cd I every bought till this day. I sill like to listen their music. The new album is fantastic too. Washed Out Prog not so much.  If I'm having a hard time sleeping I put Dive on. This is one of the strongest openings to an album by far! It's so aggressive and sudden, like someone's kicking your door open and daring you to hit them. This one website I used to visit recommended listening to Leviathan during workouts and I can see why. It's just pure testosterone.

I THINK THAT SOMEONE'S TRYING TO KILL MEEEEEEEEEEE!!!

[And then everything was butts.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp7CYvh8FwA) &gt; With the new "rehashed" episodes of Ghost in the Shell, they're throwing in bizarre product placement for Microsoft Surface Pads and completely reinventing the Major's story. It's disappointing.

I can't say anything about the product placement because i didn't notice it, but i guess it could of been there.

As for changing the majors story, it's pretty weak criticism when you look at the past iterations. The stand alone complex is on a different timeline than the movies. The movies are on a different timeline than the manga. Saying they're reiventing her story means nothing as with every adaptation they've done this. You shouldn't think of arise as a continuation or a retake of past adaptations, it's something else entirely.

I will admit though, the writing is not on the same level as the movies or SAC. I think this is why most people are upset about arise, along with the change in character design and voice actor. It is a strong departure from what people think of GiTS.

I personally don't think the writer is all that great. He can write an enjoyable story set in a cyberpunk setting, but i don't think he can write something unique that will stand out. He also wrote the second season of psycho pass which for the most part went no where and seemed to be a set up for the movie. Mardock Scramble is his original story which was something that i enjoyed watching, but wasn't really a memorable story. The only thing i remember from it was rape, tits, vagina hands and gay interspecies relationships between a boy and a dolphin. I don't think there was really any message it was trying to tell.

Anyways, that's just my two cents. I liked Arise and am looking forward to the movie, there's also a TV series airing the spring, but it remains to be seen if its a new story or just the OVA/Movies split up into a weekly format.

This song is the one that makes me suddenly go "Oh shit, THIS SONG" when the vocals come in. Every time.  UPDATE: Suge Knight intentionally drove over two men with a pickup truck and killed one. It was the result of an argument Knight had at the set of the NWA biopic. Jesus. Wow, I haven't heard this song in a very long time. Thanks for the reminder. When will they get cowboy bebop on Netflix though. Death Cab for Cutie. Viva La Gloria!, Jesus of Suburbia and When I Come Around Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Some musicians/artists want a new term to represent the stylistic departures from their predecessors and influences. Others don't care and just do what they do. There isn't much of an overarching plot, there's only like 5 episodes devoted to the "main story". The show isn't really about story but rather about it's characters. I guess you could say he had an attitude how so? Well I'm glad you agree. I just felt that was necessary to point out that I do in fact hate a person I've never met. This post has been removed.

And it has a soundtrack by the same composer as Cowboy Bebop, Yoko Kanno. Have you ever listened to Saron Gas? It's Seether before it was named Seether and it's pretty cool. Also you'll like The Exies and Smile Empty Soul.  I completely agree with this. It was all about Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, and Death Note back when I was still watching anime. I haven't really picked up anything like those ones since then...

 Foo Fighters. Favourite band to this day. I believe goldpikpik carrots (The guy who edits his videos for him) said he's done stuff like this before; loosing the plot and getting himself into a load of shit before doing a 180. I believe in a video that no longer exists he said he had a form of autism which meant that he did things and then regretted it later. Sadly I think it's not just that but teamed up with mental instability. He's very opinionated at the best of times :/ I wasn't sure if it would region block as it does sometimes depending on your country  
EDIT: Realised it wasn't a VEVO video which sometimes does that. Ok, The Exies gave me goosebumps so I would say "Yes!"^10. 

Saron Gas isn't available on spotify so it's a no-go for me.

As for Smile Empty Soul I already knew them but I'm not exactly fond of the guy's voice.

This song would play everywhere on the site for the next few days.  I think Firefly and Serenity were some of those where everything that should have gone wrong didnt, and everything that could go right went great. For some reason that cast just meshed so well and I actually felt a little homesick when I finished firefly. Was weird. Was such a comfortable satisfying show. [the music heard in the game...is a variation on the same melody... The castle theme is a symphonic variation of the melody in F minor, then C minor, giving the song an overall ominous tone.
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World#Music)

The melody is the familiar part of the song, repeated over and over. If you listen closely you can hear it in most of the levels. Taking the familiar tune and twisting it leaves you more off-guard than if a completely different song was used. When the song starts out, it's lower and about half speed, each iteration taking about 20 seconds. By the time it reaches the second part, which you linked, it has sped up a bit where one iteration takes 5 seconds, and changed key.
Compare both parts to the [overworld theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH8mQRXemuo) which takes about 10 seconds.

[There are other keys which could be used to distort and change the mood of a song, too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYBm7KFTzz8)

 Wait I'm watching right now. I usually enjoy the subs much more than the dubs. Are you saying the dub is better? Obviously this is your personal preference but can you give me a bit of insight as to why that is? I can't listen to this song. There's only so many feels I can feel.

It's still a damn shame Omar and Cedric broke up the band at their height. Would have loved for post-hardcore to become mainstream during that time.  Spiritualized - Won't Get to Heaven (the state I'm in) 

And pretty much anything else off their Let It Come Down LP. It's one of the most achingly beautiful records. Beautiful activity Holy 1998 Batman You could go even deeper with it's relations to music.

The show had a Chorus, aka Spikes story that showed up every few episodes

Episode:5,12 / 13,(25 / 26)

The Chorus is generally in the beginning/middle/end of a song in which Vicious only really seen near the beginning/middle/ and at the end. 25/26 are part of the chorus but they're also more importantly something else.

I did forget one episode about the syndicate which is another important part

Intro

Episode 1

We get the start of the song, in no words do they really explain his back story but show it off a bit setting the mood of the series/song.

Pre-Chorus

Episode 4, 11 , 24

Pre-Chorus is supposed to build up the Chorus and let's be honest these episodes are pretty action intense as the Chorus, with the eco-terrorist, the alien like episode, and the last episode before 25/26 ending, with Ed leaving and the other while being not as action packed, in your gut you could tell something was going to happen in the next few episodes, and boy did it build up the action for the two last episodes.

Bridge

Episode 6 , 14

The bridge, in a song is designed to get rid of the repetition of of the general episodes and these two episodes generally changes the pace with 6 being about a target who would be unlike any they've challenged so farm someone who looked like a kid, and 14 being something more goofy of a hacker both where in a change of tone from the episodes before as it was a change from the main story.

Conclusion and Collision

Episode: 25 , 26

The conclusion of a song is a way to finish the song. Generally with a fade which would be the best way to examine this with the ending going to a fade not telling us all that happened, but it's also a collision is where different sections of the song overlap, and they overlap all the chorus together

25/26: Spike finds his love/ loses his love/ fights Vicious / Spike fades out (dies/unconscious)

5: Spike fights viscious

12/13: Gren finds his friend/ loses his friend / fights Viscious / Gren Dies

Episodes 5/12/13/25/26 Generally have the same themes tied to each other but with the twist of it adding the final drama, the conclusion to it but all being about the same thing and feeling to them in a way.

Verse

Majority of the other episodes

The verse is made to support/refrain the chorus... and the verse help build up all the characters and help us understand them and the world around them, while if they where removed from the show the show would still make sense.


1 Intro, Explains the story

2 Data Dog, Adds a character who does assist but isn't generally part of the spike story

3 Faye Valentine, Beginning to introduce a part of the story (pre-chorus) that is important but merely explains the character but doesn't flesh it out

4 Eco Terrorist, The team work between the new characters we see work together (if Faye wasn't part of the team honestly the next episode wouldn't make sense)

5 Fallen Angel, Spike goes in to save and protect Faye, and fight Vicious (chorus)

6 Little boy, Changes up the story giving the crew a new enemy who seems unstoppable, and bringing them back to bounty hunting and not fighting with Spike's past

7-10 Pretty much bounties you could honestly remove from the story, 9 adds another supporting character who builds up the story but isn't part of the main story for the most part. (aka main story = spike's story)

11 Again another episode of team work, suspense when the crew actually faces a true threat that nearly wipes them out.

12/13 Fight Vicious/blah/blah/blah i explained this a lot already

14 Changes the repetition of the chorus with a more ed based episode, and going away from it's serious overtone so to say.

15-23 Again "filler" or the verse while they add to the character they don't add to spike's "story" or the chorus but support it

24 Again builds up the story, with spike having to deal with the main meaning of the song, loss and how we deal with it with ed and faye both leaving the crew of the bebop. This showed spike someone who hated kids,dogs and women on the ship in the end now misses those three exact things being with him. A foreshadowing of what to come

25/26 The final chorus, is the collision and conclusion of this song the chorus changes it up mixing what happened all these times and adds the tune of the final fight with vicious with the song ending with a fade to the great abyss.

But hey that's just what I think, I could just be a crazy old man! &gt; No, but I would if you said you liked Linkin Park.

But The Hunting Party was a decent record... Lateralus is drastically different. I hope you enjoy it as much as you enjoyed Aenima! For anyone who wants to know the intro vamp chords: F#m      A         Ebm7b5     D7 There should be a connection, although I rarely found "Progressive House" to live up to it's name, except when compared to regular house. 
Metallica, of course are rarely thought of as being progressive, although the mere fact of changing moods and styles found on some of their songs shows some influence
So the main thing is contantly shifting of feel, mood, key, time signature, whatever you like. Many songs finish in totally different places from where they started, other finish where they started but not after drifting around a lot. this was the song that started my love if this band. seeing them with opeth when this album came out is definitely a highlight. gotta say that the complete voyage 34 is probably my favorite Thanks! So in a sense it was what I thought, but the mood-shifting part seems very important so I'm glad I asked. &gt; he surround sound release of Reanimation was one of the best uses of the technology and blew my mind lol. 

Let's say I don't have a 5.1 setup. Which version is the best? Digitized vinyl? It's about tied with GITS for me. They are both equally amazing but both very different. I love when there are awesome shows like bebop and GITS that are similar but different but 100% bad ass. And I also believe yoko did a lot of the music for GITS movies and series' as well.  All good! My all time favourite is off the first album, "I'm fat but I dress nice, bitches finesse Mike, they suck the dick and squeeze my belly like bagpipes". I just went through several pages browsing by "new" and saw lots of prog, hip hop reggae, etc.

None of what you're talking about though. They are all so devastatingly intelligent. So many egomaniacs getting put to shame.  You should check it out.



I highly suggest watching it alone. Let's not forget that they have two rock operas. Homecoming is the second and IMO even better. Switches up more with a more emotional lyric. It's my personal favorite song. Homecoming. oh my god,oh man! Well, I **don't want** to make it work;  I want it to **stop**!  I'm sick of hearing that chord regression;  it's everywhere.

[Dead Can Dance - The Wind That Shakes The Barley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p2g2WuGXwE) Ahhh man I totally forgot about samurai champloo! Thank you for reminding me about that one. 

If you're looking for another good anime you may want to check out Dominion tank police. I was going to suggest a couple more but they have all seemed to slipped my mind at the moment. I'll come back with more if I remember.  Here's my one:    
http://open.spotify.com/user/mattyhaych/playlist/3rI4negPj3HqdtkQm05Pzn    
Just all the stuff I normally listen to.
  
 Totally forgot about this song till you brought it up. It's been awhile. Not really down with the "skinny panted" generation's take on covers, or most of their music, for that matter. Good music comes from pain, sacrifice, and a little drug addiction sometimes thrown in for good measure. Not from being on the Mickey Mouse Club, and coming of age with an entitled upbringing, and political correctness. Have yet to be impressed with anything coming out of this generation. Ok, the Black Keys, but that's about it. But I really do appreciate your input nevertheless.  I can imagine it's hard in a marching band set-up! But yeah, it is such a cool tune! Yeah arise really was a disappointment. I did enjoy it mostly because of the visuals, tech, and characters but the story was really lacking. Idk why they even bothered making it if they weren't going to write a proper story. The main writer/director from the original series and movies did not have anything to do with arise which explains why it is not very good. I forget the guys name but he was the main brains behind the real heart of the shows storyline. 

Oh yeah and the shameless Microsoft placement  was really sickening.  [London Grammar - Wasting My Young Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkeDBwsIaZw)

I think this one can be interpreted in a couple ways, generally to do with past regrets, current fears, and future hopes. Kind of gets me to put my life into perspective. Frankly it's not surprising! He's pretty popular in Japan, but aside from his work on the Cowboy Bebop soundtrack I don't think he's done anything that's really hit the Western world.

But I do stress how good he is whenever it's relevant!! Though it's completely different to anything on the CB soundtrack, I really dig his album "Assemble a Crew". This post has been removed.

That both animes share these two features probably has a lot to do with it.

Actually, I thought the FLCL japanese and english voice actors were surprisingly similar to each other. Earl Sweatshirt's Doris is probably one of the most atmospheric records I have listened to recently.  It's a good late night album to just relax and listen to.   Good Night - Kanye West

[A Man, Me, Then Jim by Rilo Kiley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwU6C2Z-ypw) I'm really sad now As Cities Burn : The Widow is definitely the first song I think of when it comes to music that could break someone down.  Super underrated band.  Bit more somber than their other songs on that album, but their later albums were a bit more like it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LUAr6CNcU4 Yeah! I never know how to describe it, so it is hard to find other stuff. =(

I would recommend Hiromi Uehara, some of her stuff sounds in a similar ballpark, her stuff with [Hiromi's Sonicbloom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkL6hwj91UM) kinda moreso, but I don't really like the guitarist she had with them. Her [Trio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR8HinFaQhk) stuff is slightly less Piano Black sounding, but i think I prefer it overall. At least every song isn't a 12 bar blues anymore, so we've at least got that going for us.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMusic) if you have any questions or concerns.* Progressive is a very arbitrary label that musicians tend to assign to themselves in an attempt to differentiate themselves from whatever they would otherwise be defined as similar to (for example progressive rock, and certainly progressive house).

The reason for the word progressive as opposed to another word was originally due to the musicians being particularly innovative in some way and pushing the genre beyond what would usually be thought of as stereotypical of that genre, in such a way that one could call it "progress". Odd time signatures is perhaps one way that music could be progressive within a certain genre, but music doesn't have to have a certain quality to be progressive, nor does any one aspect of music make it progressive. Purple Haze by Cam'ron should be listened to 24/7 Totally just found out about and watched that movie. This music would be best described as:

noir funk jap-rock

It is neither folk blues nor bebop. He voiced The Chef in South Park, if you watch that. Porcupine Tree  For what it's worth, I Just wanted to give you a vote of confidence.  I'm not sure the folks replying got a grasp on where you're coming from. 

I agree that Nickelback is entertainment via the art form of music. In the same way as paint-by-numbers is art, I suppose Nickelback is. Sure, it's a picture of something, but it's formulaic and you're not going to hang it next to a Rembrandt. If you do, then I suppose you're being ironic, and that's just bringing _hipster_ into the premise and it gets difficult shortly after.

So yeah, they're following an art form and fans can see some merit to it, but taken in the context of the wider spectrum of music, there's no value or substance in it. To the musician, they may get value out of playing it, to the fans they may get some value listening to it. Just like I get fun out of using _baby blue_ in area number 37 of my Pinky &amp; the Brain paint-by-numbers booklet. But ultimately, while they're using an artistic medium, they're following the rules to a known winner. 

There's an industry surrounding it. Just like there's industries surrounding recreating incredible art works, there's studios, labels and managers requiring you to hit certain chords, tempos and lyrical content in order to sell more canvases.  Fantastic comment. I had a difficult time writing what you've suggested succinctly. I was hoping you could elaborate. AC/DC after first hearing Highway to Hell.
I did the same with Metallica after hearing For Whom The Bell Tolls

I'm still not in a position to do so (painkillers for a back injury), but my answer would closely echo Elbenji's. I'm spending far too much time rehearsing my comments so they don't sound like complete drivel, it's difficult. There are elements from these animes that are indeed "cutesy". Bebop has those moments.

His list is the exact same list that I was going to choose, although I hadn't even thought of Evangelion. I suppose I would put that on the list too, despite a few flaws. Wasn't my favorite anime, but it sure as hell was memorable. I withdraw what I said about The feelers. Just listened to "Trying to get by" and it's absolutely wonderful. Thanks!

He's just released his seventh album in five years (a double album too, so I suppose that makes it eight). I don't know what he's going to do next, but whatever it is it's going to be the opposite of what I expect. This suggestion isn't going to make sense unless you have the same problem I had. I had mild insomnia for years and no music helped until I found some that sort of matched my energy. My mind was constantly racing so for some reason Sabrepulse really helped. I still listen to Sabrepulse at a very low volume while I sleep. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zcUfjg4zBI [Casualties of Cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1vOGSG4Og0) I used to sleep to Rob Zombie Hillbilly Deluxe and the soundtrack to Little Nickey.  If not thoes two it would be Korn or Disturbed, now I sleep watching/listening to movies. This is... creepy I found the two songs by Candiria to dull..I found track 1# better but still dull...track 2 was okay but still a miss..track 3 i didnt like...track 4 i did like..ill look into them more..track 5 i liked the track but didnt like the singer...track 6 i liked aswell..track 7 i didnt like..track 8..i loved it but hated the singer..track 9 i didnt like

Thanks for the effort in putting each track down like that :) its really appreciated 

I think with age i prefer music thats more crisp/vibrant.. im even going towards mellow with tracks like this 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml0PEKKvj1k

being played alot more regular then the less exciting songs in my collection

and with the metal influenced music I listen to the sound is clear and each part stands out for me.. most of the songs you listed above just sounded dull.. but i could maybe chalk some of that up to low quality youtube.. im sure live it be different :P Listen to MGMT's album Congratulations. You will have your faith in this generation restored.  The prodigy is definitely not close to being trance anything. Most of there tracks are drum and bass, absent of the standard four on the floor beat, and at a faster bpm than trance. I can see the rock influence though. Concrete Blonde.

Some very stones rock with sick drumming and excellent fretless bass Kanye West  &gt; The reason for the word progressive as opposed to another word was originally due to the musicians being particularly innovative in some way and pushing the genre beyond what would usually be thought of as stereotypical

Isn't that art rock?  I randomly acquired a few of his records from a record dump my friend found. They both came with large, fold out, card board posters. This poster sat over my bed for years. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/53/Isaachayes-blackmoses-unfolded.jpg
It's pretty large too.  This?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktvTqknDobU I always say it when talking about this concert, if there is another one like it sometimes in the future and I know in advance, I'll pay to fly and stay in Japan just to go. Amazing concert. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGOQfLFzJj8 Pink Floyd - Time  
Bob Dylan - Subterranean Homesick Blues
 The good days.. Yes. A lot of SW/PT's songs explore themes of alienation, abuse, outsiders to society and other people that SW doesn't necessarily understand himself but is fascinated by (see also drugs). In his own words when asked about the meaning behind the title:

"It comes fromit's related to some of lyrics. It's about people on the fringes, on the edges of humanity and society. I have an interest in serial killers, child molesters and wife beatersnot in what they did but in the psychology of why, what caused them to become unhinged and twisted? Why are they unable to empathize? It's sort of a metaphor - there's something missing, a black hole, a cancer in their soul. It's an absence in the soul."

A popular theory is that one specific inspiration behind this album was the crimes of Fred West: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_West

(Serial) murderers are the big recurring theme in SW's work, having gone back to that theme in his solo work on Grace for Drowning with Index and Raider II, and The Watchmaker from The Raven That Refused To Sing. Arctic Monkeys- "Secret Door"

oh, wait, you are. Carry on. Listen to some ambient or drone music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnMu-HBTwmw The Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Haven't listened to the most recent album though (the one without Fruciante). For me, it wasnt about downloading their entire discography all at one time.  I liked this band so much I would download one more album on my birthday every year.  The purpose was to savor the band.  Ive had my fair shair of going crazy and downloading everything a band has ever done and listening to it all in one go, but eventually you stop really listening to the music and you can't tell whatever the artist is trying to convey from album to album.

The band I love dearly is "In Flames".  Swedish heavy metal at its finest.  I only recently caught all the way up to where they are now about 3 years ago.  They just released a new album last year. Awww yisssss \m/ Art rock was defined specifically as music that included elements from both rock and western classical music. Does it really matter so much though? The point I was trying to make in my original post was that these labels were perhaps relevant when it was harder to discover new music, but in the modern age it really doesn't matter what is called art rock, or rock, or even music.

Forty years ago it was necessary to buy a record before you even knew if you'd like the music, so genre labels were helpful in deciding what you might want to buy based on what you knew you liked. These days you can hear the name of a band for the first time, search them on youtube and decide whether or not you want to hear more of their music within a minute, and all for free. Labelling music as progressive (or at all) is obsolete. Awesome! Thank you! Although it would be cool to see live action version of any anime, I don' think that sounds good at all - I'm afraid that Hollywood would turn good original stories into exaggerated franchises which would be milked till viewers would puke from out of sheer boredom. Holy shit, he quit? Does it have anything to do with 8chan? Lover, You should've come over - Jeff Buckley
 CCR - Midnight Special. 

reminds me of growing up so much... mum and dad would sing it when I was a kid.  If this song was a human, it would have 4 pairs of testicles and a beard made of the tears of his enemies. &gt; although I rarely found "Progressive House" to live up to it's name

Depends what kind of progressive house you've heard, I suppose. He was muscular because he was working in ISSP before he went into bounty hunting. Facial hair and physical build are the odd ways of looking for his ancestors place of origin. He was from Ganymede, Spike was from Mars, Faye and Ed were from Earth but they all were soaked in post-Gates culture with Mars as central place of civilization. 

They can be played by anyone IMO because their world was so diverse but personally I can't imagine anyone else but Reeves as Spike and [Willis as Jet Black](http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lcgh4miWTz1qeamv3o1_500.jpg). I was really digging Aesop Rock's "9-5ers Anthem" a few minutes ago.

"Fumble out of bed and stumble to the kitchen. Pour myself a cup of ambition. Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess. If I never make it home today god bless". 

I'm at work, at a shitty job, so the song speaks to me. I've got most of their work on my hard drive and I was very much into their first two albums, especially Frances the Mute. I tapped out because there was a noticeable drop in quality when Octahedron came out. Then again, they said they were going to go in a different direction on that one anyway and I guess it just wasn't for me nor some other folks out there. Again this is just my opinion. I haven't even listened to their 2012 album to be honest and I stopped hearing about them. This is all my opinion and I mean no offense to anyone who is still very passionate about them but in retrospect- ATDI seems like they were a force to be reckoned with, a band that didn't get as much praise as they deserved but demanded the attention of anyone who gave them a listen while TMV appeared to be a flash in a pan that lasted for the first few albums and then burned out. It makes sense that they would all eventually get back together in 2012 for some At The Drive-In festival shows. 

And there's NO QUESTION that Cedric and Omar were the more talented and creative members of ATDI and its clearly evident when you look at TMV versus Sparta. It's not even close really. So when you mention their skill and creativity, we are in agreement :) 

Side note: Their original drummer (TMV) is one of the most talented drummers playing today and did a side project with Zack De La Rocha called "One Day As A Lion." It wasn't anything earth-shattering but still a fun and angry little EP. He reminds me a lot of John Bonham when he plays. Listen and tell me if you agree. 

Edit: some grammar mistakes. Oh and "Goliath" from their fourth album is an excellent track. I need to revisit that.

Both of these absolutely kill me every time! Like no one ever was That's a David Allen Coe song. Johnny Paycheck was covering it. Clearly not enough. yes, I understand the feeling. My parents used to sing [Queen - Killer Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZBtPf7FOoM) when we went on road trips (it became sort of a family tradition).

 The answer is Longview. Green Day isn't good at being deep, but they were real good at writing anthems for young, aimless folks. Everything started going downhill after Insomniac. http://www.dreamingwithjeff.com Shut the fuck up. In no world is your shitty American dub better than the original. Bad Religion. Been listening to them for 20 years, it's still magic! Cowboy Bebop has an amazing soundtrack. They Might Be Giants They had something to say. They told a story. And then they fucking ended it.



None of this bullshit formulated crap to try and squeeze every ounce of money out the franchise and every aspect of the characters. 



They had something to say. They told a story. They ended it. And we remember it. 



It is art. Check out, Infectious Grooves. One of my favorite songs. Incredible bassline. [Before The Earth Was Round by OK GO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7frEFnt9CKU)

The second verse destroys me. Everything about this track is perfect. Must be one of my all-time favorites.  [Pearl Jam - Last Kiss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ob3lebqK1I) Yeah I was just wondering:) Thanks!

I just love "researching" genres and stuff. I simply find it interesting, music's development and so on. lol decent is exactly the problem. Are you me?
 Which is why I only listen to that track very, very rarely and I make sure it never comes up randomly. I can't afford to be crying my eyes out when I'm driving... i had forgotten about this song downloading it now Opeth. I loved how they changed it up every album but still kept a lot of the complex melodic changes that made them fun to listen to. 

Also Rush. Rush is still going strong, and those guys kick some major ass.  [Roxy Music - More Than This \[Art Rock\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9PAuWV-Vn0)

It's not a sad song, but it holds a lot of memories for me. Hate to be that guy but it's Paddy's not Patty's

[link](http://paddynotpatty.com/) I would consider Jean Michel Jarre the king of ambient electronic music. He is an expert crafter of soundscapes and was a pioneer in the synthesizer scene.

[Here is his first album \(and arguably his greatest work\), Oxygene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlBIQqIPaGg)

[It was followed up by Equinoxe, another fantastic album.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAhgz9aLukk)

I'd also recommend checking out Vangelis' non-film work (although his film soundtracks are also stellar.) My personal favourite by him is [Heaven and Hell.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ss8RrowGjE) [Pretty Lights - My Only Hope (Blood Diamonds remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUVHadqDJFw)

he sings about coping with the death of his wife to cancer, and what made her so special for him. A love so unusual in the world of pop music, took him a few years to start writing music again, and he did with this song I'd definitely consider Remission - Blood Mountain proggy Sludge Metal or prog Metal. There's songs with multiple musical sections and plenty of odd time signatures/rapid changing time signatures.  OP is a bundle of sticks because he make shit up. Binaural beats are really interesting. They helped me fall asleep quicker and I felt like I hit a deeper sleep. You can search for binaural beats (delta or sleep) and tons will come up. [This one's decent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgTHldG-vmM)  You can search alpha or energy if you need that too. fan-fuckingtastic song The sooner you start, the sooner you'll thank yourself.

The past is exactly that; your future may very well involve a renewed sense of well being, if you give yourself the chance to play again. Good luck! Thanks, I'll check them out. But what is this 'buy' word you speak of? XD

I'm j/k, I've bought 4 copies of Ninja Scroll in my life after each time it was stolen or lost. I say this with respect, not toxicity: You are the nave one. Creativity and imagination are powerful blessings that trump the 'profits' they reap, but only to the ones who make something worth seeing/hearing.

I never said I hated tv or movies. However, I do tend to get angry when strangers present to me what they think is a better understanding of myself than I have. To this day, "Moanin" represents to me the epitome of Jazz music.

Through that song, I was introduced to a shit load of godly musicians. I hope so. I'm a little worried so far ahhh, you're right about that. They really are in two completely different leagues. Except, I guess, for the soundtrack? I didn't know that.

But it is damn good. Yuskei (? it's been awhile) really plays a powerful role with the Dr. Jekyll/ Hyde paradigm, and I remember knowing it was something I wouldn't forget. Like Claymore. I'll have to do that. Ahead of his time is a great way of putting it. Even the playstation game has incredible music, and an edge you don't see anywhere else. Yes. That's the pseudonym she uses because she doesn't like to be credited as singer. Which is kinda stupid because she's damn good at it. This Time, Imploding Voice, some other that I won't recall right now... [Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrlxdKKP2n0) Bell bottom blues - Derek and the Dominoes And nothing of value was lost. I enjoy acerbic lyrics (that probably doesn't say anything good about me). Some of my favourites are:  
* I Am The Resurrection by The Stone Roses (Stone me why can't you see, you're a no one nowhere washed up baby, who'd look better dead / Your tongue is far too long, I don't like the way it sucks and slurs upon my every word.)  
* Idiot Joy Showland by The Fall (The working class has been shafted, so what the fuck you sneering at? Your prerogative in life it seems, is living out an ad man's dream)  
* Unbearable by The Wonder Stuff (Didn't like you very much when I met you and now I like you even less)  
* Eno Collaboration by Half Man Half Biscuit (I travelled South America recording different sounds / I danced within an elven ring of quicksilver delight / Highly influential documentary guaranteed / Who put the con in concept? It was me with my Eno  Eno collaboration)  
* Fake Tales of San Francisco by Arctic Monkeys (You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham)

potato quality, but this  MTV VMA version still still gets me right in the feels every time.  Archive *and* VNV Nation.

These days, I only go to VNV concerts, but the CDs are gathering dust. Archive I still listen to at least once a day. MUSHROOM HUNTINGGGGG How about [fax me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6SkaH09iDs) and [Be Human](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZb4dzyiZPQ&amp;list=PLIGqAt-MVv2JPpS8bubarT8O-xuEyzuPe)?

 Metallica. They were the band that started it all for me. "Raaaaar" Totally getcha, just seemed kinda funny in a thread with people saying they had all the Beatles' albums, or Pink Floyd, or every Zep album, there's a "3 album discog woo!" post in there haha For Cowboy Bebop OST lovers, here are some of the lesser known OSTs that I like:

[Ilaria Graziano - Pearls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lp9SiOML5Y)

[Ilaria Graziano - Diamonds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gitmb5c_WaU)

[Ilaria Graziano - EINSTEIN GROOVIN'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0TV0X4sdE0) Jackson C. Frank - I want to be alone &gt;Bebop really was not only ahead of it's time, but scores ahead of anything even being made today.

Most anime in the 90's are better than most that are out today. I believe Cowbow bebop wasn't "ahead of its time", but rather anime were just that good during that decade.

You want to know about "ahead of its time"? Anime like Galaxy Express 999 is more like it. Simon &amp; Garfunkel :) The Postal Service - Give Up  
A lot of Moby stuff. Georgia Fair I think the key to a synthesizer is that you can mainpulate it's sound to your liking and while a keyboard only has predetermened options that will always sound the same. Don't know whether this is really the difference, but that's how I see it. "When it comes to beats, well, I'm a fiend. I like my sugar with coffee and cream."

- "Intergalactic" by the Beastie Boys Alice in Chains?
 John Prine. Didn't think he'd be so bloody good; I was expecting some Gordon Lightfoot-type. Knights of Cydonia - Muse Daft punk - around the world Rammstein for me. I was like twelve and I watched xXx and saw the scene they had. Out was fucking awesome.  Mutter was the first Cd I ever bought. I still remember the physical feeling I had when I listened to that record. I didn't know guitars could be that fucking heavy. It was such a mind bloWing experience and helped turn me into the music addict I am today. The rest of their catalog was the second, third, fourth,  and fifth Cd's little me ever bought Man I wish I had found VNV sooner.  Nightwish, then Sabaton. But... But... *Yamadera Kouichi*. He's just *so good*.  And I can't imagine not having Hayashibara Megumi as Faye...

Dammit you guys are making me want to check out the dub. I never checkout the dub.  lol According for Forbes she has a net worth if over $200m and she's trademarking phases she didn't create so she can earn money on their usage.

That's greed. "That was less than amazing" from Conversation 16 by The National.  
But basically most of The Nationals lyrics.  
"I had a few good years, but they don't know" from Coronado by Deerhunter. They also have a lot of good lyrics in general for example Never Stops, Kids, Sailing, Nothing ever happened.  
" In the end all you can hope for is the love you felt to equal the pain you've gone through" from Bones by the Editors.  
They also have good lyrics overall, especially on their And End has an Start album.  
Interpol is also pretty good. I think writing stuff is pretty essential.  Don't think so, a HipHop piece also has some parts of it that stand up. And the chorus can be the hook, but most of the times isn't it I think. I think hook normally refers to a short part like a riff or synthesizer part.

edit:typo The Strokes are by far my most beloved band. In my eyes they cannot do anything wrong. Looks like he deleted it too!  Who? I think they are ok but the vocals sound a bit too much like a chorus in a lot of their songs and I find it a bit off putting. But great pick anyway!

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers. I second that. Loved the days of D12. Her albums are really good,  it's just that she gets shit for her live singing. People should be giving her credit for actually singing live instead of lip synching like most singers now.  Me too! I love listening to their b-sides/live recordings. Queens Of The Stone Age too nice No offence taken.  Do you like space? I know I do. Do you want a record that has an insatiable groove but is also devoted to themes of science fiction, love, and fantasy? Would you also like an undertone of narcotic eroticism and endless escapism with those themes? I hope the answer is yes. Would you like it if your front man supposedly studied under a real life wizard?  What would you say if I told you already have heard one of these songs a billion times on the radio? Would you call me a liar? What if I told you the rest of the record is as good if not better than that one hit? Would you claim heresy and try to see me arrested? All of these things can be yours with one of the best but not only records from a popular yet underrated band. If you are already familiar with this album also realize that this band has an equally strong discography that certain people can gush over given the right amount of motivation. 

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3bRl5fx8Eo)  My favorite album of theirs. I always look it at as the cynical response to TJT since TJT is a much more upbeat album. Ultra Violet is such a fantastic song.  Just listen to this here and all your problems seem to fade

I think it's the white noise effect it creates. When this came out in 1991, one of the UK reviews said, "by anyone's standards this is a good album; by U2's, it's a great album."

Trick question sometimes PR can go just a bit too far This album reflects humanity. The good. The bad. And the ambiguity of it. Most of this album is actually a continuous song. Most of it. The songs within this album evoke mostly dark emotions, but they are very relaxing. The lyrics of these songs deal with some very heavy themes. Mostly, like I said, to do with humanity; society. But the themes and ideas displayed in this album is familiar territory for this band. They are certainly not for everyone, they are for me and hopefully for you, too.

edit:typo No How does this sub hate on Kanye? Kanye is /r/music's waifu He's now been formally charged with murder for this. Apparently there was a "scuffle" on the set of the N.W.A. biopic *Straight Outta Compton* and Suge was seen running over a victim **twice**. He turned himself in per advice from his lawyer--better call Saul.  What is running through your head that makes you think RHCP is metal?

Check out the first Mr. Bungle album though, if you dig Primus you'll be able to stomach it Paramore. I only started buying albums about a year and and a half ago and Paramore is the only band which's whole discography I have. I am sure the clockwork orange soundtrack was a mixture of both. You may have to look for it though.  Juno Reactor Unless you are into the electroacoustic soundscape stuff done by [Stockhausen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1Psx24n3rM) and co. you are out of luck.

[Something Corporate - Konstantine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMwI1DlZpyY) Cake She's trademarking phrases used in her music and will be used on her merch that are likely to be used by others to profit from the association with her work. Thats standard practice Anything by Godspeed You Black Emperor. Their songs are long and ambient, perfect for falling asleep. Except for that one part in the middle of one of the records which sounds like someone trying to kill a  giant mosquito by banging two trashcan lids together.  The username would certainly indicate that. Generally I check out reviews on Pitchfork.com from writers that I like and seem to agree with, this is a good way of getting to know about a lot of albums and EPs as soon as they drop. 

I also browse RateYourMusic which is basically a ratings aggregation site. So users rate albums on there and an algorithm ranked them into a "best of". You can organise these lists by year, by genre, by country etc. so it's a pretty cool way to keep in touch! I see no recent submissions from you to this subreddit. Complaining is easier than adding content.  Technically it is art. It is Shitty art though. So practicality, it is not art.

Per Wikipedia: Art may be characterized in terms ofmimesis(its representation of reality), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During theRomantic period, art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science".[2]Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed[3][4][5]and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming fromhuman agency[6]and creation.[7]

The nature of art, and related concepts such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known asaesthetics.[8]

 The energy of this album is astounding.

**ARCARSENAL** - Basically hang on and hope you're still in one piece by the end. One of the greatest album openers of all time. 

**PATTERN AGAINST THE USER** - Pushing lines like "Hypodermic people poking fun at the living" in front of 4 chord progression and hyperactive basslines.

**ONE ARMED SCISSOR** - A 3 act play about how to kick enormous amounts of musical ass.

**SLEEPWALK CAPSULES** - How enormous can we make a 5-piece sound? Let's find out.

**INVALID LITTER DEPT** - Let's reach out to all the kids nodding their heads and FORCE THEM TO ROCK OUT.

**MANNEQUIN REPUBLIC** - Oh the previous song tempo was a bit slower? Time to kick it up to 11 and sound enormous again.

**ENFILADE** - Have you ever heard a song that feels like a kidnapping? No? cool, now you have.

**ROLODEX PROPOGANDA** - Poppy? Sure, I guess we can do that.

**QUARANTINED** - We need a breather in this setlist. Let's open up some space for the Paul and Omar to make a soundscape. They kill it.

**COSMONAUT** - Caught your breath? Good. You'll need the energy to pump out what is, nominally, this rocketship of a song.

**NON-ZERO POSSIBILITY** - We should put Cedric at centre stage for at least one of these songs. Let's see what he can do with a ballad to end the album and leave you feeling conflicted.

I've always felt that, conceptually, the performances on this album feel like they are playing in the street upwards to a crowd standing on the top of a 10 story building. They are just outputting so much raw energy and sound, and the scope is completely external to the listener, and starts to take up residence in their environment.

The transition from this, through the breakup, into The Mars Volta (at least for Cedric and Omar) seemed to take all of this energy and push it towards introspection, making the bizzare and weird journey of Deloused a notable counterpoint.

TL:DR - Album is epic. Listen to it on the regular. Grizzly Bear, Beach House, the xx On a Venn diagram with one circle for shoegaze, one for dream pop, one for psychedelic folk and one for alt country ... mazzy star would lurch around the middle of that.   
  
Feel like Sandoval makes their tunes too lyrically driven and the music isn't noisy enough to be "shoegaze" per se. Definitely in that family though.   
  
Lol. Early nineties pop music snobs be like "Whatever you do, don't just call it pop." Nazareth [Something Corporate - Konstantine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMwI1DlZpyY) Check out Air, they have a similar sound.  

Oh, and Industrial Revolution by Jean-Michel Jarre. How is Fear of a Blank Planet not in your list? It's possibly their best album. It's definitely their most cohesive.

PT albums ranked: FOABP=IA&gt;Stupid Dream&gt;everything else&gt;On the Sunday of Life.

Arriving Somewhere But Not Here is their best song. Fucking masterpiece.  Find your chill. [Sufjan Stevens - The Upper Peninsula](http://youtu.be/J54fc8mDbZ0) I cry half the times I hear this. Nobody's posted it? ALRIGHT!

Edit: second link. Tsuneo Imahori from the Seatbelts did Trigun's soundtrack as well, I love them both. Tom Waits Wow, didn't expect to see this. I went through a huge Gong/Hillage/Allen phase when I was about 17.  Obviously. I'm not sure what you are getting at. I support this thread. "And since we all came from a woman

Got our name from a woman 

and our game from a woman

I wonder why we take from our women

Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?

I think it's time to kill for our 
women

Time to heal our women, be real to our women

And if we don't we'll have a 
race of babies

That will hate the ladies, that make the babies

And since a man can't make one

He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one" 

Tupac - Keep Ya Head up At its release, probably Pet Sounds.

Otherwise, an album like Starsailor by Tim Buckley is a master of its form. This post has been removed. Self-posts should not consist of only a link. Please repost this as a link post, or if it's self-post Friday, wait until tomorrow.

Listen to music by a composer named Erik Satie. It's very soft minimalistic piano music. It's great music to have on in the background to help relax, so maybe it could be helpful to fall asleep to. For news, I just go between Pitchfork, Reddit, and /mu/.

Generally, in between those, I have the crazy speculation, the cautious excitement, and the fact verified statements.

Pitchfork is rarely as impulsive as FACT magazine so they're pretty trustworthy. Mushroom hunting. Let's kick the beat Anything that is Dark Ambient.

If you're 'different', try Drone Metal. Once you go Blackest Eyes you never turn back.  Progressive generally means adhering to longer and more symphonic song structures. King Crimson's "Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Pt. 1" comes to mind as an ABA form, 13 minute epic.

Sometimes the term is used carelessly by people who don't know how to use it, though. I went both routes. Life is now weird.  Burial - Untrue

Tim Hecker - Ravedeath, 1972

Talk Talk - Spirit of Eden/Laughing Stock Oh man, those soundcloud releases that came out this week. Very good stuff. I'm going to be happy listening to that for awhile.  Great album.  I close my eyes and I keep seeing things. Rainbow waterfalls. Sunny liquid dreams. Where would one find said blog? Thank you!

Like the previous "Family" suggestion, I really like the sound of it, but it wouldn't make my raspy list, but it definitely goes to my "old school rock" list. Thanks! Right, and the production of a Nickelback song reveals that it is not created to express the emotion of the communicator, but rather to relate to and manipulate the emotion of the listener. It's designed to elicit a response that makes the listener most likely to pay money for the product.

If you ever spend a significant amount of time in a big music business town, you'll become jaded as well. Pop music is now more of a science than an art, and Nickelback definitely falls into the former category.  15 years later, still sick af. [Pharmakon- Bestial Burden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsBcTuHimLo)

*Disclaimer: It may or may not be the waiting music in the lobby of Hell.* Love it! Not in a rock kind of way but I'll keep that in a corner and will come back to it at another time, when I'm in the mood for something more chill.

Thanks! Do you like Queen? Ha, I forget where I am. But seriously, do you enjoy music that is full of grand pomp and could easily get a stadium moving with fist pumps? Would you like it around the same time as Queen but without the legacy? Do you still want the music to have the operatic flair but with more weirdness? Would you like to hear an album and be baffled why it hasn't been remembered like others? Do you mind if there is crossdressing on the cover? If you answered yes to more than one of these questions, come on and grab a seat. 

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHAtv9TXEv0) To be honest I don't know a lot about them. I was invited to one of their concerts so I looked up a list of their best albums and to be honest I found their music really boring. It's just so slow and there doesn't seem to be a lot of substance. 

That said, I did end up going to the show and it was great. They're a lot louder and more interesting live than they are on their albums. Had a really good time. May not be what you're looking for but [Dave Gutter from Rustic Overtones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saxtqlhkpvo) has a hell of a voice and can add the rasp on a dime (don't mind the worlds worst music video... they are incredible) Yes Sounds like a recipe for nightmares. "It doesn't matter if we all die...." I miss his salty chocolate balls. I'm pretty sure you already know them, but Nirvana. One could argue that the lead in the band Grouplove also has a raspy voice too.  I still listen to Fish Rising all the way through every few months. Too good.  Sure, it sucks that some bands just won't be as popular as least-talented guys. I love dozens of bands and artists that are so unknown it hurts, but people have a right to like what they do. If so many people are buying the albums, going to the concerts of, and listening to bands like Nickelback, that's their choice. 

Also, this is 2015, there are so many ways to get into new artists it's ridiculous. Last.fm, Spotify, Youtube, Pandora, Bandcamp, Grooveshark, Soundcloud, 8tracks, etc When you bow your heads tomorrow at the world we build today, I want you to remember that I stood my ground and said "no".

Her voice is so beautiful, even when you hear the pain coming through. Very sad song.  Awesome!

Thanks! i always thought they were Hills
 I was very disappointed. I mean, they were never going to live up to the original, but this... You know you're. .....pretty when. ... YOURE DEAD

(NO RESTRAINING ORDER CAN KEEP ME FROM YOUUUUU) Not a huge fan of Nirvana (I don't dislike them, don't get me wrong).

And Grouplove made my list, thanks! I actually listened to Solar Musick Suite on the way to work this morning :) I love that album so much. Green might be my favorite Hillage album though. 


Ever get into Ozric Tentacles?  ...This isn't Bebop.  The fuck's wrong with you? [Barcelona - Please don't go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7deClndzQw)

Hauntingly beautiful It's not 100% music, but lately I've been playing Bo Burnham's show, "what." every night. The guy is hilarious and for whatever reason I find it really nice to fall asleep to. I think regardless of all the backlash they got for it, Folie a Deux is Fall out Boy's best album  Love this band so much. It's not supposed to be, though Jesus, now I really need to watch this show.  Didn't expect the soundtrack to be this hot and varied.

 I have been a fan for a long time, but I really didn't think this needed to exist.  soooooooo much better than the mars volta [What Sarah Said - Death Cab for Cutie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I483tB12SyE) 
DCFC has always been very emotionally charged music for me, but this song gets me every time. This. Exactly.

I don't know how Sparta got the shit end of the stick, but maaaan. Porcelain was a solid album, one I still occasionally listen to, but everything I've ever heard from the Mars Volta's inception had just been face-melting. They're so on point. The Beatles. My parents listened to them so much when I was a small child that their melodies were always playing in my head. I never knew who The Beatles were, then grew up and forgot all about it. A coworker was playing the Love Album and I was stunned the find that all of the songs were already familiar to me. I had no idea that one band was responsible for nearly all of my favorite songs as a little boy. I spent months devouring all of their albums and felt this incredible sense of reconnection / reconciliation with my younger self. Such a wonderful feeling. Such beautiful music. It just seemed so overproduced. I would have loved cool covers of it if they just cut out all of that background noise and focused on singing. They should have just been rocking out to these songs.  Neither is it folk, blues or anything 'cowboy'. This is my opinion, and you are obviously welcome to think I'm an idiot, but it seemed to me like The Mars Volta took all the weird musical masturbation and Sparta took the rock from ATDI (at least for Wiretap Scars), I can't stand TMV, and I really only like a few songs from the very first Sparta record, but ATDI is my shit.  I will forever love this band and this album, but everything that came after is apparently not for me. Use to love it on XM "what musc should be"

Pray tell, what should music be?  favorite band of all time. The rawness and rage, such energy, Clearly ahead of their time, cut short in my opinion. Hello Mother leopard, I have your cub. A couple musicians jamming out to the Beatles sounds awesome. But what the hell happened? It sounds noisy and disoriented in the worst way. 

I can't be sure exactly, but I'm guessing this is why Tame Impala left the project

 This album sounds like it was made in an icy wasteland filled with monsters and evil spirits.  The low-fi production coupled with the ultra-distorted buzz saw guitar, echoey drums, and almost negligent bass create a "wall of sound".  What makes this album really great and what brings out the melody and songwriting are the heavy use of symphonic keyboards. The keys create this epic, romantic and somber feeling that can take you to another world (at least for me it does).  This album was a game changer and is a classic, in my opinion.

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tccZs_veliA) After reading all these comments I feel like the only one here who enjoyed Sparta more than The Mars Volta.  Jim Ward went with a tad more conventional sounding band but his powerful voice over much less distorted music was beautiful. Oh, and Tony Hajjar is a straight beast at drums.  P.O.M.E. on their album Porcelain showed just how versatile and diverse his percussion skills are. Fuck yeah. I discovered them at college and quickly got a lot of their albums. They were one of my go to bands for study or homework sessions. I got into them and Shpongle around the same time. It was wonderful.  Sublime, Led Zeppelin and En Vogue- my tastes were very eccentric for middle school [Beside You -- Van the Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke27QakSPxM)

"Way across the country where the hillside mountain glide,

The dynamo of your smile caressed the barefoot virgin child to wander

Past your window with a lantern lit.

You held it in the doorway and you cast against the pointed island breeze.

Said your time was open, go well on your merry way,

Past the brazen footsteps of the silence easy.

You breathe in, you breathe out, you breathe in, you breathe out, you breath in, you breathe out, you breathe in, you breathe out,

And you're high on your high-flying cloud,

Wrapped up in your magic shroud as ecstasy surrounds you.

This time it's found you.

You turn around, you turn around, you turn around, you turn around

And I'm beside you.

Beside you.

Oh darlin'

To never never wonder why at all.

No no no no no.

To never never never wonder why at all.

To never never never wonder why it's gotta be.

It has to be.

And I'm beside you.

Beside you. Music that people actually put thought into. [no surprises - radiohead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peLiLUIpNvM) yeaaaaaaaaaaah. This is like the third time I have seen you.

 The Weeknd - Kissland

You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free, you gotta pay with your body. Extremely vague. All music includes some sort of thought.  The original Mobile Suit Gundam from 1979 fits in that "ahead of its time" category as well. Amuro Ray preceeded Shiji Ikari's reluctant tortured pilot character by over a decade. i try to do my part.

[Song of the seasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdouev9gEqw) is easily one of my favorite anime songs ever. Do you like space? Alright, you already answered yes to the other one. Great. Do you like metal? Who does't right? Do you like tabletop games? That is right, I could see your dice on the bookcase. What would you do if I told you that I have an album that is based on a lesser known 1977 science fiction RPG and the whole record is a concept based on some of the major themes within the universe? What if I told you that it was played in the style of Iron Maiden or Judas Priest without any screaming, gurgles, or cries? 

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiHpfugCboI&amp;list=PL8C562955E0B3AE10&amp;index=2) You're welcome!  That's not really extremely vague. Take a listen to the radio today. Do you think a lot of thought is put into some of those lyrics today? Please give Noctourniquet a listen. As a huge TMV fan I didn't care too much for Noctourniquet when it first came out, but now it's easily one of my favorites because it has a very mellow vibe. In Absentia is easily one of the best songs they ever recorded. So take "Strength of the World" for example, by Avenged Sevenfold, would you consider that progressive? &gt; symphonic keyboards.

I had it narrowed down to a couple of suspects.  Oh man I'm in high school again. I used to fall asleep to comedy all the time. I made a Jim Gaffigan station on Pandora, and using the like/dislike feature I got it to the point where it pretty much only played Gaffigan, Brian Regan, Mike Birbiglia, Mitch Hedberg, and occasionally Burnhan and Tosh. It was really entertaining and the bits eventually became familiar enough that I could tune out and fall asleep to them. To be fair, Sacramento might as well be Seattle or Vancouver when you're from LA. Pretty damn near identical story for me too, discovered them through a buddy at Keene State. The campus library used to have a few Ozric CDs and he would check them out. Shpongle is incredible as well, my buddy actually has been working with Zebbler for the past couple years since he moved down the road from him in Boston. He's mapping visuals and designing stuff for about 4 or 5 songs per show for Shpongle's upcoming tour.  You know the base of that song is a dolly pardon tune I like TMV and all but I liked Sparta better. Still listen to 'Cut Your Ribbon' on the regular. Good question. Back in the day, I would listen to my own personal collection on CD and MP3, and I don't typically use streaming music services these days either. However, your comment is motivating me to either find one or make one. I'll see if I can follow up. Came here to talk about Initiation. It's far and away my favorite song of theirs. I listen to the version on TSINO on the reg and always several times in a row. 

http://youtu.be/TtjdI8ikGJ4
 I heard the one about Money on XM, it was really good.  I also wouldn't have learned that there was once a kazoo duo with a recording contract if it weren't for him. [Once there was a way, to get back homeward...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlsieqdIuFI) Absolutely wonderful survey courses in pop music. And you get to hear funny, insightful commentary from the mind of Dylan. Good Lord! Fall Out boy? Pearl Jam? Get a clue.  le wrong generation XD

You think the radio music in the 60s was any better? Music is more important than lyrics anyway.

I like the ones from ep5 and that one the most. That sounds like a dream job! I hope they play Boston. I live a little outside the city and have only gotten a taste of live Sphongle through youtube. Well I'd be much obliged if you did, I've found a couple on spotify today but haven't had a chance to listen to them yet.

Smells like chaos distilled into pure serenity. Smells like rapturous transcendent AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Smells like the greatest album of all time.

I went both routes lol Snot You got it, I already want to listen to it again.  A thousand layers of guitars and keyboards underpinning one of the best voices ever in top form. An unstoppable wall of sound moving from metal to pop to ambient within the space of a few bars. Technically songs, but more like perfectly structured soundscapes with incredible attention to detail in timbres, textures, harmony and (especially) performance.

Today's post-hardcore is muchhhh different from back then. Saw them live last summer... I really wanted to like them but it's verging on the "too weird to be interesting" side of things for me. I lost interest and haven't listened to anything since the concert. Honestly I enjoyed the between song banter more than their actual songs.  This album tells story of a boy who loses his father in world war 2. Goes on to become a rock star and then begins a slow descent into madness. lots of finger tapping on the fretboard = post-hardcore Same here man, haven't been able to catch the live experience.

Listen and think of your dad. Try not to get emotional. Loud, fast, and all-around perfection on bass, guitar, and drums. Only 8 songs in length, but it starts and ends with a passion unlike most other albums. [Slint - Spiderland](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q-o3l8uKloM)

Do you have a link at all for the answer? Bonamassa. Fore by Huey Lewis and the News. Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. But, Fore is their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is "Hip to be Square", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself. Are you going to provide a link or leave us in suspense.  Now I want the story behind the audience lyrics in Sweet Caroline [citation needed] Why would anyone do that? Go to NYC to hire someone for this insignificant British band. And then spend a lot of money to cover it up before this band was known outside Liverpool.

 http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/2u344d/good_sleep_music/ Eh its fine. You could have compared him to Beethoven. 

&gt;Technically songs, but more like perfectly structured soundscapes

haha, I love the passion.  Led Zeppelin. I think I was 13 or so? Heard "When the Levee Breaks" and immediately begged my mom to take me to Walmart so I could buy every Zeppelin c.d. available. Alkaline Trio I like classical music when I sleep. Debussy gets a lot of overnight play for me. A lot of Jeff Buckley's *Grace*, in particular So Real, Hallelujah, Lilac Wine etc. The quieter ones. Maybe it's because the vocals were all recorded through the night. Cardiacs - Sing to God. Any Cardiacs release really. Sing to God just blows me away. Completely unique and utterly genius. I don't believe anyone will ever be able to craft up such imaginitive, ludicrous and yet strangely emotive songs, the likes that Tim Smith did.

One of the best ways to start an album.  In an alternate history fantasy medieval Scotland, the city of Dundee is attacked by an evil sorcerer and his army of undead unicorns. The prince goes on an epic quest to find magical artifacts and take back his home. This story is set to the cheesiest music possible. The whole album is basically one massive piss take, and is ridiculous amounts of fun.

Pink Floyd, The Wall.

Have you seen the movie? The entire album is a story. More Abstract Than Concrete I'd start with 'A Horse With No Name.'

Its easily their biggest hit. Any Animals As Leaders album ...why are their copies of the style section all over your floor. From Indian Lakes - Absent Sounds. Amazing album. Completely underrated artist.  "One Fierce Beer Coaster" boulevard of broken dreams Imagine walking through a garden on Neptune. Imagine swimming in a pool on the top of your airship while gliding over Russia. Imagine drifting to sleep on the Space Shuttle. Imagine the silence in your head if it was composed by Steve Reich.

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PhFrfIDlD8) Same with Unite and Conquer  Only decent comment in thread. Deftones were probably mine too, but like 15 years ago Who is this? To Build a home.     Possibly the most beautiful song I have ever heard.

http://youtu.be/QB0ordd2nOI
 Didn't he also kill Tupac? One of the most memorable songs ever for me. Everyone I know knows every word in the song Caress Of Steel. [Kamelot - Abandoned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vow3rbWq8es)

 Face Down - Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. My girlfriend was killed by her father during a spurt of abuse when this song came out, she called it her favorite and I had no idea or took any hint at 15. Devastating. The "Her" movie score by Arcade Fire is amazing. Slow Magic is a good edm producer that makes some kick Ass trance.  Some of Deadmau5's old stuff.  Radiohead, and not one album disappoints (...excluding a majority of Pablo Honey) Daft Punk for me Yo La Tengo has produced some of the most classic pop music of this generation. They are living legends.  a bit mainstream, but i really liked Kaskade a lot.  80's era Pantera, Projects in the jungle.

While this is entirely different from Cowboys from Hell and every one that follows this album was very relevant to the time.

 IMO this era is some of Dimebag's best work. The guys were tired of doing straight death metal. They'd been on the Warped Tour &amp; felt like it was a big, contrived talent show and it wasn't musical enough, &amp; they needed a change. They're a very musical group and with this record they wanted to show that, &amp; they wanted to have *fun* playing just what they wanted to play. This album showcases their musical virtuosity, their ability to blend genres while sticking to a prog-metal framework, and has plenty of weird, creative, &amp; fun sections. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuEz_HvBqZ0 My favourite song of all time, closely followed by Bruce Springsteen - Im on fire... How am I the only comment? Mazzy Star

Also Riders on the storm by the Doors has a particular relazing effect on me. Maybe you are unfamiliar with Cannibal Corpse, but I'm pretty sure this is a joke and I would not advise trying to listen to them while trying to sleep This album has a god damned screenplay written to coincide with the tracklist. Plus there are some pretty good stand alone songs on it. All the while every music video made for the songs on it tells a single dark story in the background  Streetlight Manifesto I don't know if it'll move you to tears but this song grabbed me by the heart and won't release its grip. 

[The Airborne Toxic Event - The Secret](http://youtu.be/WWvQjL1HK9o)  I have to return some tapes GGRRAAAAAANNDDMMAAAAAAAAAA!!!

[Link](http://youtu.be/6fOprNSFCX4) A masterpiece.  

[Absent One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnBV26BqLq8) and [Tremble Dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UPcaVkPuK0) are also sublime. That song was on the banned list after 9/11. I really enjoy Yo La Tengo and was happy to have had the opportunity to watch them perform during their Popular Songs tour--one of the more interesting shows I saw when I was living in Omaha. Aaron's Party (Come Get It).  Slayer.Seriously though i would recommend audio books or radio plays.Or I throw a documentary on my chromecast.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMusic) if you have any questions or concerns.* Thank you so much for that. Great listen from top to bottom. I loved Kanno's Ghost In The Shell soundtrack, and this playlist is full of standout tracks from that show. Da Drought 3, This was released in Wayne's rapping prime. Right before he dropped the monstrous Carter 3 album. Disturbed. I still wish they hadn't taken a hiatus   Jay just comes across bitter about everybody though. 
I've not heard anybody else hate on them though? Who else apart from Jay and Lisa Lampanelli?
 Red Hot Chili Peppers. I was a fan of rap, hard rock, and some pop music as a younger teen, then I heard RHCP for the first time. They took aspects of each of those and brought them together into a orgasm for my ear vaginas that had yet to subside to this day.  &gt;Imagine walking through a garden on Neptune.

I wish real space was like science fantasy space and adventurers carried swords and fought aliens.  Fuck. Yes. I had forgotten about this song! Thanks!  I'm not really a big Coldplay fan, but there first album is so damn relaxing Father and son by car Stevens

Gabriels oboe by Morricone (spelling). Best bit of oboe you'll ever hear I guessed DTP without seeing the link. Addicted and Accelerated Evolution are quite similar I think. 6 o clock on a Christmas morning.  Weightless, by Marconi Union.
I've been having trouble sleeping lately, so my SO showed me this. It is apparently scientifically the most relaxing song ever. I'd been taking an hour or two to get to sleep, this put me out in minutes.
 Link to wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marconi_Union#Weightless Gunsmith Cats sort of slipped under everybody's radar in the 90s, but their opening sequence definitely must've had some influence on Bebop's

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXE4wO-Qt48 I am not sure what the story behind it was, but I was always weirded out by the fact that his youtube handle was "Fagotron" Childish gambino - Because the Internet David Bowie - 1. Outside. Bowie is known for his glam days and his latest work but imo his most interesting and under appreciated work was the Outside album where he mixes cyberpunk art murder with mangled jazz. I think this might have been the album he got dropped from his label because of actually... Queen, Alice Cooper, Blink 182, The Offspring, The Smashing Pumpkins Born in the USA? American Football  I absolutely love the hell out of Lou Reed, and I have to say that this is easily my favourite track on my favourite solo album of his. Just so damn vulnerable. HA I don't know about music but I found out that my voice is. I was studying for my finals and recorded my notes. I listened to them whilst in the bath, I woke up in cold water. I have NEVER fallen asleep in the bath!! I am removing this unless you give us more of the plot. Ill give you a hint. You have to tell us about his sister and what happened to her. Also mention the House of Amon.  92-96 Didn't know them before but they are absolutely fucking mind blowing amazing! Saw them live a few months ago and man did they rock!!! Felt like blues rock taken into the 21st century, just awesome!

Also heard from a friend who interviewed Neil Fallon that he is a super down to earth and humble, all around great guy.

Very under appreciated band! Emiliana Torrini - Fisherman's Woman

Soothing and chill af. Whole album is 42 minutes long I believe. It's like a lullaby for adults (imo) You and me both man, you and me both.  The Postal Service!  Gorillaz: Plastic beach. I connected with that album lpl Morphine. Awww, his involvement was that he was the one driving. Never heard that one. I drunk myself blind to the sound of old T. Rex. Sigur Ros - Agaetis Byrjun

Can vouch for the entire album, used to sleep to it a lot. Explosions in the Sky Mono and Godspeed You! Black Emperor are also good examples of calm at times drowsy postrock. Angel dust is good for you.  "Room on Fire" by The Strokes.

It got shit on for being same-y, unremarkable, unambitious, etc.

What a bunch of bullshit. Such a great album - "Whatever Happened," "Reptilia," "Under Control," and "I Can't Win" are four of my all-time favorite tracks on any record, bar none. 

When the album wasn't as well-received critically, the band decided to experiment a bit more, try new things, try to sound like the band they thought critics wanted them to be, which goes completely against the "fuck it, and fuck you too" mentality they had from the start.

Eventually, the Strokes ended up where they are now, which is somewhere between "Oh, yeah, the Strokes... Hrm..." and "The Strokes are still together?" Ugh.

Anyway, yeah, great album. Totes. I love Mastodon and almost everything they do (The Hunter was a little hard to swallow) and I know I'm in the minority when I say this; but, damn do I wish they would start trending back towards their Remission era sound. yes!  I think Power Metal is as good as Cowboys From Hell. Climbing up the Walls by Radiohead seems to fit the description 

http://youtu.be/qbtZyuOMdHI Years ago I drunkenly compared him to Pavarotti and was swiftly slapped down by some passing musos. Certainly not my finest hour. Macys Day Parade...love it! Swing life away- Rise Against I only ever listened in the car.  It was an interesting show, but I often had trouble hearing what he was saying, due to the sound of his voice, and sound interference from traffic.  Perhaps if I could have listened to it at home, I would have gotten more out of it.

For car listening, I found Tom Petty's show more enjoyable. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqyRGjH39CQ

The guy in the video died at the age of 32, he wanted to live like this off the grid in Reykjavik, the video is dedicated to him Type O Negative - Love You to Death I can't speak for myself but my dad has every Pink Floyd song known to man.  Ira Kaplan, you're so insecure! We like your music! It's good! Stop bugging us! Not of all time especially since it just came out, but I think You+Me album that just came out Rose Ave. was really good. I don't know anybody that has heard of it, it's a folk album between Dallas Green and P!nk. Rated #2 on Rolling Stones "500 Greatest Albums of All Time." If Nevermind and Ten were the only records ever made, this would be true.  Honestly, Pinkerton by Weezer. 

Clearly it isn't critically under appreciated, however I can't believe how many people have never even heard of it. It is really a shame that all of River's hard work wasn't appreciated when it came out because it really did a number on his willingness to be creative and put himself out there. Ever since I squeezed out my mamas bee curtains, 
I been writing 16s to make your self esteem worsen,

And you can take that shit to the heart like Steve Irwin

G-Mo Skee &lt;3 [July Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU5qp-cAtOU) is the obvious answer. The band contrasts the vocals by also having a female singer. Check them out, they haven't released a bad song. Neil Diamond - America I love that I could hear Bateman's voice as I read that.
 That is one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the 90s.  [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RByvzmmEFiQ) might be kind of you are looking for. Radiohead - Exit Music.

Has a great buildup toward the end.  American idiot  That album almost caused Rush to capsize as a band. It was 2112 that saved them.  AC/DC
Motorhead
Alice in chains (laine staley not that other dumbass who sings now) bazinga When I was in India, I was exposed to the music of Pandit Nikhil Banerjee, and it's amazing stuff.  I would highly suggest checking out some of his music.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikhil_Banerjee "I Can Hear The Heart Beating as One"  is one of the few albums that I keep going back to and binge listening after years and years.  That guitar solo at the end of "We're and American Band" ranks as one of my favorites.  Yea, they're great. [Elbow - Great Expectations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM95IKmEh6I) Scott Weiland - 12 Bar Blues The Police. Even though all three are reportedly egomaniacs, something sublime happened when they created music as a trio. With Arms Wide Open Arctic Monkeys - Humbug

They were criticized a lot for this album because they strayed away from their roots. But in reality it is one of their most important albums. [Darkside - Psychic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yod9tQdibDY&amp;list=PLTNZF3CguEwwATOlrUuvxX14dYM3zjkga) In general I think ambient music is under appreciated but if I were to choose one I'd say Laraaji's Ambient 2.  The Beautiful Letdown, by Switchfoot.  Math rock with a singer that sounds like death cab for cutie

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOHGTJoh498 At the Library

  It is a perfect teenage emotion song about being in the library and getting an instant crush on a girl and trying to get up the nerve to approach her.  I don't know why, but I think it is perfect. I have always avoid DB between 1985-2001, but I will give it a listen The Disintegration Loops by William Basinski 

So calming... Incredible music  The Avett Brothers.  They're from a town about fifteen minutes from where I grew up and I kick myself for not going to every one of their local shows when I was younger.  Up until about the past two albums, every single thing they put out was close to a masterpiece.  Personally I think *Emotionalism* is their best LP and *The Gleam* is their best EP. God damn is that a great album There is a live version of this song when they performed it at cornerstone festival in '07 that moved me to tears. The back story is that the entire song is about his absent father, and the night he preformed at cornerstone his father had passed away from cancer. So throughout the set he would sit down and cry. And during this performance of the widow he added another verse. It still gives me goosebumps. 
http://youtu.be/XErzhLkUbKk &gt; Distu

me too. second I got into this thread I hit ctrl + f and looked for disturbed. those guys are fucking amazon. it's too bad I've overplayed all their songs and I don't get that trill anymore. waiting on new stuff Do you like loud, crunchy guitar? Thunderous drum and bass? How about some organ? A lot of organ. A solo even? Did you you know: This album is considered one of the blue prints for heavy metal? It features the band's signature song and another that receives a decent amount of airplay, but is overall genius. There's an interesting story about the recording of it, immortalized by the vocalist and involving both Frank Zappa and The Rolling Stones, though they don't appear on the album. Mine. It's like an endless ride through the desert. You feel all kinds of things, but there's no one to talk to. Your only friend is the radio dj who comes on every now and then. File under: Kudzu  Anything by [Blackmill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZP_kxcTgKk) or [Bonobo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTjF2_-bneM)  Oddesy and Oracle by the zombies. Was their last ever album together and split soon after. Meant they could play what the wanted to and turns out it's a cracking album! 

Quality throughout and just some of the nicest songs I've ever heard always have it on!  Sigur Ros I started listening to Mastodon while playing the original Mount &amp; Blade.  No better combination exists on this earth. easy choice here Clutch is an amazing mix of Southern Rock with a Psychedelic Twist; big fans. I personally can't stand Pitchfork. I was always leery of music blogs until I came across "WeAllWantSomeone.org". Young kid about 25 who has been doing it for years out of New York. His favorite band (and mine) happens to be Arctic Monkeys, but he is extremely good at not making it a biased site or only catering to them. 

In fact, the majority of the time he's linking/talking/sharing about other bands. He sees probably close to ten shows a week and writes up reviews and offers samples every month (he used to offer samples, I'm not sure if he still does) and covers a wide range of styles, especially if you're into the alternative/indie side of things.

Plus he has a twitter and facebook page showing the same things, in case you don't feel like checking his site every day. He's been pretty successful and works hard at it, you can tell. I believe he's started a movie review site as well but I don't follow that.

But hey, I'm done gushing about some kid I don't know, it's starting to get weird. Just another option for you! Bizzare had literally the nastiest lines in ever D12 song he was on, including this. He was funny but seemed like an asshole. I actually met him and it turns out he was an asshole. I'd like to say its probably only time i would of been let down if someone famous i met wasn't an asshole. And that fucking count-out on the snare at the beginning of the song...oh lawdy lawdy gets me every time rage against the machine made a career out of frustrated with a ragey climax Shameless plug for /r/musicthemetime. It's fun! Pretty good, but hard to listen to after age 30 or so Regina spektor - ghost of corporate future

Marie Digby - Dear friend [Blind Pilot - Rounds and a Sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juvwlEO-x2o) (indie/folk)  
One one the best albums I have ever heard.  
Never seen it in articles, on tv or on the radio. Ride The Lightning? You think Fall Out Boy made the most underrated album of all time? Folie  Deux takes my number one spot as favourite album of all time. It baffles me how they were booed for playing songs from it on stage, how it got so much backlash that they had to go on indefinite hiatus just to feel like making music again. People suck.

I'm glad FOB are back but they will never ever beat Folie even though their 3 new albums are pretty badass! Eminem, Relapse Is it "your living all over me"? When I was 12 years old, I was dragged to a province wide conference for the jobs daughters group that my sister was part of.  It's basically a formal thing for girls and they all wear fancy dresses and elect queens and princesses. Very fancy stuff. At the dance that night, all the very high up older ladies were in attendance. Very proper kind of people. When the entire hAll of teenage girls started shouting the extra lyrics to mony mony, the looks on those ladies faces were priceless.  It's clearly Tommy, by The Who. I love every lyric in Awolnations "Kill Your Heroes".  Around these parts, it's "face down ass up that's the way we like to fuck" Tiny vessels- Death Cab for Cutie This post has been removed.

There ya go.  *Kid A* by **Radiohead** went completely over everyone's head when it was first released. Now it's rightly viewed as a modern masterpiece.  U2 - Zooropa

 U2's forays into darker alternative rock styles on "Achtung Baby" were continued on the highly experimental "Zooropa". The songs on this album emerged out of sessions in which band and Brian Eno experimented with free-form sound collages and long jam sessions. It originally was just supposed to be a low-key 6 song EP. but ended up a 10 track album. This album saw the band incorporate electronica, hip-hop, psychedelic rock, industrial rock, funk, synthpop, krautrock, noise rock, and even disco elements into their sound. Lyrically, it was a concept album about mass media and technology overload in the modern age and life in a dystopian, futuristic society, inspired by cyberpunk and science fiction works and the real-life 90s technology boom, the invention of the internet and rise of 24 hour cable news, uncertainty about Europe's future following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the formation of the EU, and start of the Bosnian War that occurred at the time.

The songwriting delves into themes of commercialism, post-Cold War politics, corporate advertising, mass media manipulation, over-reliance on technology, propaganda, futurism, superficiality and image, voyeurism, obsession, pornography consumption, sensory overload, societal disillusionment, monoculture, media-triggered nostalgia, death of a parent, unfilled desires, affluence, dependence, hedonistic lifestyles, the consequences of unrestrained indulgence and gluttony, post-apocalyptic life,  total societal collapse, fate, unrequited love, estranged relationships,dystopia, religious fanaticism, social isolation, survivalism, and judgment day.

Needless to say, the album was not one of U2's commercially successful, however many critics applauded the band for their experimentation. Today it is overshadowed by the critical and commercial success of its predecessor "Achtung Baby", the failure of U2's next album, the highly anticipated, 
, ironic and sarcastic "POP, and the unfortunate bland, safe, and MOR pop rock that the band has put out (and is what they are associated with today) ever since out of a misguided desire to be commercially successful and accessible to the general public as possible as they get older/less relevant. The *First* one? Im not ashamed to say, (nor should i be) Queen! The Blast Tyrant Album is one of the most amazing i have ever heard.   Were they ever death metal to begin with. Their metalcore past has always been a point of contention with others.  Seems like a reasonable response to an argument.  
 "Whiskey lullaby" I know allison Kraus is in it but not to sure the other person.

Also "I saw red"  by warrant.  Damn the feels.  Carbon Based Lifeforms and Daft Punk Unfortunately, the question of my opinion is limited to my experience. Having gotten that out of the way...

I don't understand how "Song Cycle" by Van Dyke Parks is only a cult classic, at best. It's absolutely flawless. (psychedelic folk, 1968) American Idiot-Green Day. Everyone and their mothers loves to remind me of it being "a middle school soundtrack".

That album is fucking phenomenal. Same here, but it was on a friends Sony Walkman on the bus.  he was jamming to it on the way home one day, and I asked what he was listening to.  heard the entire Black album that day, and been hooked since.  it's too bad the last 2 albums were not that great though....but still amazing band (especially live) Anthology by Alien Ant Farm. I think it was pretty much written off as a one hit wonder because of Smooth Criminal. It's a very technical album. Especially if you look at the rest of the rock music that was popular in 2001 when that album came out. Audioslave's self-titled debut. And even Out of Exile, too. Actually Audioslave in general.

Though I've pretty much come to terms that I may be the only one who holds this band in a higher regard than both Soundgarden and Rage. William Orbit - Pieces in a Modern Style Probably my favorite album of all time. I could talk for days about this album or BTS in general. Doug Martsch is pretty much my hero. I'd pretty much recommend this album to anybody. Link? I am guessing Songs for the Deaf.  Still unappreciated. Its far superior to Nevermind.   Ween. De-Loused and this are in my top 10 albums list.  * Death Cab For Cutie - What Sarah Said

[Big Sean - Memories Pt. 2 ft. John Legend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv4Nicyuqxg) Noidea, but thanks for the link Imagine being obsessed with a city, and then putting all sorts of facts and stories about that city into one big cluster of a concept album. And what is "art"? Is it only the classics? Monet, van Gogh? Is modern popular stuff like Warhol "art"? What about the guy who pisses in a bag of sour milk can we divorce the medium from the message (such as it is)? Some impressionistic abstract? A series of polaroids or pinhole camera shots in a world gone largely digital? Anne Geddes, Thomas Kincaid or the person who buys all the shit from flea markets and paints Star Wars and Nintendo characters into them. 

Do tell us about art and how homogeneous and equal it all is... Love - Forever Changes Hide and seek by Imogen Heap Always been a fan. Jesus on the dashboard!!! Vanilla Ice - "Hard to Swallow" I always preferred One Chord to Another, but both are solid as fudge. La Dispute maybe. They use a lot of imagery and it's very poetic. It's also very depressing at at times.  Frank Black- Teenager Of The Year More bitter and cynical than Elvis Costello? No way. They do have an interesting connection in that much of The News was the band on Elvis's first album.  Radiohead - Kid A The Royal Scam by Steely Dan. Great album. What could they have done if they hadn't split up... Got it, Operation Mindcrime by Queensryche.  Dog Man Star by Suede, or either album by Lightspeed Champion. Mars Volta new to you? Put this on, and let it play in the background... absorb it... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibyGl-mqYac One of my favourite bands. They are awesome live. Enjoy the gold you cheeky bastard. "[Devil Moon](http://youtu.be/VUiq4chNUhw?t=23m19s)" by swedish metal band Wolf is full of incredible lyrics:

"*My precious gold has turned to rust / And my former victory to bitter loss / Forgotten by the black and by the white / In an unholy alliance*."

And: "*My mind is ticking unclockwise / Each second closer to demise*."

"[Soul Society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDubchjrz1I)" by Kamelot is also thought-provoking:

"*How can we believe in heaven / Human reason counters all / Ideas of a soul society / My life is just a fragment / Of the universe and all / There must be more that I can see."*

And: *"In the dark we're the same / In the concept of time / We're like a grain in the sand / And we strive for the flame / As if death was our aim / 'Cause we cannot understand."* Sparklehorse, the album called It's A Wonderful Life. It's really beautiful. Just about any Senses fail song. I really like the lyrics to Four Years. I listened to it religiously at the end of my marraige. And lately I've been listening to The Rapture on repeat.  Sublime "Robbin The Hood". After their mainstream success they show their true colors buy recording in an abandoned crack house while chillin with a schizophrenic homeless man.

I always say, depression or oppression makes for great music, and I have a hunch that this album was recorded during The height of Bradley's heroin addiction. Makes for powerful music. A shame he went so early.  Do you hate yourself? Miserable because you got friendzoned by the love of your life yet again? Want to just end it all right now? Well then you need some sad music. Everyone knows sad music is reddit's favorite music, but you need something more than the usual Neutral Milk Hotel or Radiohead. You need something that will bring you to tears permanently so people outside of reddit will finally give you that attention you desire. Well I have just the album for you:  
[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L-RGT11mqg)  2 8 string guitars and drums. Words? We don't need no words where we're going. You just need to listen to feel the energy and emotion. It's got fast riffs and powerful melodies. Gets you super pumped. 

[Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbA3jxab4A0&amp;list=PLdRTTdaMjP9wqrVI0BSC_o1RliyAWX1Tf) alivelectric by The Slip.  this thing is all over the place good. Muse Father to Son and Some Day One Day remain some of my favorites.  Imagine that there is a surreal carnival off in the middle of an otherwise vacant, sun-baked field. It seemed to spring up overnight. You've heard tales of this particular traveling show anf how it is rife with oddities and surreal characters of all sorts. Goblin-esque children, howling madmen, a demented pianist tickling the ivories in the corner of the room. You visit this carnival, and you drop acid.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-lCRxIgT6KM No it doesn't. No way, get fucked, fuck off. If you see metal and pop together, plus "wall of sound" it's pretty much confirmed to be Devy. While we are talking about it! /r/musicthemetime, a subreddit I moderate, is based off of this program! We post a daily theme at 0:00 UTC and post songs that relate to that theme. Todays theme is "Name Calling"!  Straight outta the driveway Solo Monk by Thelonious Monk

It's a piano masterpiece with just Monk playing away. Everyone should take a listen. I'm curious as to who has heard of this album or listened to it. This album is a three-dimensional masterpiece from a prominent rock band, yet is contains very little guitar and almost all electronic drums and percussion. The singer wrote lyrics by randomly picking words out of a hat, yet they somehow fit perfectly. Critics and fans were puzzled when it was first released, but now it's viewed as a modern electronic/rock masterpiece. The band had to hire a second drummer to perform this music in a live setting.  Draiman has mentioned on his Facebook page that Disturbed WILL come back together for a new album. It's just a question of 'when' now.  Their catalogue is very large and I've yet to get through much of it.  I will say that "autumn sweater" has some of the most beautifully Erie organ chords I've ever heard. Thanks so much this is amazing. Did you figure this all out yourself? Alter Bridge - In Loving Memory

 I'm over  through. I have found some new music thanks to ttrh. Good stuff. Butterfly for sure. Its what it sounds like when you drive through the desert.  Familiars by The Antlers I listen to sleep [meditation music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txQ6t4yPIM0). It's really relaxing. It supposedly helps you get into a calming rhythm with delta waves or something but I have no idea if theres any truth to that. I think listening to music really helps with sleep because it stops your mind racing which mine tends to do when I try to sleep. And music without lyrics doesn't distract me enough to keep me awake.  Never heard of this group before, I approve \m/ Beautiful song. I would suggest anyone who likes this to also listen to Man That You Fear by Marilyn Manson. I think what Rock N' Roll Suicide was to Ziggy Stardust is what Man That You Fear was to Antichrist Superstar. Love sloan. Commonwealth is a brilliant album. That doesn't get enough credit,media,or playtime in my mind. East Hastings? Michael Jackson. One day my dad brought home a dvd collection of all of his music videos and from there I was hooked. I have a massive collection of memorabilia somewhere in my closet. His sound really influenced a lot of what I listen to today. It was powerful, powerful stuff.  Definitely! I just heard one of their songs the other day and I was like "dude when I was younger I listened to this album on repeat! What happened to them!" They are a national treasure. I want to snuggle up between Ira and Georgia in bed. Then, if we have trouble sleeping, maybe have a jam session. Dude Ranch - blink-182 Woo! You beat me too the plug! Definitely my favorite subreddit. [Nine Inch Nails - Leaving Hope](http://youtu.be/l-GwX5x1cio)

Easily the saddest song I know. Maybe just because it came out a week before a friend killed themselves and it's emotionally tied to that event, but I find myself tearing up listing to it right now. They make timeless albums, are amazing live, and have touched on so many styles during their long career, making each one their own, so they never get boring like one of those bands that makes the same album over and over again.  They can do so much as a three piece band because they each play multiple instruments.  They are an extremely tight unit which is rare for a band with an experimental side, and their harmonies are heavenly.  Such an amazing band with a great back catalog, and they're never afraid to bust out a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFy6tJRkxFY](cover) or two.   Link I don't think that's under appreciated, at least by people who enjoy rap/hip-hop. Unorthodox and more modern compared to others here. But I think recess by Skrillex was amazing with a lot of different styles and sounds. It was engineered perfectly. It was unique and refreshing to listen to. And I think you should give the whole album a listen to if you haven't. Building something out of nothin - Modest Mouse....Can make me weep like a baby every time 'Sparks', especially.

Still listen to &amp; love all of their music!   I did NOT like it as much as Is This It (and was pretty vocal about it, too), but it's got great songs. I listened to it all the time when it first came out. I remember hanging out with one of my friends, and a track from Room on Fire came on. I started singing along, and he looks at me like I'm the hugest hypocrite and says "I thought you hated this album." I replied, "I said Is This It was way better, not that I hated Room on Fire." Still how I feel about it. Room on Fire is great, but Is This It was near-perfect. It will always live in the shadow of Is This It, no matter how good some of the tracks are. Pushit by Tool

An alternate take on the same song live (amazing still)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgDwkSlCwHw Yeah, no one ever really talks about PB. I thought it was a solid effort but how do you follow Demon Days? Hhaha, this maybe the largest surprise ever.  you are not wrong, my friend Gaby lala did some work with claypool.  Pay the man is an awesome offspring song, but I think that is a guitar effect. The Postal Service  Try listening to a mellow talk radio show.  I listen to Coast to Coast AM with George Noory.  I'm asleep within 5 minutes of listening. Cowboy Bebop is the name of the show it's from - The Real Folk Blues is the song name. A TASTEMAKER IS HERE. It went platinum in one week in the UK, debuted at number 1 in the US, sold over 4 million copies worldwide, and is often considered one of the greatest albums of the 2000s. It's quite far from being under appreciated. What happened to the funk? I believe it fell off the soul train somewhere along the long road of rock. Its bits and pieces wandered, occasionally hitching a ride on some alternate sounds. But the funk was lost for a generation, not given the chance to evolve.

But the funk--the dance, the off-beat, the sex--was discovered in the most unlikely place. In a dark alley, between the stark roads of grunge and indie, the soul of funk was claimed. From this alley the funk woke with the yearning sex howl of decades of silence. The dance, the off-beat, the sex returned with a roar. The streets beat in syncopated unity at the prodigal son's revival.

The funk may have taken a new appearance. To an untrained eye, this new vein of funk may have lacked any similarities. But the sex, the dance, the off-beat was back with the visceral cries only the funk could produce. And so the evolution began.

enjoy your sleep! &gt;implying taste is objective Yup. This one caught me by surprise a couple of years ago, and literally *not one person* had *ever* recommended it to me before that.  Damn, I've been eating up solo piano so thanks for this! and as a result everything he created after was shit designed to be as commercially successful as possible I'm gonna try to get to as many of these as I can.  Listening to this right now and it's really good.  Thx for your input. I knew exactly who you were talking about when you posted this. Love them, went to see them live a few months ago and they did not disappoint. Even better was they mingled in the general crowd and bar area with everyone, really cool bunch, especially Chris. ONE OK ROCK... They're a Japanese rock band, I heard one of their songs used on a video on YouTube, Shazamed that b**** as fast as I could, got on iTunes, bought the entire discography. 

Did not regret it ever since, I'd recommend their songs to anyone who loves rock and wants to experience foreign music  :) Pink houses. John cougar mellencamp  Nirvana. Or as much as I could. Saving up for $25 bootlegs at the CD shop 45 minutes away.  Do you ever want your concept albums to be more vague. Have you ever looked for what might be a concept album, but at the same time might not. Are you looking for an album that blends an arty leaning with pop instincts, with noise that doesn't sound like noise. An album that has influenced both modern composers, to hardcore bands. An album that might be about a writer, other bands, or just a collection of songs. What if I told you this was one of the most critically acclaimed albums of all time?
[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVwJMOtfJbU) Absolutely. The title track is a hidden gem. They are in a beautiful)(and long) Relient K song called This Is The End,  or at least the lead singer is. Haven't heard from them since!  This guy is going to love it. Sadly this is their only RPG based record others are pulpy and good but this is the only one where they went balls out into geekdom.  I went on a major British music bender a while ago and got hooked on The Bravery, Kaiser Chiefs, and Bloc Party.

Man those songs bring back some memories of a different me a  long time ago.  Is that Miami? I'd also like to include Angles. Love the album. It is distinctly different to any other album with its electronic samples and upbeat rhythm, but I still believe that Room on Fire is more underrated. Beer for my Horses by Toby Keith Thomas Jefferson Kaye: First Grade. You think it might be middle of the road west coast singer songwriter pap, but it is so much more. Includes an epic Becker and Fagen song - "American Lovers" - plus one other "Jones." The album is hangover ennui. If you can find it, on CD it is teamed with his first s/t album.  Testament - The Gathering (1999)

One of my favorite heavy metal albums. IMO really anything by Testament kicks ass. I feel that they are a severely under appreciated band. If you're a fan of thrash metal such as Slayer or Megadeth and have not listened to Testament, check these guys out. I promise you will not be disappointed.  Country Roads, Sweet Home Alabama I remember the Q Magazine review: Dog man arse. whoosh? What's it like? Black Sabbath - Born Again.


Black Sabbath with Deep Purples' Ian Gillian on vocals produced one amazing jam. He said bass  Did you see the MTV World Stage concert recording of it?  I refuse to delete it off my DVR.  They're an amazing live show. I used to work at a venue they played at. It's very near Mexico so they wanted tacos. I went got em some and we ate them. Good times. Emenius Sleepus, Nice Guys Finish Last, Coming Clean, 2000 Light Years Away, and Whatsername are my favorite individual tracks but my favorite albums as a whole are American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown  I really love Yo La Tengo's music. I'm looking forward to their next album.

If you like long, droney, noisy, guitar freak outs, check out their rooftop performance of ["And The Glitter Is Gone"](http://youtu.be/gYF4wbyrNyY?list=PLiRCROLlhFiXln3g3QfpYN4f0M1-rJ2r6).
 Black and Blue by The Rolling Stones.

This masterpiece tends to be dismissed by fart-sniffers, but it is, indeed, their Best Album.

That's right, Chief.  Their Best Album.  Why?  Because I have every one of their albums, many on different formats, many several times over, and I listen to Black and Blue every day.  Front to back.

It's flawless. "Smile like you mean it and it will be returned." 

It's in a song called Father Mountain by Nahko &amp; Medicine For The People.  Meat Loaf - Bat out of Hell. Every song is a great love song. Gets better with every listen. I know this album, but I can't seem to remember the name.

Let me ask my fire drill buddy Sleepy Jack. Colossal's record Welcome the Problems. Totally amazing, no one has ever heard of it. They're my favorite band:

Mostly known for the semi-hit *Three Strange Days*, the album feels like the soundtrack for a movie nobody ever made. Great blend of early 90's college rock that is infinitely replayable. The Smashing Pumpkins - Adore. People think this is when they lost their momentum and changed too much, but it's insanely underrated and IMO one of *the* best albums ever. 

I love that each new album sounds completely different than the previous one. Yeah I think you've got it. Also considering the Final Cut was a giant OMG Thatcher you killed my dad... I'd say the wall is pretty damn spot on. Those are the main overarching themes in it. Shaggy -- Best Of Shaggy Check this guy out:

[Ice Cream Drugs Rubber Goods by the Dinner Is Ruined. ](http://youtu.be/bpQfILZZjgY) The Devil and God Are Raging Inside of Me-Brand New. An amazing album with some of the most beautifully written songs. It digs deep into despair and throws you into uncontrollable angst all in the same forty minutes.  So did she just give up singing?? It was one of those "The End....?" Kind of things but yeah. I'm a huge fan of DJ Food's [Kaleidoscope](http://open.spotify.com/album/6NZdnBIelaaa2jVnrZL5jV). No one seems to know it, but even though I listen to music virtually non-stop every day, I keep coming back to it as my favorite. It's alternately weird, funny, moody, introspective, and relaxing, a mix I don't think I've heard from any other record. Scrolled and scrolled and scrolled and found no one answering ...

**Pink Floyd**

Their music was a a huge part of my life growing up. David Gilmour was my idol.  Manic Street Preachers - The Holy Bible.

Just listen. I love that album, the entire Ambient series is incredible. [10 Years - So Long, Goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-8GeJNVM2Y) I would have added the theme of someone going mad, seeing as a lot of the songs (Brain Damage especially) tie in to Syd. Cloud Nothings - Attack on Memory  I dunno, I think funk-metal is different than like thrash-metal obviously haha. La Dispute - somewhere at the bottom of the river between vega and altair

The whole album is pretty much about how his wife cheated on him; it's very personal and emotional.

 Brand New To be fair, it does have an arse on the cover. the offspring

 Elliot Smith - Needle in the hay for sure

The National - Slow show Well... some kind of metal. They're quite death metal influenced, even if the lyrics aren't about gore. Maybe metalcore is the right word.  someone isn't getting into Dorsia  I have always been a Yo La Tengo fan. I have heard, tho, from a friend that went and saw them live recently that it was an awful show and would never see them live again. I was surprised, but he said it almost put him off them completely. 10cc-The Original Soundtrack Misplaced Childhood by Marillion  
This album haunts me, and must be listened to without interruption.   In terms of an album that is seen as inferior to the rest of their discography by the public, I'd say "Suck It and See" by the Arctic Monkeys.

To me, that album is a modern Pop Rock masterpiece. Amazing lyrics, though initially jarring in their surreal imagery, variable and emotionally satisfying songwriting across the album, and it rocks hard at times while still maintaining extremely catchy hooks and pop sensibilities.

So yea, I love that album. [Antony and the Johnsons' take on Knocking on Heaven's Door from the *I'm Not There* soundtrack.](http://youtu.be/cNpCx_TDO24)  A moving and refreshing take on a song I never thought I'd want to hear again. I have to say Danger Days by My Chemical Romance was severely underrated. I don't know if it is the most underrated of all time but it's definitely one of the most underrated in recent memory.  Starts off with a slow little tinkling and a siren sound for about 20 seconds, then EXPLODES in your face with soaring vocals that don't seem to fit the beat at first but gradually wraps around you. Hard to describe, honestly the first time I heard it I thought it noise, but once the music in there finds you, it does not let go.

The whole album is a story about a man going into a coma and the fantastical experiences he has in his mind, but you'd never get that from the lyrics, just the liner notes. The lyrics are nonsensical for the most part, it takes many many listens to hear all the levels.  Every time I listen to it as a whole I discover something I missed the last time around.

This guy... Chris is a really cool dude. I've seen both of his bands live, and each time he's just super cool to hang around with in the crowd. We have a winner :) but it is nowhere near underrated. It is probably one of their most celebrated records outside of Dookie.  I have a couple, and I can't link since I'm on mobile. Anyway:

Something in the Way - Nirvana. Imagine the worst existential crisis you could have, then dump it into song form. That's that song.

Weatherman - +44. "Yesterday I found my worst regret. I'll hid it away so no one ever knows. I'm dying; I'm trying to leave. Let me slip away, I'm barely holding on. Every now and then I feel the end of us." I think it really just nails the thoughts during terribly awful, depressing, stressful time. No it Isn't by them is also depressing. It was a bad time for Mark. I would go with the Moon and Antarcitca by Modest Mouse. Hardcore MM fans go with Lonesome Crowded West and Good News for People Who Love Bad News is probably their most popular, but front-to-back, Moon and Antarctica manages to actually capture the emotions of feeling alone in a massive space. And "The Cold Part" actually gives me chills. One could argue they do some technical death metal, but definitely not regular death metal. One of the top efforts in extreme music. Machinegun beats pummeling your ears into submission, furious vocals picking you back up and making your blood boil, and delicious grooves making your head bop. Pent up anger will be let out like a triggered landmine.
[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZAKk3kxI1o) Have you listened to For Whom The Bells Tolls? Come on. This is the one record everyone can name by the band.  Of course, but Spikes future was always to go back and resolve *that situation that occurred, that started before he left the gang*. He had merely ran away from what he knew was his future, did his stint on the bebop, and returned after acknowledging that his future wouldn't be anything but, that he couldn't run forever. I was the same, heard 'time of the season' from a few films and tv shows and stuff, and thought who is this band! 
After finding that album I was hooked, I am amazed it has never really been compared to any other stuff from the time such as the Beatles as to me they sound as good as if not better. 
 Space jam soundtrack. That shits my jam  You mad bro? But is it underrated in his discography. Bat out of Hell I and II are his most popular with III underrated.  The album 'My Medicine' by an Irish band called 'Wilt', seriously  great stuff. Persephone's Bees- Notes from the underworld. It's such an upbeat, happy album but with some humor and really beautiful melodies and lyrics.  No one I've ever talked to has heard the album, but the best way I can describe it is 'comfy'  [Project 86 - Solace](http://youtu.be/mtHHd0nioCc) True indeed.

And it's a load of arse, too. Probably something that won't get upvoted because people have never heard of it? *Slightly* before my time, but,

Coasters Just came across The Fire and the Thud on YT the other day, so I am just discovering this album now.   They've actually remained pretty great! Lots of music. And Jon Foreman (frontman) has done many solo albums and side projects with another in the works. They put out a documentary with their latest album that is on Netflix, I highly recommend it!  Rocket 88 is considered the first rock and roll song of all time, which was released in 1951. Personally my favorite is Johnny B Goode by Chuck Berry, which was released in 1958 "The Ugly Organ" -Cursive Radiohead This album starts with a birth. You grow up, and the further you go, the more terrifying life gets. Child molesters, social alienation, divorce. Just when you don't think you can take anymore, the floor drops out from under you and everything is going to be alright. The singer cares less about notes and more about melody.  
The lyrics are lucid dream woven by a loose narrative.  
There is a goddamn singing-saw solo.  
It's so unique, it almost deserves its own subgenera. Sam's Town by The Killers. It was a different style than Hot Fuss so people were put off but its amazing. Master of Puppets? Do you want to enter an emotional roller coaster? This album is both soothing and electric, but has all the right energy for both. Each song flows beautifully into the other as you go through a journey. Enter a realm where you can attach your own personal story to each change in tempo.

[Link](http://youtu.be/5CIo83emfSE) Weatherbox - Flies in All Direction Audioslave is definitely more up my alley as I get older, and not so angry about "the man" and politics, compared to Rage. I also really really love Chris Cornell's voice, so that adds a big component to it for me. It's basically Rage + Chris Cornell - Whiny Zach De La Rocha, so I'm on board for that.

Tough to compare Audioslave and Soundgarden, though. They are two entirely different things, both of them amazing. I've seen them live a few times (Bakerton Group as well). I really enjoy their music and they ROCK HARD when playing live. Tons of energy. Willy Nelson is still my favorite song of theirs. :) Waves of nostalgic and warm synth chords integrated with chopped up drum machine loops. Distorted samples from 70s media and documentaries that give an impending sense of sadness and although it is quite melodic, it has a very melancholic overtone. Not quite explained track titles and lack of vocals add even more mystery to this beautiful, strange journey of an album.
[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7bKe_Zgk4o) I'm pretty sure Dr. Disc in Hamilton ON (sorry not in Cali) sells unsigned/local artists on consignment (get paid for what the store sells and if the store doesn't want to stock it anymore just give back the leftover inventory). This may be an option you could look into. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XP5e9CUNAZk 

This clip is an excellent song, not so much sitar, but check it out around 1:58 when the teenage girl begins to sing...awesome.

Also, buy anything Ravi Shankar. Tune in to 103.3 Princeton WPRB on Saturday mornings they have a great show featuring Indian music.

Also, I would recommend purchasing Sound of Wonder. The music featured is taken from 60's, 70's Bollywood psychedelia. Interesting combination western and eastern instrumentation, and the songs are just fucking awesome.

Also, you may want to look up the term raga...I think that's how it's spelled.

Enjoy! Yup My friend introduced me in 2001 and I tried to buy all the albums as soon as I could it was pretty hard to find them back then but once Good News for People who love Bad News came out it got much easier. Power Puff Girls-Heroes and Villains. Compilation / song story. Devo, Shonen Knife, Bis, etc.  Catherine Wheel- Adam and Eve
Radiohead - ok computer (not sure if its that under appreciated)
Portishead (pretty much anything by them)
Neil Young - Live at Massey Hall (one of the best live albums I have ever heard)

 Learn to read bruh I wish I knew the business details, but we do have a small record store here in Columbia, Missouri that carries local bands' self-releases, along with a decent backstock of relatively obscure indie artists' label releases. So hey, stores do it, but like I said, I have no idea of the details, I am merely a consumer. It's interesting to note that it was the failure of Caress of Steel that led them to 2112. Caress of Steel did so poorly, that the record company came to the bands manager and told them to produce short, easily consumable, radio friendly hits. Rush responded with a 21 minute long epic. They figured that if they were going to go out, they were going to go out on their own terms, so the album was like a screw you to the record company. When 2112 sold like hot cakes, the record company gave Rush free reign to do whatever they wanted without their interference. Highly Refined Pirates - Minus the Bear. Awesome band. I don't know too many people who've really given them a shot.  Yeah most people consider that album a near-classic... hardly "under-appreciated". At least a lot of the other choices on this thread are good. [This playlist helps me sleep.](http://open.spotify.com/user/121005385/playlist/3mfBXHJ5aWtgCGBYXTbVdt) It's called True Ambient.

Most things decay in a matter of days

The product is sold, the memory fades"

Porcupine Tree - [Dark Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOAGRgruHwA)

One of my favorite Porcupine Tree lyrics. Perfectly sums up the current state of music and that no matter how much of yourself you   out into your music, unless it appeals to whatever is currently popular, it may never be fully recognized for what it is, and eventually forgotten. *A Momentary Lapse of Reason* by Pink Floyd. It gets a lot of criticism for fairly obvious reasons, but I think it stands up well, particularly compared to the Roger-Waters-led stuff. Not on a Friday, anyway.  Oh no, this is turning into: My favorite record. 

[Mort Garson - Plantasia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVmcKcTZ4A) (1976)

An electronic record designed to promote healthy plant growth. It is so incredibly smooth and odd that I am surprised it hasn't become more of a cult classic.  such a great album, have you ever seen them live? they're supposedly fantastic. Some of my personal favorites who may not be obscure but never really see them get much recognition to my knowledge are:
Pearl Jam
Benefit (rapper)
Matt corby
Bonobo
And John Frusciante's Solo shit since splitting with RHCP Agreed. Steely Dan was such a perfectionist, it takes a lot of listening, to any of his albums, to fully appreciate them. Do you like heavy prog? Or do you like something thats a little more easy to listen to? This album will take you all over the spectrum of progressive music with their creativity, skill, and vision. The album goes from heavy to jazzy to powerful vocal ballads to even horns. It's something that you just have to listen for yourself. 

[Here you go]( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oIY4X8yi5Oo)

 FUCK THE MODS I'm a big fan of 'Obscured by Cloud' by Pink Floyd. It's overshadowed by the amazing albums that came after it, which is a shame, because although it's obviously not as good as what followed, it's a really great record. No, no that is perfect. I'm looking for places *outside* Cali. Thanks! YES.  Zooropa is a great fuckin' record.

Zooropa is U2's best work. Good call! They can name is, but I do beleive it is under appreciated. EoTS gets all the love, but this album is what set the whole movement off.  I really loved it. I especially enjoyed the [cassette sharing between Dylan and Tom Waits.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwqpKq7NKCM) Those were great. Nobody goes to Dorsia anymore. We're going to Texarkana. Good choice.  I won't agree that it's their best, but it's definitely a great album. I was thinking of because the Internet-childish gambino, but that also works  [Damn, you got him!](http://apocalypstick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/patrick-bateman.gif) What up dog? by Was, Not Was [Mingus Big Band - Moanin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__OSyznVDOY).  Three guys on a journey to change the world. Taking down the label industry one show at a time. Hosting the largest independent free concert of all time. With reggae roots and elegiac lyrics. They are... the one and only... New album's sooooo good Cool? This is very helpful. Can you tell me the name? &gt; They're quite death metal influenced, even if the lyrics aren't about gore.

That is a small section of death metal.

AllMusic: 4.5/5

Pitchfork: 9.2/10

Tiny Mix Tapes: 5/5 Sweet to see USS on here! They were one of the first local shows I ever went to back in like 2007. They're good stuff! **PERMABANNED** Midwest Porcupine Tree - Fear Of A Blank Planet

Just a fantastic album in allnreapects from start to finish. Guitar work as brilliant as Built To Spill  
Lyrics as good as Dylan  
Hooks as huge as Abba 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq6tlkt71sc The Band's self-titled album, the so-called 'brown album'.  Everything about it is unique.  Its cover is black and white photo of five guys dressed like they are in the Civil War standing in the rain on a beaten path.  At a time where psychedelia was in, and the more outlandish the better, they stuck to roots and americana, no screeching electric guitars or dependence on strictly blues.  

the album is literally a trip through old America and bridges it to the present.  The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, a story on the hardships of war for the poor families it effects, King Harvest Has Surely Come, a farmer who has swallowed his pride and gone to a union for protection, Across the Great Divide, which implores you to follow the American ideal of creating a new life for yourself and your family, and so many others.

Not to mention that musically, it is brilliant.  Jawbone, written in 6/4 time, the sousaphone on Rag Mama Rag, Garth Hudson basically inventing that funky clavinet sound on Up on Cripple Creek, i mean this whole album is catchy as hell and great to listen to.  It doesn't get nearly enough credit historically for the masterpiece that it is.   So, you want to make it in the music business? This album contains all you need to know about how it works. Groupies, producers, critics, and of course, music.    
Not sold out? Well, it features one of the most talented drummers your ears have ever heard, out of this world guitar solos, contextual continuity, and of course, the german language.   

[Have fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TS6ce9Ve8) At the time it was considered cutting edge. Fusing elements of early metal with what can only be coined as skate punk.
Loud and heavy, fast and short this album put them on the map for decades to come. No other album the band put out ever came close to their debut save an ep of covers some years later.

  The are cutting an album at the back of our ranch in Dripping Springs, Texas right now.  We can sit out and listen to them live. Ground Dweller by Hands Like Houses. Many people who would hear it might just call it a post-hardcore noise wall (I've seen several reviews that said this,) but those are some of the most fantastic lyrics I've ever heard, and the sound is good in its own right. It's true, it's a high-energy affair from start to finish, but the whole package is really fantastic and, I would say, impactful. I bet it would be more popular if you didn't need a lyrics sheet to understand what the guy is saying. Would totally recommend it to people who don't normally like post-hardcore or anything on that side of the genres. new one is pretty good. not pinkerton/blue album good, but it's a decent album. This is in fact "Ambient 3," produced by the one and only Brian Eno, and his first four Ambient recordings are all phenomenal, and I think for certain not underappreciated in the ambient/electronica culture.

That said, Ambient 3 is simply amazing! The hammered dulcimer is an intensely cool instrument and the layers and atmosphere that this album creates cannot be denied for their awesomeness.

 Here Are The Sonics - The Sonics. Such a killer debut from a very under rated band. Essentially the first real garage rock album and its kick ass. The follow up, Boom, is also pretty on point.  Big fan of Neil Fallon and his work, all the while being a pretty quiet and introverted guy. Always figured they're like the southern psych-rock version of Tool... but then Puscifer happened! I had heard of it because of this list from Tom Waits http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/mar/20/popandrock1

That also turned me onto The Delivery Man by Elvis Costello which is fantastic. Also turned me onto Trout Mask Replica. I'm still having trouble consuming that one. Solo Monk is a great album (Everything Happens to Me is the best cut IMO) but it wasn't under appreciated to my knowledge.

BTW, it's "I Hadn't *Told* Anyone Till You", if someone is looking the song up. Probably Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd DAE [10] Out of Exile was such a tight album. To me it's a non-skip album. Every song is awesome. They all have killer intros, perfect vocals, and great hooks. Morello was totally let off his leash and it showed in the solos he ripped out, Cornell wrote some damn fine lyrics, and each song was just different enough that you could tell it was all the same band, but you couldn't confuse any of the songs.

Time for me to put in Out of Exile again... I never understood why Dexter Freebish was unable to capture a huge amount of attention via the alt/pop market after releasing A Life of Saturdays.  I thought that was a great album for the genre from the first to last track. More like, Hard to Swallow Suge Knights dicks when he gave all his royalties to him. Death Cab for Cutie's Narrow Stairs. The attitude toward FOB (at least when that record was released) was that nobody took them seriously. That's probably still true. Being universally despised is a pretty good place to start if you want to come out of left field with something good.

But yeah, probably not the most underrated album ever. And Justice for All... by Metallica.  This album got a lot of backlash and is seen as the album in between their speed metal days and the black album. Cliff passed away on tour so this is the first album with Jason newstead on bass.  This is by far my favorite Metallica album and in my overall top 5.  You really see the entire band take a giant leap forward in song writing. Not only did James vocals and lyrics get better but the progression on almost every song is flawless. Unfortunately this album also marked the end of an era... because the next album was thee bkack one.... Texas Funeral by Jon Wayne That's everyone's favorite stroke album bruh It's honestly their only album that I would consider great. No it isn't. And Green Day never should have been inducted into the hall of fame in their first year of eligibility. Or any year for that matter. What a joke.

Hold on, my mom wants to throw her 2 in...  I'm not too into the genre myself but here are some of my favorites:

Swimming Pools by Kendrick Lamar

Bad Guy by Eminem (or really anything by Eminem)

The entire "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" album by Kanye West Absolutely thought you were talking about Kveikur by Sigur Rs Childish Gambino - Because The Internet.

Some people just didn't get it. Awesome, thanks!!  Oh yeah, that album is only known for *Time of the Season* but I was blown away by how consistently good it was when I finally listened to the whole thing. More like most over rated album and probably his worse! Quadrophenia by The Who.  It's the best album ever and a lot of people don't even know that. Up vote for Spilt Milk. There's not a weak moment on that album. Some of the best songcraft around and nobody knows 'em. Massive Attack- Mezzanine



DJ Shadow- Endtroducing...



Swans- Soundtracks for the Blind



Suicide- Suicide Their self titled is one of the best rock albums I've ever heard. This is the reason Rush is my favorite. Doesn't everyone hate the shitty glam-metal Pantera stuff? too be far, out of context that sounds like a very articulate and well thought out album review My honest opinion is totally skewed. We found Speedy Motorcycle in a commercial, looked it up online (back when p2p programs like Kazaa were popular, and died laughing. The lyrics are so completely ridiculous that we thought the song was a joke.

But I know nothing of the rest of their music. So I don't have a valid opinion.  * [Bjork - "Pagan Poetry"](http://youtu.be/KqF8_UcUQdQ)

Tychozorente - Omar Rodriguez Lopez What a fantastic album. I'm not sure if it was under appreciated at the time, but Love has been almost completely forgotten. Unless your parents were a psychedelic 60s music fan or you listed to a 1001 albums before you die list, you'll probably miss out on this gem. Violator by Depeche Mode Saw them back in 2011? They were so kick ass. One of my favorite bands for sure. Neil Fallons beard game is on point.  For soft piano music, "Hopes and Fears" by Keane
 My man! The lonesome crowded west. oh....fuck you.  &gt; Laraaji's Ambient 2

Did you mean Ambient 3, with Brian Eno, or Ambient Zither in G Pentatonic? 

I did not think he played on The Plateaux of Mirror.  All Clutch is good Clutch.  There is no bad Clutch. this is funk/punk but is a must listen

Tears for Fears - Everybody Loves a Happy Ending
Oasis - Dig Out Your Soul

 Nothing wrong with that. If an album is successful then that means a lot of people obviously liked it. Nothing wrong with making music people like right? I can't believe I've gone my whole life without watching that video. Thank you for making my day. The Long Beach Dub Allstars albums were fuckin great too.  It should be RAS-1 with them now not that other Chode Pearl Jam is definitely discussed often here found the /mu/tant If anyone says anything by *Neutral Milk Hotel* I swear I'm gonna hit the unsubscribe button. "Suge, can you tell us what happened?"...
.."Bitch ass punk scuffed my Tim's, so you know, I had to take care of business".....
.."oh, well it all makes sense now"...
Hope he get's to ride the lightning! "No Code" by Pearl Jam....always gets overlooked. One of my favorite "Rap with a message" songs is [B. Dolan's Which Side Are You On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKHf1YVATfk) I can't explain why "All My Friends" moves me the way it does, but it does. Also, once I watched [i]Shut up and Play the Hits[/i], "Losing My Edge" became a very morose song too. This!  Breakfast in America - Supertramp
North American Scum - LCD Soundsystem
America - Spinal Tap
Young Americans - David Bowie
We're An American Band - Grand Funk Railroad

 "Bat Out of Hell has been certified by the Recording Industry Association of America as a platinum album, fourteen times over. The album went on to become one of the most influential and iconic albums of all time and its songs have remained classic rock staples."

I wouldn't say that this album is under-appreciated. More over played if you ask me. Absolutely! I could listen to the first two albums back to back without a single skip.

It's too bad Revelations wasn't so great, and then they split. But such is the path of the "supergroup" band. Saucerful of Secrets by Pink Floyd

not a lot of people listen to early Floyd (if I had a nickel for every time someone refers to dark side as their early work) but I love it. also dat kazoo on corporal clegg.  check out this [remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVOWV8RzDHg) of it, it seems even more bleak.  I love FAD. it's probably one of my favorite FOB records besides IOH. 

I also don't understand why people, almost a full two years since their return, continue to expect TTYG2.0?!?! Like I'm sorry but this boggles my mind. FOB kind of do whatever they want and it's honestly been wildly successful for them. I never ever see the one of the best rock bands of the 90s, Unwound, discussed here. In fact, most 90s hardcore never gets talked about here. **Explosions in the Sky | All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone**

It is generally looked over in favor of their "big two" albums that preceded it, but it is far and away their best work in my opinion. Speaking on a purely subjectively level, it provides a feeling within me that no other album -before or since- has ever touched upon. I cannot generally explain the feeling, but it is one of loss, sadness, and regret. You'd think a person would strive to avoid feeling any of those things, but as they culminate together on this album -and as "So Lonesome" ends- I feel... comfort. It reminds me a great deal of someone I've lost and possibly never had to begin with. It is instrumental music that gives me the incalculable gift of solace. Congratulations by MGMT. After they released an album that everyone loved for those 3 singles, MGMT put their earnings towards perfecting their psychedelic sound. Everyone puts it down for some reason though. It's incredibly ambitious and honestly one of the best psych albums I've ever heard. Even their self-titled deserves a mention. MGMT pretty much did the opposite of selling out. Speak for yourself, I didn't discover Clutch until 2004 at the age of 39 this year I turn 50 and I listen to them regularly. 


Never grow up and you can never grow old.... Landing on Water - Neil Young Dragging a Dead Deer Up A Hill -- Grouper
Anything by her is incredibly atmospheric.  Bran Vann 300 - Glee.  so diferent and fresh today as it ever was. From Drinkin' in LA, to Supermodel. class in its purest form no, not new but this track came on random and i had forgotten how cool this little track was. Solid Air by John Martyn. Criminally underrated musician, he seems to get overlooked but I'm certain he's one of the greatest songwriters Britain has produced.  3, of course! Sorry for the mistake. Yes, it's appreciated in our circles but I wanted to pick the one from that series I thought was under appreciated. I mean we could talk about things like Kevin Kendle's Lagoon of Eternity or Erik Wllo's Wind Chimes but I thought I'd pick something at least a bit recognizable.  There are so many reasons to love Rush :) that album was whack. Perhaps he ran them accents into the ground. Spooky. The first album that jumped to mind for me was Soup as well. Great minds and all that... Waka Flocka Flame - Flockaveli

IMO the most influential rap album of the last five years [Giles Corey - No one is ever going to want me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eO-eAldJmA8) I rarely see anyone talk about Sage Francis around here. He is an extremely talented hip-hop artist and always seems to get overlooked  Songs about cars, truckin', how one's crying hasn't done any good, like that? this The song title? I don't remember. It's the record called f# something something  Fucking fantastic live. Consistently good too, they've never made a substandard album.

Other bands like them are Red Fang, Kylesa, Baroness and Kvelertak. Loved these guys for a long time, always impressed with each new album and theyre one of the only bands that completely changes the soundscape for each album. You could argue a few sound similar but still each one has its own flavor, always dig it Trophy Scars and Rabbit Junk come to mind but there are probably more niche subs where they are talked about. Dinah is a classic and I love Monk but for some reason his version of the song is my least favorite.  Here are the only two in my collection that match your description

[40 Top Downtempo &amp; Ambient Chillout Hits 2013](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/40-top-downtempo-ambient-chillout/id728472840)

Good luck with your search! 3, changed it. My mistake! This is the real answer. Suge? Oh, not my Suge. He was a good boy. Look at this picture if him from 1982.  Pearl jam and john frusciante. Are you fucking me? 1. dank memes

2. Which part of my comment in particular? If you are into progressive/alternative-rock then this album is for you, but as with all music you should definetely give it a couple of listens before you decide that you won't like it. 

The singers really unique voice is surrounded by beautifully ambient guitar melodies and riffs that flows well together with the structure of the songs. The bass is relatively simple, yet it stands out on its own while still complementing the rest of the band. The drums ties everything together and fits perfectly to the style, with creative beats and fills that are technical without overplaying. Song transitions happen naturally and I strongly recommend you to listen to it all in one sitting. 

This album is absolute perfection. 

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mKkMlcn0Go&amp;list=PL794DAE81AE2F6AA7) They are probably my favorite band. I don't listen to them that often these days; they're music sort of represents a period in my life that is mostly gone.
 Fantastic band. But imo their later works weren't as good as the debut. Still okay but the first is such a solid album. Face to Face - Ignorance is Bliss.

Beautiful album but the band faced such a wrath from their punk fans their next album was called "Reactionary" as a response. Felt so bad for them because their fan base wants them stuck in their early pop punk mode forever making it to were they can't evolve without pissing everyone off. Too bad those people are idiots - Ignorance is Bliss is an awesome, beautifully produced album. Absolutely. I feel the same way about A Saucerful of Secrets. it's too different eras/styles between pre-dark side and from dark side on.  Digg em hard! Big fan of Clutch here!! One of the best live bands I have ever seen! Tears for Fears - "Elemental"  Its a really powerful soundscape with intense singing.  Really every Tears for Fears album is incredible, but this one doesn't have a popular song on it so I'd consider it the most underrated of theirs. -Nikhil Banerjee 
-Vilayat Khan
-Ravi Shankar 

Those three are the Holy Trinity of sitar playing from the last generation of old classical musicians. 

More amazing sitar players include:

-Shahid Parvez (personal favorite)
-Balaram Pathak
-Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan (some argue he was as important as the big three)
-Manilal Nag
-Rais Khan

For tabla and other AMAZING drumming:

-Zakir Hussein (the big kahuna)
-Anindo Chatterjee (incredibly fast and fluid)
-Swapan Chaudhuri
-Alla Rakha (Zakir's father, played with Ravi a lot back in the day)
-Ahmedjan Thirakwa (very unique style, considered one of the best ever)
-Trichy Sankaran (South Indian mridangam, one of the finest)

Singers:

-D.V. Paluskar
-Bhimsen Joshi
-Bade Ghulam Ali Khan
-Pandit Jasraj
-Abdul Karim Khan
-Amir Khan

Other notables:

-Ali Akbar Khan (sarod player, learned from Ravi's teacher)

-Asad Ali Khan (because of this motherfucking crazy instrument:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8a_LgWG4Hw)

And honestly too many others to name. There are so many amazing Indian musicians that are all in top form that these are only a tiny sampling of them. Enjoy, it's one of the best genres out there.
 I'm more of a Four Sail kind of guy Mideast Vacation- Neil Young Midwest Miami? DELTRON 3030 

Absolute masterpiece  Best pop songs never to make it on the radio Hiding out in the big city blinking, tell them I'm lost on the sidewalk.  Distance has no way of making love understandable -- you have to learn how to die if you want to be alive.  

But don't cry, you can rely on me honey.  

All my lies are always wishes.  Playing KISS covers beautiful and stoned.

If I could you know I would just hold your hand and you'd understand.  It's become so obvious...you are so oblivious to yourself.  There's bourbon on the breath of the singer you love so much.  He takes all his words from the books that you don't read anyway.

How can I convince you it's me you don't like...

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gupjrl5ZSX0) The Hands That Thieve by Streetlight Manifesto 
Ten years after their debut album and still killing it!
Honestly, this band in general deserves more recognition.  I'm partial towards Infinity on High Trocadero is a good band that I never see anywhere outside of roosterteeth. This is a mind trip that will take you from pop to synth ballad and back down the beats n breaks path you paid to hear from the get go.
Double Stick drummer holds a high tempo throughout the album as you drop bass through the vocals that sparsely cover the tracks on this album. Surprisingly, there is a track by the world-famous John Williams, and there are multiple tracks on different soundtracks, but together on this album, they flow perfectly from high tempo to flowing funk meets zydeco meets dnb. There's no question what The Rock was listening to for many years...

[Link](www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbiRyWYeqR0) Would you not consider it unnatural to be born outside the womb? Idk why but I could never get into this one. It just sounds so... unpolished, and meandering too. Not that those are necessarily bad qualities, but to me it feels like the songs don't really go anywhere and it just doesn't work. You In Reverse is probably my favorite, but to each his own. The lyrics for "Randy Described Eternity" blow my fucking mind.  The Travelling Wilburys.  A super group that actually worked, with each member contributing their own sound but still producing a unique and cohesive whole.  I love every track on the album. Either "Banshee Beat" by Animal Collective or "Tropic of Cancer" by Panda Bear. Both are incredible and easily are two of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. Steely Dan Just learning [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSH--SJKVQQ) song on guitar by David Bowie

Blur-Think Tank.

It's such a great record yet nobody seems to talk about it, it's even hated by some Blur fans, odd thing since it's the best thing they've ever done by a mile IMO. Top 5 in my book.

 2spooky4me I've always said that Sloan was the closest thing that Canada has to the Beatles and no one ever believes me when I say that. You're right on, just pointing out that Steely Dan is two guys, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker. They are a bit shifty.  That. I agree with you in that while it's sales may support how good it is, it seldom shows up on any "best albums" lists that I've seen.  Little Richard!

Bill Haley and the Comets

Buddy Holly

Jerry Lee Lewis

Coasters

Contours

Diamonds

Duane Eddy

Eddie Cochran

Joey Dee and the Starliters

Johnny and the Hurricanes

The Skyliners 

Buddy Knox

The Fleetwoods

Chordettes

Fats Domino

These come to mind first.  And they are fun!!  Enjoy I love this track. It's actually a ride to the desert. About the drive from LA to Palm springs area. We've got heads on sticks... "Split Personalities" by 12 Rods. 

[I mean, just listen to this and ask yourself why this album wasn't bigger.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3eWQW6n6Fg) I just got into them late last year and already got all their albums. They are great and I'm excited to see them in May. Their style is so unique and heavy. Bladerunner soundtrack - (Vangelis version) 
 American Woman - The Guess Who I would say all three original albums by them with EGN being the most groundbreaking due to being first and having the best bass player they ever had.  Slaughter of the Soul - At the Gates

 Pink Floyd

Elvis Costello I disagree, I feel like it got all but overlooked due to the Carter 3 dropping shortly afterwards.

It is definitely my favorite Wayne album, on it, he demonstrated why he was, in fact, the best rapper alive. Maybe more people appreciated it than I realized. Riot! &gt; Just read that back, that's the most pretentious thing I've ever read in my life...

I wish some of the other posters in this thread shared your self-awareness.  I'll give you that. I've been a Pumpkins fan since as long as I've been buying music and when I was in high school I *hated* Adore. The older I get, the more I seem to enjoy it.

Funny how time can really do that to your ear, eh?

That being said pretty much everything post-Machina is just solo Corgan garbage; with a few song exceptions. Led Zeppelin IV Portugal. the Man's *Church Mouth*. So much fucking soul in that album, just poured out from the band. 

With awesome tracks like [Oh, Lord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ctTfipUp0k), [Children](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1Ukb8kGZkI), and [New Orleans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUI--Tycg8), it just doesn't get much better. 

Ninja EDIT: How the FUCK could I almost forget about [My Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bYh1N9Qck)?? Royal Trux - Sweet Sixteen.

Definitely not the most under-appreciated of all time, but this album got totally eviscerated by the critics when it came out while IMO it's the band's best album. Sign In Stranger is one of the best songs ever. Makes me wanna learn piano. Anything Kanye This hauntingly familiar album will transport the listener to the innocence of a young fawn, frolicking through the tall grass without a care in the world. The catchy melodic lyrics and warm soulful guitar work will encompass your soul and never let go, no matter how hard you try. Loved by thousands, and perhaps, hated by thousands more, there is nothing more endearing than the innocence of youth.

 The White Stripes [Sad Wings of Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu0z1csRnKQ) - Judas Priest (1976) - This album set the stage for much of hard rock and essentially all of heavy metal that is still going strong today. Steely Dan is way more than Donald Fagen and Walter Becker. Don't let press photos fool you. Mercury Rev's 'See You on the Other Side' is understandably overshadowed by 'Deserter's Songs' but gets unfairly overlooked or even criticised by some fans. It's far better than anything they produced after those two classics. "rome" wtf. "His"?  Try their, it's (primarily) a duo....

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steely_Dan

 Korn was mine. I was so obsessed with them and tried to buy everything they made. Then Napster came around, and I lost interest in them as I got into high 
school.  Great sea urchin ceviche *Their albums. Steely Dan is a band fronted by Donald Fagen and Walter Becker. Named after a character in Naked Lunch i believe.  It's too bad I can only give one upvote to that comment.   Kellee Maize - Integration  Man, I feel like I'm way too old for this sub-reddit.

I would argue that there's more "great" (your terminology) hip-hop than there is of the stuff that you're fed via radio and MTV.

You could start with the entire catalogs of:
Public Enemy
Talib Kweli
The Roots
Rakim
De La Soul
A Tribe Called Quest
OutKast's "Aquemini" and "Stankonia"
Goodie Mob
Common's first four of five albums are great
Boogie Down Productions' first four albums &amp; KRS-ONE's "Return of The Boom Bap"

If you want to go slightly left or obscure there's X-Clan, Brand Nubian (although they might be a bit too militant for new listeners), Intelligent Hoodlum's first album, etc.

Newer folks (past 10 years): Kendrick Lamar, Childish Gambino, Kanye, etc. 

That's really the tip of a very big iceberg. 808s &amp; Heartbreak by Kanye West.

Even within the hip hop community, I don't think it gets the credit it deserves. Graduation was the peak of 2000s rap and 808s introduced a new formula that has been and is still being used by many artists in hip hop and some in pop.  Ah, "Roads". I first heard the song--and of Portishead--in *Tank Girl* (1995). Good movie, great song.  Is this the album that was *slammed* by Rolling Stones then a few years later they came back saying it was an amazing album? Maggot Brain - Funkadelic I can't fully agree with you on this one. Whenever I wear my Pinkerton shirt around, especially at other concerts, someone always compliments me i don't think he is My vote, for what it's worth, would be for Prince's Around the World in  a Day. It was originally released without a single, and even after release, the only single was Raspberry Beret. The rest of the album is a phenomenal mix or funk and philosophy. Probably my favorite of his.  I agree 100%, but you switched the words ;) Sleepwalkin' and Grey Ice Water were the first two Modest Mouse songs I heard and they instantly got me into what's now one of my favorite bands of all time. If you would have said state instead of city I would have thought Illinois by Sufjan Stevens. Too-Rye-Ay by Dexys Midnight Runners. Come On Eileen is like, a middling track on that album, seriously! I'd say it's underrated for sure... The original mix is so hard to listen to though because of the lack of bass in the mix. It was very progressive for its time.

I think the passage of time has been kind to it though and it's become more and more revered. It's got "One" on it, after all! This just makes me sad!  Arguable one of the most well produced hip-hop albums of all time.  Set in the future in a post-apocalyptic world, themes of space and technology prevail in the lyrics.  The melodies and compositions are unlike any other hip-hop album, almost beckoning it's own genre.  The intro makes me feel like I'm floating through space, hearing faint transmissions from the apocalypse below.  And then a story unfolds, listen closely to how the world has changed in a little over 1,000 years.

Probably the best post break Eminem album.  I'm a pyrotechnical anarchist. I have one of the most influential rock guitarists with me. I'm so fucking bored, let's trip the wire.

Spoiler.

Slash-world on fire. Lyrics from title song. As a bridge to the west check out John McLaughlin's [Shakti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGW4nrsZJ3o). No Sitar but some incredible guitar, violin, and tabla.  Also, one of my favorite world/jazz drummers, [Trilok Gurtu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv6kkaPqNlI).  His stuff is more world/fusion/jazz but still has a strong link to Indian classical music. Yeah but it's true. When I was younger,and involved with various substances that would make my parents disappointed, I fell in love with Clutch. A friend of mine was a bass player for a band that spent a lot of time in bars on the east coast, and knew Neil Fallon personally. He's an alright guy, from what I'm told. 

Anyway, Clutch is excellent mood music for smoking pot, burning through vodka bottles, and gambling (not all three at the same time. Pot and gambling don't mix). It also makes surprisingly good mood music for working.

Summer Sound Attack is a great place to start. Its their new album, which is just a rerecording of old material. Great introduction to the less easily digested stuff. Also it has my favorite Clutch song, DC Sound Attack!

If you like Clutch, I'd also recommend Kyuss (really anything with Josh Homme) and older CKY.  Imagine waking up one day and you immediately notice that something is different. You lie there in your bed for a while, but you can't put your finger on it. You get up, go to the kitchen, and turn on the kettle. But the kettle isn't working. Why? No matter, the element or the fuse must have gone. You go through to the bathroom to wash your face, turn on the tap. It gurgles a bit, some spluttering, but no water. Weird.

Then you realise, as you stare at yourself in the mirror. That thing that wasn't quite right. Silence. You live in the middle of London. The city never sleeps, but now... There's just nothing. No cars blaring, no rumble of the Picadilly line as it passes under your flat. Not even the gulls cawing in the alleyway behind your building as they fight over the scraps of last night's half eaten kebab. Perfect silence.

Cue the greatest post-apocalyptic movie that was ever made. And this is the soundtrack.

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw6zTAKWGeo) I guess that's better than the guy calling RHCP thrash metal a couple weeks ago. Definitely check out Mr. B's new demo though. It's the 4th one.  Operation Ivy - Operation Ivy

Every track on their one and only album is great. Wonderful blend of Ska and Punk. Holy shit! Thank you SO much! Really glad you also included tabla players too. That was one thing that really stood out on my first listen to this vinyl was how incredibly fluid and complex the rhythm was. 30 Seconds to Mars Pinkerton is Weezer's greatest album. It's hard to believe the man who wrote Tired of Sex, Across the Sea and Falling For You is the same man who wrote Beverly Hills and Can't Stop Partying. California love-Tupac
Ohio-Neil Young
New York, New York-Frank Sinatra
And Wacko's 50 state capitols.  I opened for them this summer and they still rock out like the old days. It's good to see a great group of guys like them still playing music. **Ambient**

1. Boards of Canada

2. Keenya

3. Brian Eno I am under the impression these guys are pretty popular in the States though. I live in Vancouver and I don't think they've ever gotten radio play here [Licker's Last Leg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licker%27s_Last_Leg) by Goon Moon There's a few tracks I really like on Saucerful (Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun being the obvious one), but it's never done that much for me.

That said, I prefer it to the debut album. I've never cared for that much. I'll probably be crucified for this, but I'm not much of a Syd Barrett fan. Despite recognising how important he was to the band, I much prefer their output once his influence was well and truly gone. not criminally underrated though You're missing an awful lot, actually, and I'd argue there's definitely stuff that holds up to Bebop. Nothing quite the same, but I don't think that's something to be derided. I honestly didn't like Bebop that much from a narrative perspective -- but the writing was good enough, and I enjoyed the sombre aspect; and the direction is nothing short of godly.

The shows other people have recommended here are good shows, for the most part, but not what you're thinking of. TTGL and FLCL are the only two mentioned that I'd consider recommending. You should check out Shinsekai Yori, or 'From the New World,' a slow-paced show set in a dystopian future. You should also check out Psycho-Pass, if you're not already familiar with it. In terms of stylistic direction, I'd recommend Haibane Renmei -- which is spectacular in all regards (similarly, Lain, Texhnolyze...) and -- on the less serious end of the spectrum -- Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (or 'Four and a Half Tatami Mythological Chronicles). NHK ni Youkoso ('Welcome to the NHK') is another great series.

I can't not mention Bakemonogatari and its sequels, which I love -- their dialogue is fantastic and the writing is to die for, and Shinbou's direction is wonderfully artsy -- but I feel like you probably wouldn't get on with them. Another few oddball shows you might find interesting are 'Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita' ('Mankind has Fallen'), a somewhat surrealist post-apocalyptic comedy/SoL, and Steins;Gate (though the Visual Novel is better, it's still pretty good). I really don't think Bebop is the unimpeachable masterpiece people think it to be, but I will agree that very few popular works can even hold a candle to it. *The Human Equation* by Ayreon. Released in 2004, I believe it is a more innovative, more musically thrilling rock opera than anything Dream Theater, Coheed and Cambria, or even The Who ever made. Flood by They Might Be Giants. I listened to TMBG in high school because I was a dorky kid who couldn't get my mind around what was alluring and cool about rock music until years later. They kind of fell by the for me wayside once I was listening to the Pixies, Operation Ivy, Velvet Underground whatever... and also because some of TMBG's experiments with digital distribution were way ahead of their and difficult to grasp at first.

But I can go back to Flood today and it's still agreat album, not just as a novelty but as music. I wouldnt've said it was underrated, TBH.  Maybe it was at the time, but there is certainly a lot of love for it now. Otherwise, yes. I'm trying to remember what the USD/Canadian exchange rate was like back in the 90s.  But it doesn't really matter.  As a guy who recorded albums back then too, let me just say that $15k was an insane amount of money to spend recording an independent  funk/hip hop/ska record.  Though I suspect you know that now.  



 The sun begins to rise on a clear as crystal June morning. The heat begins to rise, and you feel it is 100% necessary to find the nearest pool, and submerge yourself under the chlorinated chilled liquid. Throughout the day, you think about all the events that have happened in your life, mostly the loved ones you've lost or left behind. After the reminiscing subsides, you go out for a night on the town, but you don't stop, you just keep driving. 


If anyone wants to know who or what this is, just ask! Happy Friday!  Don't like it. I feel like the Lips may have finally jumped the shark with this one. I think Stardeath and White Dwarfs saved their redo of Dark Side, but no one can save this one. Dusk by The The midwest states They've ruined so much other music for me. I'm an addict. I really think it's a matter of listening to it for what it was, rather than comparing it to the Pantera that we all know and love now.

In terms of guitar playing, there's nothing wrong with it and it is actually pretty technically impressive. Somehow hadn't heard this. Thanks for sharing! This is good. Definitely very somber, but I find that the lack of a couple of the original synths, detracts from the full emotional output.  Gza - Liquid Swords    

I'm not sure that it's the most under appreciated, and it's definitely respected in the rap circles, but I don't think it gets enough credit at all.  Seriously, IMO the best rap album of all time.  Two decades old and I still listen to it all the time - and every time I listen, I'm still blown away.   Ocean Machine - Biomech and Terria by Devin Townsend

What a guy Wow, great call. Gonna go listen to it now, in fact. Thank you. Angel Dust by Faith no More. Absolute genius fucking album, especially if you consider the musical era it came out. but it's not underrated. It is considered an all-time classic in most circles I genuinely couldn't get into Baccano, and ended up dropping it. It was quite predictable, and Isaac and Miria just annoyed me...  I would say Flying Saucer by Astronaut Wife, or Winds Take No Shape, by Call And Response, which, to me, are neck-and-neck winners of best album of the 2000s, but I'm sure that, in the small ponds that are their fan base, they are very much appreciated. Green Day's 21st Century Breakdown was a great album in my opinion. Incubus- Make yourself The Black Ryder  - buy the ticket, take the ride. This has been coming up a lot and is making me consider giving that album another shot. The first time, damn dude this thread is five months old. CMON AND SLAM! IF THAT SHITS YO JAM! Illinoise?  Proud Souls by Jason Boland Probably their best album since Pinkerton or if not, at least their best since Green. Venus and Mars by Wings. How about a multilingual hour long orgy of guitars, saxes, drums, keyboards, trumpets, strings and Robert plantesque vocals describing an entry in a journal found by a heroin addict about a boy who survived an abortion and is the product of rape attempting to find his family? 

At least that's what I think the albums about  It couldnt be In An Aeroplane Over the Sea is it? Yup. This and Led Zeppelin  Very good! We'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth, 

We'll never have to rot together in the dirt, 

I'll never lose my baby in the crowd,

I should be laughing right now. MASSIVE FAN! These guys are sooo unknown and it pains me that most of the world miss out on their awesomeness!! Reddit has completely deluded itself into thinking that copyright doesn't exist. A few weeks ago some guy wanted google to re-upload every album on youtube in higher quality. It came out when I was 18 and I listened to it non-stop for months. It isn't as good to me now, but back then I couldn't stop listening to it. That Lil Wayne hook tho It's a phenomenal album, one of my favorites, especially if you like industrial music, I sell it to people by saying it's basically Bowie doing NIN Manic Street Preachers - The Holy Bible
"(...) and we were in the studio doing 'Revol' when we heard Blur's 'Girls &amp; Boys'. And I thought 'Fuck, we've just written a song about group sex in the Politburo and really the biggest thing out there from an indie band is about going off on holiday to Ibiza."

Sex, politics, violence (and soiciety's fascination with it), prostitution, concentration camps, eating disorders, suicide, romance...this album just hit me...brutally.  A device that synthesizes  When i was getting ready to leave for college, i had a really hard time leaving my friends, and I'd be lying if i said i didn't start crying while i was singing this song by myself in the car.

True Believers by The Bouncing Souls This album is a little odd. Though for some people, a full listen could change their taste in music.


You are first invited by a reasonable easy to listen to song. It's somewhat lighthearted and it is sure to get you into a good mood. 
The album progresses and you are introduced to some darker, more violent tones but before you are about to leave you are played one of the cutest songs I know.
But then the craze is back, though now you feel almost more at home. The tracks now aren't sinister and you can really get into them. 
Finally you are at the end with a song that makes you feel as though it was all a journey.  

[Link (Spotify)](https://play.spotify.com/album/43s2fKRQsOSB6rSrxtAXKK) wrong I would say Mary Star of the Sea is more underrated. That album is perfection. No problem! I love Indian music and have been collecting favorites for many years now :) let me know if you have any other questions about anything related to it (artists, instruments, techniques, etc...) Zombies are weirdly, enduringly, and inexplicably popular in Detroit, Michigan.  Not as popular as the Beatles, obviously.  But many of us grew up listening to their records.  

It was only moving away from home in adulthood that I realized most people in other American cities have never even heard of those guys. 

 Aimee Mann Bachelor #2

The Cardigans Grand Turismo and Long Gone Before Daylight

The Woodentops Wooden Footcops On Highway *Dig Out Your Soul* really surprised me.  I only bothered getting it a few years after it came out (for 3 I think) and thought it was great. As for *Be Here Now* - whisper it - I think that is really underrated, it is nowhere near as bad as everyone says it is IMO. Steve Burns 'Songs for Dustmites'(2003) This is Steve from Blues Clues backed, arranged and produced by The Flaming Lips minus Wayne.

Also 'Rise Robots Rise' (1992)  Astoundingly good, cohesive album !
One of those rarer &amp; rarer "listen beginning to end" releases.

Do I love every single song equally ? . .  maybe not . .  but it is startlingly &amp; deeply good.

( especially the ORIGINAL version of "Hallo Spaceboy" . . .  a mix that manages to meld incredibly loud intense settings with soft touches that aren't buried ) It's one of those great concept albums, not only because it paints an interesting setting for the Gorillaz characters but also because it contains real world commentary littered throughout. I can remember hearing Transatlanticism all the way through and the craving I had for more. I don't think any other full album came close to capturing that feeling again I love the album, but this was before their mainstream success. Unless you're counting Date Rape as their mainstream success. He's inactive  Thanks you, for proving that it is a very under appreciated album :) To be honest, Kanye's Only One made me cry. It's quite touching and although the use of Autotune is off-putting it's hard to say that he isn't an artist.  I think it's his latter-day element- so much more enjoyable than his records have been, despite their flashes of lyrical brilliance. His voice does so much better as an MC these days. Stray has to be one of the top anime OPs in my opinion. Honestly New Found Glory never gets brought up here, or at least not that I have seen.  Also, Second Hand Smoke is a gem as well. You can almost hear Bradley losing his mind I need to finish the second season. That show is amazing. Well, than educate me. Hayden - Skates Offspring - smash The call by Matt Kennon, moments by Emerson drive, and whiskey lullaby by Brad paisley are three that hit me particularly hard.  Fall Out Boy are a great band and I don't understand where all the hate comes from. "Uma Thurman" is the best song on the Hot 100 right now and possibly the best song of the month regardless of popularity. Most tracks by Third Eye Blind, check out God of Wine, I want You and Slow Motion. Also Something Corporate has some great stuff, check out Space, Me and the Moon and Heroine. I also love anything by Coldplay.  ... HAD A WOODEN LEG!!! Can you explain the joke? Yes! This was the first cassette tape I ever bought!

[*If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high - And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low - If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high - And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewOzi5-AZXU) Bossa Nova by the Pixies gets no credit, and i think its awesome Right now I am Wikipedia surfing and learning as much as I can. It is really fascinating! Listening to this music while relaxing in my living room smoking my hookah makes me feel more at peace than anything I have experienced.  Outside is fucking awesome. Also worthwhile, I think, was Earthling. I think too many people phased out on Bowie in the 80's and didn't return until after 2001 or so...

And damn, they missed out. If you're into emo stuff, The Season by All Get Out. I can't believe no one listens to this band. They're on the label created by the guy in Manchester Orchestra, but they're ten times better in my opinion. If you enjoy bands like Manchester Orchestra, Brand New, Better Off, etc. check them out.
I've been trying desperately to get a copy of the record, there were only 250 pressed, one sold early last year for $100+. Maybe one day.

Here's a Yotube link to some of their stuff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzr-nXk-g_A&amp;list=PLA2974E6C8E6701FF, but it's not in the same order as the album, nor are all the songs there. Like I said, it's hard to find their stuff for some reason unbeknownst to me. Six exceptionally talented but not really well known (in the grand scheme) guys make an album that blows the doors off anything else in the genre. Arguably one of the best drummers helps write the catchiest and craziest time signatures/tempo changes that fit perfect with a somewhat somber and sad (lyrically) but fantastically written album. 

The entire album is written around events that happen in a single house so if you like albums with lyrics/backstory you can 'read along to' almost every time, look no further.

It has heavy songs, it has slow songs, and best of all they are all basically poems. Very little repeating choruses, but catchy none the less.

It's an album that you HAVE to listen to many times before you really see the genius in it's writing and composition.

It's an album that is sad to see get so little attention because it falls in a genre that a lot of people overlook and may not expect beautiful writing to come frome.

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMA8HcmyLmI&amp;index=9&amp;list=PL-XbTEkQt3TYszsjIjjFuWmulEDv0QvJk) - (youtube playlist, full album stream doesn't exist in a single video)
 You'll always be a loser...and that's okay. This is a hard rock epic about the difficulty of successful interpersonal relationships and the resulting possibility for loneliness and/or self-destructive behaviors. The songs are long, the lyrics are dense, and it's kind of about the civil war.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFHlK8ZXgvE&amp;list=PLGLhPs1c6AqfqfhashHwklKVvcJA6eFy8 Basket Case by far is their best song.  [McDonald and Giles](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald_and_Giles) EVERYBODY GET UP ITS TIME TO SLAM NOW I've heard of it and listened to it a few times as well; still think it's a piece of crap. Definitely had a lot of influence though, so I really can't deny that it had a huge impact on a lot of people and likely helped to change the direction of popular rock. So, I respect that I guess. I agree. It's the best thing they've done, with *Blur* a close second. [this](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=synthesizer) "Dark Side Of The Moon" Le Pink Floyd It's influenced by *Beyond Civilization* by Daniel Quinn, *The Master and Margarita* by Mikhail Bulgakov, and the poetry of Rumi. It's about finding oneself in a changing world. It's reflection and cynicism. It's about yielding to nature. 40 Oz to Freedom is what I'm considering their mainstream success but that could be a poor judge of it  Presence by Led Zeppelin. Everyone hoots and hollers about Zep I-IV, as well as Houses of the Holy and Physical Graffiti, but Presence is just a high octane, no BS album in whole. With the lead track being Achilles Last Stand (Led Zeppelin's most underrated song in my opinion) this album just doesnt slow down. The 5000 spirits or the layers of the onion by the incredible string band is damn good Jay Reatard - Blood Visions. I bought Eisenhower when the slip had a song from on GH and I was not impressed. Is this one better? YES. Will do! One of the most underrated bands in the world. I do like their harder stuff more, although Electric Worry is probably my favorite song. Not really sure whats on what album as I always play my music on random but Pure Rock Fury, The Regulator, Buccinal (spelling), Rock and Roll Outlaw all kick above average amounts of ass.  Same career track with Interpol. The critics loved their first album, then their sophomore effort was a bit divisive, but count me towards thinking it was better than 'Turn on the Bright Lights'. But since then it has been ugh.  Summer in Abbadon by Pinback. Maybe more obscure than under appreciated but it's definitely both of those things.  I tried their. 4/5, would recommend trying in the future. using "underrated" as the criteria, I'm gonna go with Neil Young's [On the Beach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gALPWW9QByQ&amp;list=PL94gOvpr5yt1mZgtJSDkoIni5N8XsEB-7)

Didn't get critical accolades until years after its release. Actually the entire doom trilogy (Tonight's the Night, On the Beach, and Zuma) are all brilliant and overlooked albums in the annals of rock history. I would like to see any discussion of the 80s/90s Berkeley punk scene other than just Operation Ivy. How about some Crimpshrine, Fifteen or Wynona Riders? Came here to post this album. Not disappointed. Dosage by Collective Soul It was ahead of its time, people were still in love with IoH and Dance, Dance, it made for an uncomfortable change. But after listening to it again a few years later, it has some phenomenal content. I suggest it, but I'll suggest all Fall Out Boy albums. I feel like I don't see them enough around here. They're only Germantown, MD's finest!  LOL sorry man I didn't even notice - obviously Suge in the news brought me here. Blind Pilot has been on TV a ton.  The first dozen comments under the YouTube video that you linked are literally "Californication sent me here," or "Chuck and Ellen brought me here."  I was actually going to say *Riot Act*.  I know that *No Code*, *Yield* and even *Vitalogy* turned off a lot of the *Ten* audience, but RA is filled with great songwriting and lyrics.   "I'm passionate about everything, like my family and friends." - Suge Knight This hauntingly familiar album will transport the listener to the innocence of a young fawn, frolicking through the tall grass without a care in the world. The catchy melodic lyrics and warm soulful guitar work will encompass your soul and never let go, no matter how hard you try. Loved by thousands, and perhaps, hated by thousands more, there is nothing more endearing than the memory of youth. 




[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDx9zqDpSik&amp;list=PL-_g2IiH9OFrZcZZbuns6FwE7uJTXhJ5a) Spacegrass man. Presidents of the United States of America, self-titled. It's just so much fun. Whenever one of its songs come on, everyone in the room gets into it. The first 2 pumpkins albums I listened to were machina (1) and adore. I loved both of them so much I bought the back catalogue the following week. They don't get mentioned a lot, but I have a serious soft spot for those 2 records. It's a shame most of the stuff since they "reformed" had been sub standard, but what did I expect?  Weezer- Pinkerton  Revelations, by Audioslave. It has the sound of a solid band, well written, explores different sounds (at least more that their previous releases) it just sounds solid. Not that i don't love the other albums, I do, but for different reasons. Allow me explain myself. 
Audioslave - It sounds like RATM + Chris Cornell
Out Of Exile - Gives the feeling of a "Euphoria Morning Chris Cornell" + A band that sounds like RATM. Oh my god! YES. It's a rare jewel. People generally don't know it or even listen of it. But it's great. Butcher's tale WTF? Incredible.

Thank you kind Sir. for reminding me of it LA CURANDERA IS THE YOUNG GIRL IN A LINEN DRESS IN A LINEN DRESS OF WHIIIIIIIIIITE Maybe not a specific album per-se, but I couldn't resist:

"like the sound of two Catholic high-school girls in mid-knife-fight" Rush is my long standing favorite band of all time. As much as I love their music, I sometimes get a little irritated at how they are not afraid of squeezing every dime out of their very devoted fan base. I call it getting "Lucus'd". I'm just waiting for a "Best of Chronicles" album to come out to take getting Lucus'd to a new level.  &gt; Aaron's Party (Come Get It)

His later works lacked the pure sound and adventourous musical endeavors of his freshman self-titled album. [Shake It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rKTE8Hej_M) is, in my opinion, his greatest work. I mean, just look at him go! That must be awesome! It's from the movie American Psycho.  It's a great movie, watch it if you can. Every thought that I repent
There's another chip you haven't spent
And you're cashing them all in
Where do we begin to get clean again
Can we get clean again
I walk home alone with you
And the mood you're born into
Sometimes you let me in
And I take it on the chin
I can't get clean again
I want to know, can we get clean again
The God of Wine comes crashing through the headlights of a car
That took you farther than you thought you'd ever want to go
We can't get back again
We can't get back again
She takes a drink and then she waits
The alcohol it permeates
And soon the cells give way, and cancels out the day
I can't keep it all together
I know I know I know...
I can't keep it all together
And the siren's song that is your madness
Holds a truth I can't erase
All alone on your face
Every glamorous sunrise
Throws the planets out of line
A star sign out of whack, a fraudulent zodiac
And the God of Wine is crouched down in my room
You let me down, I said it, now I'm going down
And you're not even around
And I said no no no...
I can't keep it all together
I know I know I know...
I can't keep it all together
And there's a memory of a window
Looking through I see you
Searching for something I could never give you
And there's someone who understands
You more than I do
A sadness I can't erase
All alone on your face Yep, same here; over 20 years now (wow). Granted, Adore wasn't an album for the average SP fan.. but it's beautiful. 

I'm on of those people that love pretty much everything he's/they've done from Gish demos to MTAE (and yes, Zwan too). Somehow there is always a hook or melody in there somewhere that grabs me.  Their last great album, IMO. tie:
Edgar Winter Group - Shock Treatment
Donnie Iris - Fortune 410 I was always told they were named after slang for a dildo. 
Googled it. We were both sort of right "Fans of Beat Generation literature, Fagen and Becker named the band after "Steely Dan III from Yokohama", a strap-on dildo mentioned in the William S. Burroughs novel Naked Lunch" Besides "Is this It?", this is definitely their most critically acclaimed album. Definitely not underrated. Dan Mangan - Nice, Nice, Very Nice. My favourite singer-songwriter album of all time. It's folky, it's playful, got some upbeat stuff and some introspective stuff and really is brilliant with its melodies and lyrical content but I don't think it got much love outside of Western and other main cities in Canada. 

Polaris Music Prize Shortlisted, people! It mattered!  Thank You, I will check them both out. I've only listened to there music, but I'll definetely check it out. Thanks. The Bravery's self titled album. Idk what to say except every single song is excellent and it is definitely worth the listen. I agree. Somewhere around the turn of the millennium, Bono became the egotistical Messiah complex rockstar stereotype that he had spent the entire previous decade satirizing and actively tried to avoid becoming.  A mix modern elements of electronica and metalcore into rap-rock, which at first seems a bit disjointed and weird, but soon settles into a comfortable roar that hits all the sweet spots in the metal/hardcore/emo realm. If that's your thing, come click [ME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk36pj_NRjM&amp;list=PLKcGEIO7V0rVhj83rokxrpnGzxf_htj3D) Pinkerton by Weezer --- If the album wasn't shit on by fans or critics, Weezer wouldn't have cranked out pop songs over the next decade. They are a local band here in the DC metro area.  I kind of grew up with their music.  Blast Tyrant is absolutely essential.  Also, Tim Sult has played  with the DC band "Lionize."  They have a similar style and are fantastically awesome as well.  They sound similar to Clutch but mix in more funk, reggae, and even some go-go flavor. The Red Harvest by Bloodsimple. Haven't listened to their first album, but their second and seemingly final album has this gritty growl almost ever present in Tim Williams' vocal style, a very metal style sometimes reminiscent of SlipKnot and Korn put together and other times of the ballads of Metallica, and lyrics that apply so much today. Starting out with a semi-cover of "The End" by The Doors, the album flows smoothly throughout and transitions between songs beautifully. Until my friend's father gave me the CD back in 9th grade, I never even heard of Bloodsimple, let alone any of their songs. Definitely recommend to any metal fans.  Demon days was amazing. There are other bands with similar themes, but my favorite thing is the scope of their songs.

Rush has a couple of Love songs, but the vast majority of their music (including said songs) is about the wider human experience. What it means to be alive, the trials and tribulations, and particularly the way we can choose to react to events in life.

In the end that is what all music is, but with epics like 2112 and Clockwork Angels, I feel like they have come closer to telling "The Whole Story" than any other band I have listened to. I agree, Everything Goes Numb is one of my favorite albums! I've noticed, especially on reddit, a lot of posts from this album. I hosted a college radio show and would play songs off of Hands That Thieve, many of my listeners were unaware of the new album so that's why I said it's underrated. 
An amazing album that, like all of its predecessors, never fail to pick me up :) Zwan - Mary Star of the Sea For me, Soundgarden &gt; Audioslave &gt; Rage. Honestly I don't even really like Rage anymore, but Audioslave (especially their first two albums) has held up well for me over the years. Nice bro, i havent studied much on them, just love there music. NOOOOO haha. Deja Entendu is definitely their best album through and through. so much yes to this answer [Hiding My Heart - Brandi Carlile](http://youtu.be/3Snph1Y_HXQ)

 Lol, I've gotten several messaged telling me this. I already new that, I have the Nightfly by Fagen and I know about Walter Becker's injuries. You guys can stop telling me XD I would agree. i bought his solo albums he made after leaving PF and I honestly could not get through them.  Day for Night, by The tragically Hip.  Until We Have Faces by RED. Really under appreciated group in general, but the pure musicality of the group really comes out in this album. It's like listening to a rock symphony through the whole thing. Is there even a vinyl rip available somewhere? As far as I could tell, the mastering on the vinyl wasn't far off from the CD release, but I've only ever spun my vinyl copy a couple times on mediocre setups. The mix on the 5.1 is noticeably different, though. When it came out, I didn't have a 5.1 setup either, so I ripped the individual audio channels and made 3 separate "songs" for each song. 1 "song" was just the front left and front right, 1 was the rear left and rear right, and the last one was just the mono center channel. It really blew open my perception of music production and atmospheric layers and how important small background details can be in the final product.  Thirteenth Step by A Perfect Circle.  I prefer it not only to other APC albums, but to Tool as well. Chillstep or Ambient music.  The Division Bell got bad reviews when it came out. It's not that bad, I like it a lot. The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner by Ben Folds Five. I know I am a random stranger on the internet, but I ask you to trust me on this.  Watch the dub.  Faye is done in the typical annoying cliche, but Spike and Jet, are 100% pure gold!  As someone who has unbiasedly watched them both, this is THE ONLY anime in which the dub out shines the original.   The Clown - Charles Mingus "Pocket Full of Kryptonite" - Spin Doctors. That album is front to back a good time. I'm 27, didn't own it till after I graduated high school in 2006. They are absolutely not a one hit wonder in my eyes.  Has Been by William Shatner. I know, I know. Just listen to it.   They can be pricey, but you cannot deny that they give FULL value for what you spend on them. Their concerts spare no expense, their clothes are always top-quality material, and they do contribute a large part back to charity. Every single Thrice Album, especially Beggars. Will check out them, personally am looking for more music like there's because i cant get enough! Mahavishnu Orchestra.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavishnu_Orchestra "Isolation Drills" by Guided by Voices. Even by Guided by Voices standards this album is underrated.  Amazing songwriting paired with great production, beautiful strings, and a cameo appearance from Elliott Smith.

Also Maladroit by Weezer. Great songs, nice riffs. One of Weezer's best! It's like an improved Green Album. A must listen! It feels like a grief-induced bender. Drug-fueled, confused, stumbling but determined. Carried by chaos, underscored with meaningless phrases that taste like sorrow and loss. It's a trip through the reeling mind of something deeply damaged, but maybe not yet entirely broken.

Now I admit that I am not the biggest fan of Faust but who does not love in the nightside eclipse ..  If you want to try something more recent, I can only urge you to listen to this band, they absolutely steamrolled me when I saw them live
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL31pQW-sT4 The shark and the helicopter - Smokey Robotic Unfortunately, I don't think they ever played outside of England very much. Check out the Mares Nest show on Youtube though if you haven't. The way Tim would Schizophrenicly berate and apologize to the rest of the band and the audience is hilarious.  Ive often said that Soup was the best album of the 90's! It still holds up today! I loved the heady nature of many of their songs. Closer to the Heart and The Trees comes to mind. I've fallen away from Rush as I got older, but back when I was on a Rush kick I loved that they were covering philosophy because no other band really did that.  Great choice - I haven't listened to that album in forever. And that's definitely something I can appreciate. I just don't think it deserves the comparison to Bebop or Champloo. It's the British *Pet Sounds*. Utterly beautiful album. I've recommended it to so many people, as so any people haven't heard the whole thing.  Spotify doesnt like to show all there album's so where could i find all of them online? Which isn't really a good thing though. They had people buy into a product in order to try and sell something completely different. That being said I still haven't given anything after Oracular Spectacular the time of day but are you bro? **Death Metal**

Their most praised and known album is Hour to Clean Everything, and a lot of people haven't even listened to anything past that. Their music is incredibly technical, political, and energetic. I live it.

Also, Fuck World Trade by Leftver Crack. You are inconstant.  You are a set of electric impulses emanating from an imperfect organ.  Instinct is your god; appeals to all else are veneers cast over a conceptual cosmic behemoth of violence and deconstruction.  You are inconstant.  You are viscous.  The only sensible choice is to forget, to indulge, to fuck, to dance the wardance that is only made possible at the junction of abrasive digital sound and nature's reviled monster.  Everything will crumble.  Everything is preserved in archives across the air.  The only moment that exists is the one you are in.  Relive it, over, and over, and over, and over.

Green Day's new music has gotten so bad that people forget they used to be awesome.
(Not that this is their best album, but probably their most under-appreciated--also their first) One of my favorite bands.  I have Pure Rock Fury in my CD player.  Red Horse Rainbows is the best. Revis- Places for Breathing  It really is. The last half of Jesus I/MSOTS.. I could listen to just that half on repeat for hours. That's a given, they had the best of the best playing with em. Dude had originally posted with the assumption that Steely Dan was the name of the musician.  OP, listen to this guy. Do you have a dog or something? *snickers* A little chow? And? I assure you, Dolly isn't writing Aesop's songs. /r/music needs to add a DAE guideline.... They're great when the pressure is on. Contributing to the Steely Dan love here. Everyone always throws Aja in the mix as their best record, but I'm inclined to disagree and say that it's The Royal Scam. It's the one that I feel like is most true to their really cynical jazz-rock snob vision, has the hardest edged tunes (and I love when Steely Dan get gritty), and has a really authentic feel that Aja and Gaucho weren't able to touch with their oil-slick production. Whose copies? If you dig this, you'll probably also really enjoy Bill Evans' [Conversations With Myself](http://www.allmusic.com/album/conversations-with-myself-mw0000022550) Butchers tale is a deep one! At first I thought it was about a drug addict with shaking like he is on withdrawals.  But in reality shows how grim the war was for the everyday man who was in the trenches. 
When you can have that song along with "Friends of mine" on the same album with the latter just a list of people he knows in love! Album for all the moods! I'll definetely check that one out, thanks! Drive my car  
DR Robert  
When im 64  
The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill  
Abbey road is perfect I cant do it.  [This site](http://albumsthatneverwere.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-zombies-rip.html) is awesome. The guy creates "Albums That Never Were" BLIND MELON!  

OP you rule! Blind Melon is always my answer to questions like this. THE most underrated band of all time.  I know why "All My Friends" hits me hard. It came out not long after I moved away for graduate school. Suddenly, all of my long time friends were on the other side of the country and when I did get to see them we would party too hard. Things did have the feeling of we have to do this now because it might be the last time. I remember putting the LCD soundsystem album with that song onto my ipod then hearing it come on while on my motorcycle and starting to cry while I was sitting at a stop light. It hurt, but it also felt good, like finally facing that my life had changed and things would be different, that I couldn't just pretend things would go back to how they were in a few months.  Butch Walker "Sycamore Meadows" is probably my vote. I feel so dirty posting an album from the last decade but it's really really good.  Those are my favorite songs from the album.  Go for it!  Clutch is an amazing and honest band.  Their music is deeply blues rooted and if you like them, I hope you use their music as a stepping stone into other similar acts and blues rock. The first time I heard [24 Earth Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84ydY4H_0IY), I fell in love. He references Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Middle Earth, and the Ultima series to name a few. Haven't listened to the album in its entirety, but "For Martha" might be the most beautiful Pumpkins track I've ever heard. Live - Throwing Coppper

Such an underrated album (with possibly my favorite first/last song combo ever in The Dam at Otter Creek to open the album and White Discussion to close it) X&amp;Y by Coldplay Great band. I love them along with Pavement.  Nah it's Geezer! The OP said under appreciated, not critically under rated. I would argue there is a difference. If you asked 99% of the population who "Built to Spill" was, they'd look at you funny. Lots of critical acclaim, very little in the way of being appreciated by a wide audience. Havent heard that one, I'll check it out thanks bro. Physical Graffiti - Led Zeppelin  Ayyyallaaayyaaiiiaahhh!! and Ohhyiiaahyyiiayyaaiiioooo!! are probably my 2 favorite right now. Copperopolis by Grant Lee Buffalo. Still one of my favorites after almost 20 years of listening to it, but I hardly ever see it mentioned. All of Grant Lee Phillips' solo albums that followed the band's break up are criminally underated, too, IMHO.
 ...AJFA is my favorite Metallica album for so many reasons, but also my favorite Metallica riff/moment in general. [This fucking part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk7OM5OypE#t=239s) of Frayed Ends of Sanity. Can't help myself from air drumming the break and banging my head until the solo. That's quite odd! Even over here in England most people have never heard of their masterpiece Three sides to every story by Extreme. A lot of good stuff there. Love Steely Dan too. The ogre men are still inside

Got to keep down out of sight

 Number 3 is a weird way of spelling Possessed.  Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite.

I first heard "Somewhere In Time" when I was in high school and that was it.  They are kind of like my "Grateful Dead." And the solo on "Kid Charlemagne" is one of the best guitar solos ever.  James Blake's cover of Joni Mitchell's "A Case of You"

The music video is really emotional too. Think it's on Vimeo. [New Adventures in Hi-Fi by R.E.M.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioxyEAE_788)

It was their last album with drummer Bill Barry. 

A dark brooding vibe permeates the album and It feels like a band traveling across the American West going through towns and places whose best days are long past. 

This in fact partly true as the album was at least in part recorded during sound checks while on tour.  Unfortunately, it  got mixed reviews as a result of the sound quality, but I think those complaints are overblown.

For some perspective, when given the chance to perform any R.E.M. Song with R.E.M. Tom York of Radiohead chose [Be Mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2VAHF2o0TA) off of New Adventures in Hi-Fi.  I love this album and I completely agree! So many great songs off that album.  Totally underrated. Especially when most rock historians put Aja or Pretzel Logic above it. Stereogum did a best to worst of Steely Dan and they have it at #2 (behind Aja) so maybe its being reevaluated critically. Great album, but I'm not sure it was underrated. At least not where I was living at the time. Everywhere is different though I suppose.  I listen to everything in and around clutch, it's just so much better than thrashing metal and classic rock imo Gonna nerd out on ya here. Start at 0:30 or so. And yes, that's Liv Tyler singing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hluMK_Rpj0 Superb choice! The first half of the album reminds me of the latter half of 'Abbey Road' - they all flow seamlessly into each other, combining in to what has to be one of the best albums I've heard. EUPHORIC HEARTBREAK in 2011 amazing ablum Christ how many times can this question get asked in one week?  DING! DING! DING! Sam's Town, The Killers. So underrated.  Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow by Rainbow I'm so sad we can't go see them next weekend at the prudential center :( Bought 3 tickets, now something really important came up. First time the whole group is touring in a long time!! One is Fleet Foxes' "Shrine/The Argument." Something about that scene at the old broken fountain with pennies in the bottom, wondering what happened to all those kids who tossed them in- it just gets me.

Another is "Time Flies" by Porcupine Tree- Steven Wilson is only a couple of years younger than me so the lyrics really resonate. I know what he means when it feels like all your chances to really live your life are starting to run out.

And then there's Gunner's Dream by Pink Floyd. I can't even get through that one sometimes.
 better add Lonely People and Sandman to that playlist as well :) I've seen them live more than any other band, they're the best. The crowd goes wild.. They don't get radio play in the US either but they have a very strong following. Yea man, I'm been listening to Sublime for 20 years and that dude's bubble gum voice ain't Sublime.  He does the old ones well enough, but I just can't get over that voice. I do like that song! I'm listening to it now, what did you play? I would imagine lol &gt; Kylesa

I was about to correct your spelling of Kyuss, but have instead found a new band to listen to, thanks.
 Menos El Oso - Minus the Bear. Great album. Pachuca Sunrise is one of my favorite songs.  [Macklemore - American](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqDu47GbQWk) Just listened to the song for the first time and I immediately thought of Petty. So it is there.
 Beatles, Stones, Bowie and Scissor Sisters. I agree about listening from beginning to end. I had picked out a handful of songs that I really enjoyed, but never as much as when I listened to the whole thing in its entirety. I enjoy the hell out of them. They seem like they are from the alternative universe version of our world where the current model for american rock is not Nickleback.   Well, Rod Argent made some pretty impressive solo albums.  10 0011 10101 This is the band they want to be and it's a VERY strong alt rock album. 

I went to a show of theirs last year, and it was so strange seeing all these teen girls still screaming to hear Kids, 7 years on. You could see MGMT was unhappy on stage. It was as if nobody even bothered to listen to anything other than Oracular Spectacular. They are releasing a new album this year. Beverly Hills has grown on me so much. It's hilarious when you really put it into perspective, coming from Rivers and all. It exemplifies their fish out of water vibe but from the perspective of delusion. It's just a three chord pop song like most weezer songs anyway and it's just fascinating in my opinion to track weezers career and arrive at make believe. Someone's going to make a mockumentary or a comedy biopic about weezer one day and that will definitely be the most interesting portion. 

And the alone II version of can't stop partying is a goddamn masterpiece.  No More Tears - Ozzy Osbourne "Aim directly for his crooked brow,
And look him straight in the eye!" &gt; Imagine if blues musicians started trying to do that to eachother.

What? Give credit? They sure do. Or they can steal (Led Zep, I'm looking at you.)

 Saucerful and Ummagumma always felt like a band searching for something. You have acoustic tunes next to freeform stuff. Some of that was admittedly not very "musical". 

Out of that chaos emerged Obscured, Meddle and Dark Side, so it is all worth it.  I don't know how this ranks all-time, but I feel like Hum's "Downward is Heavenward" never got enough appreciation. You might've heard it when you were an angsty teen. It's okay. We all, usually, grow out of it. You go back a few years later and it's like a punch in the face. It's dark, it's needy, and then it realizes it doesn't need to be. BAM. It punches you again. It's tough. It's industrial. It's sobering. You come out a different person. You can't tell if you're better or worse for it. Yet you feel like someone just took your brain put it in their head to soak up everything, ran it through a grinder, and stapled it back in your head.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMusic) if you have any questions or concerns.* YOU CANT EVEN HEAR IT! I listened to the shit out of that disc when I got my first car. Haven't heard it in years now, thanks for the reminder! It's seriously considered one of the best mixtapes of all time. #2 on a list by complex and I'm sure many other put it at least top 5... All of Frank Black's solo stuff is underrated!  Devil's workshop by Frank Black and the catholics has to be on this list! I have had many discussions on the Possesed thing. In my book it is still more thrash than death, but really arguing about it won't go anywhere. In my book it starts with Chuck. 

To each their own.  Good find! Trout Mask Replica is not to be listened to. It's a trophy, or a shibboleth, if you will -- passage into the elite club of true audiophiles -- you know, people who appreciate music so much that they can never really enjoy it. Anyhow, that's what I hear, after several attempts over the years.  ITT: a ton of folks who are unclear exactly what underappreciated means.  

It's a tough question.  In my opinion, Califone's Roots and Crowns is the best album of the last decade.   But that record's probably more obscure than underappreciated; there's a difference.  

I suspect the answer has to be a record from an established artist that many folks say was a misstep, or just plain bad.  

If you think Self Portrait is the best Bob Dylan record, for example, that would qualify.   Impressionist, heartfelt, independent slack-rock at its zenith. Lyrical depth as plunderable as you care to go, and riffs to satisfy any pop sensibility. Are they accessible? Are they incoherent? Do they rock or do they shred? All we know is that indie rock would never be the same.

It's a sound that people are still trying to copy: Big, strange guitars, bombastic drums, and washed-out slacker poetry. Everything is produced with a big-budget sheen, without encroaching on believability. Each piece fits cozily into the mix, often led by meandering guitar lines in odd tunings, or nostalgic ponderings on the state of rock music. These wistful and sometimes condescending jabs rarely, if ever, come across the wrong way; they're here to right the wrongs of boring music. They want to give you back rock the way you remember it. Not stylistically - while there are a few callback riffs, this is rock made new and rebellious again. We know they loved Lou Reed and Sonic Youth, but they seem pressed to deliver something instantly accessible, as if to say: we don't have to have a gimmick, we don't have to be weird, this is not post-modern, this is just the way out.

I could never, however, describe the band or this album as well as they once described themselves - a single quote, hidden away in a forgotten ep:

"I am made of blue sky and hard rock and I will live this way forever."

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVhsO-Nbl5M&amp;list=PL95E54B3C5839FE4B) Is there gas in the car? It's at once triumphant, brittle, sweet and melancholy. An amazing album. I'm from the DC area.  I kind of Grew up with Minor Threat, Black Flag, Fugazi.  I had a party at my house once back in high school and had some punk bands over to play.  Ian MacKaye was there.  That was an awesome night! Do you have dreams?  Of course you do, we all do. But do you remembers when youre dreams of who youd become while ignorant of what life had instore for you? Now imagine those dreams were produced by Phil Spector (not involved on this album) and filtered through the radio of a 67 Chevy. Each side opens and closes with a mirror of each other, asking you what if you're dreams dont come true, or more importantly, what if they do?   Isn't every great album slammed by the "experts" at Rolling Stone? Radiohead - Kid A Double nickel on the dime by Minute Men TRY GETTING A RESERVATION AT DORSIA NOW YOU FUCKING STUPID BASTARD It wasn't me.  Too good [Resonance by Mad At Gravity](http://youtu.be/QAChY87KXtI)

The band ended up parting ways before reaching mass audiences, but I swear if they had stayed together they woulda been huge. I think the biggest they got was a song or two on the Reign of Fire soundtrack. They've been one of the biggest influences on my own music with Dear Love. Is this underrated or not rated at all?  Rift by Phish.  I know they are more known for their live act but Rift is an incredibly tight album.  The songs all work together in context and almost tell a story.  It's one of those albums I put in my cd player periodically and am always blown away with how well everything works together.   I like the crowd goes wild song. Harry Connick, Jr. - **She** Relationship of Command by At The Drive-In.  It was their only album and it was produced by the Beastie Boys.  It's little on the alternative heavy side and some call the lyrics word salad but the energy is undeniable.  Dont listen to it while driving because it motivates you to speed and vigorously pound your steering wheel.  **Progressive Rock**

gun to my head....Come Together? Well, I though you could give me a quick summary, but that's obviously beyond you. Fick nickelback Velvet Underground "[Loaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NwKZ9ZsgGA0", greatest rock album of all time.

Gang Starr "[Hard to Earn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Nf5doxmPBg)", greatest hip hop album of all time. you are on fire m'dude yes yes yes a thousand times yes, this should top this list hands down, he leads the best band in the world and then finds his stride with his solo work and kills it, delivers one of the greatest albums of all time and no one gives a shit :(
