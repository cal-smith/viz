I don't have anything worth hiding from the FBI, but I do not support allowing the FBI to trample on my Constitutional rights in the name of \"security.\"  ", "score": 1},{"body": "It's an interesting conundrum we're presented with here, but the answer is substantially less straight-forward than just shoot on site.\n\nFirst, let's establish our goals:\n\n1) Preservation, rehabilitation, and possible expansion of new healthy, productive ecosystems capable of sustaining existing native biodiversity\n\nThat's the big one. That's the one issue that the majority of the environmental movement, academic environmental scientists, and laypeople with an interest is and should remain focused on. Emerging out of that line of thinking is the directive to eliminate feral cats, as they're an introduced, invasive species. Invasive species negatively affect the health and productivity of existing natives species = get rid of the invasives.\n\nBut it's not the only goal. Also:\n\n2) Support the ability for humans and non-human organisms to adapt to existing and upcoming challenges to the local and global environment.\n\n3) Help mitigate the harmful effects of human activity on the productivity, biodiversity, and adaptive capabilities of ecosystems associated with human beings.\n\nThe last two are extremely dependent upon the timescale from which you examine the problem. If you're just concerned with the bird counts this winter you get a totally different answer than if you're thinking thousands, tens of thousands, or more years down the line.\n\nThe fact is, we've moved a fairly large number of species around the world, where they've since become naturalized. Invasive in some cases, but naturalized nonetheless. We're not going to get rid of these (frequently) cosmopolitan species, and many are not going to die out if we died out. Feral cats are one. Sparrows, rats, kudzu, innumerable microorganisms are others. \n\nThe ecosystems that existed perhaps as little as a few decades, and certainly tens of thousands of years ago, is gone. It's gone. Nature doesn't wind back the clock. We're as much a part of nature as the songbirds and wildflowers, so we cannot wind back the clock. We have forever modified the biological skin of this planet.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's dead, necessarily dying, or has to die. The cosmopolitan species are a seed of a future world. This phenomenon has numerous precedents in evolutionary history.\n\nSo acknowledging that, let's examine what feral cats really do. They're a voracious predator of small birds and mammals almost exclusively (their occasional grass eating habit excepted). They're also usually associated with humans and human modified environments. It's not impossible to find evidence of cats deep in the woods, but they're massively more common in urban and sub-urban areas.\n\nA substantial portion of other introduced birds and mammals share that similar relationship with the human landscape.\n\nIf this was any other set of organisms that I was talking about, say beaves, wolves, and moose, we'd be ooh-ing and aah-ing about the grandeur of nature. Shit man, this is grand too! We've got a whole ecosystem of organisms that, like it or not, hang out with us in pretty much every urban area on the planet.\n\nBy all indications, human population and particularly the proportion of humans living in urban areas is going to keep increasing. Urban areas are expanding in size as well, in terms of total land surface area devoted to them. That is to say, the \"urban ecosystem\" is expanding.\n\nBack to goals 2 and 3. We should be equally focused on making this urban ecosystem resilient against climate change, disease, or other environmental shocks as we are for the green belts and wild areas surrounding the urban areas. And we should be thinking of ways to make the two work well together.\n\nIn some cases, yes, that means the feral cats are really not helping and perhaps we should try to reduce their numbers. But in others, maybe we should be thinking in terms of helping the native songbirds bridge the gap between the long dead or rapidly dying ecosystem of the past, and the nascent new cosmopolitan ecosystem. And sometimes, perhaps we should look at our ecological neighbors and toss 'em a few scraps (literally in some cases, but metaphorically most of the time!).", "score": 1},{"body": "Goddamn how do people afford to adventure like that.", "score": 1},{"body": "Your submission was removed as it violates rule I: No pictures with added/superimposed text. || No comics or infographics", "score": 1},{"body": "RIP his hair", "score": 1},{"body": "Wow.

Those who adhere to a confrontational view of sharia tend to ascribe many undesirable practices to sharia and religion overlooking custom and culture, even if high-ranking religious authorities have stated the opposite.\" Otto's analysis appears in a paper commissioned by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nI think it's very important to remember that there are approximately 1.6 billion Muslims in the world - and the majority of them are nonviolent. Imams around the world are condemning this attack. \n\nThough I agree that most Muslims do not enjoy seeing their prophet desecrated, I do not agree that most celebrate this tragedy. \n\nI have Muslim neighbors and friends. There are Muslims on Reddit that you can talk with about their beliefs. In my personal experience, and in the news, I hear a unified reaction of horror. \n\nAre there others that celebrate? Of course. Just as Christian fundamentalist nuts celebrate when so called \"abortion clinics\" are firebombed. This type of extremism finds fertile ground in all religions, and in atheists as well (think of nationalist extremism). \n\nI agree - to a point - that reform is needed.
