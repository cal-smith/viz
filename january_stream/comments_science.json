The Amish, sometimes called old-order Amish or Amish Mennonites, are a group of Christian \n&gt; fellowships among Mennonite churches.

Immunization is not\n&gt; prohibited by Amish or Hutterite religious doctrine, but vaccine acceptance varies from district to district. Districts that typically decline immunization reflect a social tradition within these religious communities, related to modernity, more than a theological objection. Low immunization rates in Amish communities have been attributed variously to limited access to care, limited disease understanding, higher priority to other activities, and concerns about vaccine safety, with\n&gt;     variability among various communities [18,120\u2013123].\n&gt; \n&gt; They tend to define illness in terms of failure to function in a work role, more than in terms of symptoms [19].

While low vaccination rates exist in some Amish communities, the rates can be attributed to other factors and are not related to a formal religious objection. Over the years there have been a number of outbreaks in Amish communities where there are low vaccination rates, and the usual response is a sharp increase in vaccine compliance. \n\nThe position of the Amish on vaccines is outlined in John Grabenstein's systemic review, What the world's religions teach, applied to vaccines and immune globulins, published in the peer-reviewed journal Vaccine, April 2014. \n\n&gt;  3.1.5.2.  \n&gt; Amish and related communities. The Amish, sometimes called old-order Amish or Amish Mennonites, are a group of Christian \n&gt; fellowships among Mennonite churches. Amish fellowships began with a schism within a group of Anabaptists in Switzerland in  \n &gt; 1693 CE. Related groups in Canada and the northern US are known as Hutterites. Immunization is not\n&gt; prohibited by Amish or Hutterite religious doctrine, but vaccine acceptance varies from district to district. Districts that typically decline immunization reflect a social tradition within these religious communities, related to modernity, more than a theological objection. Low immunization rates in Amish communities have been attributed variously to limited access to care, limited disease understanding, higher priority to other activities, and concerns about vaccine safety, with\n&gt;     variability among various communities [18,120\u2013123].\n&gt; \n&gt; They tend to define illness in terms of failure to function in a work role, more than in terms of symptoms [19].

Major meaning that the plaintiff suing the surgeon has a good case because something actually went wrong, either due to negligence or just bad luck. (This isn't counting sometimes up to a dozen other lawsuits that are filed and dropped quickly, which still cost money.)\n\nWhen these lawsuits are filed, they are filed against every single doctor, surgeon, specialist, anesthesiologist, supervisor, technician, and everyone else who had anything to do with the patient (even if their role was unrelated to the problem.) The patient and their lawyer don't know enough about medicine to identify what went wrong, so they drag everybody in to give a deposition and try to get them to point fingers at each other so that they can narrow down who they're trying to sue. Sometimes they get lucky and the healthcare professionals give them good info, but most likely the problem wasn't really anyone's *fault* to begin with so they just say whatever they can to shift the blame to someone else and hopefully they can go home.\n\nAt this point, the lawyer picks a person or persons they think were responsible for the issue and actually takes them to trial.

Also, just to add to this, there were tons of tests we ordered in the hospital that were technically unnecessary, but which were still informative. Just because a test is negative does not mean it was unnecessary, yet many papers that review hospital testing use this sort of measure to retrospectively sort through which tests were \"necessary\" or not. For example, we ordered blood tests on every post-op patient every day-- the lab would sometimes tell us that these were unnecessary, but every time that someone's kidneys ended up failing or someone had a surprising amount of blood loss a day or two after surgery or someone had a super high potassium level that could have caused heart problems, we were grateful we had done these tests. But if someone asked me in a survey why I am ordering these tests, I'm not going to try to justify it by anecdotal experiences, I'm going to push my agenda and say I order lots of tests to practice defensive medicine because I don't want to get sued for missing someone's post-op renal failure, etc., so I check labs for it. Regardless of what reasons I give, it is clear that this is actually all based on reasonable decision making, and these sorts of things are not meaningful sources of inflationary costs of medicine. Interestingly, however, the tests that we did that were actually unnecessary typically had nothing to do with \"defensive medicine,\" and everything to do with hospital policies (e.g., with every transferred patient, we were required to repeat all the imaging and scans because 'something new might have developed' or 'might have been missed on the other hospital's scans').

The physician is suspected of being negligent (which can be difficult to prove/disprove), he or she treated the patient outside the \"standard of care\", and the result was harm to the patient.  Standard of care is a tricky one, the are volumes of guidelines but most all of them are based on the studies of prior cases and assumptions of their conclusions.  So when physicians follow the guidelines even when their own clinical judgement tells them \"it's unlikely to be disease A, but I can't be 100% sure and if I'm wrong the patient suffers/dies and I get sued\" they order the battery of tests that some perceive as unnecessary.  This is what many people equate with defensive medicine.  However, if the battery of tests is the only way to be sure you are not missing something and most physicians run them (not to mention hospitals vigorously encouraging it) IT BECOMES the standard of care.  Then, acting on your own clinical judgement and avoiding the tests are now practicing outside that standard.  So the trend becomes the trap.  The hospital systems install protocols which direct diagnostics and therapy based on initial triage reports from the nurse at the front door and nursing assessments of patients during their workup.  So if a patient meets even the minimal risk of developing a blood clot I either have to give them anticoagulants or thoroughly document my decision not to (thereby admitting my guilt in the event a blood clot occurs).  Walking is very helpful to reduce the chances of blood clots, but due to the litigation from prior patient falls/injuries I can't just order the nurses to allow the patient to walk.  I have to document why, how often, and with assistance.  If I do order them to let the patient walk, the nurses have been given authority by the hospital to disregard my order and call a supervisor to report it. This leads to phone calls, meetings, more documentation.  If I just given the anticoagulants and let the hospital confine my patient to their bed with bed alarms and such, the anticoagulants have the risk of causing a serious bleed or renal failure and it takes longer for the patient to heal because they are now sedentary.  People do expect or at least hope their doctors to be 100% on the ball and sometimes they expect them to be 100% perfect (right or wrong, it's a typical perception).

They all have a sensitivity and specificity that less than 100%. By changing the thresholds for \"this person has disease,\" you are going to include people that dont have disease as well as people that do. You are going to cause these people to have stress, anxiety, and further testing ordered that they don't need. When you decrease the size of your filter, you're going to catch more cases that should be caught, but also more cases that should have passed through. Additionally, not all tests are benign  - some involve exposure to harmful substances. Sure, doing an ultrasound or measuring someones FEV1 shouldn't have any reasonable expectation of harm, but that isn't the case for everything (and there are always exceptions...). Every X-ray/CT involves exposing the patient to radiation. En masse, this is going to have a undesirable effect on cancer rates, even if you can't attribute an individual person's cancer directly to their radiation exposure. Nonetheless, there are still *some* people out there who have gotten cancer due to tests that they wouldn't have had otherwise. For the population at large, its easy to say something like, \"oh, well, only increase testing to the point that the increased risk is equal to the increased benefit.\" But medicine is a human endeavour - you can't view people as being tested in a vacuum. By ramping up testing, we introduce negative effects and potentially ruin the lives of people who would have otherwise lived happily and peacefully. And there are still people with disease who will be missed. Nonetheless, that is the right answer. But that won't make anyone *feel* any better. What can you say to a person who has a cancer that wasn't diagnosed? \"Oh, we didnt test you because you fell outside the 95% confidence interval for being likely to have cancer?\" From a human standpoint, thats ridiculous, but from a scientific stanpoint, thats how decisions are made, and need to be. Your story is absolutely heartbreaking, and the limits of medicine are something that I feel bound by every day. But I cannot ignore the fact that nothing in medicine is black or white; instead, everything involves varying degrees of risk. It doesn't matter what outcome ends up being decided on as the consensus, there will always be people who are passed over. That isn't to say that we shouldn't stop trying to improve - instead, both physicians and patients need to recognize that what we can do as humans has limits. I know it sounds like I'm rambling here, but its because I'm dancing around the fact that medicine isn't all powerful, and sometimes, we have to accept the fact that we as humans are going to have to suffer terrible things because of bad luck.

One or two CT scans is going to do very little to increase your cancer risk, if anything at all.\n\nI agree with your sentiment, however. There are two compelling reasons that we should continue to practice defensive medicine in the majority of cases - PET scans aside.\n\n1) Screening tests are useful and protect at risk communities. - e.g. HIV. I used to live in Vauxhall, London, and the GP clinic offered every single person a routine HIV check for no other reason than it is a gay friendly neighbourhood. I'm sure some people tested false positive. However - these tests are cheap and quick (hence screening), so you can easily do the test again - and the chance of a false positive is virtually eliminated. See: smear tests.\n\n2) Rarer conditions with more invasive tests. e.g. brain cancer. These conditions are rare - it is prudent to practice defensive medicine in the majority of cases, so you can better understand how to treat specific subtypes of what was once considered just one condition. For a 27 year old male who has 2 tonic clonic seizures 2 days apart - should they just prescribe epilepsy drugs and be done with it? 95%+ of the time, they would be right. \n\nBy exposing 100 people to a head CT scan at 2 milli Seiverts a piece, they find 5 people that already had a brain tumour, which they wouldn't have found otherwise.

Epidemiological studies are there to provide evidence of an association between two variables, in this case risk of melanoma diagnosis and coffee intake.\n\nWhen reporting on these potential associations we should be damn sure of the quality of them. Normally we do this by adjusting for other variables that could affect our outcome. To give an artificial example of why this is important I may do a study looking at rates of cancer in a group and find those with hip replacements are more likely to have certain types of cancer. Does this mean hip replacements cause cancer, almost certainly not. Are they even associated with cancer, possibly but again unlikely. Hip replacements are more likely to occur in older people, cancer is also more common in older people. When we control for age as factor it's very likely the association we saw would disappear.\n\nApplying that logic to this study; melanoma already has a very good, clear risk factor associated to it, UV exposure. The authors do try to control for UV exposure in their study. In their methods the authors seem to suggest they measured the UV exposure at each place where people lived in July each year and averaged it for a 15 year block (1978-1993) and a 9 year block (1996-2005). Now then you can decide whether this is a good enough measure of individuals UV exposure for the previous 10.5 years in the follow up period. Personally, I don't find that convincing at all. Especially when it is not inconceivable that increased coffee intake may be associated with reduced UV exposure, given that high coffee consumption maybe associated with office jobs that reduce UV exposure through lack of being outside as much in daylight hours. \n\nAnother issue this study highlights is whats called data mining. If I have a large data set say looking at food intake and 20 outcomes measured. At a 95% confidence interval level one of those 20 outcomes is likely to be 'significantly' associated purely by chance. Similarly if I my same large data set but one outcome, but stratify my data set into 20 different ways, one of the stratifications is likely to be correlated with the outcome by pure chance. \nA quick literature search of the last author shows they've published papers using this data set before, another search for the study itself suggests over 150 papers have been published looking for associations within this data set, some of which linking coffee to other cancer types have been negative (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23681472).\n\nAll of these methodological difficulties may suggest the association we have observed is not actually true. Before urging everyone to grab another cup, we could see if the association holds up in other data sets. Alternatively using better measurements of UV exposure would reduce the risk of confounding, I'd imagine someone's probably developed a sensor people could have attached to belts to measure personal UV exposure during follow up. The ideal study would be to randomise a group of people to coffee or no coffee for say 10 years and see if melanoma rates change then. The randomisation would produced a balanced cohort of all of the confounding factors (including UV) and then we could assess causality of coffee intake on melanoma. \n\nAnyway if there's any more questions, just ask, otherwise I'm off for a cup of coffee.

She said it was probably stress, but  wanted to do a brain MRI just in case. And of course they found something on part of my brain stem and cerebellum. Small but definitely a lesion or growth. So then Iended up getting a spinal MRI and  spinal tap to check for MS since it seemed the most likely. Nothing. No other signs. It became wait and see, with a brain MRI every four months. No growth or change for over a year. In the meantime I'm put on a medication that stops the twitching. Finally after a year it grew, and it's behavior put it in the benign brain tumor category. I changed neurologists soon after that due to her crappy office personnell and her not doing anything about them. \n\nWhen I told my second neurologist about all the tests and how the tumor was originally found he practically gaped at me. He said that the facial nerves that had been twitching are all associated with high stress. It was completely unrelated to the tumor and its location. It was pure luck/misfortune that the MRI actually showed anything. I actually came off the medication soon after and the twitching didn't come back. \n\nSo now I have to get MRIs every two years to watch it. Can't ignore it since it's shown growth twice in five years, but they don't want to treat it yet since there are high risks due to its location.\n\n It may end up not affecting me my entire life or it may start pressing on certain parts of my brain and I start having serious symptoms. Either way, it was a complete accident and just my original neurologist either being lazy, covering her ass or just trying to help their practice by charging for an unnecessary MRI (they had a machine in house so I did all my scans there until I changed doctors).

In that contrived example there's only two diseases so why not test anyway, but in real life there'd be dozens of possibilities as you're well aware.

Greek olive oil is different than what you buy in America. There is actually a book called, \"Extra Virgin\" that tells about the olive oil scam. The greens that they eat come from the mountains and contain an insane amount of antioxidants, as well as the oil. Whole grains such as dark breads and rusk are consumed with most every meal. Meat is not always consumed at every meal but will probably consist of some fish,seafood, or snails. Red meat, however, is consumed minimally around 1-2 a month. So with the combination of an active lifestyle and the powerfoods of the Greek and Cretans people it results in some of the healthiest people on Earth. Side note: i saw more old people than I have ever in my life. and they were almost all smoking.

In my mind this all comes down to a question of differential diagnosis.   As a critical care nurse i find myself saying.. and i see doctors and other nurses occasionally NOT saying:  \"what are the FIVE worst things that could happen?\" (even in situations that almost never have very negative outcomes)  Now i picked the number 5 mostly arbitrarily off the top of my head just now but in any given diagnostic scenario if feel like there are usually at least 5 potentially deadly consequences or unintended consequences of either missing something or doing something we shouldn't have.   I very much agree with another comment in this thread that mentions potential complications from over testing but I must stress it has to be taken with a grain of salt.    ABG's was the example i read here, and yes there is a risk of thrombus but usually the risk of impending acidosis and respiratory failure is a much larger concern.  Furthermore having dealt with too many ABG draws and arterial lines to count I can think of none that have resulted in this potential complication.     A more pertinent example would be things like IV contrast administration for a CT scan,  or empirical antibiotic prescription for certain sets of symptoms.     These actions have real and immediate negative consequences that could outweigh any benefits of care provided if done hastily without considering our options carefully.    Yes we have evidence based protocols and policies for deciding who gets what and how much (like kidney function tests in this case),  but I have seen many cases where these protocols were followed and damage still resulted, and it might have been that we should have left well enough alone, observed closely and supported the individual conservatively.   On the other hand I'll use a real example from my career that directly relates to the chest pain comments above.   In this case doctors did NOT order some extra \"defensive\" tests or take extra steps that, if done, could possibly have saved a patient's life:   Patient comes to ER with chest pain, is seen and worked up much as described above,  EKG and troponin are negative and the patient is given nitroglycern aspirin etc...  chest pain is non-specific and appears to have resolved... said patient is admitted anyway and stress test is scheduled for next morning.    For first several hours of admission patient is 100% normal, moving independently in room,  suddenly tech watching heart monitor screams down hallway to get to patient room..  Patient found unresponsive on floor cyanotic with no pulse.  CPR performed immediately and effectively with no response or recovery.   Patient had dissecting AAA.       If ER doctors had practiced \"defensively\"  patient may have gotten a chest x-ray or abdominal x-ray or CT that almost certainly would have revealed some abnormality and it may have been possible to fix it.       Now the doc/nurses involved in this made no errors and are very good at their jobs,  the odds of this outcome are very small, and these are good people who care about their patients, so please don't reply with \"how could someone miss it?\"   Lets go back and review what i said earlier using hindsight.   What are some worst things that could happen with chest pain? (Basically your H's and your T's)    ACS (heart attack, maybe pericardial effusion),  PE (clot in lungs),  Trauma (collapsed lung).... the list goes on... and finally Aortic aneurysm (the high pressure garden hose coming from your heart is weakening and delaminating) .     A chest x-ray would have eliminated a few of these at once but some (like PE) can be eliminated with blood work, and most of the others are plausibly eliminated with a simple physical exam and patient history.     So whats really happening here?      Time is money as always!   our healthcare system does not allow highly trained doctors and nurses the time to critically think about these issues often enough.   Insurance companies push agendas of not ordering tests too often to save themselves money, while on the other hand certain MD's push certain diagnostics for everyone because they can bill for them and it might be pertinent.   Then when crunch time comes and that case where the patient just doesn't feel right comes in we have 20 other people telling us to hurry up and the extra tests that should be ordered get overlooked in the shuffle, or the person who maybe doesn't need IV contrast gets it anyway and they're ARF.    Then we have the really good doctors who stay late and are always tired because they are always thinking critically and caring, ordering an extra test because something doesn't add up.  We hope they don't burn out... same with the nurses who do this and advocate that doctors order the extra tests.   Are you starting to see how complicated this can get?      \n\nTLDR:  just like most things in life this is a gray area, there are a lot of reasons shit happens, you can't fucking boil it down or dumb it down too much....  merely calling it \"defensive medicine\"  frames the entire issue incorrectly.  \n\n...we need to spend more money on educating kids and the public about their health and more money on universal healthcare and education in general.

A result of eating too less of these essential foods can result in ketoacidosis.\n\nAs the chart above from Cahill shows the brain can use ketones as well.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis doesn't happen unless you have an underlying condition:\n\n*\"There is frequent confusion between the dietary ketosis seen during a ketogenic diet and \nthe pathological and potentially fatal state of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).  DKA occurs only in \nType I diabetes, a disease characterized by a defect in the pancreas, whereby insulin cannot be \nproduced.  Type I diabetics must take insulin injections to maintain normal blood glucose levels.  \nIn diabetics who are without insulin for some time, a state that is similar to dietary ketosis \nbegins to develop but with several differences.\"*\n\n...\n\n*\"Additionally, in non-diabetic individuals there are at least two feedback loops to prevent \nrunaway ketoacidosis from occurring.  When ketones reach high concentrations in the \nbloodstream (approximately 4-6 mmol), they stimulate a release of insulin (8,12).  This increase \nin insulin has three major effects (24).  First, it slows FFA release from the fat cell.  Second, by \nraising the insulin/glucagon ratio, the rate of ketone body formation in the liver is decreased.  \nThird, it increases the excretion of ketones into the urine.  These three effects all serve to lower \nblood ketone body concentration.\"*\n\n*\"In addition to stimulating insulin release, ketones appear to have an impact directly on the \nfat cell, slowing FFA release (12,22). This would serve to limit FFA availability to the liver, \nslowing ketone body formation.  Ultimately these two feedback loops prevent the non-diabetic \nindividual from overproducing ketones since high ketone levels decrease ketone body formation.\"*\n\n*\"Type I diabetics lack both of these feedback loops.\"*\n\n[\"The Ketogenic Diet\"](http://books.google.com/books?id=JtCZBe-2XVIC&amp;amp;lpg=PA35&amp;amp;ots=dNISh1zQJz&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false) by Lyle McDonald, page 35.\n\n&gt;  it is a diet that long term can produce some very bad effects, compared to a wholesome and well rounded diet\n\nDo you have any study supporting this claim?

It would be too costly to cultivate the cows just for that purpose, so drilling for gas although less environmentally friendly, is a much more cost and time effective option.\nOn the other hand, we have products like insulin, that can be produced effectively from genetically modified bacteria, and it's not too difficult to produce considering the amount of insulin we need is orders of magnitude less than the hydrogen gas demand of the world. Even though it can be done, insulin extraction from swine is still higher than artificial production due to its cost effective benefits. \n\nOnce we find a way to reduce or remove that cost barrier, we will see great things happening with bacteria farms producing most of the organic chemicals and materials we need in society today.", "score": 1},{"body": "That is labeled as such.

DNA and proteins alone can not explain the complexity of life.  Human DNA only contains about 20,000-30,000 protein encoding genes, which is extraordinarily small; some grains of rice are known to have more encoding genes.  So where does the complexity of life come from?  Well, after proteins are made, they're post translationally modified by an extraordinary library of modification (there are over 300 known).  The largest class of these is modification by carbohydrates.  The sum of all carbohydrate modifications--known as the glycome--is believed to be orders of magnitude more complex than the entire proteome and genome.  By just changing one sugar on a protein, you can radically alter a protein's behavior, folding, half life and signaling (this is why antibody production is a major challenge.  Additionally, you can not predict the patterns of the glycome from genetic information alone; the glycome has no known code that would allow you to control in a template like manner like DNA/protein (it's a stochastic process).  \n\n\nInserting foreign DNA into a cell doesn't always produce the expected result.  For example, recombinant human protein production in bacteria doesn't always work, and it's because bacteria do not produce the same patterns of glycosylation that humans do, and proteins often have problems folding (which is why you have to move to yeast).  In order to get a fully functional protein to work in a human cell, you'd have to be able to predict if it could fold correctly (which still hasn't been solved).  Glycosylation of proteins has a very significant effect on protein folding, so you'd have to include sites for it (unfortunately exactly where proteins will be modified by sugars is unpredictable).  Even if you had the right sites for glycan addition to proteins so that they'd fold, you still can not guarantee that the right type of glycans would be added so that you'd have a properly functional protein (because again, the glycome is unpredictable with no code).  For example, just by changing one sugar on a class of proteins like ion channels, you can radically alter their gating properties.
