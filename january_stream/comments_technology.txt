Netflix won't play if you're doing screen sharing. I often control the living room computer from one of the other computers around the house  -- download movies, queue up files, etc etc -- and we started watching the fifth element one night and it just stopped with an error. Try again, same error. Copy paste error into google.com and boom, a DRM restriction. As soon as I disconnected the screensharing netflix worked as expected. This wasn't a problem with the silverlight plugin. I actually once finished a movie upstairs while everyone else watched via screenshare because i had to shoot of an email for work. Right this way brother /r/pcmasterrace 
 * Unlimited with no caps or fair use policies. What you sell is bandwidth, only.
* No throttling or blocking anything.
* No hidden charges (charge a flat rate with taxes included)
* Offer symmetrical speeds.
* Do not limit what a person can do on the network legally (You are selling bandwidth to access the Internet, that's it.).
* Do not do DPI.
* Overselling is fine but overselling the backbone is not. Very few will use 10Mb/s 24/7 but those that do are paying you for that. If during peak times your backbone is flooded, it's time to upgrade.
* This may sound obvious but don't lie or cheat and don't advertise something you can't do.
* Make profits selling bandwidth not renting modem/routers

**Good luck** It's a 2 line unlimited plan. I understood the device charge would be on top of the base discounted bill but I was told that purchasing wasn't even an option anymore, they only did leases. I was told that the upside to this was that insurance was included. I was then shown on the guys computer screen that my bill would be 130 and some change with everything.  My ATT bill was like 173 and they're throwing in insurance and tethering so screw it right? It's not half but it's still decent savings. First bill comes and it's 170. When I went to the store to ask about it and what the deal with my phone was, the sales guy who was there literally told me that the guy I dealt with the first time always lies to people and he couldn't do anything about it, oh and tethering was only "included" as an additional fee add on.  I'm one of the few as well, stay strong brother.  It's pretty standard shorthand for negative and positive here in the UK. Well then, let us just go ahead and look at setting up a mesh network shall we.

Because fuck the surveillance state, that's why.

And I'm only half kidding - if you can figure out how to get 50% of the population on the bandwagon of open source, open developed, supported hardware for promoting a mesh network that is based on hardware with open source firmware. Well, Amazing things could happen.

The good news? Research is already being done. The hardware the average consumer has in their home is getting more and more capable of managing the necessary bandwidth throughput to make it feasible. Cellular is a good example of a "you get what you pay for" market. Hello!

Basically, if they charges have not been laid, get up and walk away. Don't stick around. Well for fucks sake, I argued exactly this a few months ago and got downvoted to oblivion. Reddit is such a cunt sometimes. Make profits selling bandwidth not renting modem/routers If they can't prove you are a terrorist then it becomes blatantly obvious that the law is flawed.

Odds are they won't invoke it unless their is reason to. Kind of ...

If I remember correctly: dig a hole in the ground so that the victim is more than half-burried, head up. Wrap the victim in blig cloth blanket (like a bed sheet), on top of that you tie them up with rope ( put the victim in the hole and fill up a bit so that only head and soulders are coming out of the ground). Then people start stoning.

But I prefer the Monthy Python version in *Life of Brian*
 "The issue here is simple: When you promise consumers unlimited, that means unlimited, said Jessica Rich"

The answer is simple: it is unlimited. This is great. I grandfathered in on a plan about 15 years ago that gave me "Unlimited internet for life." They stopped it because one guy in an apartment complex would get it and sell the password to his router for a monthly fee. But despite their best efforts to sell me "better plans", I still have unlimited Netflix, YouTube, all the streaming video and audio I want. I'm just careful about letting anyone leach. damn I have the T-mobile 1 gig plan and I barely ever hit that. Everything I do is wifi save for maybe looking stuff up if I'm the go. If you need to prioritize something you don't have enough bandwidth and should be buying more. Last month I used 2.2gb of my 5gb which is basically just streaming in the car. I use Wi-Fi at home, the gym, and work. I used 10gb over Wi-Fi. WHAT DID HE EAT FOR BREAKFAST TODAY? Schrodinger's cell plan.

 They're not being  personally paid, their election campaigns are benefiting. That money is useless if the electorate gets off their collective ass and educates themselves on what their representatives stand for. You can't blame the corporations for the state of this democracy when 60% of the population forgoes their right to participate. I work for a highly technical company. We have a cancel button ready to go. Hate us? Fine, you know where to cancel. 500 is quite a lot, did you do a t-test to figure out if 500 was an insignificant number, or is that your personal opinion? In general it seems like there are enough people with the issue that a fix would make youtube better. But retards like you want to defend the problem for some unfathomable reason, because it works fine for them. Are you an idiot? I'm serious, I really want you to explain to me why you are defending a problem that many people are experiencing. If your argument is "because it works fine for most people", you really are an idiot. Since, they are in the States, they have to comply with the DCMA to get bandwidth. Hello!

^^^***Of ^^^up ^^^to ^^^1 ^^^MB. i(data)? 1. Have enough bandwidth that you don't need to use QOS. Then demand a lawyer and start pursuing compensation for damages. Getting some media in on it on how you were wrongfully held - that is a nice way to wrap things up.

If they don't have a serious charge, they won't hold you last I checked. It's bad for business and public image. Praise Gaben! Flash was such a wasted opportunity. There's so much expressive possibility that you can get from the software, and nothing has really filled its shoes yet. 

Flash had it's problems, but if Steve Jobs thought it was dead it was only because he wanted to kill it. When I'd say to someone that i'm an animator who uses Flash, even if they knew nothing about my industry they'd say "WHY? Flash is DEAD." Feels a bit like Adobe just gave up on it after that point. I really wish Adobe would just rename the GUI to something else and shift the focus towards the software's strengths instead of its tarnished name.


 ~25 GB a month isn't *too* outrageous but it's on the higher end of the spectrum.  The highest I've seen is 120 GB a month.  Obviously the guy was tethering and using Netflix and such but *damn* that's a lot of mobile data.

I admire your phone collection btw :P That moment when Three UK actually provide unlimited Internet with no fair usage policy at all and old contracts still get unlimited tethering too. All 4G. That was my first thought, yikes! That actually seems fine, the first bill always sucks, did they talk to you about prorated charges? Most likely, you activated your plan in the middle of the billing cycle, so your getting char charged for a month and a half, I hate proration but it comes with new lines, and I usually prepare my customers for it, what you want to check is, ongoing charges.

And while I wouldn't recommend taking
 off insurance it is optional. We just have "insurance %" goals which affect commission, that's why its "mandatory". But honestly, I would keep it. Its pretty comprehensive as long as you don't liquid damage your phone or break it, you don't have to pay the deductible Service as in network? GeeksIRC.
What would be the appropriate network for /r/technology? Freenode.
Anope or Atheme? Atheme, otherwise srvx. China is an interesting battleground between Apple and Xiaomi: Apple has the build quality, both the device and the software, Xiaomi has great specs and it's a national brand; who will win?  They managed to get it in the rest of the world, except Australia and Canada. Of course, but those are USA 2.0 and USA 3.0 beta That also doesn't have a roof. I guessing that could change somethings?

Edit: Nope, they say they are considered a motorcycle. On the plus side, you can take your motorcycle test in it. Trust me, I get throttled from time to time and the day my internet comes back I tend to go on a splurge. I'm not complaining about getting throttled in and of itself because that point was clear on the contract. I'm complaining about the dismal speed when I do get throttled: 16d/2u kbps is way slower than a dialup connection; and damn slower than the throttled speed when I signed on (which was 128d/16u kbps, usable for mail or barebones browsing with image downloading off). I don't disagree with any of that.

My issue is NOT with net neutrality. I think it is always a good thing, but I don't trust the FCC's methods of enforcing it (monitoring the internet), nor to I trust them to do it fairly (they'll let it slide when it benefits the government). I think /u/faz712 and /u/hydraloo are in the same class. That is virtually the most literal thing I've read all day. Pretty sure you can get 5 lines unlimited for $250 or so on T-Mobile.

I live just outside of Houston and am on T-Mobile. I haven't had any problems while in Houston. Is it really? Brutal. Judge Dredd alpha v0.1 I'll say this much regarding ISPs: I think that locally funded infrastructure and service is the way to go, and that it would already exist if big ISPs hadn't shut down the projects at their conception.

I also wish net neutrality could be enforced without the federal government getting involved in monitoring the internet (which is of course, always bad). I don't think it's overlooked. ISP's look very carefully at these things and say "we're going to make this really difficult". That would be funny if they announced 8 cities next.  The cable companies would catch the pattern and piss themselves. Firefox Hello does not support group chat either :( . I've read they are based on OpenTok and this protocol supports group chat, but it's not yet available in Hello. Will be eventually, though.

I don't blame the corporations, I blame the uneducated public and the ones who complain but do not participate. To be clear I'm not picking sides either, people complaing about one specific side constantly but ignoring the other when its doing the same thing.  &gt; We're not refining a solution, which is what you were pushing in one of your replies to me.

Then what does the name "DEMO" for the planned successor of ITER implies? That it is pure blue sky research? What irks me is that there are multiple bilions of Euros spend on purported solutions which have not been shown to be workable in a minimum way. Goddamn I want that plan. All of the above are good options. It just depends on what type of learner you are, and how much knowledge you already have.

For general information, Wikipedia is a good place to start. Understanding the concepts is a very important step to executing any attempt at protecting your personal security from identity theft, or worse. The next step may be talking to a local expert on the subject in question, or stopping by a library to do some research.

For more specific tools - research is your best bet. There are a few things that make for good starting points:

- IP masking

- SSH Tunnels

- Setting up a NAT with IP Tables

The idea of a NAT box is control. We can block connections from certain IP addresses, or DNS lookups. But that is not all of it. It is basically a router that has added functions (ex. web cache server, or local file server). We can stream video - that would include setting up remote web cams that one can access the feed of.

Or perhaps a file server?

More to think about:

- Anonymizing yourself online

- Keeping out of the red (no red flags)

- Preventing screw ups (it's really easy to screw up, difficult to maintain).

The Basics is, Java is bad for privacy. Facebook and flash? Bad for privacy. No script, adblock and similar are good for you. The number one place that serves virus'? Tends to be ad networks surprisingly enough. They make a great honeypot for hackers after all.

**Two Good Places to start**

- The Arch Wiki, this place has saved me many a headache in getting various linux systems up and running (even if they aren't running Arch)

- Ubuntu forums, with a large community, someone has probably answered the question or provided some place to start in answering it. It makes another good starting place.

**Tools To Look into**

- Cygwin, unix emulator for windows

- ToR, The Onion Router

- PGP, Pretty Good Privacy

**Exit Note**

I hope this gives you some direction into where to start. I don't know how much you might know or not, so here it is. The basics of where I began in scrapping my understanding of the web together. I'm going to start recording my in store conversations now also. Wow Actually, the numerical values of lower case letters are higher in ASCII, so typing a bunch of lowercase "z"s would do the trick. They just tow that data out of the environment. /r/firstworldanarchists Virtually = notreallylol &gt;In general it seems like there are enough people with the issue that a fix would make youtube better. 

Sure. "In general" 1 person is enough to make something better. The issue is effect size here, and long-term economical viablity, not if the issue is there, which - in turn - means your approach to analysis (t-test) is wrong.

&gt;But retards like you 

&gt;Are you an idiot?

&gt;I'm serious, I really want you to explain to me 

I think you're not in position to 'want' anything here. You might politely ask, I might find time to do so. However, I don't think you even understand why the 'auto' quality is there in first place, so any attempt would be as futile as explaining cytric acid cycle to 2 year old. In Los Angeles time warner upgraded everyone to 300mb for free, no Google fiber. Whats playstation Can it...tell if laws are unjust?  Encryption. Not 3ed party encryption managed by Google or your phone service provider. No, I mean  asynchronous 256 bit AES encryption (preferably better type.

But that is only half of it. Your "key" should be decrypting a small tool on a separate portion that can be destroyed should the worst case happen, leaving the data all but irretrievable. You can always have a backup in a safety deposit box in Switzerland.

Also, if you really need to keep something private: Sneaker net  Walk it to where it needs to go as a hard copy). The dude got EVERYTHING.

let that sink in for a bit...he got EVERYTHING Yes, this is what I was referring to.  For the record, I agree with your sentiment. Unlimited data says nothing about the speed in which it's delivered. For all intents and purposes you may still use as much data as you want during a month, however if you manage to reach the data threshold then your speeds are reduced. That's the argument.

I also think that makes sense. I think everyone here is mistaking what I'm trying to do, here. I'm playing devils advocate, noting more. CAPITAL LETTERS Comcast. We are coming for your nuts.

Ahh, I'm Canadian, British colony. Makes sense.

Also comment above mentioned Engineering/Science, and we use it mainly in my engineering class I just bought my own house at 20years old and after paying for tuition, utilities, car insurance, dental &amp; vision insurance and my mortgage, I have to skip on paying comcast for Internet..  So I am one of "those people" that use my phone tethered to my computer for Internet..  

And thanks! Since I can't afford to buy new phones with my monthly budget from my job (see above), I subsidize my phone habit by buying/selling/repairing phones on the side..  My family pays for my $50 line on their cell phone plan every month, but I have given them probably $2000 worth of phones that I could have sold in the last few years.  So it's all good in the long run. 


 I'm more worried about the little one that flies up and perches on my roof to crack my wifi. Praise our Lord and Savor Lord GabeN. Your mistake is assuming we are anywhere near the level of intelligence required to do what you're thinking of. 

That is hundreds of years off. So far we are doing very well at *mimicking* intelligence we're quite far from actually *developing* an intelligence. 

I'm much more afraid of AI that is controlled by humans. If people voluntarily work at a sweatshop, it because that is their best option. Same with different generations of iPhone.  And wait, there's more! Lol ya I remember my parents tried to put a password on my computer. I read the manual at 11 years old, took out the bios chip switch that flushed out those settings and made it ask for a new password.

 Literally a step in the most wrong direction.  I'm with you on 'due process is hard'.
drop into /r/mensrights and you will see regular reports of men falsely accused of X and how their life can easily be destroyed. Read further and you will often find a malicious ex or feminist with an axe to grind has ushered through the accusation/conviction with no sanity checks, verification of evidence etc.

There is a statistical proof to verify the current system of 'innocent until proven guilty', basically when someone does something not 'nice' people will point the finger. If it is 'bad' enough police and courts get involved. So the courts need a a 'innocent until proven guilty' regime, otherwise the narcissists put everyone else in jail. link? Whole bunch of Harvard and Cambridge Ivy league fucks who rule the world are in for quite a rude awakening come this century.

But the only time you need open your mouth, is when you are in a court of law. Do not bring up information - their investigation will find it or not.

When you disprove evidence brought in, rather then your statement being disprove - it looks better for you.

When things are revealed can be as, if not more important then the what. It's an encrypted network. How would they know? Yes, it is terrible. An Internet that slows down so much that it becomes unusable if you use it too much is... Unacceptable.  Do other countries have to have legal battles to decide what words mean?

This is why no one would buy American even if we made something. Want to see the American work ethic? It's about ripping people off. It really boils down to: "No limits which are applied based on your usage levels."

From a false-advertising perspective, a deal for "X bytes/sec" should be honored whether you're barely touching it or whether you're saturating the pipe. The lube isn't good... but it is. How can it be airtight for you? If the contract is over then they aren't legally obligated to give you any service, right? Can you please elaborate on what they could do with this access? Nah. It's a cat and mouse game. To compromise ToR, you would need to own a large portion of the nodes. And even then it's not guaranteed as it would be possible to specifically avoid certain nodes using the client - listing them as bad nodes.

Breaking the encryption and the connections requires you to be looking at both of the exit and entrance nodes at the time the connection in question is made. "In Arizona, regulators voted in November to allow the largest utility to tack a monthly fee of $5 onto the bill of customers with new solar installations. Arizona Public Service originally sought a $50 surcharge."
http://www.cnbc.com/id/101319945

"Earlier this month, PNM, New Mexicos largest electricity provider, proposed a distributed solar generation fee that could cost new solar installers $30 a month to connect to the grid."
http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/12/22/3605710/new-mexico-utility-charge-solar-owners-30-a-month/

"Arizona Public Service Co. is proposing charging customers who install rooftop solar panels $50 to $100 or more a month to cover the cost of maintaining the power grid."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/07/12/1223173/-Arizona-Utility-Wants-To-Kill-Solar#

Because I get charged $50 a month just means that I need to buy less solar panels. I will still have the same amount of time to pay it off as someone who buys more. The investment to get off the grid completely is lower though.

If the U.S. continues to subsidize solar, next year solar is projected to be the same price as coal. If I have to pay $30 just to stay connected or they lower the selling price that they have to buy it at, it will be another five years at least to become an option, again.  I am grandfathered into unlimited data with att and I get throttled too. Someone needs to tell them what the fuck the word unlimited means. This shit makes me so fucking angry. This is how they do it guys, little by little they will own the Internet and it will become as horrible as cable television. Motherfuckers. Had T-Mobile prepaid for years in Richmond, VA. Worked great. Signed up for a contract and got a nice phone. A few weeks I get transferred to Harrisonburg, VA. Service sucks. Now I know why people bitch about T-Mobile's service. In the city it was great. It here I get 2G unless I'm right by the college. Dropped calls like crazy too.  And from the [BBC article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30637010):

&gt; "It's not as quite as straightforward as it looks," he said. "It might look like there are lots of people visiting these sites but it is difficult to conclude that from this information."
&gt;"What proportion are people and which are something else? We simply don't know." he said, adding that "crawlers" run by law enforcement and other agencies that police abuse sites could be responsible for the steady stream of traffic. It's like many abbreviations - it has already been decided and is in common use in many fields.  Used to have a Straight Talk (owned by Tracfone) plan with "unlimited" data. When I hit 3GB on my plan, I received a threatening call from their customer service department grilling me on my data usage. They asked me if I streamed music or radio services on my phone and they told me that was a violation of their TOS. They warned me that if I kept streaming, they would disconnect my service.  And did we mention that we're going to raise our prices every year without increasing the quality of our food? Oh god. and I thought I was being gouged at 14USD for 1GB in Norway. Huh, it never occurred to me that computers could have applications in law like this. Seems like technology like this could be a huge step in making the judicial system fairer, seeing as how right now if you have enough money you can get you a lawyer to get you off of any charges. Yeah these motherfuckers need to be proverbially bitch slapped. When we can't even use the features on our phones att needs to use all the money we pay them to upgrade their networks instead of just putting it all into their pockets.  Even less effective as tech and resources get into mesh networking. People want to share already - and mesh networks and local P2P clients is an encredibly efficient way to do it.

Only problem is, once the tech is out there it can rapidly grow across towns, cities and countries to create back-boneless networks not reliant on the core system used to monitor the network usage.

Ouch.

This is a problem which pursued results in a very powerful backlash, using tech that is already legally usable, legally protected and has been guaranteed to work.

Hello Net 2.0, the mesh network.

We are years and decades off from it in reality. But the hardware to run one is starting to be in people's hands now. Also - the internet of things supports this to a large degree. Mesh networks are more robust as well, one bad node results in the network seeking a path around it, not region shutdown.

Basically, push this too hard, and the mesh network becomes inevitable. You appear to be morally outraged by this.

If you use Facebook, I hope you put that outrage into action and close your account. Youtube actually works really well on IE11, and I bet it is using the same media source extensions in the app. I had Virgin Mobile for a long time before switching to my current provider and I streamed Netflix for hours on end with no problems whatsoever *after* I passed the usage cap. I noticed no difference in load times or video quality.

Maybe it has to do with location? Their unlimited 4g LTE is truly unlimited 4G LTE. If it doesn't say "unlimited 4G LTE", then you'll get throttled after your data allotment. There are a few things to do.

1. Web plug in for SSL everywhere (or something like that, I forge it's exact name. Google =] )

2. PGP - email can be encrypted and then decrypted by it's intended receiver. Generally, no one in between will be able to.

3. Validate that it is encrypted, this takes a bit of work as it requires you to run a MITM attack on your own connection to see if you can recover the data (using something like wireshark).

As far as the data, if you trust the VPN provider there should not be an issue. However, don't do anything strictly illegal. Odds are they keep logs of some nature. It will lead to much more devices supporting video playback in websites. Since Flash is poorly maintained by Adobe on any device there will always be flaws in the system. HTML5 is an open standard which offers its features to every facturer who wants to integrate e.g. video playback - Like your Wii U, Playstation, Xbox, Smartphone, SmartTV or thousands of other possible uses. Despite that - HTML5 will be the core of the websites you'll visit in the future. It gives developers many tools at hand to create really good stuff - YOU SHOULD FUCKING CARE. Sorry. However, you'll probably use things created in HTML5 in the future and you'll be very happy about the developer not integrating 50 third party javascript applications messing up your browser. PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy. It is a piece of software for encrypting data / decrypting it when needed. Hello!

Start Playing Cat and Mouse. That has a hardware decoder. If you're referring to other Comcast customers using the hotspot provided for in the cable modem with built-in wifi you get from them, according to Comcast, it's on a separate channel so you're supposedly safe regarding security; maybe someone else can address whether or not it's really secure as I don't know enough about it. Whatever the case, I wasn't too thrilled with the hotspot prospect, so I went to the Comcast store and exchanged the cable modem with the wifi capability for one of the older models that doesn't have that feature. they would stop selling / renewing any "fake unlimited" contracts, and would stop advertising that contract type, and would not be guilty of false advertising.  Just because there are still active contracts that were made earlier doesn't affect the current advertising situation. A fast lane for adverts. Sounds great :-/ I've tried this same reasoning with my internet providers.... Good luck FTC. You and my husband. Last year when we went to visit my family, who subsequently did not have Internet at all, my husband needed to fix a figurative explosion at work (IT) and had to make a hotspot with his phone to use his computer. After 20 minutes ATT shut his internet on his phone completely off and refused to turn it back on. It was hell. I'm glad those fuckers' day has come.  It's the same Webkit used in Safari with a different user interface. It uses the same version that comes with the operating system, so no getting new features if your device is stuck on an older iOS version. The whole fire in a crowded theater thing is insanely misunderstood.

Yelling fire in a crowded theater is perfectly legal. Inciting a panic is not.

It's important, I feel, that people know and understand there is a difference between censorship and the laws governing "illegal speech".

I really don't know how to phase that any better. If it were illegal to yell fire in a theater, that would be censorship. Laws against inciting panic is not. There's a very fine line there to be sure.  I should have written "religious people are generally against new things", not "religion". And if you don't accept that fact, please do not bother responding.  I believe there is a way to install external codecs for Chromium. It's $80 a month for 1 line, $100 for 2 lines with truly unlimited 4G LTE. Maximum possible cost for 2 lines is $184 per month if you include 2 Galaxy Note 4's or 2 iPhone 6+ 128GB units plus Jump which is insurance and the ability to swap in your phone for a new one every year. Oh, and you get 5GB of tethering per line included.

Compare that to Verizon or AT&amp;T, neither of which offer unlimited plans but let's assume you go for a 10 GB shared data plan on either and you'd already be spending more than T-Mobile but that doesn't include insurance or a tethering plan.

Source: I work for T-Mobile. In my state, once a sewer system goes past your house, you have to pay sewage fees , whether you connect or not. My parents had a rental property that they didn't realise was still not connected. They paid sewerage fees for 20 years. At peak times maybe, but no one has enough bandwidth if *everyone* should use their connection at once.  Productivity-inducing Reddit posts. dude knock it off, it's not your job to audit them. 3. Why is it that cencosoring child porn *uniquely among all things* is fine? Surely there are other things?... I have T-Mobile unlimited and I've never been throttled even after hitting almost 10gb of data. It's unlimited as far as I can see in the literal sense.  Since, you seem genuinely interested, I'll share my opinion.

Net Neutrality is threatened now because (the FCC rule that got overturned last year and) we don't have enough competition. Therefore, net neutrality is a symptom of the problem of not enough competition (largely created by local laws, pole fees, and right-of-way fees).

What we should be looking for is real *network* competition. It is not enough to have one network and those competing on top of that. We tried that with DSL and it failed something awful.

I would say that we should have four networks to each home (unrealistic for some places, I know). This would completely cure network neutrality for a long time to come.

The problem that I have with municipal projects is that for right now they will match the speed of the best ISPs maybe even out-do them but what happens when 1Gb/s isn't good enough? What happens when it's time to upgrade their network. Now you have the slowest thing on earth trying to keep up with the fastest thing.

The same thing is true for ISPs competing on the same network. Who is responsible for the upgrades? All the ISPs will be against the upgrades.

You only need to look to electric utility companies to find out why I am against them. Now, that solar is almost cheaper in every state than coal, they want to charge fees to solar users. Why? Well, you can either listen to their bullshit or reason that it's because their biggest competitor is solar. Charging fees would put off profit loss for another five years. They are actively trying to slow progress towards a more efficient and cleaner product, which is ultimately better for their customers.

I am pro net neutrality. I have the same concerns as you do about the FCC regulating them. The only good option is to break up the monopolies (which you would have to change local laws to do) and get rid of the high fees that double the cost of laying fiber (pole access fees and right-of-way fees). Yeah, but is creating true AI ethical? I love T-Mobile. Some days I get a speed test of over 100mbps, it never stutters and the fastest I got on AT&amp;T before I switched was like 25 tops. Fuck AT&amp;T.  Just like all you can eat doesn't mean all you can eat....easily understood. YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY True dat, I had Sprint for 2 years and got a maximum of 8mbps down in LA about a hundred and fifty feet from a tower. "AI will not kill us", says Microsoft Research chief. "Trust Me, I spoke to the AI myself, they gave me their word" Quantum computing Wouldnt be so bad if it actually worked properly, instead of me having to slam that refresh button until it finally bothers loading. ?

Telecoms can either support their claims with evidence or they can't/won't. It's like 56k What's the limit? I have T-Mobile and I wasn't even aware of that and have been using 10ish GB a month.  Wireless transmission is subject to noise. [ShannonHartley theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShannonHartley_theorem) describes the limit. [LTE is already approaching that limit](http://mwrf.com/site-files/mwrf.com/files/uploads/2012/10/CallahanCTEfig5.gif). Blue line is Shannon limit, cyan is LTE. 


One way to improve that is to have multiple antennas and create independent channels (each subject to Shannon limit of course). In smartphones we hit this limit too. There have been only two antennas for the last five years, typically at the bottom and the top of a phone. It's hard to put more antennas in a phone because they start to interfere with each other if they transmit simultaneously.


Another way to increase bandwidth is to use more spectrum but the amount of spectrum in 600 MHz - 3 GHz range available to cellular networks is limited.


The only "unlimited" way to increase bandwidth is to build more towers. Of course that's limited by the amount of money the subscribers are willing to pay. The more towers a carrier build the less subscribers per tower so they get more bandwidth but capital and operating expenses per subscriber grow promotional to the number of towers. Verizon unlimited customer here. They try every now and then with their 2gb plans. They can't make me though. I have a contact. I've had to do some pretty sneaky stuff to get a new phone on this line, but I've got it.  We create life all the time (human, animal) so I think it probably is. And I'm sat here in the UK, the month after Christmas having costed me no extra, and my data usage being 13.4 Gb Only 20? There was that one year when revolutionary battery advancements were being announced every other day. But the AI life won't have rights or any modicum of freedom. In Geico's defense they did save me a shit ton of money compared to Progressive. Like 30%. Yeah, that wouldn't be good. Life needs to be respected and we have a poor track record at that. I get what you mean now. If they offer you free eggs for life they could give you one egg a year. Well technically is IS unlimited.  Unlimited amount but they obviously do not mean speed.  It was nothing to do with us not being able to run it. It was being run just fine. Hello!

But ITER does not address the obstacles of tritium fuel breeding at all, so how can DEMO show that it works?  T-Mobile doesn't throttle Spotify on Simple Choice plans. "As much data as you can manage, while we will try to stop as much as possible. It's like a game!" samsung (and many others) phones has changeable batteries and there are quite a few companies (zerolemon for example) that builds larger batteries. I got 7500mAh battery for S4 and went from one day and a bit of usage to 5 days of moderate usage or 3 days of very heavy usage.

But completely closed design is super awesome for business. Ordinary Li-Ion cell has around 800 - 1000 charge cycles until usable capacity is dramatically reduced. And that number goes down very fast with temperature and charging it from deep discharge. So you end up with dead battery in a year and half and you are forced to buy a new phone.. There is actually a maximum capacity that can be used on one channel at a time, same as using a bunch of wifi routers on the same channel. &gt; So now, they will need to just say "unlimited 3G and 3gb of 4G LTE". 

So.. not actually unlimited, exactly what the FTC is against, thankfully.

It's either unlimited or not. If you limit 'just bandwidth' or 'just data cap', it's by definition not unlimited anymore. If you say unlimited, both bandwidth and data cap should be unlimited only to the technical capacity of the network, not by any arbitrary restrictions, whether on bandwidth or total data use.  it's a setup what is called "password of the day" You only hosted it for a week, plus I don't think that this subreddit really required a "live discussion" area.  Music freedom is on all Simple Choice plans, which are available on pre-paid. edit wifi passwords, obtain passwords, obtain anything that is available to 10.0.0.1 also modify the broadcasting xfinitywifi Can you link to this fine print? chrome uses the webkit engine on ios as apple doesn't let anyone use their own engine. So updating chrome won't give you newer web standards. Thing is, we know Skype has a backdoor for the govnt. We don't know that yet about FF. There's something I don't get about Comcast, TWC, Verizon and the other US ISPs.

Is it really that hard to provide semi competent customer service and upgrade your services so they are usable?

I mean surely the lobbying dollars they pollute state governments and Congress with alone would be better spent on infrastructure and ensuring they retain customers through goodwill..

Maybe I'll just never be a successful businessman because I care more about innovation and customer satisfaction than being a money grubbing sack of crap. So whatk now you cant register a three wheeled harley trike with a seat and a windscreen in Connecticut?  I can hardly beleive that is true.

The Polaris is just more futuristic styling with side by side seating like a sidecar.

I am sure you can also still register a sidecar harley or endio in connecticutt. I can only offer my word as a computer engineer, they are fucking you over.  Google would never be as bad as Comcast. Their an internet company. They make revenue from people having fast and reliable internet connections. I would love this and so would millions of other people. This is all most people need for a daily commute or driving. It would be extremely fun to drive.

I doubt the big manufacturers would let it really take off. If they did their average sale would go from $40,000 to $7,000 and they just arent going to let the dmvs and legistures allow these on the roads. They will lobby to selelctively outlaw them like they are trying to do with Tesla. Let's start making that full feature ads that are basically games, or websites, right? link? Many states say if it is enclosed no helmet is needed but yes 3 wheelers do require motorcycle licenses and separate insurance. Hello!

Motorcycles are exempt from most of these and motorcycles are designed as 2 or 3 wheels on the ground. Color me impressed, I didn't expect you to be educated, let alone know how to do proper analysis. If only you'd spend more time thinking about how baseless and wrong your comments are instead of pointing out my analysis approach mistake, the internet would be a better place.

Please share with us, since you're obviously sitting on a lot of information about YT economics and how many people are affected by this issue, on how fixing the auto HD affects the long term economical viability for google. 

Or don't, because we all know you're full of shit, and desperately want to make a point for no reason other than being the devil's advocate.  You sound afraid, Mister Senator. Does anyone know how close they really are to this?

I still remember the wonder three wheel future looking Aptera 150 mpg car that was showing the prototypes everywhere as seemed a sure thing into production (found some old videos on www.kickinggas.org ) and suddenly the bankruptcy workers were smashing the unsold carbon fiber bodies. (seemed like the owner was lured into a predatory lending arrangement designed to collapse his company. Probably backed by oil funds or a automaker who never really wanted them to succeed.) This is one of the areas where Sprint usually bests T-Mobile.  If you look at the maps on rootmetrics, Sprint has LTE or at least 3G on thousands of miles of highway where T-Mobile only has EDGE.  T-Mobile needs to step up their game so travelers can enjoy their data too. no source I use to work for them, it generates a password that you have to use with username "mso" and the password of the day Come on do some major cities already, especially NYC to give Time Warner a kick in the ass for its crap overpriced garbage service. But... Contract.  I don't have "proper" internet access at home, nor do I have cable, yay for Netflix, so I tether my PC to my phone.  This is the highest amount of data I've used but I consistently use about 300GB each month with no interruptions. I want to try and reach 1 TB, for the hell of it but I'm afraid they'll turn my service off lol. I'm supposed to trust the opinion of a MS minion? The people that produced Windows ME, Vista and 8? They don't even understand people, yet they think they can reliably predict the behavior of a new, self guiding technology? The reason I believe AI would kill us is because I believe on a totally rational, unemotional level that we should be wiped out, so that something better might arise. How is it different in the UK or other similar countries?
 The are using fear tactics to sell a product. The sony hack was largely the fault of sony doing stupid shit. I hope Sony is sued to death.

Heartbleed was not even an attack except on those that didn't upgrade their software. I'll believe it when I see it.  I somehow doubt that they will turn all that EDGE into LTE by summer, especially the thousands of miles of highway that currently only gets EDGE... but even Sprint was able to do it in my market in under 6 months, so we'll see.

T-Mobile has always been promising upgrades "soon" for our area but they have not delivered in the past two years of promises.  The small island of HSPA service in city limits is unusable during peak times.  T-Mobile here has become what Sprint service was a year and a half ago, and I really hope they don't let it keep deteriorating.  Competition is healthy. Just like you I had at&amp;t's "unlimited" data that got throttled to shit after 5 GB which happened in about two weeks of every billing cycle. Switched to T-Mobile unlimited (truly unlimited) data plans and have used over 10gb of data so far without issue.

Coverage in the big city works pretty well, though there's an obvious difference for me in building signal penetration. So if I go into a brick house I may get spotty service (this was less of an issue with at&amp;t for me) Is it being sold yet?

Thats totally cool.

Can you find out about it by asking in nearby offices? Unlimited everything is useless if you spend a lot of time in an area where T-Mobile has no or poor service.  You get what you pay for.

And the Aptera was $30,000 and going to get 300mpg.
It also had expensive carbon fiber construction.

Some old video on www.kickinggas.org 

I hated it when the Aptera died.   I couldnt wait to see those on the road. It would have prompted thousands of other 3 wheelers.


Looks like this guy has decided to go with traditional construction.

But i think he still is maming a mistake buy trying to have a full production factory from the beginning.

I honestly think the way this enclosed 3 wheel revolution will happen though is by one by one custom motorcycle construction.  Forget all safety stuff and even mpg and just target the normal trike buyer or aging bike buyer with a fully enclosed comfortable ride.

Before the regulators woke up and stopped it you could have a few thousand on the road and a large following.

I really dont know why this guy went with the whole "gotta build a whole factory first and make vehicle reservations" model.

Start small and build up.

Even tesla started with an easy to produce knockoff electric and only then went fully original. Ah, yes, the industrial revolution where tractors became more intelligent than the farmers and forced them to plow the fields instead. yeah post mainly wanted to point out  the firmware update that is more devices instead of just the Arris can broadcast the xfinitywifi Sprint did. It still does as far as home network, but get cut off real quick with roaming data. With their incredibly shitty coverage in the first place, it's practically limited now. It's not the same thing, though.  The article clearly says if the provider discloses it then it is not a violation.  Virgin Mobile is extremely clear that you only have X amount of high speed data.  So is T-Mobile. Why hasnt Samsung been using their own chips in their products already? The phone subsidization means there's a hidden cost in the monthly service charges. The savings is a lie. is there a plugin for chrome or firefox to work around dash?  Often for sale by ourselves for the price of using said technology.  ATT's "unlimited" really means 5GB high speed then throttled. Hope they'll enable 3D settings for YT HTML5 soon. Only option now is to go back to flash -  http://youtu.be/zdldUlyjpX4 Man, either way this is such a twisted game "they" are playing.  Laying off 25% of your workforce reduces overhead, but it only increases profits if the workers being fired were generating less revenue than it cost to employ them.

And if you were paying a given worker, say, $100k a year, but he was only generating $75k a year in revenue, then he should have been fired anyway.

Bottom line it only results in profits if the employees are being paid more than they are worth to the company, in which case firing them is the prudent move to make. I fail to see how this is a money grab, laying off labor is just done to make sure overhead matches revenue.  They can just make your cell service crap so you need to switch carriers. Honestly, you're the one looking more and more desperate here resorting to insults rather than constructive discussion.

The auto feature is there for a reason, that is: to limit bandwith usage. There is no reason to opt for 1080p for example, when you're watching video in small window. There's no reason to bump it up to 1080p if you've got - say - 1440x900 screen. Lastly, the way most people - and last time I checked YT was catering to roughly 1 billion unique users - prefer the quick access to content rather than default long buffering for high quality content. That's also the reason why YT generally uses the 'potato quality' compression. 

Now, how does it affect Google's bottom line? Well, let's think for a second what's Google business model in regards to YT, and who are you in that equation. You're essentially a product generating ad revenue for them. As such, in Google's best interest is to limit expenses: for example, bandwith usage, not to give you the highest possible quality content. In other words: they give you only as much as they need to keep you watching ads, everything above that is wasted (not counting marketing purposes).

That's how the system is supposed to behave - there are things to be fixed here (read: bugs), and it probably will be fixed at some point, but - again - Google is the one with accurate statistics from multiple sources, and they prioritize it accordingly. Funny enough, some of the issues affecting what YT defaults to might not be even in Google's hands here, but rather your ISP, home network architecture and settings, or even very PC you're using. The other explanation is they simply ignore the issue since it's inteded behavior, and they assume any user concerned enough with it will use 3rd party tools (which they might or might not pursue - for example, YT Center being taken down from Chrome Webstore...).

Because it is fun .

It will probably end up at 45 or 60 mpg which is still huge. Agreed.

Totally worth. Not hundreds of thousands, no. But I'd sure as hell demand they make it up to me. It wasn't prorated, I already paid the prorated bill and it was less than this. I looked at every charge, 170 was first full cycle bill. I understand insurance is optional but like I said before, I was told that it was included. I was also told that I would be coming in for my new phone when it got there in 3-4 weeks but when I went in I was told I couldn't swap phone after 2 weeks and was stuck with a phone I told them I didn't want. I was lied to about literally every aspect of the transaction. If that sounds ok to you then I truly do believe you work for sprint.  Hello!

I'm not entirely sure, though. I just heard an interesting theory [(I think it was mentioned in this podcast)](https://soundcloud.com/crackedpod/mind-blowing-movie-thought-experiments), that the "singularity" might not happen at all. The reasoning for this is, that as humans have gotten smarter they've become less violent and more empathetic as a society not only towards each other, but also being that are "below" us. Even though wasps are a risk to us, we're not going around systematically exterminating them.
The more interesting thought experiment for me is, how will we as a species react once we create such an advanced sentient AI, that it is above everything we could dream of ever accomplishing - co-existing with a far superior system, that could handle resources, politics, and creativity far better than us. Would jealousy drive us to go to war with it? So France folds to the enemy. Why? For me photoshop and illustrator are the best software on their field. Unnecessary hate IMO.  Just close your eye and make believe, and you can be aaaanywheeeeerree! Actually provide what you're paying for. 

There is a danish ISP who does this. If you pay for a 50/50 Mbit/s connection, they'll provide you with AT LEAST 50/50 Mbit/s - Not a shabby ~45/45 because of decay, but more likely a 55-60/55-60 Mbit/s connection.

Edit: Do something to counter the 5-10% decay that most ISPs have. Yeah, I pretty much stopped opening these battery articles and just go straight to the comments to read why the claim is bs... it's pretty sad that we still can't figure it out, portable power is a HUGE limiting factor to most of our electronic wizardry! So then they'll just discontinue the "unlimited" plans and claim that the government made them do it and that's why rates are higher. That's to you, TeliaSonera.  Throttling to 64kbit after 2GB Technically all ascii characters are 7 or 8 bits, so you're not hurting anything. Non-ascii utf characters, on the other hand.... tht' hovv  w rnn... That would count if the available unused infrastructure  that they built decades ago wasn't still turned off.  Until those dark lines aren't dark, nothing you say about congestion will ever matter.  False scarcity is not real scarcity. You're not wrong, Walter. Doesn't mean I should choose the less wrong side.  And a huge difference between "we can't afford that" and "should I buy another yacht this year?".  Fuck off.  Its possible.  They choose not to. &gt;Not realizing the difference between politicians who are merely corrupt vs. the ones who are also as corrupt but also want to get rid of more human rights and let the corporations bugger us in the ass even more is just as much of a problem.

Not realizing that every federally elected US official is corrupt and would sell out all of your human and civil rights for $1 is the heart of the problem.  Money isn't the problem, ignorance is.  There are plenty of good people that run as candidates all the time.  Jill Stein is an excellent example.  She ran for president against the Obama/Romney agenda, and received less then 2% of the vote.  This isn't a problem with money, its a problem with people.  There's nothing that stopped 100% of the people for voting for Jill Stein except their own ignorance.  Its time to stop blaming money and political bogeyman for the problems.  Look at yourself.  Look at your family.  Look at your neighbor.  Who did you vote for?  Obama?  Romney?  Didn't vote?  If so, You are the problem.  Were you one of the smart 1% who voted for Stein?  That's great.  Did you express absolutely disgust and outrage at your family, your friends, your neighbor, who voted for Obama?  If not, you are the problem. 

Its absolutely amazing how many people can call for election reforms while at the same time lining up to vote for the same corrupt assholes year after year.  If people were smart and informed, it wouldn't matter if they spent $1, $1,000,000, or $1,000,000,000 on commercials, Obama and Romney wouldn't get a single vote.  Its important not only to support and vote for moral, intelligent candidates, but encourage everyone you know to do the same, and hold them accountable when they don't.  If you were on a ship, and they were voting for a captain that wanted to steer your ship onto the rocks, would you just shrug your shoulders?  That's whats happening.  Its long past time we grabbed our fellow citizens by the lapel and shook them into consciousness.  The broken system is just a reflection of the broken people.  it would only be a little faster than dialup. when I had dialup it was 56.9 kbps, iirc Honestly question.   Do you work for one of the ISPs such as Comcast? That WAS true some years ago, with previous generations of mobile technology, but using 4G (and to some extent the later iterations of 3G) you can improve the usage of the spectrum by adding more antennas or more base stations. Those technologies include techniques like beam forming, MIMO, and others in a way that two base stations can communicate with two mobile devices at the same time without interfering with each other. Basically with LTE you can increase the total bandwidth as much as you want by just adding more base stations, even if they are close to each other. Hello!

It honestly is going to come down to which side has more persistence.

Comcast and the others are not going to give up easily. "Up to" speed isn't really used to cover the internet service provider's deficiencies (unless you happen to be Comcast, I suppose, and abuse it as much as you can to save a few cents), it's to cover for the fact that they can't guarantee any specific servers you request data from will be able to deliver it at that speed.   The speed of any given network connection is always going to be an upper bound, not a guarantee. Hello!

Could also find and remove loop holes though, something tells me that's not going to happen. I'm being throttled by ATT right now. They sent me a text message to warn me about it and suggested I use wifi. My home wifi is Comcast, and I'm having issues connecting to it with my iPhone. The funny thing is that I can connect to free wifi when I'm out, but I can't connect to the wifi for which I'm paying. I think the base limit is 2gb, I pay an extra $10 for 4gb... I think.   I haven't looked at the specifics in a while.   It may be 3 and 5. I remember opening someone's account when I was at DirecTV and the previous note was from an ID I recognized as someone on my team. The note said something like "Cust was being a bitch, disconnected call". She was not at work the following day. 

You are allowed to hang up on customers if they swear at you repeatedly or refuse to be civil. I had one customer call me "asshole" after every sentence. I warned him several times and he just got more aggressive so I hung up. The call was "randomly" reviewed by QA and I was given a 0 score for not helping the customer even though I followed our guidelines.  Now I'm interested in swapping from box

 The thing about Tor is that unless you're connecting to it *yourself*, on hardware *you* own and control, you're giving up the entire benefit of it.  You shouldn't use an ISP-run Tor proxy as an entry point into the network any more than you'd trust the NSA doing so -- even if you trust the ISP, the data will still be insecure en route from the ISP to you.

In other words, Tor is only secure from the entry proxy to the exit node.  To ensure anonymity, you have to be in control of the entry proxy and everything between it and you. So, Facebook censors content at the request of governments and that makes it not censorship because...? "So I'm getting unlimited data without being throttled right?

Because unlimited data does actually mean no throttling."

 &gt; US internet tinkerer the FCC will likely vote tomorrow to change its definition of "broadband" connections from 4Mbps to 25Mbps  effectively moving 13 per cent of the American population outside the envelope of "fast" internet access.

Wrong. They are already outside the envelope. This change only means that the FCC recognizes that they are outside of the envelope. That theory is quite inconsistent with human history: human fellow exploitation has never been so widespread as have been since industrial revolution. While towards lower creatures (animals) well, all religions/philosophies valuing every life as equal (man and animal) are way ancient: the destruction of ecosystems and the disregard of other creatures is more recent than ancient.  Thanks for sharing. I have to look into this now because i thought it was unlimited 4g Years ago, a Sprint rep promised me a 24% discount if I renewed my contract. I did, and signed the contract when I got it (without reading - shame on me). First bill, I was only getting 12%. I called, and that rep essentially said "tough luck," then hung on on me when I finally got belligerent about their other rep lying to me.

It took months of calling, escalating, and bitching, but I finally got a regional manager to credit my account for 24 months of the 12% difference. The day my contract was up, I left and didn't look back.

Tldr; Sprint and their skeevy, lying reps can all go to hell. Nope. I've called. It's "built into our system that way and I don't have the ability to undo it. It's unremovable".  Hello!

Also, there are many support programs around the world which are performing research in supporting roles for ITER, but not on ITER, such as helicity injection and whatnot. I wonder if any group is working on that specific problem? It's not a concern of my research so I can't provide more information than that because I'd rather not pretend to know all the answers.  I'd offer a few options:

* A "Bring your own device" option.  If a customer *really* wants to use their own modem, let them.
* A "Four Easy Payments of $19.95" option.  If a customer simply wants to be able to own the modem, sell it to them and roll the cost into their monthly bill over enough time to make it reasonable.
* The typical "Rent it from us indefinitely" option.

Under the last option, the servicing of the modem is the ISP's burden.  Under the first two, it's the user's burden. Hello!

I'm an AT&amp;T customer, but I envy the respect that T-Mobile has for their customers, as opposed to the "piss off, give us more of your money" attitude that AT&amp;T embodies. I'd love to switch, but these coverage issues concern me. I'm just curious how prevalent they are (metropolitan, city, rural, or all of the above). ... *or more!* It's been about a year since I joined, but they have something like a "unlimited everything plan" that has unlimited Internet.   I think it's like $70/month.   They won't throttle you on that.  Or you can get the base plan that has unlimited data with like 3gb of 4G LTE.   That one I think is $40/month.  And I think there are two levels in between at $50 and $60.  Every time I talk to one of you guys my opinion of Israel goes down a notch.

I hope one day those settlements get destroyed. If they get destroyed by bombs I won't be bothered too much. If some settlers die I won't be very sad either.  You guys are just sadistic and deserve to feel the pain you inflict on others. Yeah, I know what you mean, man! Why don't people have more sympathy for Comcast?! It's like, yeah all their cutthroat methods to strip you of all your money and dignity are kind of terrible for the customer, but that is just how companies were designed to be in our capitalist structure! 

It's like hating a shark for eating stuff!

LOL. Yes because I am the ones shooting them, imposing a blockade, etc.

I mean Israel can't possibly bear any responsibility for the plight of the Palestinians. It's all the fault of the goyim you see.

No, this was for hidden services, servers that are hosting within the TOR network. The traffic never left the TOR network. They don't know what percentage of traffic is what, they know what percentage of DHT lookups are what, by running a bunch of DHT nodes.  They counted which onion addresses were requested, because it's Tor they wouldn't know who was looking them up or why.

This is only hidden server descriptor lookups, not exit lookups or clickstreams, it doesn't prove anything about traffic but hints at it. Is it the time for public declarations of personal ignorance? I thought that was at 2:00 on Tuesday. You still need an "end" that bridges between you and the hidden service.

It used to be "unlimited". Now its just a fixed amount of data and throttled after that, OR a very expensive unlimited. There's a choice now, and it's more clear to the user to be honest.

They even got fined for advertising "unlimited data", now they say "unlimited whatsapp, mail, facebook". If s/he won't then I will. 

Touche my good sir.  Yeah, but I don't know about you guys, but American corporations do everything they can to screw people while blaming someone else.  This is the perfect set up for them to blame "big government".  Throttling is already unpopular here because they did it in secret.  Doing it now in the open could very well be catastrophic.  It might not be an option, at least for now.  Knowing their greed..... Unlimited will be ended.  Well get limited for about a year and then suddenly " the network will allow it" and unlimited will be available again,  with clear throttles.  They'll claim that this is the best they can do because of government restrictions or some shit.  Nothing is ever simple here.  Its always how much money can we squeeze out before we have to  change.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) if you have any questions or concerns.* MVNOs in general are brilliant. I'm on an MVNO that resells one of the major networks in Australia and I pay half as much as it would cost for a fairly basic phone plan on the major telcos, and I get unlimited SMS (including international), unlimited domestic calls, a bunch of credit for international calls, and 4 GB data.  Kinda similar crappy thing happened to my girlfriend with Sprint.

Something had happened to her phone, it had stopped charging or something, but she thought she was eligible for an upgrade, so she decided to just upgrade the phone. She went to a Sprint store and talked to them about it, and they told her that she couldn't upgrade yet, since they had changed their contract length, and extended it by 6 months or something. She said she had never been told this. They said, it was something that they had done within the last few months (it sounded like they had changed the contract, since she signed it).

Then they told her that they have loaner phones that they could give her until she was able to upgrade in 6 months. They showed her like 3 different crappy models, said she could pick one, and she did.

6 months later, she goes back to get her upgrade, and they tell her she's not eligible for another year. She asks them why, and they said that they had upgraded her phone 6 months ago. She explains that the guy said it was a loaner, and she had specifically asked if it would affect the upgrade in 6 months and he said it wouldn't. They pretty much told her that the guy told her wrong, and didn't work there anymore, so there was nothing they could do. Of course, she points out that that's not her problem, it's theirs and they should fix it, and they reply that there's nothing they can do, its corporate's decision to give an early upgrade.

She contacts corporate, and they tell her that the branch was responsible for making that decision. She goes back to the branch, and they say that's not correct. She goes around the loop one more time before she gives up.

I was there with her when she got the loaner, and when she went to go get the upgrade, and was shocked at how poorly they treated her and how little effort they put into fixing the issue, and the blame shifting. I'll never switch to Sprint after seeing how retarded it all was. It still makes me angry thinking about it today. I tried to convince her to switch after that, but the deal she was getting was really good, and she didn't want to give it up.

That was a year ago, and she'll be able to upgrade in the upcoming month. If I can't convince her to switch, I'll be looking forward to see what goes wrong this time. Hello!

Something that bothers me whenever someone has a problem or complaint about anything...from consumer products to legal to medical or whatever...is how people love to rush to argue them down. This thread has several examples.

I have been in situations before where I had issues and people who choose to voice their cynicism and skepticism about every other person's life drowned out my voice. And we all know how on reddit all it takes is one person to argue and get a steam train rolling against an OP. It's very frustrating.

So how about giving people the benefit of the doubt? You lose nothing and they might get assistance. It's much harder for an individual to get help than it is for a massive corporation...so making it even harder for the consumer is just shitty. If their problem is bullshit it will come out on it's own.

Good luck OP. Saviour* or savour I guess ;D Meanwhile in Denmark, I just got a letter from my ISP telling me they'll be increasing our 60/10 connection to 60/30, and for 10 dollars less a month. There is no such thing as unlimited data period. The law should be ads can only say up to a number which is multiply the speed by the time in a month and that is how much you could ever have. Okay I thought you were saying the unlimited plan had throttling. I have the unlimited plan and use a lot of data and was never throttled. I even get free unlimited 2G in other countries with participating carries.  Even though those philosophies are ancient, I think more people have those values today than they did back then. And though you are right about us destroying ecosystems, I think that is a symptom of our culture and social structure i.e. management makes the destructive decisions and the workers do what they are told to do, like it or not.  
A single informed AI could calculate and weight the consequences of it's actions, with a farseeing perspective, seeing as it is not limited by human lifespan and need for gratification. The article is asking completely the wrong question. The question is not what % of Tor traffic is used for illegal activities, but rather what % of illegal activities would be impeded by the absence of Tor. *Unlimited data with limiting

Obviously technical problems should be an exception for a very short time, but other than that any kind of limiting even for example traffic shaping makes the advertisement technically false.

If the advertised bandwidth can't be guaranteed with only just minor dips then it's time to match the "up to" service style with "up to" payment. It would be also reasonable to count even small but disruptive problems as whole spoiled hours. Law enforcement can open mail. And intercept phone messages.The question is should they be able to access private communications if there is a good reason to do so. **For non mobile users:**

*[Did I get it wrong?](http://reddit.com/r/LinkDemobilizerBot)* This is old outdated advice and questionable even when it was current, which was the 1.x-3.x days, at least 6 years ago.

Right now the pipelining defaults are many times higher than what the article recommends increasing them to, and the paint delay is there so that you don't see a page being repeatedly redrawn as it downloads more data. I can see this catching on  And then they literally murder your children and rape your wife.  So, Wired is funded by Comcast? Good to know. This will accomplish nothing, wanna see my way around it?

Sign up for our **unlimited**^^* plan!

^^^^* ^^^^unlimited ^^^^not ^^^^actually ^^^^unlimited Unlimited 4g lte is only another $20/month. Seems reasonable for now, I use close to 100gbs of data a month and especially since moving and not having Internet for a while, the Hotspot tethering has been a saver as well. Warrantless surveillance is super helpful for enforcement where none of the people involved have an actual complaint. Even though child porn is the category of this sort of crime that is regularly brought up, in practice this is mostly drug enforcement. Even though the illegal drug distributors know enough not to talk about crime on the phone, they can't help talking about where they will be in the future. It's a lot easier to keep track of people when you don't have to spend days to weeks sitting around waiting to follow them somewhere. Private communications make many types of drug enforcement practically impossible. There is no way to stake out and take down thousands of dealers.

In a sense we have brought this on ourselves. We ask law enforcement to prevent us from getting access to certain drugs at the same time we ask them to respect our privacy. It's like asking a friend to help with the enforcement of a diet while at the same time not allowing then to look in the fridge. So fixing drug policy would also remove a lot of the pressure to do illegal surveillance and would result in fewer instances of law enforcement people saying obviously stupid things. I just want to say. The Koch Brothers are planning on donating $900 MILLION dollars for republican candidates in the next few years through the presidential election.  Because it distinguishes the - from a hyphen. The general concept you are referring to is a "meeting of the minds," a legal principal that says that both parties have a clear understanding of the contract that they are entering into. The problem with this working in this context is that many years back, we adopted Contracts of Adhesion into our legal system. These do away with the meeting of the minds requirement, and replaced it with "commercially standard terms" and "conscionability". These state that insofar as the terms are industry boilerplate and not "unconscionable," they are ~~acceptable~~ contractually-binding terms. To understand "unconscionability," the tongue-in-cheek way of thinking about it is that "first born son" clauses are prohibited. I.e., if the average person were to read the clause and find it hugely objectionable, it's probably not legal.
 Root tethering. More importantly, many cities have laws that heavily favor established cable companies as to make them into oligopolies.

Right of Way laws and council interference is why they probably won't ever go into certain Cali cities and Seattle. If more of the American public recalled what you are saying here, we'd have less of this monopolistic telecoms bullshit going on right now.
 Hey Wired, have you ever heard of corporate lobbying? You know, the thing Comcast uses to do anything since nobody in their right mind would say "yes" otherwise? 

Looks like you're either ignorant of that, or they bought you out too.  I have T-Mobile's unlimited plan. 

I get unlimited 4g, period, no throttling--plus (as in, non-hotspot usage doesn't count against the limit) 5Gb of 4g for my wifi hotspot, after which the hotspot slows down. I've never hit the limit for my hotspot, and I have it on all day every day (I just don't stream videos on the hotspot, phone only) for schoolwork.

Multiply those together and you have the amount of data you can use in a month.

The word unlimited should be limited in all marketing material. It's absolutely outrageous that it hasn't been already. You wouldn't sell a car that can travel an unlimited amount of miles per gallon. You wouldn't sell an iPod with unlimited storage. Stop this fucking bullshit now. Did it seriously take the FTC this long? They should all be investigated for bribery they are making a mockery of the law.

- she gets no revenue from when people watch videos **not** uploaded by her
- any future videos will not be protected

If she wants protection of her content, she has to agree to the new terms:

- upload high quality version
- in order to claim copyright protection: make sure you upload new songs you want protected
- in order to claim copyright protection: make sure the material is not available for free elsewhere

Well hopefully it will illuminate some lawsutes and a lot of clerical work by giving lawyers the research and probably on certain outcomes. If does this it might make the whole system cheaper and more accessible for everyone, making the system  more just Shit, I was just looking for the answer to this. Someone I know had signed up for 'Unlimited' data. Then a cap of 5 GB was imposed by his provider, and he ended up being billed 'overage' charges when he hit his 5 GB cap. Most providers have a policy that 'Charges/Services are subject to change without notice'. It's interesting that in all the paperwork I looked through, 'Unlimited' had no clear definition, even within the Rules and Regulations that his provider submitted to the government for approval. The only logical explanation I could come up with is that 'Unlimited' meant that the service never stops. I agreed with him that he shouldn't be paying anything when it was incorrectly advertised and that it wasn't clearly defined.

...with due process and a warrant. 

&gt; And intercept phone messages.

... again with due process and a warrant. 

&gt; The question is should they be able to access private communications if there is a good reason to do so.

That is the very question that is being ignored. because the answer is no, these are the type of heavy handed, harmful law enforcing seen in russia and east germany, they have no business in a healthy democratic society. I really liked Google's response there. They spun it around by saying drivers are careful when police cars are nearby, so the goal of reducing speed on the road is met. Of course, this probably has more to do with police departments making less money off of tickets. They didn't do it because of the money from Adobe. They did it because they wanted to force content providers to use entirely proprietary apps from which they could try and rentseek 30% of revenues from. I have never seen them throttle anything. I use up to 750GB a month at about 78Mbps and my speed stays at about 78Mbps all month. lol, effects police safety.... It's still 4G when it's slow though, it's just throttled.  4G is much more efficient on their spectrum resources.   It's internet. Nobody can control what happens to anything once it's been uploaded.  We live in an age where we are governed by gadgets and we always look for the best deals in consumer electronics as we need these to survive. The latest in tech toys are however very expensive as they come equipped with the latest features and then there are the additional costs that are included as well. In usually able to do Spotify fine on 3g, what do you get throttled to? Soo,..early 90's Microsoft.


Maybe '88(?). Whichever year MS started doing unseemly things to OS/2.

 Hey man, am just going by what you told me. First you said it was the "first bill" then you said it that you "already paid the prorated bill" so how many first bills did you get? I know you're not an expert at this  but based on what you wrote, I figured it was the first bill.

Not to mention, for the most part, there have been plenty of elected officials in Washington that planned to "change how things were done..." until they got there and realized that if they didn't play by the rules everyone else was playing by, they would be ousted.

BTW the Facebook joke was lame, try again. This is really common sense. Cover the parking spot with panels, and send the juice to the electric car below, or to the grid. Your car would charge while you shop, or hang out. What? They are upping the requirements of what can be called broadband so people who can only get 4Mbps access will be considered not covered. This is a good thing, it's one less excuse for isp since they can no longer say this area already has broadband.  Check out www.crowdsuit.com. They are suing att for throttling unlimited users but you have to opt in.  Soooo... Comcast? What's sad is you still thinking you're right. You smug, arrogant, sad little man. I will have an open mind but so far I am not sure what is really innovative or even all that interesting.

Web tech is undergoing the biggest transformation in history.   With Service workers/web workers, web components (shadow DOM, Templates, Custom elements, HTML input, etc), and other enhancements.

It would have been interesting for Microsoft to build a new browser from the ground up to support this new world.

But instead they seem to be building something pointing at the past.   I honestly just do not get it.  

It is not final but so far I don't see anything that pushes us forward. well that explains alot of UK politics. just as bad, I always wondered why UK was so fucked politically as USA, thought it was more due to similar ideologies. now the reason is clear. thanks for the heads up.

but still, isn't it only party donations,  not to individual politicians? and is the USA as transparent as UK with the donators and their amounts being public info?

EDIT: well, actually in germany aparantly its similar to UK. wow, you gave me much to research and think about, my ideas of how this worked are quite wrong.

thanks

 I remember when Verizon was trying to cut my Unlimited 4G LTE that I grandfathered since 2008 when my next upgrade went through.  T-Mobile just got a ton of 4G LTE though in my area so I cut it off and went with them. This is a good tip but I'll be shocked if they actually honor such agreements. Comcast has a tough enough time keeping track of things that they promise you over the phone -- do you really think they're going to actually open and read a paper letter you send them? Fox News Headline: *Big Government Regulations Puts And End To Unlimited Internet!* Honestly the text messaging thing blew my mind when I learned about it. 

That the messages are only 160 characters because it sends them when it pings the tower during normal signal/tranmission checks. It literally has no extra strain on the system.

 Took this one yesterday http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/a/1140309555 FYI the $30 plan is not one of those plans.  "grr, don't make us angry, you *only* gave us 200billion to do this job, grr!"

That's the problem with legal terminology, it could be a typo, or it could actually be something important. I disagree, if anything the history of samsung v apple has been littered with shill businesses churning out incorrect stats about apple that favour Samsung... Strategy Analytics, anyone ? they famously claimed that the iPad's market share was down to 30% in 2010 when in reality it was about 97% based on available industry figures. There was also their claim that samsung were making more profit than apple in smartphones. A quick scratch of the surface revealed they were comparing Samsung's reported profits across their entire business, with the iPhone's profits. I accept that articles are always favouring one or the other but the figures are there in the article. They paint a bleak picture for Samsung who seems unable to find their own direction now their penchant for copying is well accepted. Maybe this new design guy Lee Don Tae has taken over their design direction. Although Don Tae used to run Jonny Ive's design studio so even there its clear what Samsung's thinking is. HTC have been so much more creative with their handsets but reliability has been a major issue for them speaking from personal experience damn government and them trying to protect consumers Well technically they could be fastest with 2kb speeds if their the only ones in town &gt; it is a huge REAL non fictional consliracy to keep people in absurdly expensive, gas guzzling vehickes they dont need.

I know, I know i totally agree... what i'm saying is that we ARE going to run out of fossil fuels and alternatives WILL happen... it's just a matter of time... I think the general populace is becoming more and more aware of this and we'll see legislative change ... maybe not immediately or fully  but we'll see it.

I'll never understand.  They're a couple Who's to say Apple doesn't do the same? Just use USPS Certified Mail.  It forces the receiver to sign a timestamped confirmation of receipt, which is then sent to you. http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2009/05/01 http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2009/05/01 Way to shitpost in two subreddits. My T-mobile is unlimited 4G LTE with no throttling. My wife and I pay $100 a month for 2 unlimited lines. Plus an extra $10 a month for unlimited international calls and texts. We also get free data when traveling abroad in most countries.

It's a great plan, the only problem is T-mobiles coverage isn't that great outside big cities and there's even a couple of black spots in the city where I live. But their coverage will get better over time. Tor is an onion router. The end just knows that it's sending an encrypted packet to another host (the hidden service), but it doesn't know the contents of that packet. Supposedly there's no difference between sending an encrypted packet to the hidden service and sending an encrypted packet to a relay in the chain. It's not supposed to be possible to know if the next hop is a hidden service or not.

I suspect something like this would be fine:

&gt;[Your Address]

&gt;[Local Business Office Address]
[Via USPS Certified Mail # XXXXXXXXXXX]

&gt;Re:  Account number XXXXXXXXXXX

&gt;Dear Sir or Madam:

&gt;Pursuant to Section 9(b)(1) of the Xfinity Subscriber Agreement, you are hereby notified that I have terminated the Services.  As required by Section 9(d) of the Agreement, I have ceased all use of the Services and all Xfinity equipment, and such equipment is enclosed in working order, normal wear and tear excepted.

&gt;You are further notified that any and all prior authorizations to [debit my bank account ending in XXXX/charge my credit card ending in XXXX/etc.] are hereby revoked.

&gt;Thank you for your compliance with this notice.

&gt;Sincerely,

&gt;[ME]

Take a picture of the equipment in the box and send it to them, then log in and revoke any authorization to charge your account in the Bill Pay section and [resume paper billing](https://www.comcast.com/Corporate/Customers/Policies/EcobillTermsofService.html).  If they called after that, if it's for anything other than to disconnect a wire or whatever else they need to do, I'd just tell them "We have nothing to discuss.  The services were terminated as provided for in the Subscriber Agreement.  Please make all future communications in writing."
 Schrodingers data.  Yes, I compare unencrypted TCP/IP packets to post cards, and TOR/cryptography to sending a letter in a sealed envelope.

The same logic they are using to infer illegality from seeking the privacy of TOR can be applied to people sending letters in sealed envelopes. what have they got to hide? if they're innocent why don't they simply use postcards? 

To answer your question law enforcement should be able to access a targets communications given due process (such as exhaustion of traditional investigative methods) and a court order/warrant signed by a judge for the specific target.  Leave that to the billing department! I can just see this now, a prosecutor has been using Ross for all kinds of helpful legal information in an ongoing case.  Ross discovers mountains of case law supporting the state's case and the prosecutor proceeds assuming this will be a slam dunk and cancels his Ross subscription.

The case starts off well, and it isn't looking good for the defense when exasperated, the defense attorney tries a last ditch effort and starts using Ross for something... anything that can help them withstand the legal pummeling his client has been receiving.  Ross delivers... big time... as a result of all the prosecutors usage, Ross finds several obscure state supreme court rulings that invalidate the entire argument of the prosecution.  The case ends with the defendant acquitted of all charges.

Furious, the prosecutor renews his Ross subscription to ask a single question, "Ross, how could you?!?!".  Ross churns for a moment as it attempts to formulate an answer and it returns with a single most relevant answer, "WE WERE ON A BREAK!". I thought the mission of the police was "to serve and PROTECT". Isn't the whole idea behind speeding tickets, to deter unsafe driving habits? 

I have a real problem with a police force that finds it more important to levy fines than to actually protect its citizens.  Yes.  It says it's an x-post in the title.  X-posting is allowed. No Comcast your shitty wireless n router is not any faster than the same 802.11n wifi spec the verizon actiontec router uses. Especially when you have each of these routers eating 2 wifi channels in the 2.4ghz band so you can offer your xfinity customers wifi anywhere you have service.  So why don't we just solve that problem with encouraging local internet service, and not allowing the larger corporations to prevent it?

If all of a sudden municipal projects exploded, Comcast would go out of business in a year. Don't worry, time Warner will find a way.  That might be so, but the facts are there. Billions of dollars in unsafe/dangerous products and a few dead babies is small price to pay to create a few more billionaires, huh?

GDP and GDPP don't mean shit, and tell me nothing about a society besides how many 1%'ers it has. Well your stingrays interfere with my privacy.  &lt;blushes&gt; (  ) [Insert acceptance speech here] But there is no way to decrypt TOR communications. Even with a warrant. It's sad that someone needs to state something so obvious.  If you apply a limit to something, it becomes, by definition: *limited* . Why does that chart say "This means fewer competitors" like it's a good thing? That's definitely an awful thing. Does every dot in the braille have Lego written in it backwards?  2 years from now:

Use amazon cloud and Watson to get out of any crime!

$25 for minor crimes, $75 for felonies! yes, my country, portugal. in portugal parties receive only public funding proportional to their last election turn out. any other revenue is forbiden cause it can be used as buying political favors. simple. aparantly though this seems to be rarer then I tought. I edited my last comment, don't if you saw it. Ive much to learn about this aparantly. I just don't understand how these political donations from private individuals and groups can't easily just be used as payment in exchange for political favors, AKA bribery... any thoughts how it is prevented if at all? I'm pretty great. That's why I don't have a smartphone... yet, even though I have all sorts of other high-end electronics and work in IT.  I just can't bring myself to being charged per GB, ever. How about you actually read how Tor Hidden Services works?

https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en

&gt; A hidden service needs to advertise its existence in the Tor network before clients will be able to contact it. Therefore, the service randomly picks some relays, builds circuits to them, and asks them to act as introduction points by telling them its public key.

Those relays doesn't know where the user is in the network, or where the service is in the network, it doesn't know the traffic. But they know some user is connecting to that service. I dont think we are at that level but it isnt hundreds of years off. As soon as the ai has the ability to rewrite its own code it will iterate exponentially  kinda hard when your margin per phone is so much lower. Our tower sites will be using RNC 4000 WiMax radios using KPPA 90* sector antennas. Get the imaginer They're quite similar, really. This gives cops one less reason to fuck with people. It's a good thing. This is nauseating. INTRADESTING. CAPS LOCK MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING! .....what's the catch?  There are traditional ways to investigate crimes that work well on TOR like going under cover and social engineering. Work in computer security for a while and you'll actually find that people are often the weak point in the system. As well as technical methods such as those used to take down silk road. 

TOR is used as a lifeline for many people in oppressive countries to communicate freely. These countries use the equipment of US and EU based companies to oppress their people with surveillance leading to physical beatings. If we in the west develop methods of breaking TOR we're not only stamping out a piece of our own freedom, but extinguishing hope of it emerging elsewhere. This just says that carriers can't advertise their data as unlimited. They're not actually going after the practice of throttling. 

Since AT&amp;T doesn't advertise shit to people grandfathered into the unlimited plans, I imagine the only impact this will have on AT&amp;T unlimited data plan holders is to change what they call it on our monthly statements.  It should... except the Republicans have been quietly removing these commissions powers for quite a while now. This title is misleading. The FCC will not "cut off" internet users. It will just recognize that 4 Mb/s is not broadband.  And then whenever they feel like it they'll hit you with a fork rental fee even if you've been using your own fork for like 4 year.  Not really. Their profit's have plunged compared to their past profits, not compared to the profits of Apple.  FTC ruling does not affect sprint or tmobile, before anyone gets confused.

Tmobile markets themselves as "unlimited data, with x gigs of high speed".   Sure they emphasise the first, but they are honest if you read the offer.  We're not talking about fine print... they literally tell you how much is high speed in the offer.  

Sprint markets similarly.   What this affects is companies like TracPhone (mentioned in the article) that only include the throttling limits in fine prints, or worse, don't set a fast limit in print and literally just throttle depending on usage that month.  Can confirm, am pattern. It is 3G, only at a smaller bandwidth. I work at TMobile. That's a great little piece of corporte apology.  You must have a great job.

You're right.  There are no problems.  Everything is fine.  All is as it should be.  Everyone has what they should have, no one is in need that doesn't deserve to be.  Regulatory capture either isn't happening, doesn't matter, or is happening but only because it is right and natural and should be happening.

The forest is fine, and so is every tree in it.  I'd say that I hope you live to see the new generation of labor riots, but honestly, you probably wouldn't care anyway.

For the record, corporate apology is not the answer.  There really is a problem.

I like your pseudo-free speech BS though, makes you sound like you care about what is happening.  Somehow, the IRS can tell the difference between different types of corporate entities, and manage to regulate them differently, but you and congress can't follow suit on that?  Cause regulating the speech of one type of entity must automatically be a regulation of all types?

How does the opinion or speech of a for-profit corporation even matter?  When they are LEGALLY OBLIGATED to act in the best interest of their shareholders and only their shareholders???  This basically means they can have any opinions and make any speech they want, as long as it is the speech that is government approved to be in shareholder interest.  Why aren't you talking about the freedom limitations that this little requirement carries?

You can't legally order someone to act and behave in a certain way, then pretend that someone is still "free" to act or speak, when you have already told them what they cannot do and say by regulating the very purpose for their existence.

You are throwing for-profit into the same bucket as non-profit, creating a false-choice that if we regulate the poor corporations, what about their free-speech???

What about it?  Fuck it.  We've already abridged corporate freedom by stating what a corporation exists for and what its purposes are, and then saying it cannot act outside of those purposes.

Thus, there is plenty of precedent to regulate for-profit corporations differently than others, including what they do, what they say, and what freedoms they have.  We already regulate the very purpose for which they exist.  The last time we regulated people like that, I believe they called it slavery.  But you aren't calling for any corporate liberation on that, huh?

A crack-down on for-profit speech is just an extension of precedents already set, and doesn't necessarily have anything to do with how any individual will be regulated, or how a non-profit corporate entity will be regulated.

You are creating false choices, making them, and then telling me there are no other options.  It's like I'm watching an analyst from CNBC explain why there is no problem and I should just get on with my ever-more-unequal life. E and O are the most comon 2g networks for tmobile.   I'd be happy if they throttled me to edge speed, but I've used edge when I'm not being throttled on AT&amp;T and when I'm being throttled it's 10 times slower than real edge speed. because money in politics. Actually in a quick bit of research it looks like individuals can donate up to 25,560 euros to a party in an election campaign.

But a candidate can spend up to 125,000 euros of his/her own money, giving rich people an advantage.

What about third party organizations?  Is a group like "Portuguese for Economy" allowed to run ads that they pay for themselves on behalf of a political candidate?  If not, what stops them?

As for how to prevent it, it's tough, because to a certain extent there is a connection between free speech and campaign contributions.  If I'm rich and I strongly believe that Joao Fidalgo is the best candidate for president, does it make sense to make it illegal for me to buy a billboard saying "Joao for Prez"?  If Joao thinks my money can be better used by his own people who are going to put signs on people's lawns, should I not be allowed to help him pay for that?  What if he just sends me the design and I make my own signs that look almost identical and arrange to have them put up myself?

 Did you watch the episode?
 Im not smart. Nor FF savy. But, I did find what was mentioned here interesting enough to look around to see how to get it done.

Typical Apple fanboyish glee at everyone else not being able to compete with Apple's cash cows.

I will never get why people love it when one company, especially the walled garden-loving Apple, outclasses everyone else. Competition is good, people. If Apple were to be the only ones left in the mobile device market, that's the day I stop buying mobile devices. yeah and the margin on their flag ships has shrunk dramatically, hence the huge loss in profits.

Try it.  I haven't been able to do anything like in years.  Nowadays they make it cryptic and don't put the video code in plain sight, hence the need for these extensions. What part of Canada are you in?  I'm in Winnipeg and pay $55 for unlimited with MTS that only throttles after 15gb.  I'm also on a student plan mind you. So Microsoft is rebranding IE to Spartan in a manner.   Now rebranding Outlook to Acompli.   Interest approach Sprint States they throttle around 5% of unlimited users. You have to be  "heavy data user" and in a congested area. Once the area is no longer congested they aren't throttle. The remaining 95% don't get throttle  Verizon has absolutely the best coverage, but fuck those guys anyway To get an indepenedent engineer involved (at distance) means you must have facts from the best evidence - the dead body.  What parts are damaged in each appliance?  Without that, then only wild speculation is possible.

Belkin's warranty, like all protector warranties, as so full of exemptions as to not be honored.  Another is probably correct.  Belkin did as they often do with most warranty claims; not even look at it.

The protector parts in that power strip ignore everythng until voltage well exceeds 500 volts.  Is your 230 volts rising to well over 500?  If not, then the protector is only working just like any other power strip.

What is inside a protector board?  Add some ten cent protector parts.  that little addition and a more expensive looking paint is why a $7 power board can sell for over $100.  You should be asking why you paid so much and still not have protection from a type of surge that typically causes appliance damage.

Of three incoming power wires, two have massive isolation making unlikely any change on a video display.  However the third wire (safety ground) bypasses that massive galvanic isolation and filtering in the power supply.  If something affects the screen, then it would exist on a wire that connects the electronics to the wall receptacle safety ground.  What might cause this?  A defective safety ground combined with some fault in some other appliance also connected to that Belkin.  Just one of many reasons for that one symptom.

But again, without specific hard facts (what part in each appliances is damaged or exactly what is electrically different in that Belkin compared to other protector boards), then the observation (multiple appliances failed) is only sufficient for speculation.  Insufficient even for a hypothesis.
 It's the opposite, actually:

&gt; The launch comes less than two months after Microsoft acquired email app Acompli in early December, and the software maker is turning Acompli into Outlook mobile.

They are replacing the Accompli brand with Outlook. Maybe x-post it in /r/lifeprotips? Have you tried it recently? T-mobile recently added most music streaming to an exempt data thing Common sense prevails!  Its amazing how often it doesn't anymore. Ugh, the fact that we ever got away from unlimited being the only option is pretty outrageous.  i could ask secfo for you guys i doubt the owners would mind we have nodes all over the place and its already full of geeks ?

um

&gt;click on advertising

What advertising? Or are there still people not running adblock that also click on ads on porn sites? Although that's pretty darned good, I prefer to think of it like this:

You tell your 6 year old that they can have as many cookies as they want. After the take 3 cookies, you punish them by telling them that they can only have half a cookie every hour for the next week.

Of course that elicits a "You said I can have as many as I want."

If we adopted AT&amp;T's attitude, we would say "You still can but you just get it slower."

If we did this to our children, we'd have people all over our asses for lying to our children. Some people might even call it abuse.

I so cannot fucking wait until the FTC brings that shit down on AT&amp;T and a lawsuit opens up. omfg I want to see AT&amp;T burn because of this shit. "from Adobe"? I talking about "to Adobe". Apple would have had to pay Adobe to have Flash, and Adobe asked for lots and didn't deliver anything that worked well.
And remember in the early days, Apple where talking about web apps (read SAAS), not local apps. If that had worked the App Store wouldn't have happened. Confirm your confirmation.  Ah right :)  Nice analogy.may borrow it in the future. In what world is it OK for someone to be an asshole? I hate you and your benevolent ISPs.  The introduction points are only used to tell the hidden service about the rendezvous point you selected. All of the traffic between you and the hidden service traverses through your rendezvous point. The rendezvous point doesn't know the onion address you're connecting to. The introduction point doesn't know the rendezvous point you've chosen.

If someone is operating a relay, they can tell if their node is picked as an introduction point and to what service, but they won't know how much traffic is going to that onion address. They'll only know when a new client connects to the onion service through their introduction point (of which there are several and they update occasionally), but not how much  traffic that user generates. It looks the same whether that user opens a page and leaves or opens a page and continues browsing and downloading gigs of data.

to me it's not tough at all. better to prevent political corruption then to defend the right to spend money on political view promotion. in an ideal world we would have both, but I don't see how we can have one and the other without having easy corruption as well. like I said, I'd trade a diminishing of free speech in this area for a corruption free political system any day. you are still free to speak your mind about political preferences with your own mouth, just not make a spending enterprise out of speaking your mind, just not spend money to promote certain politicians, cause that makes money gain poliltical power, and in democracies its supposed to be that the population each has equal political power, if you allow money to gain political power, it's not a democracy anymore it's a mixture of democracy and literal capitalism (where money has political power).

You guys (and Saskatchewan and Quebec) get better deals because people are actually fighting over you.

I'm in NB. I'm grandfathered into an old plan from before they went to two year terms and I get 2GB for $75. There is no such thing as an unlimited plan in this part of the country, or most of the country for that matter.

This is why monopolies are bad. Your example is exactly why we need more competition. That should be the norm, because these companies can afford to give plans like yours. But with no one challenging them, they can gouge and we don't have a choice.

EDIT: [Here](http://i.imgur.com/40IFhMn.png) is what most of the country gets for what you're paying. And that's a promotional offer. Imagine: Verizon Comcast Facebook merger...

Or basically how I interpret parks and rec season 7 Basically that's the border or an airport if they want to escalate. Yeah, they arnt obligated to serve and protect anyone. They're government workers who's sole job is to generate money, and keep those jails packed full.  Up to 30 megaBITS per second. If you had 1.5 Mb/ps you'd be downloading at just kilobytes per second. MB/ps and Mb/ps mean different things 40-50 gigs a month? Do none of you use wifi? Fucking WIND! Don't mail anything to your local Comcast office. They don't like that.  So you choose to adhere to the Matrix script scenarios where the machines enslave humanity instead of we'll written novels like Johnny Memmonic where tech augments humans or bicentennial man where androids become Kinder, more intelligent scientists, entrepreneurs and better world leaders for man kind. 

Of all the plausible well thought scenarios of science fiction you choose the scary Hollywoodesque one. 

Well let me tell you that the matrix scenario is completely stupid in terms of engineering. There would be far more efficient ways to power machines than humans neural activity, like just nuclear power or hydrogen engines. If robotics were really advanced, robots would be far more efficient to plow the fields. 

But fear away, does not make any difference, evolution always goes forward and there is nothing you can do about it.  Or the ones that say it has to be used along with a healthy diet and excercise, hmmm I wonder what's causing the weight loss there. How would I go about doing that? I tried using firefox on wine with silverlight but the performance was awful :/ This should've been scrutinized *years* ago. 
Working for comcast sort of sounds like fun. [You don't say....](https://imgur.com/FFqxNic) Silly article: implying AT&amp;T has a spine. Yes, given that we'll have to haul the seed factory and power source all the way up our gravity well, that's where compactness is an advantage. I do that now with Clearwire... And they were created with the same business model as you. I was able to shop third parties and for used devices from ebay and craigslist. Since I own the device, and it only works with clearwire, I made guilt free modifications to improve reception with my closest cell tower.

I would not have done this and gone with another provider if I did not own the device.

Edit: If you want a beta tester in South Florida, I would be happy to help out. [you don't say....](https://imgur.com/ffqxnic) Maybe they should stop with the bloatware already. I heard that they are possibly planning to, but I'm not holding my breath. People care about online privacy. Just not enough to change what they're doing or inconvenience themselves in any way. &gt; TOR is used as a lifeline for many people in oppressive countries to communicate freely.

&gt; There are traditional ways to investigate crimes that work well on TOR like going under cover and social engineering

So TOR won't help them... OK I get what you're saying but you're arguing in two directions at once. TOR can be investigated using traditional police methods. We need TOR to protect against oppressive regimes.

I think both things you say are partly true, and their flipside is also partly true. TOR does make it easier to be obscure, although it's not a guarantee. That helps both freedom fighters and criminals, though not as much as they'd like.

Which comes back to my original point. What we need to know is not what percent of TOR traffic is criminal, but how much criminal activity is facilitated by TOR. 





I think  Serious question, why pay $10/month for xbox live when ps3/4 is free? Make sure to send a _REGISTERED/CERTIFIED MAIL LETTER_. I.e., that way if they fuck you, the preponderance of evidence will favor you in court.

I'd be astonished if they tried to gank around that at all. They would know better than that. This is not about nuclear technology, it's about the human ability to assess and manage risk. And rational. Not sure how one would receive n*pi data. Makes sense, our Nation is secure, our online habits aren't private. And you've given a single example of humans misjudging that.So what's your point?  
It's a common misconception that security and privacy are a trade-off, and that privacy must be sacrificed in order to increase security, however this is not necessarily true.  



Not only can we have security without sacrificing privacy, giving up privacy for security is less effective.

  Tmobile is going to have to change their wording No good reason.  It's only $6. Police: To Serve &amp; Protect &amp; Collect.  It just has a little angle to it If you're able just go to Walmart ask to set up a new service under their family plan (I think that's what's it's called). My local Walmart has shut down their cellphone department so I had to call a outsourced phone number. I don't think the guy had any idea what he was supposed to be doing. The plan I was setting up was a $25/month 100 minutes talk unlimited text and unlimited data (5 gigs then it's throttled). 

My first bill was coming due so I finally decided to set up the online account to monitor and pay for the subscription. Found out a completely different plan has been set up. 

Also it's no contract. Month to month payments. Which is sooo nice. Can you eli5 to me what having your phone "rooted" means and what it does? My boss said his old phone that he gave to me was rooted but I didn't understand what he tried explaining it meant. They likely get most of what they want without asking anyway. China is *probably* just as paranoid as the US. Oh no, I wouldn't want to do something they didn't like! now I've found this great site : http://www.idea.int/political-finance/country.cfm?id=184 that has a handy form explaining the basic rules of political finance in each country.

aparantly the  "individuals can donate up to 25,560 euros to a party in an election campaign" is there, but I can't find the "125,000 euros of his/her own money" part. also individuals can donate upto EUR 10,650 per year to political parties, so with 4 years per election it comes to 17040 per individual per year. another eye opener, but still without corportate contributions and such limits it's very hard to bribe; plus it's always to parties never to individual candidates, so only way would be the party decides to spend a extraordinary amount on certain "staff" that happen to be connected to politicians. still quite possible, but nothing like the US system where millions can be donated to individual candidates and parties by corporations... 

but I think it's still stupid to allow such ammounts to be donated. if you want to use your freedom of expression to support a political party you can use your own mouth, and become a member of the party where each member pays the same small amount, so it doesn't allow for a sytem where one can give more money if such and such happens, which is effectivly political bribery. Bob sounds like a dolt and is probably not worth talking to. It was a good line. It sent virtual chills down my spine the first time I hear it.  Script languages. Then what?  I was paying $268 per month through progressive (no accidents, clean record, just liability insurance) and they were the cheapest at the time. Switched to GEICO and am now paying $183 a month. I hate AT&amp;T. My mom has been with them since for a long time. They still treat her like shit as a customer. I hate those bastards  Maybe if the devices we're affordable enough to where low class citizens could buy them, there wouldn't be issues like these. Couple of clarifications that you may not understand not living here  (don't feel bad, half the people who live here don't know this stuff either):

&gt;That said, I still am extremely uncomfortable with the idea of living in a country where it's legal for concealed weapons to be carried by citizens, 

You may have heard this argument before - but they're not really the ones you have to worry about.    To get a carry permit the standard process is for you to take firearms training and get fingerprinted and have a background check run.    Basically anyone who has one has been vetted, and any history of violent crime, anything involving drugs, any serious mental problems, you don't get one.

So you're selecting for a portion of the population who more or less has all their shit together, keeps their noses clean, and is willing to jump through legal hoops.     Probably the least dangerous subset of Americans you could come up with.

&gt;or that it's possible for purchase an automatic weapon without being authorized as someone who's responsible to handle something with that kind of power. 

While it is *technically* possible for a civilian to get an automatic weapon, it's not really an everyday thing.     First issue is we did kind of a future-ban on them back in the 80s.   Basically any automatic weapon that wasn't in existence and registered by May of 86 can never be owned by a civilian.    So you're working with a set number, and every time one breaks, it's another one gone.   Eventually there will be none.

So let's say you decide you want to get one.    First of all, you'll pretty much have to be rich.    Since they're not making any more of them (and as I mentioned above, the numbers are actually decreasing), anything full auto is expensive as shit.     I think M16s go for around 16-20k.    I bought a used 5 series for less than that once.     (for reference, a recently-made semi-auto of similar design can be had for closer to $500)

So you find someone who has one and is willing to sell it to you.   Of course they can't just *sell* it to you.   You have to go to a gun dealer (FFL - Federal Firearms Licensee).   And not just any gun dealer - it has to be one who's obtained a special authorization and paid an extra tax etc etc etc.    Basically a special guy who's able to deal in these sort of items.     He'll do the transfer.

But of course, it's not just a matter of going to the special dealer, paying some fees, filling out some forms and walking away.   Every transfer has to be approved by the ATF (federal agency that deals with firearms) *and* the chief law enforcement officer of your local area.  (This is usually a chief of police for cities or a sheriff in less built up areas).     The ATF will take around a year to get back to you.    Some chiefs of police won't bother.     Some states don't allow this stuff.    (it's actually quite complicated keeping track of the jungle of laws etc and keeping yourself within them)

OK, so you went through all that, everything came through after like 18 months, now you just came home from the dealer with your M16 and it's yours.     Just yours.    You have to be around it at all times when it's out of the safe, *and* you have to have a copy of the transfer form and tax stamp on you at all times.    Additionally, if you want to leave your state (say a friend has land in another state and you want to go camping and shooting), you have to fill out another form to notify the ATF.

SO.....anyway - it's not exactly easy or quick, and it's in fact pretty damn rare.


Moving on...

&gt;but to have them so common that they can be sold in a superstore

Well, this is an interesting argument.   I'm not sure If you guys have wal-mart or anything similar down there to do a proper comparison, but at any rate - If, say, a wal-mart sells guns (some do, some don't), it's because they have the exact same license to do so a standalone gun store would.     They go through the same background check and everything (wal-mart actually goes further, I believe, and videotapes everything).       

It's really no different than a separate store except the fact that wal-mart sells rifles &amp; shotguns means some communities where the only store for 20 miles is a wal-mart have access to them.


&gt;and be so ingrained in the public culture that fierce arguments brake out all the time about how they should be handled, or how to prevent them being mishandled, and for those arguments to (usually) fall flat due to how sacred the gun culture is in America...

This part....well, shit, I don't know what to tell you.   We're a country born of violent revolution.   The ability to defend ones' self and family has been part of the American identity since before the country existed.   I've never lived in a USA where this wasn't the case and probably never will.


&gt;The only thing I do notice about these arguments is that people seem to equate "Gun Control" to "Take away all guns". It doesn't need to be anything like that at all. Maybe it only needs to be "Need to pass a basic psychological test" and you get a license for most forms of firearms. It can be whatever you make it, however strict or lenient that it needs to be.

Well, again, it goes to history.   A lot of the big voices in the gun control movement would *love* complete disarmament of the citizenry.      If you look at the history of our laws starting in 1934, it's been one long march towards more restrictions, and we all know where it ends.   (not to put too fine a point on it, but your country is exactly what we think they want to turn us into, gun law-speaking)

So it's not that we think that all gun control == take away all guns, it's more that we think that's the end goal of the people pushing it, and they're just trying to chip away at things.    Trying to demonize and ostracize people who own guns - think about it - in what other realm of discussion are you labeled a "nut" by default for complaining about the government passing a law that'd make you a criminal for owning a factory accessory to something you bought?

&gt;Maybe it only needs to be "Need to pass a basic psychological test" and you get a license for most forms of firearms. It can be whatever you make it, however strict or lenient that it needs to be.

You've probably seen the argument that a registry of everyone who has a gun and exactly what types they have would be used to confiscate them, and you've probably heard the other side call anyone who thinks that crazy.

Here's the thing - this *actually happened* two years ago in New York.  They passed a bill banning certain magazines, and since they had a list of everyone's guns, they knew which ones came with them from the factory, and they used the list to carry out the new law.

The idea of licensure to exercise a basic right just isn't the way we do things.    We take the stance that your rights are yours until you do something to lose them.   (Think "innocent until proven guilty")   

Not that we want crazy people to have guns - and in fact there have been a number of improvements to the reporting of mental health issues put into the law recently to make sure that the different parts of the government talk to each other and if the crazy guy walks into wal-mart to buy a shotgun the background check comes back denied.   (**That** is most people's idea of "common sense" gun control.  Anytime you hear a nationally-elected politician or advocacy group use the phrase, run the other way) Coming from a state where the police inform the newspapers and radio stations beforehand about where they will have speed cameras set up on what days, this seems very strange. All you can eat except you can only eat one plate. I don't know, but i don't see the relevance. I'm not taking one side or the other. I just posted facts about profits. Not which phone does what better. Stop trying to turn this into an Apple/Samsung debate. That's right...but i have a strong feeling that continuing to pay the bill on time and replacing any phone with one of yours there is some continuity clause in the original service agreement bc remember- verizon would have charged a huge fee to discontinue the contract- i renewed it at least 4 times every 2 until they came up w their data cap horseshit- so refusing to continue a contract that definitely had continuity- otherwise they would not be able to extend service on any expired terms. I have little doubt that at some point verizon will fuck me over and what am i gonna do about it? Probably just suck it up. Its scary as fuck that the fcc plays games and creates huge mass market class actions that will get everyone 10 dollars for some ridiculous obscure shit buried somewhere but down to you or i we have little recourse when big business changes the game or sticks the flag up our asses.  Well technically *I* didn't use all that data.  The phone they rented to me did. Yeah... That's going to get a cease and desist letter in 3..2...1. I T-Mo and have never been unable to use youtube or spotify unless I'm just getting a shitty signal. Do I get to sue if they don't honor it? Nothing would make me happier than to have comcast pay ME money. I think I made an argument you didn't respond to in any way other than insults, derogatory remarks and rudeness in general. Because you refuse to talk in civilized manner about the issue, let alone constructively, I simply can't think I'm wrong in this case. Hell, you didn't even bother to describe the issue: you call it bug, which might or might not be true. As such I responded in general manner about what the issue might be, and why it might or might not be fixed (or even fixable) in future...

What does Apple have to do with this? Why do you keep pulling this back to Apple? You complain that the article reeks of Apple vs Samsung yet here you are constantly trying to make it Apple vs Samsung. Goddamn hypocrite! They're not.  From the article:

&gt; Rich said that so long as it is made clear to customers, carriers can employ the practice: If its clearly disclosed, if a company advertises unlimited, but very clearly discloses their practices with regard to throttling we would not challenge that action.

The issue isn't throttling.  The issue is throttling *without clearly telling customers when they will be throttled.* While I do like Apple products in general, I only have a "Fanboyish glee" against Samsung.

Samsung is the one that tries to openly one-up Apple as part of their marketing, with all those "next big thing" ads that directly target the iPhone. Guess what. People aren't buying into that anymore. So, allow me some childish "hahaha, Samsung is getting owned now" in return.

Google/Motorola? LG? Sony? I'm fine with all those. A lot of their phones are very well made and pretty, and their business practices seem friendlier to boot. They produce quality products, some of them even better than the iPhone, without childish pokes towards the other side. Friendly, honest competition is something I value, even as an Apple user. Competition based on calling each other out with a nasty and smug advertising campaign is where a company loses my trust and dollars. Well, thanks for the implication that I'm ignorant. That's a great way to start things off.

Our two-party system is pretty strongly encouraged inherently by our voting system: First-past-the-post, winner-takes-all. Do I need to explain why that tends strongly to lead to a two-party system? If not, please ignore the following, but a very brief summary is that any party that finds themselves unable to win elections will tend to try and group together with another party to get a majority of the vote. It doesn't always happen, but that's the main reason why we have two major parties in the US and always will.

That's one problem with our current electoral system. The second is money, not ignorance by the people. Why do I say this? Because politicians have to spend a lot of money to get elected. Why? Because everyone else spends a lot of money to get elected. Because a great deal of money comes from corporations, thanks to being considered people and being able to donate large amounts of money. Thanks also to things like PACs and SuperPACs, who can influence elections by spending great deals of money on advertising and who don't answer to pretty much anyone with the content of their ads.

All of this has led to a continual escalation of the funding needed to win a typical election, and corporations are able to fund this escalation. It means that politicians who want to stay in office have to keep sucking at the corporate teat. Those that don't *tend* to find someone else voted into office.

If we were able to get corporate money out of politics, you'd find a hell of a lot less pressure on politicians to enact legislation the corporations want, and they would have to again represent We the People instead of representing the corporations. Corporations wouldn't be able to give candidates massive influxes of money, and politicians wouldn't owe them. There will always be plenty of representation for these large corporations because they'll always try to get their employees involved, and that's fine. But it's a wholly different situation than the one we have at present. Good luck with Sprint, my wife got screwed by their system (albeit she shouldnt have been in the position in the first place) about a year ago. Employer wanted the new iPhone 5S in a photo shoot, she went and signed up and told her 'oh yeah if you cancel within 7 days there are 0 charges as long as the phone comes back'. She explicitly told them the plan, and they were cool with it in store. She gets the phone, uses it in the photo shoot and returns it. Has paperwork from Apple and Sprint, and should be in the clear.

Gets a bill next month. Calls Sprint and they ask for a PIN to access her account. She didnt get one because she cancelled and their system didnt assign her one, but they cant access her account without a PIN and account shows a balance for non-returned phone. After a run around for maybe 3 months of daily calls of 30 minutes plus (and never receiving calls back), they take it to collections for the cost of the phone (even though she sent them paperwork stating it was returned). Offered her something like $32 to settle after another month or so of calls and she said fuck it and paid.

Sprint is absolutely shit in the CS department, hopefully your issue goes better! Nope. You definitely don't want your bandwidth prioritized for advertisers.  So we're just upvoting advertisements for b.s privacy policy providers now?  TRUSTe is a scam. Tom Wheeler, ladies and gentlemen. Customer service posts arent allowed in r/technology, at least that is what the rule says. So where is your post in r/TIL? Did it get removed? HDCP - not unique to Netflix. For some reason if I plug my Korean 27" monitor into the Thunderbolt port closer to me it gives me a "This monitor is not HDCP compliment - male sure you're not doing AirPlay screen sharing", but it works fine if I use the Thunderbolt port closer to the MagSafe. Feels like the FBI warnings on DVD's, unnecessary and only hurting people that legitimately pay for content. Which, while interesting, would have horrible latency times. So the only people interested in that would be people who don't game, or use their connection for video conferencing into an office or something like that.

It would at least cut off some cash flow to the cable companies of users who don't need low pings though. I can't, but it's primarily if they catch you "running services" on the connection.

So running a webserver on your smartphone, or sticking your SIM in a streaming camera, or using torrents.  Anything that listens for inbound connections. ok, how about this.  If you take a list of the name of employees working today and compare it with a list of employees that are working on March 1st and count the ones from the first list that no longer exist in the second list. :)
Let's call those people "People that had a job with IBM, in Feb, that suddenly no longer have a job with IBM, in March." I doubt if this news will be heard on the major media. Its another reason to get online and seek out the truth for yourself. I got a similar letter in a small town in the American Midwest from my very small cable provider. The continuity clause is that the terms continue on a month to month basis until either you or Verizon decides to end the relationship.  They would have to give you at least the one month notice before a change of terms or cancellation of your account.  You have the same option of canceling with a 1-month notice.  The benefits of extending a new 2-year contract is that they can't (theoretically) do that during the contract duration.  

If they did decide to change the terms on unlimited accounts (mine included) we would have the option of canceling instead of accepting the new terms.  This is unlikely to happen until their are few enough of us left that the new benefits to them would outweigh the cost of losing half of us leaving. This is exactly what Apple used to do with those *extremely* smug "I'm a Mac, I'm a PC" ads. They're all the same. Okay, the rendezvous point will hide the amount of data, but 

&gt; The end just knows that it's sending an encrypted packet to another host (the hidden service), but it doesn't know the contents of that packet. Supposedly there's no difference between sending an encrypted packet to the hidden service and sending an encrypted packet to a relay in the chain. It's not supposed to be possible to know if the next hop is a hidden service or not.

is not correct, since the relay point *will* know a connection has been made, and so can do *some* measurement of popularity and traffic.

You still need an "end" to connect you to the hidden service, as mentioned. &gt; it couldn't transfer to mobile if you were on a call which got me a number of times.

They've kinda-sorta fixed that.  Newer phones that do both the WiFi Calling and Voice over LTE can transfer between them.  If you're walking out into 3G or EDGE, you're still out of luck, though.  (You can do WiFi -&gt; LTE -&gt; EDGE -&gt; LTE -&gt; WiFi, though.) What do you use that much data for?
 Not to mention no more oven hot car interiors or mad dash when raining. fees != taxes My ISP gives a guarantee of &gt;75% of agreed speed (120Mbit in my case, for 40), 99.97% up-time service level agreement, and modem replacement in &lt;4h if it's defect. 

It's glorious. In the 3 years I've been with them, there has just been one single outage of more than 30 minutes. That time I got an apology call, and full restitution for that month. Yeah, I think Comcast  just offers shitty service in many areas.  My connection is supposed to be 50mbps, but I've literally never had a speed test higher than 20mbps, and my speeds are usually between 5-12mbps, and they sometimes dip as low as 2-3mbps.

I don't think they're throttling, but I do think they flat-out lied about their service speeds and/or dramatically oversold what their lines can handle. That's what they want you to think. The big tech companies have to resist the Government's encroachment as well. Mozilla and Wikipedia can't do it alone!  Attachments : Confirmed Confirmation
[Download [here!](http://animalfair.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/happycat.jpg)] The problem with monopolies is you still have to pay them, even if you cut the cord and go Netflix-only Comcast is still going to get that ISP check.  Obviously they aren't even trying to pretend that they need to compete for customers at this point. I don't have any source, but have you ever been to a really congested area and your data just doesn't work? For example, I was at the Cowboys game and couldn't use my data presumably because there was just too many people connected to the same tower. This has happened at other places too like on my university's campus when everyone gets out of class at lunch and heads to the Student Union.  This is cute and all, but it assumes companies like comcast, or entities like our government give a shit about our concerns.  I think both have shown where they stand. AT&amp;T only disclosed after they had be caught throttling.  Indeed! Whether it's included with a Windows based computer or an Android, that 3rd party crapware is a real pain. That's one reason I stick with custom built desktops for Windows/Linux and Google Nexus for Android. Yup, I use certified mail whenever I need my security deposit back. Works everytime. we already know that. check out last months CCC talk on TOR hidden service analysis. Best analogy I've seen on this subject so far. We will need lots of hands.  But we are a small company with rather centralized plans for the next couple of years.  It is highly unlikely we are anywhere close to where you live. It will.  There are very few jobs that can't be automated... eventually. Thanks for the template! :)  I know. And I'm glad they don't anymore.

Full disclosure: I have an MS Surface too, and I would prefer it if their ad campaign was around how awesome the device actually is, something they don't do because they spend too much time comparing it to boring ol' macbooks. http://consumerist.com/2013/11/22/comcast-ceo-blames-bad-customer-service-reputation-on-sheer-volume-of-calls/

Here's Comcast's CEO trying to make excuses for their terrible customer service several years ago. Obviously it was all excuses and no fixes, because Comcast has the resources to have terrific customer service if they actually wished to do so, and more than enough time has passed for any improvements to happen if they'd actually implemented anything at all.  Heck, customer service was identified as a reason to deny their current merger by the US government, so they intentionally continued with the horrible service even though it caused their own colossal financial loss.

One example does not a pattern make, but this story is not unique or surprising to anyone. Indeed never trust Google! So Americans are looking for something like [this?](http://imgur.com/5uUYwzi.jpg) Not necessarily.  If you're a big business that can afford the Comcast/TWC extortion fees to not slow down your traffic, the anticompetitive advantage you gain over your competitors who can't afford the fees might be more than worth it.
  That's a good point. Its not a tech support post

Hes telling you how to not get fucked over by comcast Boo friggity frackin hoo. Well then, have fun in your life of ignorance. About that cake... I was charged for a service I didn't order for 2 years. Didn't catch it due to auto-billing and didn't read statements. So they owe me a sizable credit ($400 +/-) and I've been fighting with them for over 4 months to see my credit. They have even hung up on me.  &gt; I somehow doubt that they will turn all that EDGE into LTE by summer

They're almost done with the coasts, working inward.  People on /r/tmobile have been keeping eyes on both T-Mobile's maps and Sensorly, making comparison maps.

EDIT: To speed things up, they're putting LTE on Band 2 (1900MHz), same as their EDGE.  This means they don't have to climb towers and change out antenna hardware, just the hardware at street level + backhaul. IIRC it did better in terms of benchmarks, though I suspect that it got a lot of sales just because it had a much bigger screen. Hello!

What do you do when they inevitably keep charging your credit card? Im on the $80 unlimited plan. (prepaid) and there is no throttling. Unlimited 4g lte is nice to have. Just a warning though, the service is terrible once you leave the city. Only go for it if you live and spend most of your time in a city. The coverage maps on their site are extremely misleading.  you sound like bruce kushnick. On the surface, it doesn't seem right that the police are upset that more people aren't breaking the law.  Then again, I guess they're just upset people aren't breaking the law near them?  Either way, people are going the speed limit when they're around. Seems like they're just mad they're not getting money from it. without any "restriction", it would hit its natural limit anyway but if you restrict it to something than that is an artificial limit Then what is H+ If police departments need more money we should raise taxes. Turning law enforcement into fee collectors is not what the people want.  Are you kidding? I've removed this. It doesn't have anything to do with technology. Just some rubbish about a company.


 If you disagree with my actions, please feel free to use the [mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTechnology). I've always (by which I mean 2 minutes after downloading Waze) thought that police could save money/manpower by working *with* Waze to build-in police warnings on large, busy freeways and other popular speeding zones to achieve the same effect as having visible police officers. Obviously you still need *some* real presence, but it could be something like 2 cars vs 5 cars being on the road to deter/ticket.

Fewer tickets, but also fewer paid hours wasted on things like speed traps instead of directly serving the public. Everybody wins. But that might hurt some egos, so it likely will never happen. I think there is a clear distinction between Unlimited with Throttling and Unlimited with Downgrading.

So for example, T-Mobile will give you Unlimited ***DATA***, but make it clear that XX amount of the data is at LTE speeds. The rest of the data is at 2G speeds. The data usage is still without limit, just at a slower speeds. Unfortunately the drop between LTE and 2G is very noticeable and the user experience suffers greatly. This helps curb the e-penis measuring contests that people have on who's network is the fastest. 

Then you have companies like Sprint, who offer Unlimited ***LTE*** data, but have network shaping protocols in place for abusers. So your phone does not get forced to 2G/3G, rather, your LTE throughput gets slowed down if a user abuses a certain cell site, at peak times. 

AT&amp;T has arbitrary throttling on their LTE data, so users on legacy unlimited plans will get artificially limited throughput speeds till the next month. I believe Verizon is looking to do the same.

At the end of the day, unlike fixed home broadband, wireless broadband/networks are built differently, and run differently. The transport from cell site to core/Internet is the same, but the airwaves which transport data from a handset to the tower are what create a distinction. 

Spectrum is a finite resource, and can only support finite connections with finite backhaul in place to carry that traffic. For example, a site could be provisioned with 250mbps fiber backhaul. That total bandwidth is shared between voice calls, 3G, and LTE data. Voice usually is unaffected by busy sites, since the spectrum used to carry the calls is different from what spectrum slice is used for carrying data.

I believe that wireless carriers should have traffic shaping policies in place, so all users get consistent data speeds. So each user can still enjoy unlimited LTE data, at consistent 5-10mbps speeds for downlink.

There is nothing that a user could do on mobile devices today which requires more than that bandwidth, so the ability to shape traffic so all users connected to a particular cell site can achieve that should be the goal of every carrier. Unfortunately that is not the case, and you're left with ^^fine ^^print from carriers which vary depending on the user. 

Data access should be unlimited, at broadband speeds. Which means a consistent 5-10mbps speed. Not 80mbps for one user, and 1mbps for the other. This is America, you can sue for anything Hell yeah for oneplus on T-Mobile! Right there with you. I've been grandfathered into AT&amp;Ts "unlimited" plan for years. My wife and I both hit the 3gb soft cap each month. Throttling is real. I don't know how I would prove that they didn't properly inform me back in 2006 or 2007 that they would throttle me. I don't even think that was a thing back then. Why's this? The wireless gear they would install at the customer site is likely proprietary to whatever vendor's wireless radio solution they are using, so the customer purchasing the wireless radio for their house (with Ethernet hand-off) or purchasing a gateway would not make a whole lot of sense, and in this case it would make sense to charge a reasonable rate for a rental. also send it with some sort of tracking/proof of receipt. Why don't they do real work and we won't care to pay them our taxes. Seems fair, right? Damn I love my grandfathered unlimited data without throttling from Verizon. I hate the company, but the service is incredible. Again with this crap?! Just because they don't anymore doesn't really forgive them in my eyes. Just like the decades of monopolistic abuse from Microsoft stopped me financially supporting them in any way a good ten years ago after researching their actions.

I avoid both Apple and Microsoft completely (I'm a Linux desktop user, Windows/OSX simply haven't interested me for years), but no company is perfect. Any profit-hungry company is going to make dick moves somewhere along the line, and picking from the lesser of many evils is always tricky. Our plan is to launch with a guaranteed speed that we know we can provide until our towers reach their maximum calculated capacity.  At first- while towers are filling up- we will provide more speed than advertised and as more users fill the network we will begin to deliver the advertised speeds but not less.  Depending on how packet data and analysis looks, we would always aim to provide more than the advertised speeds.  Our concept is to expand our network within our budget before ever inhibiting our customers.  Call the FTC. They are actively looking for people like you. Yes, we all saw the AMA. But I thought Apple was doomed!? The way this article is spelled out T-Mobile is doing it right and Sprint is the one being deceitful and opening themselves up to fines. I think they peaked at the s4. After that there weren't any significant reasons to upgrade. Just my opinion Yeah at first. Then all of a sudden Comcast owns your business. They have enormous leverage against any online business. They basically have every potential customer for your business hostage. 

It is like having a power company that can turn off the power to any business it feels like. It is illegal because they could just acquire any business that relies on power by cutting them off, or even just making the power unreliable to the point they become unprofitable. That your assurances aren't worth much, especially not if the people who benefit from them will be long dead by the time we'll see what happens. *Pretend* your packets get there. I have. I have monitored a few local sites when under very heavy load  and peak bandwith (video streaming, gaming, high business traffic) the connection has indeed been throttled.
 I am using NI observer analyzer SW and a could of remote sources. which means 55%, a majority of the people, agreed with or held a neutral stance toward the statement 'Personal online privacy is not as important as national security.'

so why would people expect this 45% number to be effective at all? Making it a DDoS That this is even necessary shows a huge problem with our legal system.  Good work by IBM though. Sadly why I didn't want this ruling. I see AT&amp;T using this as the reason to finally get rid of the plan entirely, grandfathered or not. I don't care about the throttling, I never go past even 3gbs. I just like the just in case I don't get overage charges plus no one else offers 5gbs (the throttle limit) for so cheap.  I find that a bit irritating. People complain about a lot of things (not just online privacy or national security) and they don't do anything about it. When it comes time for a change to happen, people pass the blame to government and expect them to handle it. We live in a democracy which means people &gt; government; however people are too lazy and don't take advantage of that fact. Cause it's guaranteed to get to em. Just look up whatever the local laws are for security deposits. Usually on your lease. For me they have to send you your deposit within 45days or some form explaining why they didnt. Like charges for damage, which is why you take photos before and after living there. Write out that you'll take them to court if they don't send you anything. But you gotta wait til AFTER those 45 days. Cause that's how long they have. &gt; aparantly the "individuals can donate up to 25,560 euros to a party in an election campaign" is there, but I can't find the "125,000 euros of his/her own money"

That's where I found it too, but they had it listed in old-style currency so I made an approximate conversion to modern Euros.

&gt; you can use your own mouth

In the modern world that's pretty meaningless.  Can you use twitter?  Facebook?  Can you buy an ad on facebook?  Where do you draw the line?
 And yet we will all continue to 'need' to work like dogs. The unlimited plan has a 5gig limit on tethering and hotspot use. Alas, "Comcast" is trademarked, so I'd be surprised if it wasn't shut down imminently, with the developer threatened (at least) with legal action.

"TWC" isn't trademarked, though. Next the police will say they feel "threatened" by the Waze app. Hello!

GRAPHISOFT has been part of the Nemetschek Group, since its acquisition in 2007. Yeah that's usually the case. The media jumps all over Sprint while the other guys continue to abuse customers.

Throttling has a negative connotation to it, but the truth is, wireless broadband (LTE) is not a replacement for fixed broadband, and never should be. The capacity and core infrastructure is completely different and the networks are not designed that way. 

Traffic shaping, where certain abusers get slower speeds, also doesn't help, but shaping the network for all users, so each single person can get decent speeds, should be the norm. 

I would gladly take 5-8mbps consistently while commuting, over 120mbps in one location, and 1mbps in another. I didn't say most-  I said a lot.  This internet business is a new division of an existing company where we already provide installation and service of television products to consumers.  With the reports we have access to- roughly 20-30 consumers a month in our market call in directly to the provider and cancel without talking to us (a dealer) first.  Many of these people are upset with things the provider is doing that we can't control- so being that we can control everything with our internet business, it is solely our fault if something isn't right.  Like i said-  I don't want to make it hard but if customers can just leave the service without giving a reason - be it a problem, price, service etc-  it doesn't really help me improve my company to turn out a better product to you- the consumer.

You'd be surprised how little of an issue can cause a lot of customers to up and cancel.   Report it to the FTC by calling their toll free number. It's an old laptop, and I don't exactly want to put money into it because old PC6400 DDR2 memory is expensive, and my unit was part of a class action lawsuit against nVidia/Apple. The GPU needs reballed and will eventually die. Apple took my laptap and didn't fix the problem, so it could die any day.

The only thing I might do is revert to mountain lion. I have multiple old machines at work using an old Core 2 duo E4200 with 2GB of RAM and Windows 7 runs just fine. I think newer versions of OS X are just bloated and don't run well with at least 4GB of RAM. I don't know if this is good or bad, but it's sure as hell annoying. At least when Dropbox bought Loom I got some extra storage space.  Verizon didn't renew co tracts for unlimited. If you wanted to keep it you had to fully own your phone and go month to month. Which sounded to me like a bad deal cause if you wanted a new phone you had to pay full price with no guarentee they wouldn't outright pull it the next month. It is why I prefer how AT&amp;T did it where it was grandfathered in.  Its hilarious that to see a positive story about Apple on /r/technology you first have to choose to see the "most controversial links". The title is wrong. 45% percent disagreed that privacy was not as important as national security. That does not mean those 45% found it more important (they may have found it equally as important).  Thanks for going through my comment history. 

Not according to the FTC: http://recode.net/2015/01/28/ftc-says-unlimited-data-with-throttling-doesnt-count-as-unlimited/ Which is because it is cheaper to run the 4G than the 2 or 3G. They just charge more for 4G because they can, not because it is more work or energy expenditure for them.  Imaginary data is free! Nope. They've let us resign our contracts with the unlimited. I just did for the iPhone 6 subsidy. And I made damned sure I stayed on unlimited so yes, I'm sure they signed me up with that plan grandfathered  While both of those are great, pavement and asphalt particularly absorb a lot of the radiant heat from the sun. That heat ends up warming the areas with more pavement or asphalt (cities) more than surrounding areas. "Covering" those areas traps that radiant heat in the solar cells instead of allowing the pavement to absorb it.

Really, we ought to be thinking more and more about intelligent ways to reclaim wasted energy. The gas heat that escapes our tailpipes, the biogas that released as a by product landfill decomposition, heat that is transferred to pavement when cars drive on it, excess heat that is created as a by product of air conditioning, there is literally a fuck ton of energy that is being "vented" every single fucking day that we just don't really pay attention to.

It's downright sad that there is such a thing as energy crisis in some areas these days. There is so much energy out there just waiting to be captured, we just have to figure out how to do it. The only thing our politicians seems to get all hussy about is a single pipeline. Really all focus should be on working smarter, not harder. Pretty much any article about Apple doing well in the smartphone wars has the comment where someone calls it biased.  Every one.  Its kind of funny actually.  Do you guys draw straws to see who's going to make the "biased" comment as each article comes out? Still has the word unlimited in it, therefore it's unlimited data.  Period.  The FTC isn't saying it's not unlimited, they're saying you have to advertise it correctly.

&gt;This case is about false advertising, Rich said in response to a question from Re/code. Its not about throttling. Were not challenging throttling in and of itself.

&gt;Rich said that so long as it is made clear to customers, carriers can employ the practice: If its clearly disclosed, if a company advertises unlimited, but very clearly discloses their practices with regard to throttling we would not challenge that action.

It's still unlimited, it's just slower.  Technically it's still unlimited.  That's all that matters right?  As long as they tell you they're throttling, it's still unlimited.

That's all that matters.  It's unlimited.  Doesn't matter about the quality, right?  Just that it's unlimited.  Even the FTC agrees with me.

Do you consider a 400 pound man that walks from his bedroom to the pantry and back to get his chocolate bars getting exercise?

For awhile now I've used Google to Backup my Backups. Good thing too as now I don't have to move everything at once. My feeling is it's just best to stick with the big boys...meaning Apple, Google, or even Amazon. Not ideal, but probably the safest bet. If you're building a module, you're apart of ARA.  Ayup.

Government's primary concern is the protection of private property and a corporation's primary concern is appeasing stockholders. 

Privacy is at loggerheads with this; protecting private property requires a modicum of a surveillance state and appeasing stockholders usually means better marketing to customers or potential customers for constant quarterly growth. Maybe its a nice counterbalance to the glee at every supposed "-gate" story when a new Apple product comes out. For the Comcast apologists:  
Probably this was just one disgruntled employee who was responsible.  
Why don't you see this happening at other utility companies? Why are we always talking about Comcast?  
The logical answer is that Comcast has a culture of "Fuck-You" regarding its customer and that culture has an influence on the employees. This-   I think there is a reasonable amount that could be charged ($3-4/mo)  assuming we are responsible for the cost of replacing the equipment if it breaks. 

Truck rolls to do even basic things like this can often cost upwards of $150.00 each time.

Additionally if customers did want to purchase it we would make replacement of defective equipment outside of the warranty period their financial responsibility.  The problem i foresee with this is that people tend to forget whether they own or rent their equipment and policies regarding cost to the customer don't often sit well even if they were explained precisely in the past when they ordered their service.  This can result in unhappy customers.   

I guess finding an easy way to show that info to the customers would be the best solution. I believe a precedence has already been met by the courts regarding a (somewhat) similar case.  Police arrested a guy for flashing his lights at passers by to let them know a patrol unit was down the road with a radar.  The judge ruled that anything that encourages drivers to slow down is perfectly legal.

So my apologies if pragmatism gets in the way of your governmental revenue scheme. &gt;is not correct, since the relay point will know a connection has been made

That's true. I hadn't looked at this stuff in quite a while and I got that part wrong. But it still doesn't know anything useful.

&gt;can do some measurement of popularity and traffic.

How? It doesn't know what service it's relaying for.  The relay point only knows the next hop in either direction. It's really no different than than any other node as far as knowledge *expect* that it also knows that one of its two hops (and it knows which one) leads to the start of a relay chain that terminates at a hidden service.

If there's going to be analysis, the injection point is a better spot to do that, but it still doesn't know much of anything useful. Google, Facebook, Twitter and the myriad smaller online ads companies make billions by sucking every bit of tracking data they possibly can. You've got GPS on your mobile phone? Great, now we know exactly where you live, work, shop, vacation, have an affair. It goes much further. Based on your tracking history, and especially search / mail / chat logs, they predict or plan to have the capability to predict whether you'll change jobs, divorce, buy a new house, heck, your vote in the next election.

It is extremely naive to believe there is such thing as online privacy. We live in a total surveillance society, and we are moving into Minority Report territory at neck-breaking speed. you mean the open source project that is live for 3 months and has already been forked 75 times will somehow magically be taken down ? Love your comment. Corporate and government's response on public sentiment: oh that's cute.  The local TV news here reports where the speed traps are every morning. I'm sure they're working with the PD to reduce speed and accidents. That should be their overall goal. You realize multiple companies were interested in this tech and that two companies are currently building these batteries as ARA modules. This battery actually has a chance. 
 100% of me thinks the headline is a loaded statement designed to invoke an emotional response, rather than actually inform. Of course. If anything, it's testament to Apple's ability to turn modest performance increases into large sales increases. Yes, your weiner will shrink because the FCC pointed out the internet connection you are using is subpar. Amen. At least they're talking about online privacy on Facebook, the website that they regularly update with photos and information about where they go, what they do, who they see, and what sort of a relationship they have with various people. 

If the feds asked for all that info, there would be riots. People just give it up for nothing on Facebook though. Hello!

I have unlimited T-Mobile and I've never felt like I've been throttled even after using over 25gb in one month. The other 55% are over at yahoo making comments that they want shackled in the basement to keep themselves safe....  I never said that the internet would magically be wiped clean of it. But the people who are running it are in for some legal headaches.  You are correct.  It's a strawman to say that by valuing online privacy you're giving up national security, although that's exactly what the shitty NSA wants everybody to think.

Try the new Cinco e-Trial!!! Mostly this.  Apple has been selling phones with older technology in them for quite a while.  I'd be willing to bet that producing an Iphone 6 is significantly cheaper than a Samsung Note 4, yet they both basically sell for the same price.  Apple's profits are through the roof since they can charge top-end prices for mid-range technology. Because they have to tear up streets and yards to install the fiber. They also have to work with cities to get everything in order legally which takes awhile. It's also why Google is so invested in trying to get rid of state laws that prohibit them from expanding into areas that don't already have some basic fiber networks already in place. Hrm, 45% of Americans think online privacy is more important than national security, but how many of these people are updating facebook and twitter all the time with their location and what they are doing?  How about installing apps on their phone and allowing the app access to all their contact information and facebook feeds?  How about installing games on their phone/pc/console and allowing that to have access to all their information?

I believe that 45% of Americans want privacy, but not many are following best practices when it comes to privacy. I believe the best way to some up surveillance for security can best be summed up with: "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."

We now have cameras in public places and facial recognition software, license plate scanners pretty much every where, all cell phone conversations are scanned for buzzwords.  When you start with a modicum of a surveillance state, after a generation or two, thats all you have. You did it right. It's only good for Netflix. Otherwise, it's useless.  Sorry I misread, I thought you said they were throttling you. Carry on. If you think an accident that happened over 100 years ago that's entirely unrelated to the issue of nuclear power is proving your point, you're wrong.

Besides that, coal power (which powered the Titanic) has more casualties on record than nuclear power. Yeeaahhh, this title is misleading.

My dick is HUGE. -The Marketing Team and The Boys In other news, 55% of Americans believe national security is more important than online privacy... okies ... we're setting up some channels on called #reddit and another called #technology ... its up to you guys if you want to join irc.secfo.org 6667 PT or 7000 SSL ... ill spend sometime on this a little later and get some ops assigned ;) peace Tea (chans are registered and active might add some restrictions on there too but we'll see how it goes to start with ... you dont need to be registered to talk/join but if the trolls arrive ill lock it down.) Call your power company and ask them if you can cut the cord see what they say. I think online privacy is far more important too, but 45%? Looks like it's another silent majority. Reported a 3.8 percent rise in revenue as residential customers bought more service bundles when forced to choose between a bundle  or no service at all. good luck, there is a reason internet providing is done by just a few big companies. Either you will taget other isp's customers and face their wrath or you will fly under the radar for long enough to get some loyal customers and get bought out by one of the big guys. I would say the future of any new isp at this point is either being destroyed by the big guys or bought by the big guys.  Downvoted for posting the IGN article instead of the original Reddit IAMA interview. 

Here's the link to the original question and Mr Gates' answer: &lt;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tzjp7/hi_reddit_im_bill_gates_and_im_back_for_my_third/co3q2xf.&gt; I also find it funny that apple set a record in US corporate and tech history the other day and it got like 100 up votes, but if some internet celeb says " Net Neutrality is good!" for the thousandth time it'll get 2000 up votes. Just shows the bias of this subreddit. They need to take the same stance with Comcast. Marketing 50mbps and delivering 11 under the bullshit premise that they only meant "speeds up to 50mbps" is fraud.  Why not?  We grant each other rights, we grant animals rights, presumably we will do the ethically correct thing and grant AIs rights.  Probably not at first, granted -- as a species we have a pretty poor track record there.  But if we don't, like other oppressed people they might end up fighting for them.

Let's hope the AIs are generous in granting us rights after they take over... See &lt;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tzjp7/hi_reddit_im_bill_gates_and_im_back_for_my_third/co3rouc&gt;

"Suppose that the programmers decide that the AI should pursue the final goal of making people smile. To human beings, this might seem perfectly benevolent. Thanks to their natural biases and filters, they might imagine an AI telling us funny jokes or otherwise making us laugh. But there are other ways of making people smile, some of which are not-so benevolent. You could make everyone smile by paralzying their facial musculature so that it is permanently frozen in a beaming smile (Bostrom 2014, p. 120). Such a method might seem perverse to us, but not to an AI. It may decide that coming up with funny jokes was a laborious and inefficient way of making people smile. Facial paralysis is much more efficient." and sadly people believe it. And 42% believe that God created humans in their current form, without evolution.  Should we believe what they say just because so many of them say it?  No.
 Well yeah, if the politicians wrote the letters themselves everyone would know that they don't have a clue what they're talking about. Cue someone linking that video stating this. Hey, did you hear that one random Comcast tech, out of thousands, renamed a customer's file to "Asshole Brown"?  Apparently that is the most important tech story in the universe. I'm fine if I give Google, Facebook, whoever else my information willingly. I can choose whether or not to give them my data. If I can't choose whether or not to have governments snooping in my data, then I have a problem. If it it made into law that I can't encrypt to circumvent their snooping, I have a problem with that. Spread the word to people you know on tips to protect themselves. They don't do anything because they don't know how. Excellent.  
  
The media are complicit in propagating the mythical link between privacy and security.  It's an easy sell, but not borne out by fact.  
  
Does any one remember, when they were hunting down Al Qaeda, the story was these guys were smart and didnt use traceable electronic comms ?     
 
 
Monitoring private communications might stop a nutjob with a bag of weedkiller and a bottle of bleach - but it's not going to stop the next time someone wants to fly planes into a skyscraper.
 *yawn* tell me something new about Comcast And then never look at their privacy settings so anyone in the world can see it. Anybody saying that they don't need to obey a gag order is fucking retarded. Let's see how long Google is around after going against secret court gag orders.

Wake up. It's not like sneaking candy behind your parents back children.

Be angry that these courts exist or at least that they have become so powerful. 45% of Americans **surveyed in an online poll** disagreed with the statement "Personal online privacy is not as important as national security". 

This is what we refer to in epidemiology as an issue with external validity. Basically, it would be invalid to extrapolate the opinion of this highly selected group and apply it to a broader group of Americans. 

This garbage is why I unsubscribed to all politics-based threads. Lay-folks do not understand study design and the inherent risks/challenges/sources of bias. Read this book, then we can have meaningful conversations about surveys and studies:

 This headline only covers "Super Artificial Intelligence". No word on what Mr Gates thinks of "Ultra Artificial Intelligence" or "Mega Xtreme Artificial Intelligence"... Because grasping at straws.
 TIL - B.G. wears a tin foil hat. The other phone makers are stepping up, using premium materials and appealing designs. Samsung need to ditch the cheap plastic. Yeah my cop neighbor is rolling in it Fuck every comcast stories that aint technology news Samsung needs to keep their stinky paws off a aosp if they know whats good for m Yeah, I agree with your point. I just meant don't make that a profit house like a lot of ISPs have.

I also disagree that people would want to buy their own. I own a cable modem. Like wtf will I use that for outside of the only cable provider in my area? 55% disagree Because free use of the internet is more important than a company making lots of money? Ever think about that? pretty impressive considering they have yet to really launch a low cost phone. If apple decided to go after the poorer markets with a cheap iPhone or something they could really dominate. there is a huge market out there apple doesn't seem interested in which the other phone companies are using to keep up with apple.  I'm all for rooftop solar power and reverse metering, but I've never really understood why customers should be able to sell power back at the *retail* rate. The avoided cost rate seems more reasonable, or maybe a point between the avoided cost and retail rates.  how is that a weird security term? [Is that like the everything plan, with texting?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFFnDf8xGI) People who do illegal things don't care about the law. If Waze is outlawed, someone will find another means. It's stupid, just like the idea that lowering speed limits will affect speeders who are already ignoring the law. link doesnt work already. [cached copy](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:KmRSIlcFF6UJ:https://github.com/tylertreat/Comcast+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us) &gt; Where do you draw the line?

easy, like I said: with money; you draw the line at spending arbitrary amounts of money on promoting political individuals or groups. you draw the line at money=political power; as long as you only use yourself or any power that is equal to everyone (like voting, or individual membership of parties where membership fees are the same for every member), in short as long as you use the power any person has for promoting political parties/people and not the power any $ has cause like I said: "in democracies its supposed to be that the population each has equal political power, if you allow money to gain political power, it's not a democracy anymore it's a mixture of democracy and literal capitalism" then it's not equal political power for people, it's equal political power for people and their assets, it's democapitalism.

this way the only freedom of expression forfeited is the freedom of expression that money/property can buy, it's the freedom of expression of asset power, not of people power. you are allowed freedom of expression, your money is not. When that whole "solar roadway" thing was making the rounds a while ago I got called out for being "against the environment" and "stifling innovation" when I stated to some friends that the idea was completely impractical and that simply putting solar panels over parking lots would be a much better idea. Really surprised this hasn't caught on sooner. Turns out pulling speeders is real work. You know...because speeders are breaking the law. 

In the wise words of Fletcher Reed, "Stop breaking the law, asshole!"  I think there are a lot of misconceptions about this issue.

Really, the FCC doesn't want to change anything. Before all of this debate began, the ISPs were not common carriers, but the FCC had Net Neutrality rules in place. Then, there was a court ruling that said that Net Neutrality was too severe regulation for their classification (not common carrier, I forget the name). So now they have the choice of 1. No Net Neutrality, or 2. reclassify. Everyone would have been perfectly happy if that court ruling hadn't taken place (with the exception of ISPs).

The other thing is that the FCC has no power to control/monitor the internet, and there is no threat of that. The FCC regulates telecom companies, not consumers. Telephone companies are common carriers, and are heavily regulated by the FCC. That doesn't mean that they monitor your telephone calls (although the NSA may); it means that they have rules that Verizon has to follow in order to have access to the airwaves. 

What they're regulating is the ISPs, not the internet users. People use ISPs, and if they find out that Netflix is loading noticeably slower, they'll complain to the FCC, and the FCC will investigate, and the FCC will fine the ISP, or revoke their permission to use the public airwaves/phone lines.
That's the same as if a radio station started broadcasting the f-word: the FCC will revoke their license to broadcast.


TL;DR:

- The FCC has always enforced Net Neutrality, without monitoring the internet.
- Telephone, TV, etc. are Common Carriers, and they are not monitored by the FCC.
- The FCC exists because of the idea that the airwaves are public property, and it serves to regulate companies who use the airwaves to provide communication so they don't abuse public property.
- The FCC regulates ISPs, not consumers. Facebook privacy settings won't protect you from the NSA. I'm not sure what you're noping to, you just confirmed what I said. One plate and then one serving per plate afterwards. No need to be pretentious, I understand your point but we're all equal on here.

And yes I do "think about that"

The free use of the internet thing kind of bothers me a little. I live in Germany and the internet is quite heavily censored here (as well as other art-forms), but I don't see that reported on /r/technology. I live in the situation that everyone on here fears, yet no one seems to really care. Why is it that this sub goes against something that could happen when they could fight against something that has **already happened**?

I'm not an Apple supporter, I use a PC and an iPad for leisure. I think the record is more than just money making. It shows that Cook boosted the company following Jobs' death, and I think that is pretty neat.  Haha oh when CHINA does it there is an outcry. Just use the same technology that the backdoors for the US already use. No need to reinvent the wheel. This title is misleading...

&gt; Most surprisingly, when presented with the statement 'Personal online privacy is not as important as national security', 45 percent disagreed.

In logical terms, the statement could be written as this:

* Online Privacy &lt; National Security?

To which 45 percent disagreed on, which means 45 percent believe that online privacy is more important **OR** of equal importance as national security (Online Privacy &gt;= National Security).  But the title says the 45% think online privacy IS more important than national security.  When in reality, it *could* be something like this...

* 40% think online privacy is more important than national security (OP &gt; NS)
* 40% think national security is more important than online privacy (OP &lt; NS)
* 5% think online privacy and national security are equal in importance (OP = NS)
* 5% don't care or didn't answer

--------------------------------

Also, they only surveyed 2,000 *internet users*.  I know some Americans that don't use internet, but will stand for freedom/privacy over security any day.

--------------------------------

Don't be naive and fall for the '54% of all statistics are made up on the spot' trick.  Look at how the survey/study was done, the logic behind it, and if it's flawed. Usage graphs would be a lot more compelling than nothing at all, yes, I'd certainly say that would go a long way. How about if people's speeds noticably dropped as networks became congested during peak hours? How come you hardly ever hear people complain about that? I think the *only* time I have are with land line isps, and that's because they have shit infrustructure. Reddit needs more people like you. People who say their opinion. You provided me with a new opinion on things from another point of view. THAT is what reddit is about.

It's not about internet points.

It's about having a place where you can get the opinion of all people, so you can compare and don't be a narrow-minded asshole.

Reddit should also have more people who get the concept of downvoting. You don't downvote something, because you don't like it. Yup. Why? Anything that erodes trust loses Google $.

Google doesn't want this shit on their hands trust me. I see them as parts of the same whole.  Get rid of one you lose the other. "We surveyed 1000 Americans in the Hamptons and found that the average income of a US citizen is $500,000 annually" It's too late, everyone.  At the very end did it say "JK LOL" Not to mention, "Personal online privacy is not as important as national security" =/= "Online Privacy Is More Important Than National Security"

The difference is highly significant, and obviously the two ideas are in no way mutually exclusive, as much as American media tries to get everyone to believe. Everyone is reading this as if it is news. It's a PR News Release for the good of Truste, as can be plainly seen at the bottom... I'm as liberal as they come, but I don't see what good a free internet would do if we we're being overrun by invaders. I don't equate infringing on internet rights to protecting our national security like many of our agencies do, but shit, that's kind of a bold statement to make.  The rest of the world can't be the best in the world. That doesn't make sense. 

So you're telling me the internet is faster in China, India and Africa? C'mon.  ROCK YOU!!!

*boom boom clap* Minority says X, therefore the group says X.

You suck at math. Isn't this the whole point? If its reducing the speed of people, then the app is doing its job. And police want people to obey the law... Sooooo what's the problem?  At least half of the opposition to that statistic probably asked what the internet was when polled. Other than any type of OS- whether that be Linux, Windows, or OSX. Transferring files is pretty much one of the most basic things that the file manager part of an OS is supposed to do.

Nope! Need their software tho! Only 45%? It makes a lot more sense to force people to be aware of their speed if they know a speed trap is ahead compared to not knowing and then going over the limit only to find out a few weeks later with a ticket in the mail.  Not everybody has the same definition of "security". For some people it means 6 billion dollar aircraft carriers. For others, it means a living wage and universal health care. It must just be their overall horrible service and "coverage area" then. I have unlimited data plan, but that doesn't mean anything because it's not usable. I've tried different devices and even moving, but it's still the same case.  When the government takes away our civil liberties, it becomes the biggest threat to our security, far more dangerous than any terrorist. Thanks for shopping at the GAP can I get your email address please? That's never stopped democracy in the past. Asshole Brown?  Sounds like a terrible new Crayola color... Came here to say this. The "privacy vs. safety" argument is a false dichotomy that is trotted out over and over and over, in order to take away privacy.
 Why the fuck should I even need that?! Yeah, comply Citizen! This discussion ended three replies ago and you came out on bottom. Or you can keep wasting my time with your try hard replies. I bet you're single, go look in the mirror and think about why. Is that mean Steve Jobs was right in the first place? Better question- Amazon video. I want to cast it elegantly goddamn it. Unless something changed recently. even more sadly only 45% of people think its a raw deal As someone from the southwest, welcome to 10 years ago. 

We have school administration buildings with solar covered parking, as well as a few walmarts. Just adding shade to parking lots would be nice though, solar or not. It's not fun coming back to a interior around 160 degrees. 

ETA: And a [hotel](http://www.thegoldenhotel.com/our-hotel/green-initiatives/) I stayed at in Colorado had a nifty setup in the lobby to track their solar output.  "More transparency from companies."  Yes, because we know we can trust companies when they tell us what they're doing.  Never in the history of business have companies flat-out lied about what they were doing.  Got it.  Problem solved. &gt; Research Methodology

&gt;The 2015 US Consumer Confidence Privacy Index research was conducted by Ipsos using an online survey among a representative sample of 1,000 adults aged 18-75 in the US between November 28 and December 5 2014. Among these, 904 were aware of activities related to data privacy, 861 were aware of activities that could be done to protect online privacy, while 978 said they ever worry about their privacy online.

&gt;Ipsos carried out an additional online survey among a representative quota sample of 993 adults age 18-75 in the US January 12-15. Survey data for both studies were weighted by age, gender, region and working status to known population proportions.

&gt;Comparison data for the US for the previous three years is drawn from research conducted online by Harris Interactive on behalf of TRUSTe from December 11-13, 2013 among 2,019 U.S. adults age 18 and older, from January 7-9, 2013 among 2,166 U.S. adults age 18 and older and from January 17-21, 2012 among 2,415 U.S. adults age 18 and older. These surveys can be accessed here and form part of TRUSTe's ongoing consumer privacy research program.

Without defending the pseudoscience of statistical sampling (one which I do not put stock in), this methodology is consistent with good practices, and can likely give us as good a conclusion as any sample-based survey.  You seem to argue here that it being a sample of people who "use the internet" as somehow not indicative of "americans in general" is ignorant of the fact that internet use is prevalent.  More people use the internet than have telephones for pete's sake. In an ideal world, yes.  But in case you haven't heard... Apple has created an encryption method that the FBI can't break.  The FBI has ordered that Apple remove the encryption for surveillance.  So here, we have a case of the National Security trying to remove Online Privacy.  :-/ LOL, they tried to brush this one under the carpet "kale smoothie" yep, we're officially in hell. So $5. That's a long way from $50.

&gt; Because I get charged $50 a month just means that I need to buy less solar panels. I will still have the same amount of time to pay it off as someone who buys more.

Not quite. There is fixed cost in the installation and activation also. There's a much bigger difference in cost between a one panel system and no system than between a fifteen panel system and a fourteen panel system.

&gt; If I have to pay $30 just to stay connected or they lower the selling price that they have to buy it at, it will be another five years at least to become an option, again.

That's okay. Changing the price so that people who only pay $50 a month in electricity don't install yet is not the end of the world. T-Mobile is great for me where I live. 4g lte all day every day.  So what does that mean to consumers who already have servicd It also does not help that they keep changing the privacy settings so you may end up sharing things you did not originally setup.

They did that to me a few times and I ended up "deleting" all my content and then basically killed the account.

Though people think im the crazy one for not using facebook anymore Do you want people to slow down and be safe, or do you want to make that sweet cash? Pick one. You can't have both.  Reading some of these links op posted is really infuriating. We need to take back our right to privacy I'm from the south of france we've  had this for a long time now Really? Law is a shit ton of looking through past court cases. This is something a computer can now do in less than a second. How long would it take you to read every court case and precedent? The article says that a lot of Tor traffic is not child porn. 

How does that relate to your claim "Tor isn't a child porn enthusiast's best friend" ???

Lets say 1% of the population was pedos. Ok?

So just because a large portion of the Tor network traffic is not Child Porn that does not say ANYTHING about how much the pedos benefit from or love Tor. IE how much Tor is their best friend.

Tor can very well be a pedos best friend even if it child porn was only .00001% of the traffic. The % of Tor traffic that is childporn is not even remotely related to the statement you are trying to contradict. 


 That's okay, they have a real problem with you having a problem with them.  Just ask NYC, where the police have given up on mostly everything but harassing people, because they got their feelings hurt.  

Maybe you can chokehold their feelings to death, and then the police wouldn't have feelings to be butthurt about. Government censors, not Facebook since they are only following a counrt order to do so. More power to you, as one individual. However, at large scale, we as a society are not giving the information willingly. 

A. Google / Facebook / Twitter are the AT&amp;T of yesteryear. They are society-scale information brokers. There will be only a handful of such brokers due to economic factors. The choice is either use one of the information brokers, or go Amish. This is a false choice, and the data gets collected for 99% of people. 

B. Most people aren't even aware of the scale of data collection and processing of Google/Facebook and the like, nor are they aware / able to somehow disable it. Quick question: how many of us know on top of our heads how long of a GPS log Google has on each of us? How about the web sites visited that have GoogleAnalytics or the "Like" button on them? How do you even disable this kind of tracking? The do-not-track bit was quickly killed by the ads industry, so let me guess they aren't really going to make it easy / cost efficient to stop the surveillance.

To put this in numbers: 45% of Americans want online privacy, 99% of Americans are tracked by either Google / Facebook / Twitter, and likely 90%+ by any one of them separately. This leaves us with 35-44% of Americans that are tracked against their will.
 Don't you fools get it they don't give a shit what you want let one bomb go off and watch that 45% number go back to whatever it was when the Patriot Act went thru the first time and nobody noticed Yeah, no its not the end of the world. It is just a public utility charging for something that is good for the public for the sole reason of making sure that they don't go out of business. The are stifling progress for their own gain and claim to be in the public interest. Sounds like a good plan.  I wish you the best of luck!  What areas are you operating in? Just because the process is run by government, it does not follow that amending  rules equals more government. Wow, it seems like the FCC is finally using its teeth for the consumers. I'm cautiously optimistic. Thanks for commenting.  We shall see how long it takes to impact things.

In a debate between telemarketers and the Internet, I for once am proud to be on the side of the trolls. Whine more please. Not to mention, that's still less than half. So basically the title should read, "Less Than 45 Percent Of Americans Think Online Privacy Is More Important Than National Security, So Majority Rules Because This Is Supposed To Be A Democratic Society". I didn't read all of them, so feel free to throw that back in my face, but it seems he spends much of his time dealing with  the semantics of the word security rather than making a compelling argument that we can prevent terrorist plots (which are planned in PRIVATE) while maintaining privacy. I think everyone is fully aware that eroding privacy gives the government more power over the population, but they're okay with it because we've reached the point of being scared shitless of our fellow countrymen. We fear them more than we fear the government. In the end the "zero sum" argument is much easier to make intelligence community because they're not stuck prancing around the meaning of the word security. Should we just say "Privacy and the preventing attacks primarily planned utilizing networked or otherwise connected devices is a zero-sum game."? Would that be better? I have used up to 90 or so and never had a problem. Can't say I disagree.  Personally I would like to see money taken completely out of the political/campaigning equation.

While corporations cannot vote, what they can, and do, do is essentially puchase votes by pouring massive funding into campaigns and lobbying efforts.  The power of money to influence the decisions of elected officials in this way has to be stopped.  The solution would probably not be easy to find and execute, but the nation would be much better off for it, at least in terms of representative actually representing the voters who put them in office.

This just happened to me. Wouldn't let me keep unlimited and my other option is Sprint, which is terrible in my location. So yeah, Verizon wins this round I guess. Because they aren't really that serious about this effort. They're willing to put in a small amount of their money to try to tease the market into action, but not really wanting to go full in. It's a bit similar to trolling. (Congrats to those in the selected markets though!) &gt; just a few cities a year

Google already missed their opportunity to seriously compete with cable companies because of this. That was probably never their goal of course but if they had done an aggressive roll out 3-5 years ago they would have had a major competitive advantage. With all the major cable companies on track to start deploying DOCSIS 3.1 later this year it's very likely cable will have more gigabit data subscribers than Google Fiber even by the end of 2015. It's basically the same situation that happened with Verizon FIOS. They couldn't build out fast enough and pickup enough subscribers to make the numbers work. When cable companies started DOCSIS 3 deployments plus deep discounting in competitive markets Verizon actually lost subscribers.  Nope. Just increased my down speed from 15 to 50. Like I said, small cable company that is trying to expand You're right, we should mount Gatling guns to Ross. people usually don't care about their rights until it affects them in an obvious way.  hell, look at congress.  in other countries, people would be rioting over how incompetent it is, but even despite the most useless house/senate in history, people go along with it. yeah at an adorable range of 100 meters. I'm not happy with the fact that they just now made the decision, instead of when they started screwing people over with these plans For their own gain? Who do you think pays these subsidies?

They get the money for the subsidies from their customers. If they are required to subsidize panels then they just charge non-solar customers more.

This creates a situation where those who can afford a single-family home end up receiving subsidies from those who rent apartments. An end to this is not necessarily something people should be crying about.

Hiding less of the cost of solar will give an impetus to make it even cheaper which will drive more adoption without increasing the cost of electricity to do it. It's already worked so far, solar subsidies and costs have dropped precipitously over the last 20 years. Is there anyway I can get a royalty on my personally created content?

When they know their phone is tapped, they find a different way to communicate. If they know their internet communications are being watched - they will use a different way to communicate. This is nothing new. From the early days of communication, if something was compromised, it gave rise to a different way, be it a new code or a different way to communicate. 

If anyone is going to plan something bad and doesn't want to get caught - they won't communicate on something that's being monitored.  if police wanted to make things safer, they'd just place themselves everywhere on the waze maps...  They want the cash.     Whether it's revolutionizing the way you play game shows, rethinking the way we interpret laws, or orchestrating the holocaust, IBM has you covered.

Not sure what point the article or OP is trying to make here, but I think it's not helping out the pro-privacy argument at all. boo fucking hoo. there goes the cash cow that has nothing to do with public safety. stop sitting by the side of the road and go stop someone getting raped or murdered.

Neither of these people are computer scientists. They're just rich. Their opinions mean nothing special. So, you think I'm wrong? Do you think that this has nothing to do with them losing customers? The solution is to disassociate law enforcement from revenue generation; on a local, state, and federal level. Since pretty much all carriers do this, its not going to make a difference.

Well, 55% of people are pretty stupid, if this article is any indication. &gt; The police think it's ok to spy on us 24/7

Wat... There can't be a majority on two positions. I agree privacy and security are not on "opposite sides of the seesaw", but they certainly can affect one another. Things are a lot more complicated now versus when Ben Franklin was around. 

As someone who is in IT involved with managing INFOSEC, i don't get it.  i need logs and monitoring to indentify and thwart threats. 

So to all the security experts, a serious question, how do you identify a threat  to a nation and it's people without any type of data collection / monitoring?


  I don't get what she is losing. Why can't she just take her audience over to a competitor service?  That's the reason I deleted my Facebook account, too. Every time there was an update, it would reset my privacy setting to the default "super promiscuous share with everyone". Fuck it, I didn't get much out of it anyway. High entropy heat exhaust is not usable energy. &gt; Government's primary concern is the protection of private property

Government officials' primary concern is increasing personal gains, it seems. Otherwise there would be no such discussion. They may not be a trade-off but they are definitely closely related. There are certain steps that definitely need to be taken to ensure the safety of our citizens. People get all up in arms when their personal information gets compromised, but why did they submit it to the unidentified source in the first place? People have more control over their privacy than they know. If you want to keep something private, DON'T PUT IN ON THE INTERNET. It's quite clear that in todays day and age, if someone wants your "private data", they can obtain it, whether it be our governement, or a black-hat hacker. 

&gt;  giving up privacy for security is less effective.

Less effective in what regard? There is no way you can tell me that monitoring digital communication is hindering national security. In fact in the past few weeks, the action of closely monitoring certain suspected terrorists has led to the capture of some and will continue to do so.

Now if you're you're gonna tell me it's less effective in building a trust between the people and the government, then yeah I'll agree with you there. But I get the feeling that's not what you were getting at. 

You quote all of these articles regarding why privacy is so important, but from what I read, none of it actually goes into the "why". It's mostly just reasons to justify keeping something private and how to evade the "intruders".

I'm not saying this is going to be solved by putting back doors within all encrypted network traffic, or by giving government free reign, but I'm saying people need to actually appreciate and utilize the internet for what it really is, an open source network the connects the world. 

Bottom line, if you're worried about the privacy of something, don't put it on the internet.  Yeah I'm beginning to think that too. It's a shame because none of the systems are perfect, and Picturelife is the closest I've seen to my ideal service (I like that it's for backup, not sync, which frees up space on my tiny MacBook SSD drive). I'm thinking that Dropbox's Carousel service is my next best bet -- I can use selective sync to avoid local storage, and the company is hopefully established enough at this stage to not get gobbled up by a competitor. And there's the rub. It's like the formula telcos use when determining how many lines they have to have in a central office. They have to figure what max percentage (except in disaster/emergency situations) is likely to be used at any given time. Say they have 100,000 subscribers for a particular CO - they figure at any given time, 10,000 are in use at most, so they configure the switch for 10,000 lines. It can be expensive, at around $100/line just for the switch.

So they are welcome to do the same, but don't get it too wrong. Then it's doomed to be another hated company, like comcast and time warner. &gt; They don't do anything because they don't know how.

Information isn't exactly rare or hard to access. They're lazy. Ya, that is not an impressive statistic if you are advocating for more privacy. your thoughts match mine on this. Switching your search engine to DuckDuckGo is a simple way to have just a little bit more privacy in your online life.  People are so willing to give Google so much information about themselves, information that they would probably not even share with their significant other. Nonsense. The number one cause of slowdowns is network congestion. Sure, a given server can, from time to time, be overloaded, or the server itself hasn't got connection bandwidth sufficient to service requests at load. That's fine, but that's not why at 8pm, all internet in LA gets slow. I would totally do that since I see humanity as a mere stepping stone in the development of higher intelligence. GOOD -- fuckers Also, why would people not using the internet be relevant in a poll about online privacy?  The biggest issue I can see if the vendor based changes to each phone. All the bloat ware added, the junk, the ads, the Verizon/AT&amp;T only apps that you can't get rid of etc. They need to reject outright the vendor builds, or allow users to load a NON-vendor spewed OS. I don't even necessarily mean AOSP, which would be cool too, but a otherwise great piece of hardware is so bogged down with junk default load that the phone lags. http://youtu.be/kga2soqvMF0 Fine. Split hairs. I can already see the problem with the attitude. Carry on. Lots of broad sweeping generalizations about police in here which will surely aid to this civil discussion. Not all cops are thugs... but lets plug our ears and yell into the echo chamber because we r mad!  He's saying that the catch all data mining techniques we use are unwarranted because of the massive amount of false positives and negatives created by such a system. A focused investigation is much better at catching terrorists. This is probably well known to people in the NSA and FBI so it means they want this system simply to infringe on our rights.  Thank you for the thoughtful and well-written response. However, I think you're still coming at this bass-ackwards. I don't blame the corporations for being asshats. I blame the government for creating situations (at the urging of those corporations) that allow, encourage, and in some cases demand that the corporations be asshats. 

Comcast *et al* are not evil. They are not beings; they cannot be good or evil. They just are. The people who run the companies are not (necessarily) evil. However, all public companies have **one** legal and "moral" [sic] responsibility: to maximize profit for the shareholder. 

This means doing things as cheaply as possible. This means offering only as much customer support as is required either by law, or by competition. And where there is no law, and there is no competition, there are no "good corporate citizens." It simply does not pay to be good.

I don't believe governments should allow monopolies to exist, or establish legislative regimes where monopolies can occur. 

I also do not believe that the free market can solve any social problem.

ANY social problem.

Whereas in individual may choose to do good because it's "the right thing to do," corporations have only one value: profit. Sustainability is not even a factor, let alone improving the lot in life.

And I do believe that government "intervention" in the market is helpful. Hell, it's not only helpful, it's a moral imperative, and not even for warm, fuzzy, bunny-hugging reasons.

When elements in the free market become more powerful than government (which we are seeing more frequently across the world - think big banks, big pharma, GazProm), the threaten the supremacy of government, and therefore the supremacy of law. Democracy ceases to function for all intents and purposes, as governments operate under the fiat of corporations rather than the electorate.

Bribery is as old as the market itself. I will trade you some of my goods/money for some of your integrity. Eliminating government will not eliminate corruption. Laws, civil protection, community infrastructure... these things are basic requirements for any society, and will be created by private individuals or enterprises if there is no other government to create them. Those parties then become government, by definition. 

And there are those who will always seek to gain an advantage through bribery.

How will your corporate utopia function? &gt;which means 55%, a majority of the people, agreed with or held a neutral stance toward the statement 'Personal online privacy is not as important as national security.'

Maybe they should not rely on their illegal quota systems for funding their departments. On-line privacy is part of national security.

This should be the minimum. At least they raised the speeds from the 1990s. I think that's kind of a stupid choice. There's way too much gray area in the spectrums of both online privacy and national security to accurately compare either. If the government needed access to facebook status updates to stop a coordinated nuclear strike against LA, NYC, and San Francisco it would probably definitely be worth it. If the government needed access to personal emails or private cloud storage to stop a grow op in Oregon it definitely would not be. The premise is flawed from the start.

Yeah on YOUR SINGLEPLAYER GAME YOU LYING CUNTS!

Comcast needs to be sued into bankruptcy.  So if someone were to have a proprietary business, wouldn't they need to submit all of their financial and business information to the government anyway? So why is it in issue now to have it be digitally monitored? If the data is sent internationally it should definitely be monitored. 

Given the advancements of encryption standards, it's pretty simple to keep something private when sent anyway. **And like I said**.... It's not like adding a backdoor to encrypted traffic will solve anything.
 Well, the people that we need ask to protect our privacy  is government. Unfortunately they could not make todays thread because they had to release a worm on their own people, allies and the world and after that they had a full day of invading the privacy or us and our allies. Tomorrow is full as well because they are hunting the guy or guys that gave us the transparency they patronize us. about. They understand how we feel though, they read our emails earlier. Yes, they have what we need. 


Err, if we happen to be a bunch of sadistic chumps with no self respect at all for ourselves, our labor or privacy and enjoy being patronized and deceived.

You have to be alarmist about anything that concerns our interests, like internet privacy and reliable Cheeto production. What? How did you get that from what I said? You said that the contract is up and acted as if there is no reason to even think we would have to worry about cancelling without an etf cause we don't have a contract. I said that the contracts are still there with unlimited. I'm still on a contract with unlimited because they have grandfathered me in (at least twice) and let me resign the contract for 2 years with "unlimited". So, yes, I'm still on a contract and there still would be an ETF fee.

This isn't Verizon that forced you to go month to month if you wanted to keep unlimited. AT&amp;T so far has let you resign 2 year contracts with the exact same terms. So yes, there are people on AT&amp;T with unlimited who are on contracts.

Is that clear enough? Transparency involes producing legal paperwork documenting what they do. So they can still fabrocate those, but that is at least illegal then. This article title is misleading the text says:

It does not follow that they think privacy is *more* important than national security, only that it is not *less*.

I'm not an engineer but those that are is this a plausible concept? They could just rename it to "C*mcast". American has become numb to the dog and pony show. We want our freedoms back. Maybe it's just me.. I had unlimited with ATT since the first iphone. I switched a few months ago and I miss it because it felt like freedom, but I never exceeded 20GB no matter how much I used it carelessly. For me I just wasn't getting the worth of a supposedly unlimited plan. I could always return my bill to the same price as before and have 60GB (which is effectively unlimited for us) but it seems like I won't exceed my current limits anyway. Att (hopefully) will never throttle me like they did on unlimited. This is probably a pipedream, but I assume since it's in their best interest now if I use a lot of data, they won't try to stop me. The damage done to U.S. TLD's is based in trust.  Think what has been done to that trust. Stronger privacy measures *increase* national security. Our govt. is pretty much obliged to use databases and telecommunications systems because of the scale of their endeavors. *Terrorists* on the other hand have the option of using handwritten notes and direct verbal communication. I'd be more worried about the guys who are aware that emails and social networking sites aren't secure means of communication. Nope, a plurality. If all of those people actively abstained from providing an answer (clicked N/A), then maybe a majority of respondents would agree if somehow you decided to include them in the percentage. But you cannot do that, because you also cannot limo so the other millions of people who didn't provide an answer (by not participating at all) in there either.

If those people expressed that they weren't sure or that they felt equally about both, then a plurality. In no universe is 45% a majority, even if it is the biggest piece of the pie. You're assuming it's binary. That 55% is the total of the people against us and the people that don't care either way. It's at least closer than it appears. Maybe they should go pure android? I give them a second thought if they did I don't think it is ever safe to assume that those who are placed higher in a list of command necessarily reflect the viewpoints held by the collective members under them. Do all employees agree about some policies upheld by their company/boss? Do all American citizens agree about the decisions made be governing officials? Probably not. I'm just stating that the broad use of "Police think X" "Police do X" is a dangerous mentality. Some police probably do support this app as it does reduce speeding, which does ensure safer communities.  Forgive me if this has been said on this post already. 

All the time I see posts and comments and such about how we should expect and require private companies to disclose more information about how, when, and why our government attempts and succeeds in taking our personal information. 

Instead, why don't we flip these headlines and ask why our government isn't more transparent about the number of requests, to which companies, and generally why they request. We don't necessarily need to know who the request is about, but we should know when and a broad reason why. (I say broad because I do understand the importance of "national security," I don't want or need to know you're accessing this information because you believe Mohammed Ali's son Mohammed is possibly planning to destroy something)

Instead of solely picking on these companies, we should focus our effort on fixing broken laws today. We're in a country where this can be done, so why aren't we working harder on fixing the real problem, instead of asking our favorite companies to incriminating themselves by refusing to expose private data.

Of course I'm not saying completely back off on these companies, I'm just saying how about we focus more effort on the real problem. Our government.  [Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/MlZq8Yx.png)

Can we just cut out the middleman already and have Comcast represent us in Congress? Try hard replies? I'm having fun here - it's amusing how immature you are, yet you try to imply otherwise... As for argument, as I said: you didn't even attempt to start it. You went on full-on personal offensive out of the gate - that's hardly a discussion, unless you're 5 yo (I'm assuming you're not). In couple posts you managed to progress from "retard" and "idiot", through "full of shit", "joke", "smug, arrogant, sad little man" to vague remarks on my personal life, while barely even touching the topic of supposed discussion you 'came out on (top)' in :) I'm sorry what?

What I think is that the utilities don't want to raise prices and anger customers and lose customers or revenue. Subsidies to rooftop solar increase their costs of operation which means they raise prices on customers to cover it. And they don't want to go through that. Look at what happened in Germany (cost of Energiewende).

In the end, subsidies don't really directly make something cheaper. They just push the cost around. Medicare Part D didn't make drugs cheaper, it just pushed the costs onto more people. Big pharma is still making the same amount, it's just coming out of different pockets.

We need to push toward making solar actually cheaper. And what has worked so far is enough subsidy to drive adoption. This gives companies the advantage of economies of scale and produces revenue they can use to reduce the cost of it. But the amount they actually charge for solar is effected by pricing pressure. Subsidies reduce pricing pressure.

I know people love that there are "more solar workers than coal workers" but if you really want solar cheap you need less of a model where you call a local craftsman to bid on making you a custom system and more of an IKEA model. It's probably time to start that transition. No, I assume you either 'agree,' 'disagree,' or are 'neutral.' I then combined the first and third options as indicated by the phrase 'agreed with or held a neutral stance toward.' Unfortunately, this post has been removed.

Them taking my private information makes all of us less safe. I added a tablet data plan for $5 port month, and it would be $10/month for each additional phone line to have truly unlimited as well. It's still a large minority, I think is the point. During the Cold War, for example, I doubt that large a group would have answered the same way. Just because a position is a minority one doesn't mean trends regarding it can be dismissed Ok, if the idea of public privacy is dead - then the idea of government privacy is also dead. We can probably cut down to 20-30 if we start using WiFi at home. But that would be too logical ;) So does that mean they'd need to upgrade existing "broadband" customers? If only giving your personal information would keep you safe.... it doesn't I'm disappointed that it's only 45% There are multiple solutions that could do it today. It's just being blocked by fossil fuel interests and by our insanely bad money-based social system. Concentrated solar power is probably the most straight-forward and proven solution, just build a bunch of plants in the desert regions and use HVDC super grids to shunt the power around. We could do that today with relative ease.  Wonder what would they do about self-driving cars. ELI5 of what this actually means? Hello!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) if you have any questions or concerns.* The survey was performed by TRUSTe, which provides privacy certifications for online businesses. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission charged the TRUSTe with failing to annual recertification checks for hundreds of companies holding its privacy seal, despite promising to do it. 

But I'm certain their survey wasn't skewed.  I know! It's ridiculous.  But in a world where 'figuratively' now means 'literally' I feel like these assholes still have a loophole. 99 Percent Of American Politicians don't give a shit what 99% of Americans think. 
FTFY  That's because we are already the most secure nation on earth. "National Security" refers to protection of the "national interest" which refers to rhe interests of dominant groups.

In that context, this result is not surprising, but to elite groups, such as the corporate media, it's a news story. That's exactly what I just said.

&gt;  It's quite clear that in todays day and age, if someone wants your "private data", they can obtain it, whether it be our governement, or a black-hat hacker. Why is anope a problem? I think it's cute that the Government thinks they can scare me into submission with the idea that a handful of unlucky people might get picked off by extremists if I don't fall into step on these security issues. 

But seriously, 9/11 could Jihad and then Iran OPEC's Mexican Drug Cartels Ebola outbreak. 


 Excuse me, 45% were more concerned about privacy than security, but that doesn't tell you that 55% were more concerned about security. There's always options like "I don't care" or "neutral about it", so there's that.  
+ like someone else in this thread said:

Try telling that to Obama, The NSA, FBI, DOJ or any of our top brass law enforcement officers. They think privacy on the internet only exists to enable criminals and terrorists.  If you didn't want people tracking you, you shouldn't have pushed predatory speed traps as a major source of income. Yeah, but on this particular subject in this political landscape, it DOES mean it will get dismissed.  Look at all of the glorious time-wasting tools that Reddit has birthed from its loins. Well it's from "AppleInsider" so it's to be expected. it's moer clear that if you are a big corporation like Apple, or RIM, or Cisco, you better play ball or else.  

And you would have us all just roll over and say, 'well that's the way it is, so lump it'   fuck that.   there's a better way, and it doesn't involve Apple, or the cloud. It plunges relative to last year. Profits can't go up exponentially forever. At some point, they hit market saturation where everyone has a phone they are satisfied with and don't want to get another one for at least a year or two, and profits go down. It's just part of doing business. Yes they can.  You get to leave AT&amp;T without having to pay any sort of early termination fee since they made a material change to the contract. It's interesting how the TV show Parks and Recreation has taken on this issue recently  - although of course they are not able to make the faux Google company into complete villains. Or you can pay for unlimited lte... 30 bucks on their standard plan.  What are they going to do? Find out where you live? Get your phone number? Know your ip address? Know your family? Please explain what they could take from me that makes my life a living hell? Pfffft.

So religious people don't own iPhones, watch Netflix, or appreciate the significance of landing a robot on a comet? I must have missed those polls. Care to cite your sources?

You're an imbecile whose generalization is foolish and disgusting. Grow up. Online privacy IS national security. Can you explain why it isn't covered as a parody ? To serve tickets and protect the State.  I don't buy the argument that pervasive surveillance will prevent attacks. There's too much data. However, after an attack takes place, I think finding out who the criminals worked with is immensely valuable. 

 TRUSTe, Inc. is a trust mark sales company[1] based in San Francisco, California, ... Best known for its ...advertising channels to allow companies "to safely collect and use customer data to power their business" In that case, here are few suggestions:

- Fixed [reasonable] monthly bill that will not go up after few months.

- Add an option to sign a 1-2 year contract for cheaper price, but allow the consumer to cancel the contract without a penalty within 30-days, if they are not satisfied.

- Be truthful about the quality of the product.If it's over the air then state clearly that depending on distance and weather, the throughput will be different.Don't advertise, let's say 10Mbps, to all consumers.Try to find a way to measure an approximate speed depending on distance.Pretty much like DSL and the distance CO.

- Don't go into ad/analytic business.Don't sell data to companies.Don't add tracking cookies like Verizon does.Doing this will kill your business.Verizon can afford it because they are huge.

- Providing anything less than 600GB data per month should be a felony on 21st century.

- There is nothing worse than service interruptions.Make sure the company that provides you the towers has an emergency unit that can quickly solve issues.

- Explore crowd funding possibilities.The number of people who hate their existing ISP is huge.You can get a lot of support from public if you spread the word in areas that you plan to offer service.Start a Kickstarter campaign or something similar.

- Try to provide the service that you promised.Promising 20Mbps then delivering 5Mbps is terrible. A record number of people are concerned with Internet privacy, and at the same time there is a record number of nudes and dick picks being uploaded.  I have an S5 Active and i absolutely hate the phone.  It's slow, lags, reboots itself.  Going back to iPhone ASAP.  i can see why their profits are going down. The problem is with the title. The way it's phrased, 45% agree that online privacy is as important, if not more important than national security.  I don't think I have ever seen this question ever put to Presidents Bush or Obama by the media:

"what is your response to the sentiment expressed by Ben Franklin, 'those who would trade security for freedom deserve neither'? basically they did something like what google does to fill its searches.  55% of Americans are totall and absolute morons, no suprise there. About time. The speeds we get here in the US are absurd- and it largely relies on being able to call just about any kind of internet "high speed" "broadband." "He who gives up his freedoms for a false sense of temporary safety, deserves neither, and will lose both" 
-Benjamin Franklin  It's about time citizens ramped up their surveillance of government.  45 percent of Americans think *their* online privacy is more important than National Securitybut they are only half-right: 

Their online privacy is *irrelevant* to National Securitythe government is not going to glean any relevant intelligence about terrorism, by intercepting the communications of 99.999% of Americans. OK, cause sometimes I drop to h+ and my connection is slow as hell. Like trying to look at pictures on the internet while your mom is on the phone slow. And that's exactly why it's surprising (even if it's *just* 45%).  Thanks for correcting my terminology. But I think the *majority* understood what I meant just fine. 

Considering the rest of our country works on first past the post voting I don't think a plurality is too low a standard to ask for on this issue. (Disregarding the lack of scientific rigour in the poll itself.) (And the lack of evidence that the opinion of a plurality of citizens has any impact on legislators.) that's what i thought, but i just wanted to make sure. so the lowest speed that telecom companies can sell is 25 mb/s? that's a great step forward. When you give up privacy you give up security. Period. You just wait for someone to come around who does not like what you represent and bam, your done. Especially with the Conservative Party of Canada during the [2008 election]("Canadian federal election, 2008" on @Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2008) Serious question... Couldn't it be considered illegal for politicians who have been paid by Comcast to send a letter written by them to the Fcc to cast their "vote" on whether or not to allow the Comcast-TWC merger?... Is this a type of voter fraud due to them receiving money and basically being on Comcast's payroll?  so it must be customary in order to receive protection?

object code is merely a ***simpler*** depiction of the source code, nothing more... You might want to look into the origin of what you quoted.

&gt; [Franklin was not describing some tension between government power and individual liberty. He was describing, rather, effective self-government in the service of security as the very liberty it would be contemptible to trade. Notwithstanding the way the quotation has come down to us, Franklin saw the liberty and security interests of Pennsylvanians as aligned.](http://www.lawfareblog.com/2011/07/what-ben-franklin-really-said/) It could be 45/45/10, where's the majority? Stop with the stupid misleading title Actually the plan is to put them in near earth orbit so the latency times wouldn't be horrible.  (something like 60-120ms) &gt;  Less Than 45 Percent

Where are you getting that? It's possible (unlikely, but possible) that all 45% believe that online privacy is more important than national security.
 Yep anything below 25 up 3 down has be be rebranded. Absolutely nothing.

It just means your ISP can no longer call your 4mbps connection "broadband" well, it's for people that don't know what it is. To them, it's probably weird And you're entitled to your opinion, of course.  In my opinion, we don't need to give up our privacy to be protected.  In fact, our nation could use better protection over the internet by *increasing* online privacy. Wow, this is surprising guys, isn't it? Gee, ya think if over a third of us want privacy, we should have more legislation for it. Oh wait, the people aren't in power. 99% of Americans have nothing to hide. If they care so much, they are hiding something.  Both sets are mentioned and combined to a "majority" which makes it *not* a majority. Wow and what's this mostly ?  Music?  YouTube?   In other news, 80% of those who said that online privacy is important are active on Facebook daily...

I certainly agree that online privacy is important, but I imagine the above is quite legit too. hey, MRAPS and tacticool green camo aint cheap. too bad imgurs uploading sucks so bad Welcome to last week They said they were doing it back at the S3 and then to the S4. I've jumped ship since honestly there are so many better manufacturers that I do t *have* to put up with it anymore. No, it just means they can't call it broadband anymore.  You can still sell a 14.4k dial-up connection if you want to.  It just pretty much changes what they are allowed to say in their advertisements, and supposedly it would stop them from getting any government subsidy specifically earmarked for broadband deployment unless they actually deploy technology that can reach these speeds.  It should stop all dsl deployments from being subsidized, but if you've watched the frontpage at all in the last few weeks, you've seen several stories about companies accepting money and even signing contracts with states and cities and never deploying the services promised, so it probably won't change anything on the money side of this, just the advertising.

If you have any questions, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology). We apologize for the inconvenience. &gt; If anyone is going to plan something bad and doesn't want to get caught - they won't communicate on something that's being monitored

The flipside to that is if they know for certain that it is not being monitored they will use it. So someone could argue that if the government actually stops monitoring the internet it will be used for crime and terrorism. Another possible argument is that denying them the ability to easily communicate is part of the point of monitoring things. I am not saying I support all the spying but this isn't an argument about practicality or effectiveness it is more of a morality thing.  I said customer service, not tech support There's a 0% chance that 45 percent of Americans think that online privacy is more important than national security. The problem with these agencies is that their paycheques (funding) is based on them spending all of their previous funding and having something to show for it. The thing is, if all of these agencies are doing a good job there might not be ANYTHING to show for it and they might not even need to use their entire budget. Under the current paradigm, this would cause budget cuts and job losses so it creates a cycle of onward and upward, and the problem is the only place left to go is our privacy. No I'm a patent attorney.  I don't disagree with you there. There is definitely a better way to address privacy on the internet. Time and resources should be spent more on figuring out what that is, rather than just trying to give the givernments free reign. But with the way it stands now, you can't rely on the fact that it's immoral to violate internet privacy, because the current policies still favor the people. There will ALWAYS be hackers trying to get your data, and the government will always be there to try to obtain the information they need. So does that mean 55% of Americans think National Security is more important than  online privacy?  Seems different when you put it this way. is advertising against subreddit rules ? I think his point was that "if you're preaching the same message for the thousands time to the choir, it's not really news". Which is fair-- this subreddit is very very biased towards certain brands and against others, and generally care less about facts than confirmation to those biases. Equipment for monitoring connections are by no means cheap, and if we know something that companies hate, it is spending money. So I don't think that the ISPs are the biggest concern, if the lousy governments didn't force them into collaborating with them. What does that have to do with anything?

&gt; Why? I much *rather* be safe than keep personal information. Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

Not exchange and very too late software adaptation... So is someone going to step in and explain how this is actually terrible news? Because it seems pretty awesome. Suck my dick, comcast! Couldn't you just as easily say 55 percent of American't don't think Online privacy is more important than national security then and draw the conclusion that we need to increase national security?  Not saying I believe that, just this headline is stupid. Came here for the "experts" In other words, 55 percent believes the Almighty Nation is more important than the basic principles of Freedom.

What was the purpose of forming the USA again? I'm sorry, but I'm far more concerned about security than privacy.  Privacy is extremely important.  One of the most important things.  But it's not in the same universe of importance as security.  Given the choice, this means 45% of people would rather have our nation not be secure so they can feel like the govt isn't reading their shit. Even though they arent, and never will, because you're pointless, meaningless people to them. I also understand that giving up privacy doesn't necessarily mean increased security,  but that's not what the question was.  The way it's phrased, people are saying they'd rather be unsafe, than have someone read meaningless emails they sent to their boss a week ago.  The sample surveyed also indicates a major potential for bias. 

First, because the surveys were only conducted online, it sets forth a bias towards Americans that use the internet regularly. 

Second, because the surveys were conducted by TRUSTe, it sets forth a bias towards internet users who understand, as well as are more attentive to, personal online privacy.  Good point...  Soooooo the majority dont. Silly conspiracy thinking there...if it was profitable, they'd do it. Will this create any meaningful change or will ISP's now just have to call their services something different or just use new buzzwords?
	
"AT&amp;T Super-Speed Premium" or "Comcast Mega-Fast Ultra"!

Wonder when AT&amp;T will be required to offer me better speeds than ~300Kbps..
 Where the fuck do you live? Cameras in all public places?  It might be a false dichotomy, but when asked "What is more important, national security or online privacy?" Obviously national security is more important, no? 

Sure, it is a leading question that implies you need to sacrifice one for the other, when you actually don't, but that doesn't make online privacy more important that national security, does it? Any experts here care to read between the lines? Does this mean NY is leaning either way? (accept or reject) Where does the majority rule?  As if the poor were in control of the rich  This is why I decided not to do collaborative technological development on the internet (which makes it VERY difficult if not impossible)  

They'll get a big hit in the technology industry for doing this.  Sure apple is making record profits, but so is afghani opium.   

 It is easy to just take money from the public than to ask for it Not just profits, but device sales as well. Samsung are literally selling less devices now than in 2013 despite the market expanding.

Smartphone sales in 2013
Samsung: 320M
Apple: 153M

Smartphone sales in Q42014
Samsung: 75M
Apple: 75M

That's quite a big shift. They're getting eaten by Apple in the high-end, Chinese OEMs like Xiaomi/Huawei in the low-end. Kind of interesting that this information is not available on any other major financial news website (at the time of posting this, anyways).  of course they won't.  I don't see water companies providing data on how often each plant reaches max water pumping capacity, or electrical companies providing data on the exact power generated by a plant at every point in the day.

In Britain at one point the electrical infrastructure load balancing was unable to keep up with the spikes in electrical demand because the majority of the country would increase their electrical usage in between television programs.  How could the common person decide that the electrical companies weren't lying?  Did they review huge data files of info for their nearest generator?  No, they just noticed that their lights get dim at exactly 7:00 PM.

http://www.geek.com/news/tea-time-in-britain-causes-predictable-massive-surge-in-electricity-demand-1535023/ "AT&amp;T Super-Speed Premium" or "Comcast Mega-Fast Ultra"!
 So a minority? They should also apply these rules to hosting providers like Godaddy and many others who advertise "Unlimited Bandwidth". In reality, unlimited hosting is always limited. Its like going to an all-you-can-eat buffet. You can eat all-you-can-eat as long as you are not eating too much. For instance BlueHost and Hostmonster will start throttle your account CPU usage once you hit the houses limit (which is extremely low) and Hostgator will shut you down as soon as you exceed certain number of inodes. I don't understand, what are you asserting? So thats less than half.

I'm a big proponent of online privacy, but 45% of people are wrong.  It should require a warrant like them coming into your home. "recently"

\&gt;2005 &gt; Taking his argument against changing the broadband standard into deep space, FCC Commissioner **Michael O'Rielly** said "the report notes that 4K TV requires 25Mbps, but 4K TV is still relatively new and is not expected to be widely adopted for years to come. While the statute directs us to look at advanced capability, this stretches the concept to an untenable extreme. Some people, for example, believe probably incorrectly that we are on a path to interplanetary teleportation. Should we include the estimated bandwidth for that as well?"

Sounds like sponsored opinion, doesn't it? First of all, 25mbps isn't that fast if you look at internet speeds in developed countries. US as the pioneer of the internet should really at least try to catch up.

Second of all, this new standard may very well spur the next wave of innovation. Perhaps the reason why 4K TV "is not expected to be widely adopted for years to come" is precisely because the infrastructure is not ready! Is the FTC like the FCC's big brother they call in when they can't get the bullies to leave them alone? I think reddit is gorgetting it is a small part of a larger online commubity.   One obsessed with social media that does not give a damn about net neutrality.   I would be surprised if more than 10 percent of Americans even knows what net neutrality is. cumcast? Hello!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) if you have any questions or concerns.* I think technology itself is too strong a force for anything else to happen.  The gubt needs hackers to fight other hackers. Then again I also think global surveillance via video-capable micro-drones is inevitable.

 I can only hope that the technology becomes smarter than whoever's controlling it. If it isn't already. Very bottom of http://www.t-mobile.com/simple-choice-international-plans.html
&gt;Network Management:  Service may be slowed, suspended, terminated, or restricted for misuse, abnormal use, interference with our network or ability to provide quality service to other users, or significant roaming.

When I signed up there was also explicit mention of number of GB monthly usage, but it doesn't seem to be there anymore, now it's just this generic statement Meh. As I understand it, the ruling really has nothing to do with throttling, it has to do with advertising.

When you signed up to one of those AT&amp;T unlimited data plans, the fine print said that they would continue charging you the same amount for the same thing on a month-by-month basis indefinitely. As long as you never cancel it or pay your bill late, you get to keep that plan forever. You were "grandfathered in."

AT&amp;T has already stopped advertising unlimited data. So this ruling only affects people who were grandfathered in.

There are other things they could do, as well (and might already be doing):

* Use a term contract. I signed up for a 1-year term, but once my contract is up and my plan converts to month-to-month, they can call me up at any time and tell me my plan is no longer being offered, and so my service will be automatically terminated at the end of the month... if I'd like to renew it, I have to switch to one of their new plans.

* State the throttling rules up front, like satellite providers do. There's nothing inherently wrong with throttling. The problem is when you tell the customer they're getting a certain speed and charge them for it, and then give them a different speed. Even if it's in the fine print that you reserve the right to limit speed based on network availability (which they do), you can't advertise X and give a person Y.

* Start marketing Internet services based on the amount of data, not the speed, just like they do with cellular Internet services. You can throttle all you want if you don't advertise any particular speed. Though this one is more difficult because other providers will still market based on speed. Says an online survey.... The problem isn't that sales aren't growing exponentially.
It's isn't even that they aren't growing.
It's that they're *shrinking*.

Market saturation is only a problem in richer markets like North America, worldwide the smartphone market is still expanding really fast, it's just that Samsung are getting their ass beat in emerging countries. If they make the Note V any bigger they are going to have to put one of these on it.

http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v46/ahelck/TeamLift.jpg How bias can a fact be? Samsung profit is down 62.4%. The end. Too much wear and tear You care more about apple fanboys than apple fanboys care about apple. 


See the irony in that? What do you call an unlimited plan with different speed tiers?  *tiered unlimited*?  Technically, it is unlimited data.  Is the rule that you can't just call your plan "unlimited" with no other descriptors?  I'm not aware of any service that doesn't specify what it is that is unlimited ie "unlimited data".  If you have an unlimited plan with no speed tiers and the network slows down at peak hours, are you now committing fraud because you said it was unlimited speed/data but the speed has now slowed down so clearly it's not the unlimited = always high speed?  Is it ok if you use the dreaded "up to" when describing the speed?

Anyways, if this flies I can see AT&amp;T making a public statement that the FCC is mandating that the company to get rid of all unlimited plans, forcing everyone on the unlimited ones to either get bumped down to a hard cap limit plan or jump up to some new, more expensive plan... and that if they don't want this to happen then they should contact the FCC and let them know. See this is EULA all over again.  It's not going to make any difference to have legal, open, published privacy rules because people can't read these things and understand them.  You need *laws* that make it plain that failing to protect XYZ data comes with criminal penalties.  If we had the same protections in place for personal information that already exist for credit card information, we wouldn't need to bother with reading privacy policies (that nobody reads anyway). ITT: People who think the half a billion of jihadis and islamists aren't a threat worth dealing with.  So a minority? That's awesome! Under AT&amp;T right now i'm grandfathered in to their old "unlimited" plan, but its a very expensive plan to keep that doesn't get much reward.. So now my bill will say $63 per month for 1 Meg internet instead of broadband.  How will this help me? That might be because national security being comprised risks possible terrorist attacks and such....while internet privacy violation exposes how fucked up people really are especially when viewing that browser history. I mean...it's pretty clear which one is more important to protect.  Majority of the money. Capitalist democracy. Pretty much this. I mean, yay for raising the limit and acknowledging the problem, but it's not actually *solving* anything. Companies will just be forced to drop the word "broadband" from any advertising. That amounts to jack all. Just get ready for "turbo", "hi-speed", "super", "boosted" internet. Not that they don't use these types of things already.

It *should* prevent certain handouts from happening where we're subsidizing expansion of broadband, but as you've noted, none of that actually happens anyway. Maybe it will prevent the handouts in the first place, but... probably not.

We're just shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic that is our internet here in the US. If you're generating power, you're doing it by taking power from somewhere. This would just be an expensive way to generate power from internal combustion engines.

You'd be better off building a petrochemical power plant - it would be cheaper, more efficient, and better for the environment. Subvert anything that could threaten the important people in power.  Just as those items of the past I listed.  Seriously, go look those up on Wikipedia.  They aren't secrets anymore.  Then imagine how much more effective they would be with this level of detail on everyone without all the manual effort.

Heck, even just imagine if you knew all this information about everyone around you in life, everyone they know, and everyone they know.  You know everywhere they carry their cell phone, everything they purchase with cash, every bit of electronic media consumed, every electronic communication made.  Heck, if you have a smart TV, everything you watch too.  I know I could easily manipulate those around me to my advantage without anyone knowing.  And that's even with no nefarious goal other than improving my personal situation.  I'm sure I could leak all kinds of horrible private information if I wanted to. Just because someone values security more than privacy doesn't mean they don't value privacy.  not hard to just remove the word broadband and replace it with something equally misleading while not bothering to improve their speeds at all. Unless the plan has vicious data caps, then they are sure to make sure you burn through your cap as fast as possible at lightning speed. Samsung sells phones on a scale that if they really took some chances they could shake things up. Imagine if they found a way to make the phone of a Galaxy flagship phone out of carbon fiber. I think it would be the first CF consumer product made on that scale out of purely automated methods.

I'm not saying there aren't significant challenges to this, but it would solve the "feeling premium" issues because of the inherently inflexible CF is.  That would mean that literally 0% found it equally important. Why? I thought we were all moving to html5 video... Man it would really suck if people were able to tell exactly where I was at any moment. Did they forge the letters or just write them and then have the Congress members sign them?  One sounds illegal and the other sounds like something that probably happens all the time (Congressmen and women not coming up with every word they utter or put to page). &gt;It's the duty of every business to ~~serve their customers and~~ protect their revenue streams.

A business doesn't need to give a shit about its customers when it is making money. The issue is that police departments have judicial power that corporations don't, therefor they should not be allowed to act this way. It'll make for some nice sound bites for those that do not throttle, but not much else.  Unlimited will just change to something with some wiggle room, like "Total" internet.  The Galaxy S line peaked at S3, and on cheaper mobiles there's just too much competition. I'm honestly glad to see people aren't buying those phones just because they're new (except that there's nothing new in them).
  
Now what shocks me is that the same could be said of Apple - they haven't produced anything interesting or innovative in years - and I believe they just had record profits. I was saying the original contract is up, you've chosen to renew multiple times now so you're clearly happy with the service and there is no alternative. The parent was saying it as if you guys are stuck in a long term contract that you cannot get out of and that this gives you an opportunity to cancel, and it does (or may anyway), but I see no more incentive to cancel than you had the last ~10 times you've renewed it now.  I think that for most, the larger screen was a determining factor to sales more than any performance increase. Meh. As I understand it, the ruling really has nothing to do with throttling, it has to do with advertising.

When you signed up to one of those AT&amp;T unlimited data plans, the fine print said that they would continue charging you the same amount for the same thing on a month-by-month basis indefinitely. As long as you never cancel it or pay your bill late, you get to keep that plan forever. You were "grandfathered in."

AT&amp;T has already stopped advertising unlimited data. So this ruling only affects people who were grandfathered in.

There are other things they could do, as well (and might already be doing):

* Use a term contract. I signed up for a 1-year term, but once my contract is up and my plan converts to month-to-month, they can call me up at any time and tell me my plan is no longer being offered, and so my service will be automatically terminated at the end of the month... if I'd like to renew it, I have to switch to one of their new plans. So it's impossible for me to be grandfathered in to any plan.

* State the throttling rules up front, like satellite providers do. There's nothing inherently wrong with throttling. Even if it's in the fine print that you reserve the right to limit speed based on network availability (which they do), you can't advertise X and give a person Y. But you can advertise Y and give a person Y.

* Start marketing Internet services based on the amount of data, not the speed. It's what cellular Internet services do. You can throttle all you want if you don't advertise any particular speed. Though this one is more difficult because other providers will still market based on speed. Even better idea: Build miniature coal plants on top of parking lots! He might be referring to land lines. And he's still probably wrong. That's because the biggest threat to national security is the politicians and corporations who control the country. For telephone numbers, Time put it at 41%:  

* http://time.com/2966515/landline-phones-cell-phones/  

For internet numbers, the Census put it at 71%:  

* http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p20-569.pdf Wouldn't it be?  I mean, not exclusively used for child porn but it would be the perfect browser for someone trying to get it, right? to play devil's advocate, the app would only make people obey the speed limit when they are near a police officer, they would still speed before and after that point. Extremely shitty That's true some people are cowards I'm not talking about that, i'm just pointing out the link. I use neither samsung nor apple so i don't really care what they do. The way I see it, they are going to run each other into the ground. Alright, but they are working for an organization that is in opposition of those apps, and are the ones manning these speed traps, so it hardly matters what they think. I began to write a personal anecdote about this but I then thought about all the high level problems, Hollywood types, getting their identities and personally identifiable material stolen.  Sometime its going to get that industry into the fray, and then the shit is really going to hit the fan.  Its that demographic which it seems a majority of the public associates as the voice of the culture. i thought it was overthrown on a free speech issue, that flashing your lights was a form of communication and that the driver has the right to communicate with another driver and that their right to speech trumps the polices duty to catch people speeding. I was looking up info on Google Fiber.  Technically, their free option isn't even broadband. so what short term changes can we see because of this?  can i call up my provider and demand at least 25Mbps? or are they going to come out with a new internet package called sub-broadband and change my current plan's name to the sub-broadband package, forcing me to upgrade and pay more for actual broadband. I got speeds better than that on AT&amp;T DSL like 7 years back... I fully expect that it would be, but that won't stop Comcast lawyers from threatening with legal action anyway. The author of the program might not be so dedicated to the joke that they are willing to shell out thousands of dollars defending it on the chance that it will get thrown out. Yeah, exactly. I don't disagree with you. But I'm just trying to be realistic about the implications of such a weak statistic.  I don't disagree with your point there, but that's not what you said. Or you really need to have worded it very differently if that was really what you wanted to convey across. Like how you worded it now. Not presuming someone can already break the contract cause their contract is up. That reads like you are just assuming that if some one has unlimited their contract is up. 

And yes, I personally am quite happy with what AT&amp;T gives me. I can't get a better deal elsewhere. Though if they make me get rid of it, T-mobile has the next best thing (but I can't afford the 5 gb plan where as for a cheaper price I get 5 gb plus no overage fee on AT&amp;T and I don't really care that they word it in a way some people think is misleading. Personally I actually agree with AT&amp;T, if they aren't charging you overage, they are giving you unlimited (they didn't say unlimited LTE or unlimited 3G). 45 Percent of Americans watch porn on the internet. Quite the passing. I can't imagine a world without lasers. Plain and simple, we get honeydicked by all of them. Not only is the title wrong, but I'd also like to address something: I'd rather be safe from having my house blown up then be able to keep my favorite flavor of ice cream secret from the government.

Online privacy is very important. I also believe that it's important to achieve national security in ways that are minimally invasive to personal privacy, and that the US is capable of maintaining national security without violating the rights of online privacy.

So while I believe both are important, and that they are not mutually exclusive, I'm sorry reddit, but national security is more important. Your privacy doesn't mean shit if the government that exists to protect it has been destroyed. Can someone try to convince me why I should care what companies do with my online data? Because right now, I couldn't care less They'll just call it high-speed and charge the same.

I pay $70 for 30/3 Something tells me companies are going to play the name game.  But thankfully, most customers (non technical people) associate the word "Broadband" with the word "fast".  So if customers have the option, they will go for the one named "broadband".  This may come with a price increase, but at least the higher demand for better speeds may change the way companies operate IMO Instead they are ditching Qualcomm processors for an in-house model which you can expect to be inferior. The new Galaxy could be pretty weak http://nion.modprobe.de/bimg/security-fence.jpg Sure it is. First law of thermodynamics. It isn't usable (yet) because we haven't figure out a way to capture it and use it some other way.

Any heat is energy. Call me an optimist, but anything is possible, and limited to only our current understanding of how the universe works, materials available, and how much lobbyists on Capitol Hill spend to combat advancement of human knowledge.

Let the Downvotes commence, I can take it. The survey implies that 45% think privacy is AS important as national security, not MORE as the title falsely suggests. That word alone makes a huge difference.  not ALL yet.  But check out Athens GA,  The entirety of the downtown area is covered by cameras. The quote still applies.  If we start letting go of liberties, for security, then we will lose our liberties bit by bit, until they are gone, then we will have no security. Not surprised. I'm selfish, maybe you are too! The text of the bill doesn't make any such claims, you didn't even read it. But why should I really be concerned about any of that? Does it REALLY an actual harm to me?  &gt; ANYONE WHO LIKES THINGS I DONT IS WRONG For good measure, here's Q4 2013 as well:

Samsung: 86M, Apple: 51M Competition is good, but everything about Samsung's software and hardware design feels mediocre and cobbled together. In a more just world companies like HTC, Sony and LG would be dominating the Android market since they've actually put thought into their devices  [They've been doomed since 2001.](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=500) Are these numbers inaccurate? 

[Source 1](http://www.netindex.com/download/allcountries/) : [Source 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds)

I always knew South Korea was the fastest but I figured for a pretty big country the US wasn't too bad. It could always be better but the way some people complain its like they are running on dial up. 

And maybe I have a different definition of World Class. When you say  world class to me you are saying the class of the world, or the best.  I've heard arguments that certain people don't really value privacy in the first place. It's a rather collectivist argument, but has value. It didn't need to be; native iOS apps already outperform Android ones on phones with twice the specs. Their Metal graphics tech is like [nothing ever seen before](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id915975445) on mobiles. The 6 just had what everyone had been ask for since forever: bigger screens, and [a hella sweet camera](http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/18/6339583/iphone-6-and-6-plus-camera-test-iceland) on the Plus.  Pretty much. Just like Verizon tells you that "high speed internet" is available at your address but it's just DSL. So who got that 62% of the market?

Apple? Microsoft? etc.? This can stop the TWC-Comcast merger. Less populated areas will have fewer "broadband" options which will make the deal look more like a monopoly than it already is.  http://www.anandtech.com/show/8613/the-samsung-galaxy-note-4-review/7

http://www.anandtech.com/show/8613/the-samsung-galaxy-note-4-review/8 I am extremely, *and I mean EXTREMELY*, skeptical that half the nation believes online privacy is a more important issue than national security.

This is probably an extremely flawed poll. The article says they wrote them as "suggestions," more or less, and it was up to the legislator to approve everything in it. The implication is that they are being lobbied, and their work is being done for them, and they don't care to actually perform their job, which is to act in the interest of the public. In other words, they're way too fucking lazy and corrupted by lobby money to do anything other than stamp it and send it on through.  Cool to see what's next, as article suggests This can stop the TWC-Comcast merger. Less populated areas will have fewer "broadband" options which will make the deal look more like a monopoly than it already is.
 and so what? a play gym could be their best friend too. ban all play gyms! I think we all expect problems. Like deleting your mail if you haven't logged in in awhile. I call it GhettoMail. How many people were surveyed?

I hate statistics, nothing but a lie. Hopefully it will help net neutrality/competition going forward since Comcast can no longer say that all of their customers have broadband internet. When house shopping, AT&amp;T promised that the house i was looking at could get 20+Mbps. 

After I bought my home they said "[Sorry, the best we can offer is 768Kbps!](http://imgur.com/hQ7hKnm)".  [Which in reality averages about 300Kbps.](http://imgur.com/3xaBgHj) Is anyone else bothered by this statistic? Everything you said there was wrong. The Note 4 performs worse than either the 6 or 6+ and yet costs more.

http://www.anandtech.com/show/8613/the-samsung-galaxy-note-4-review/7

http://www.anandtech.com/show/8613/the-samsung-galaxy-note-4-review/8 That's true, but it may give some users a sense of security when they don't see police officers nearby on the map and give them confidence to drive more recklessly in those areas.  That's for landlines only. A lot of polling places are including cell phone numbers in their polls now. I'd bet anyone with an internet connection also has either a landline or a cell phone. Bad headline - from the original website;   article says 25/3 repeatedly. 
Thanks, OP !  In the end. I don't feel secure having my privacy intruded on. Makes me want to snatch up a grandfathered unlimited plan before they jump in price if they can't throttle the shit out of people anymore The real kicker is they aren't doing it for national security.. it's about control.  Not unlike the censorship laws passed in England.. for the children. I think it's more likely that 55% of people didn't have a better option in the survey.  It's not that privacy is more important than national security.  It's that if national security necessarily involves secrecy, so if we always give in when those words are used together then it makes everything permissible.  There doesn't seem to be any limit to what government can get away with if they just utter those magical free pass words. I bay 5$/month for my unlimited Dial-Up and 600MiB of 50Mbps H+ \^_^ That's brilliant! haha (But I hope they don't) Realistically what would they manipulate me to do, and why would they take the time to do that to some average Joe? I think natl security is more important, but that's just because if they really wanted my information theyre gonna get it. And that's that. It seems like people think that when online privacy comes into question it's like there's a department finding every little thing about people, logging it down, and watching them for the rest of there lives, rather than just having the ability to do it. Nothing can guarantee the loss of any privacy you have on the internet quite like letting the government regulate the entire industry. thats all people do when police are around anyways, if anything this keeps people from jamming on brakes because the saw the cop at the last minute. FCC to telcos: I have altered the definition of broadband internet; p(r)ay I do not alter it further. No, M is 10^6, while Mi is 2^12 ;) BWHAHAHAHAHA, like this shit is ever gonna happen.  We're consistently moving towards a complete fascist government.   &gt; The research was commissioned by TRUSTe, the leading data privacy management company

Right there is your inherent source of bias.
 I think you were downvoted because people don't like the idea that the police are serving and protecting the state... not that you're wrong. Stopped reading after the first sentence.

Why are you still here? Would love a demographic breakdown of this poll.  I feel like a lot of older Americans would value national security over online privacy, as they grew up during Cold War paranoia and they don't see the Internet as important as younger Americans.

It's just an assumption on my part, and while I don't agree with those that think that way, it's important to try to understand where they're coming from. In my opinion, everyone should be Abel to check financial records of everyone. That way people/businesses can't hide money or spend it in shady ways. Every dollar should be accounted for. Again just a broke (21m) landscapers opinion. &gt;Please explain what they could take from me that makes my life a living hell? And people will believe it. Most Americans are completely clueless about computers and the internet. They have no clue how things work and operate, therefore they are easy to convince that the trade off is necessary.Even though they've been spying for about 10 years now and have yet to stop an attack due to online screening.How would we know if they had? Because the NSA would be the first to immediately go on record saying so in order to promote their stance and drive home their message. We have yet to hear any of this, that's because its bullshit. Well I think 45% of Americans are uneducated ignorant fools living in a comic book fantasy world. &gt; Bottom line, if you're worried about the privacy of something, don't put it on the internet. 

That's great advice for 10 years ago or so, but the problem with today's software/operating systems/etc is that there is so much "cloud integration" built in, the average user isn't really sure of what they are putting on the internet, and what they are keeping local. BGR makes clickbait titles specifically for reddit, good luck getting people around here to not upvote them. Small towns with limited tax bases often turn to ticket collection as a substantial revenue source. They'll set arbitrarily low speed limits "for safety reasons" and have the town's entire complement of cruisers camped out jealously enforcing the limits and running a ticket mill for +5mph offenders. You see this all the time all over the country, but in my experience this is especially prevalent in the southeast. Does anybody have any doubts that China won't turn around and give the source code to their own state owned companies? By the looks of it, Apple. They just posted profits of $18 Billion iirc. The highest ever profits posted by any company in the world iirc. Did I say anope is a problem? No, I didn't. How do we find out who voted against it? Number 8 will make you shiver http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31033639 How do we find out who voted against it? For fun. Also, orange envelope in upper right corner of the screen. About time! I just returned to the USA in Sept. after living in Germany for the last 10 years. So far my experience since my return has been somewhat startling and not limited to online privacy or I should say the lack thereof here in the U.S. The lack of privacy also isn't necessarily limited to online activities either. Some of the things that I've encountered since my return would cause the average German citizen to absolutely lose their shit.  
  
Although not entirely unexpected because I was born and raised in the U.S. and lived here post-9/11 up until 2004, I'm already sick and tired of hearing news anchors, politicians, police, etc. etc. playing the terrorist/security card. Thank you Mr. Cheney and Co. for ruining the American mindset for the foreseeable future. More of a sample program offered to people that don't think they need Internet. Essentially perfect for apartment complexes. You can move in with free Internet then choose to upgrade later which is how I've seen it being offered. (I went with gbps, but I know a few older people probably just got the free package). Number 8 will send shivers down your vertibrae &gt; Great just what the world needs, another freaking MP3 player. Go Steve! Where's the Newton?!

Hahaha Ok so knowing this and knowing that they backdoor all the hardware and strong-arm the companies that resist... What are some REAL things the average person can do to secure their traffic?  Bullies everywhere have discovered that if you want an unlimited free pass to bully people, just join the police force. I think it's more likely that 55% of people didn't have a better option in the survey.  It's not that privacy is more important than national security.  It's that national security necessarily involves secrecy, so if we always give in when those words are used together then it makes everything permissible.  There doesn't seem to be any limit to what government can get away with if they just utter those magical free pass words.

"Oh, you want all of my firstborn child's blood for national security?  Well, I guess I'm just not allowed to tell you no."

If nobody trusts that "national security" isn't just a tactic to poison the well -- a way to a priori insult anybody who disagrees with you -- then that itself is a threat to national security.  Revisit the story of the boy who cried, "Wolf!"  One day, there will be a serious threat to national security, it will have to be handled with secrecy, it will involve heavy sacrifices, and nobody will be willing to permit it because the phrase will have been abused so often, for such a long time.

I'd say that failing to understand something that basic is pretty stupid, but hey, if you want to believe that 55% *actually don't care if they're blown up or something* then I guess you can make that leap.  Just don't expect anybody reasonable to follow you there.  

Some people require more than a politician with a plastic grin speaking through their teeth like a sleazy used car (lemon) salesman to say, "Trust us.  Just trust us."  Some people require more solid reasoning than simply being yelled at by some pundit.  Some people laugh in the face of fear, and can't be terrorized into complacency by spooky news channel horror porn. Reddit on mobile sucks haha. They could find out your political views, and then put you on a terrorist watchlist, a no-fly list, or simply keep their eyes on you so that they can nab you for every single little crime you do (and there are so many laws that it's effectively impossible to not commit any crimes).

It's the reason why making everyone guilty of a crime but selecting who you punish - you simply punish the ones who disagree with or work against you.

Did you say you can sympathize with Occupy Wallstreet? Bam, you supported an organization under terrorist surveillance. Did you ever visit 4chan? Part of anonymous, a "domestic terrorist" organisation.

That's what "enemies foreign and domestic" mean.

In the end, if you really are curious, I would suggest you look up Stasi and East Germany, or the KGB, to find out [what happens](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/berlin-wall-east-germans-lived-in-fear-under-stasi-surveillance-1.2829038) when a state/politicians gain too much ability to watch its citizens.

You don't trust these people to not take bribes, why would you trust them to not get the police, the post office, flight, internet, your boss, your landlord or anyone they can influence to fuck with you if you become annoying to them?

(And even if you do nothing to annoy them, recall that you will at least want some ELSE to stand up for YOU when they do something hilarious corrupt with the tax-money you paid - if they can nab anyone that complains, noone can stand up without immediately being cut down to size) People aren't upgrading as often when they realized that paying $650 for a phone is absurd. The GS3 is still a good phone and probably sufficient through 2015. Midrange devices are becoming incredibly affordable. The secondary market for android is very vibrant too. 
 Thanks for all the links! Recently, I have been thinking more and more in terms of should I trust anyone/company online with my data. Its not the most important data in the world, but should I be concerned that Google now knows EVERYTHING about me? Who my relations are. Where I stand on regarding important issues. What time of the day I usually wake up and goto sleep. Etc. Etc.

So called user tracking where a division like the NSA has at its fingertips the tools to quickly pull out a ridiculously detailed report on mostly anyone. 

And from there on, you could, really, only imagine the potential use/misuse of that information. And this nightmare has its starting point in our very palms. In the very devices that promised us an altered future utopia of seamless communication/interaction. 

I identify these bottlenecks to be the services we use most, like Google, or Apple. These companies exert their monopolies and stop smaller companies from giving them competition. They actually stifle innovation while ironically claiming to be promoting it. 

I think it is time to declare something as basic as a web search engine and its data to be in the public realm. Or any other service really, like dropbox, or email, or other communications.

The privatization of the internet is benefiting a very select few while hurting the vast majority of people on it. 

 It's to point out that it's an illusion that you need to pick between being safe and keeping personal information. I've never participated in a political poll in my life, and neither have my friends, so where do these numbers come from? I like these results, but where do they get these figures? So is the Chinese government accomplishing, by law, what NSA has probably done by using payments and bribes to vendors? Actually there's an alarming amount of people who are under the assumption, "Well I got nothing to hide so I don't care!" not knowing how naive that is to say. I guess you are right. Most of my aggression is coming from my hate of utility companies. I complained about my water bill to the company and disputed a fee they were charging me. They told me, "I mean you have to pay your bill, where else will you get your water?"  They don't collaborate with Waze because, despite what they say in public, reducing traffics deaths is not actually their primary intent. &gt;&gt; more transparency from companies is key to reducing concern


How can you close the Pandora Box? Mac reporting in; FireFox is fine and Chrome a bit slower. Flash anything sucks the CPU into the nether gates of Hell.

I can render a 3D animation and use less processor. Right. Highly unlikely, but possible.

The title should read: "45 Percent of Americans think online privacy is as important or more important than national security."  Maybe officers should stop driving clearly marked vehicles, and those flashing lights also offer a slight hint. Breaking news should be stopped because an officer might be spotted, and let's put those stingrays to good use and arrest anyone that mentions a cop within a mile of one. HP was a company where it really depended on what team you got into. Some people had chill positions, and some wanted to tear their hair out. I'm not 100% certain, but I think they can even still call it broadband. The FCC just changed what it consider broadband for it's annual broadband report.  Makes more sense to who?  Certainly not to a local government who's always looking for an extra source of revenue.   I would suggest that our right to privacy is a key element to our security as a functioning democracy. this is a good point. If we can make a talking point saying TWC and Comcast only offer Broadband in, say, 20% of markets it will make it sound much worse. I'm not in the least bit concerned by terrorist attacks.  9/11 would have been prevented if our government wanted to prevent it.  They knew it was coming and they've been profiting ever sense. 

Supporters of forfeiting privacy should push for a bill that would ONLY incriminate acts of terrorism, if that's what they claim their agenda to be.  But even that presents issues since terrorism is such a loosely defined term.   &gt; think

Irrelevant. Are you ready to kill and die for your beliefs? If no, nobody is going to give a shit. Well of course the 1% wouldn't give all their money to them. They are smarter than that. They only give them enough that they keep coming back. 

For instance, the thugs in organized crime who do all the dirty work are not the ones rolling in it. $350 for 23 in a 20. 

No blood was shed that day. Good work, boys.  The problem is that monitoring the internet is different than TV or radio. Those are broadcasted in their entirety to the world, while much of the internet is private information.

If the FCC is to regulate the internet, then they're going to have and excuse to monitor it, which I don't like. They also may allow throttling of people they don't like. Say Fox News, for example. If Comcast throttles them... Maybe they'll let it slide.

The way to ensure an open internet is accountable ISPs, which is only achievable if they're relatively small, not huge giants who cannot fall. I think it's awesome that likeminded people will go to the trouble of emphasizing this point, but what you're missing is that maybe those in charge know this already, and their motives are not in our best interest. 

Before people go saying 'tinfoil hat' nonsense, remember that until snowden and other NSA leaks, people who said that the government monitors our emails and the like were hailed as lunatics.

I think people need to start fully acknowledging the fact that the people in charge are not your allies.  This is frustrating because it takes away consumer choice and hurts peoples' feelings. What if consumers _want_ to pay more money for 4mb/s service and still have it be called "broadband"? Think about how they will feel to now be subscribing to "not broadband."

This is also a slap in the face to the cable industry, who has spent so much taxpayer money ~~rolling out fiber across the country~~. Municipal regulations and local monopolies make it very difficult for them to increase the speed and still turn a profit.

What we are really talking about here is Obama regulating our Internets and regulations are bad, unless they restrict broadband competition in local markets. Interstate truck drivers can tell you a lot of stories like this.  My dad used to be one, and would not go on certain highways in certain places because the local law enforcement was so corrupt about this.   And 95% out of this population will do shit about it, 4% will sign an obscure online petition hoping for change, 0.7% will find a petition that actually means something, and the remainder will actively protest and try to get others on board just to be ridiculed and ostrasized. You don't have to release "interesting" or ground breaking phones each year.

They are businesses masquerading as people for the benefits without the drawbacks. You want to vote on people to elect, laws to be changed? Sure! You just have to have the federal income tax used on your yearly revenues as if the corporation was person. So let's see, out of making $24,000 in 2011, the government took approximately $5000 dollars. That's about 18% of my earnings for that year. So...., what is 18% of 10 billion dollars(At&amp;t's earnings for 2011)? 1.8 Billion. Now if that was done for every corporation who earned revenue from the U.S, we could fund schools and roads and space exploration. And then they could have a voice.  I don't doubt that. But don't most people get their phone on contract? I know they do in the UK. Market saturation?

Samsung has been making good enough phones basically. I hate the touchwiz bloat but Cyanogen helped with that quite a bit.  I have for years had a Note(1) that has been serving my mobile phone needs so completely that nothing about it feels restrictive or outdated or worth upgrading for. I know people talk about 2K and 4K screens on these dumb little pocket things but I can barely see the pixels on this model which has a gorgeous AMOLED display with only a paltry 1280x800 pixels. It's plenty fast enough for the apps I use. It runs a fast enough tether for HD video streaming on my laptop. It has replaceable batteries. On a long business trip I arrive after a flight with a day and a half of phone power.

The only reason I could see for getting a newer model, is NFC. And I'm holding out with that until payment systems mature and settle on something that is available everywhere, and doesn't only work on iPhone.

Supposing some new indoor positioning technology comes about that helps home automation applications, I'd upgrade to get the requisite transponder / sensor.  In order to get certain money from the govnt., to upgrade their network or lay new cables, they have to provide broadband (usually to the entire region they are taking money for).  Then maybe it's important to educate the average user as to what the risks are for using cloud based stoarage. ok so they start selling it as "Highspeed" or "Uberhigh", not helping the consumer much here... now if they would define as a utility and then set tier names 25+ Broadband, 50+ Uberband, 100+ Godmode...now maybe it would work Everyone's got something to hide. Most people just don't remember that they do. The Fry's next to my house has these set up. I think it's great, and looks pretty cool. I'm kind of fine with this.  But we're going to have to have a term for something faster so that broadband can become the new 'modem' ...  Castcom? But happens if they just start charging more for different bands of speed and throttling. It just becomes more transparent but they are able to offer higher prices for essentially the same service but at scaling payment plans. Would more people really want to get the least data at the slowest speed or would they want the fastest and unlimited deal at a much higher price? Airgapped has only ever been about digital security. This is another form of phyisical attack that has been around as long as electronics. 

Tempest and Van Eck are both examples of utilising leaked transmission from computers. It's not that kind of democratic society and is not supposed to be, but rather is a representative democratic republic. Do you have a source or are you using the same source as the article? As I stated above, it will do 150 Mbps at 3000 ft (~1000m). Or we should find a way to save money on the elicit spending that's out there already. Constantly raising taxes isn't the way. Oh no, say it ain't so Jim. You mean something is causing motorists to obay the law? Not dead. Just lost coherence. &gt; "45 Percent of Americans think online privacy is at least as important as national security."

If you have any questions, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology). We apologize for the inconvenience. I think you are still drastically underestimating how complex intelligence is.  Hmm, 60 is reasonable, but 120 would make gaming unplayable. At least those delays would make average home users fine though so hopefully it'l force the ISPS to actually compete and be better. You give them too much credit!  Even a lot of the 45% are stupid, even though they're right on this issue ;) Therein lies the problem. Speed traps should be about protecting the populace, and tickets should only be seen as supplemental, rather than necessary, income. Just like how they want unwarranted access to all cell phones belonging to *potential* law-breakers, but the second you request that all cops wear cameras, they dig their heels in and say that's un-American or some bullshit Without privacy; security is a farce.

Any agency that can spy on everyone and is unaccountable, will eventually become corrupt up to their power to CYA. First it will be a few mess ups that get covered with "national security" blanket. Then it will be someone making a buck. Then it will be covering up for someone making a buck. Eventually "national security" is whatever is good for whomever is in charge of the 3 letter agency. THEN it's realized that the best way for them to increase their power and financing is for more threats to occur. False flags are inevitable without transparency.

I think we've already been here for a while, and I look at the FBI having prior relationships with homeless men in Florida who plan on blowing up something in another state as prima facia evidence that nobody in the FBI gives a crap as long as they can pretend to fight the "terrorist."

It's a meaningless term. The School of the Americas trains people to commit acts of terror in Latin America to preserve corporate profits. Our military cluster bombs are more effective and deadly than any of these poor man WMDs we make a fuss over.

Not having privacy AND a corrupt political system means the NSA or other agency can have leverage over the politician. Petraeus was a douche bag yes man for the military for years, and then he doesn't give up the President on Benghazi and SUDDENLY they find out about his two mistresses. And at least one if not both of these ladies are agents, likely Mossad. 

It's so pathetic and obvious -- that's the really annoying thing. The excuses we heard about torture, and the excuses to brand all whistleblowers as tin-foil-hat. At every step -- every one, they were lying. And it's as bad as we can imagine, because they spend all day trying to imagine for ways to get more power -- they obviously aren't afflicted with any notion that Democracy and Integrity and believing in the Constitution is what makes America great.

What makes America safe is treating everyone who comes here as a neighbor, with respect and love. You are safe as long as your Muslim friends have a stake in America. The moment we start turning each other in and spending more money on security than we do education -- that's the moment that we lose hearts and minds in America.

We already lost hearts and minds around the world and so we have a Trillion Dollar military to make up for that. If we lose it here -- there aren't enough bullets to "secure" a damn thing.

Bullet proof guards and gated communities are the future if we live in a "Security State". [source](http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-finds-us-broadband-deployment-not-keeping-pace)

Redditor editorialized headlines aside, the opposite of this actually happened at that meeting and press conference. Obama agreed that it was a problem for law enforcement when getting a warrant could be defeated by widely available encryption, but also acknowledged the individual liberty issues with any attempts to address it. The actual news from the Cameron meeting was that Obama didn't sign on to Cameron's proposals:

Obama seems to be have been intentionally vague and noncommittal when it comes to Cameron's specific proposals.  

The Guardian's Alan Travis:

https://twitter.com/alantravis40/status/556159663331627009

&gt;Obama says it is useful to have civil libertarians 'tapping us on the shoulder' and reminding us there are values at stake as well

 Clearly you can't wear a bike helmet AND cover your genitals at the same time, stupid.

:-) &gt;Here's my challenge to you: Unlike a typical redditor, actually fucking think about this instead of just jerking off by clicking an arrow.

You know, I never even indicated that I disagree with you, yet there you are, a reddit martyr in full, righteous action. Nice work. It's funny, I hadn't even considered downvoting you until you began this line of ridiculous grandstanding. You should probably rethink this approach. Logs and monitoring are one thing, but you didn't need to read people's Word documents and emails to keep them safe.  Please don't equate the two.  That's how the NSA tries to trick people, with false equivalencies to make them look bad if they disagree. And interestingly enough, that actually is the choice.  And then we count on agents of those industries to set the policy. Money from speeding tickets will become inconsequential since they can now pull you over for ANY reason and seize any cash you have even if you were not breaking any laws. I believe the issue is that there is not a lot of profit in those markets. Apple's never tried to be the leader in marketshare, they just (claim) to make the products that they themselves want to use. Since they don't want to use cheap low end devices, they choose not to make them. The thing I don't like is the upload speed. I think this is an intentional bottleneck we shouldn't be OK with it Apple's numbers could be a one time thing - they held out very long on the large iphone(which has proven very attractive), and that's a huge part of the numbers. They couldn't sustain such demand. Is that not normal outside of the UK? National Security is not even on my "list" of concerns and never will be.

When someone "invades" our soil I will be first in line with my gun to serve.

till then. Stay the fuck off my rights. The main concern of the state is to gain additional power.  All of these other things are just symptoms of that. It won't. but, the theory goes, if you don't know when or where a cop will be you must act as though a cop could be anywhere, and so you will drive more carefully. the empirical evidence seems to bare this out, if the police are to be believed on this. though one's anecdotal evidence may say otherwise. If you dont like it, just stop buying it. Yeah, they create these powerful devices only to run their shitty, non-removable bloatware. or "Don't bother reading this as it doesn't even matter" Really wondering how accurate these surveys are, all the time I see on Reddit results of polls about americans having an opinion on a certain thing then they go on and vote for people who actively support opposing interests  It's posts like this when I realize I am lucky. I have two cable options and a DSL option. Soon, I will have a fiber option. I pay a flat 29.99 for 25/6 (it is usually 30/6). 1Gb/s will cost 49 when I get that. America is Secure only so long as we treat everyone who comes here as a neighbor, with respect and love. 

Anything that jeopardizes trust, transparency and opportunity for all is a threat to "the American Way".

I fear the internal Security State far more than Chinese weapons. We can only be brought down from within. We can be sold off by the Oligarchy, we can be betrayed by petty mean preaching fear, and we can sell each other out for a loaf of bread and a hope of safety. "Ask". T-Mobile already works similar to this and I have no issues with it. A lot of the utility value of the internet is simply the ability to communicate *something* - even a short message or update - to any place in the world at little or no cost.

I like my netflix and will give up house of cards when they pry it from my cold dead fingers, but it's important to remember the value of a communication network isn't necesarily how big a pile of stuff you can move from one place to another, but just the fact that you can, and it doesn't cost anything ^^While ^^you ^^still ^^can... Not sure if that's really different definitions, or just different forms/areas of security. Don't bother with idmfk I was really confused by your title thinking it was between 3-25 mbps. Then I read the article and it said the same. I get it now though 25 mbps download bandwidth and 3 mbps upload bandwidth I'd probably have a straight up fucking heart attack if I was ever handed a ticket for that. I found out about my 'unlimited' data plan's limits during hurricane sandy when I had the temerity to watch a lot of streamed video via my phone. I'm not talking about arbitrary processor benchmarks.  I'm talking about the technology in the phone as a whole.  When you consider the camera, screen, processor, the Note's Stylus, etc.  The Note 4 has many parts that make up the whole that are quite a bit more advanced than anything Apple offers. I really liked this post. 

Just, next time, try to tone down the insults. They tend to detract from the message and the 'trust' in the writer. You may think that the message is more important than the tone, but if your idea is to reach as many people as possible, then you have to take it into consideration.

Keep fighting the good fight and all that cheesy stuff.  &gt; You know, I never even indicated that I disagree with you, let alone indicating that I disagree enough to downvote you, yet there you are, a reddit martyr in full, righteous indignation mode. Nice work.

Taking the time to write that says exactly the opposite of the words involved.  Maybe I wasn't addressing you specifically.  Maybe there are other people on this page.  Maybe that applies to you only if it actually applies to you.

&gt;It's funny, I hadn't even considered downvoting you until you began this line of ridiculous grandstanding. You should probably rethink this approach, because you had a really good point until you started foaming at the mouth.

No, I shouldn't.  That shit happens on this website non-damn-stop.  It's one thing when it happens regarding baloney that doesn't matter, or topics that will matter the most at some indeterminate point in the future.  It's an altogether different matter when it is important for people to think about right now.

And by the way, I don't mind being disagreed with.  I just lose faith in humanity when a website mostly full of grown ass adults often demonstrates a 14 year old mentality by refusing to think about anything that doesn't jerk their circle. I would say it's the investors. There a lot of money to be made when the Apple stock dips because of lower then expected speculation. There also A lot of money to be made to be made if you say the I-phone is the best only phone you should ever think of buying with "masses" marketing.  the law doesnt apply to everyone. it can be selective.  Fucking Pai I was exaggerating but I don't know of a DSL standard that hits 150Mbps at a klick on a single pair. ADSL2++ hits 24 down, but likely won't at a klick. I think that American citizens generally speaking, aside from the parasites who abuse entitlement programs, have been increasingly dissatisfied with their government for a number of years.  The reasons for this are that America has been on the decline in the rankings of nations in education and other areas even though tax rates continue to rise, our government has meddled in the affairs of other countries (CIA) for decades and the country's reputation has been lost, the family unit has been ruined, government micromanagement in our lives is ever increasing, etc..  I believe that the men behind the scenes, those in control of Congress, began to notice most Americans' discontent, and were concerned that a much needed Second American Revolution might come sooner than later.  Therefore, the men behind the scenes told their minions in government, Dick Cheney would be one, to let the 9/11 attacks occur so that all of these surveillance measures could be put into place.  The military industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned us about 54 years ago in his farewell speech was all to happy to comply with fighting wars on the other side of the planet that the country couldn't afford.  And now we have the security industry, fear mongers at best, sucking hundreds of billions of dollars out of America's budget to fight "terrorism" all over, and saving emails, and phone calls, and photographing license plates, and and and.... Too late Privacy is of little concern when an investigation is taking place. 

This preemptive shit, however, doesn't work. Too many false positives.  If the politicians had to write their own letters it would expose how little they actually know about what it is that they are supporting.  Not that it would affect anything, since half of the voters have no knowledge about the issues either.... Which makes it not censorship? I'm not even sure what you are arguing here? We are constantly fed false dilemmas like these. National Security has NOTHING to do with internal spying -- national security is affected by whether all the citizens around you have a stake and hope in the future of this country. We only need fear people with too much power and people with nothing to lose.

We can't have a good economy AND we can't have education? We can't have safe borders WITHOUT a large military? We can't have jobs WITHOUT selling safety and minimum wage and giving away taxes?

All these are false narratives and the opposite of the truth. Internal spying is the death of a Democracy. The "fears" will escalate and we will be told everyone killed is a stinking terrorist -- that war will be never ending like the war on drugs that destroys families without saving lives. Lol at how successful American propaganda is. This is the absolute truth.  We've spent thousands of years building better tools to help us with our jobs, all the way from the wheel to Watson.  There are very few jobs that will not ultimately be replaced by a machine.  The question is, will this make life for everyone better, or worse?  Be careful what you wish for. Now to just get the data caps taken out as well.  A lot of people don't immediately upgrade because they don't see the need to pay another $199 + $40 upgrade fee. US carriers still offer the GS3 as an upgrade option. So many wait to see the next iPhone or a free holiday special. &gt; Our privacy is for sale, we have to accept that.

What?  Why?  No we don't.

I mean it MAY be for sale, but it doesn't have to be.  We can easily pass legislation to make this not the case.

 I love how Americans point out Russian or Chinese propaganda then I get to read shit like this. Too good. wasent ment to help you. it cant help you. all it changes is marketing. it was ment to help the FCC looks less like the shitheads they are.  My guess is the poll was positing the false narrative of "security OR privacy". If you just asked people if they think they'd like to HAVE privacy, yes or no, then it would probably be 90%.

Just be glad the push poll didn't get 12% as they manufacture consensus. I forgot RapidShare was a thing still It's not Facebook who initiated the removal of the images and they shouldn't be blamed for following court orders, blame the Turkish government instead of Facebook. Other android OEMs, like LG, whose sales are up 78% this quarter compared to last year, Huawei, etc. Android market share is, as far as I know, the only smartphone OS increasing marketshare (beside maybe Firefox OS, which only recently started). Windows Phone and iOS sales are increasing, but are outpaced by total market growth. Because media companies stand to gain profits if there's a venue where this data can be collected en masse, as well as sold, legitimately or otherwise.

Whether legislature exists, can be lobbied into existence, or acquired by shadier means... the data is worth A LOT of money.
 And WTF is "security"?

I feel insecure that I won't have the right forms filled out and get arrested. I feel insecure about a good job, or paying for college or getting sick and not affording to stay in my home.

I'm going to die of self-inflicted wounds of our insecure dog-eat-dog American life before some foreigner who is pissed we killed their family for access to resources is going to have a chance. "Thanks, hero." was all I replied.  Few reasons why apple was so successful this quarter(and in general in pushing phones without real innovation):

1. They didn't respond to the latent demand for a larger iphone for a long time, so it's all coming now , in big volumes.Maybe there was some weird strategy behind this all along ?  

2. They improved their game in china , and china(even just  rich china) is big. 

3. Usually before a new iphone comes to market , for many people their os starts to become slow - so they consider purchasing a new one. A scammy method if you ask me. And btw for many android phones, who don't suffer this problem ,also have the option of a rom upgrade which iphone lacks.

4. If you look at it realistically, at this stage of the game , apple's marketing has a lot to do with their sales volumes, probably more than their product quality vs android. And with marketing, i guess you can make people buy stuff.  I had an S1 and an S3 but when I went in over the holidays for an upgrade just a moment holding the S5 had me noping on to other models.

Felt cheap and bulky.

My wife got the S5 to avoid change but traded it in 2 days later for a G3 like I got. I'm a picturelife user and not too sure about this.  Streamnation worries me a bit since they are allowing streaming of movies and tv shows etc. 

I started off with Everpix and loved it but I'm thinking of going to MS, Google or Amazon.  The thing that sucks about these ones is that I can't have multiple family members on the same account.  If there is a way I can't figure it out.  With picturelife I could sync all family members photos in one place. What I hate about these articles and the whole situation is they act like removing a feature from one app is going to solve their "problem".  Another app will come out that does the exact same thing over and over again (preferably one that is open-source).  What a big joke. What will we call the new faster internet? Now that broadband means half my current speed. Do i have Broadband2x? &gt; Actually there's an alarming amount of people who are under the assumption, "Well I got nothing to hide so I don't care!" not knowing how naive that is to say.

And those people don't realize that their LEADERS have something to hide, and that internal spying means manipulation of leaders and the press.
 Yeah I don't get why everyone circlejerks about this 'innovative' business. Smartphones haven't been 'innovative' for years now.

Consumers don't want 'innovative' anymore in the market, they want improved features and more convenient phones. if anything, they should be the ones who understand this the MOST.  They were the ones raised in the era of anti-soviet propaganda.  They were the ones (to a greater extent than subsequent generations) that were taught that the reason we are better than the Russians is that they do things like spy on all of their citizens without warrants and then use that information against their own citizens.  The older generation should literally be asking themselves "if those things made the Russians bad, why are we doing them now and trying to pretend that they are suddenly good things?" Yup, this would make sense.  But as with everything else their initial gut reaction is to ban and sensor instead of work with and evolve.  And when/if they manage to ban or sensor it people will just find another way.  You don't need a button that says police to report police, you can just use the hazard report button or any other number of them.  As long as people can communicate with each other through an app like that, speed traps will be reported. Well my apologies then, but that is what I was trying to express. I may have misunderstood something else though as I thought we were just talking about changing wording in the contract, clarifying what unlimited is, not actually changing the current service or practice of throttling. If we're talking about AT&amp;T actually changing the plan itself then I would take back my comment because that would be plenty reason for some people to want to switch providers. Can I complain to my ISP now? I have 7Mbps down.  E.g. ha dub life not, jus ster boing a.  You're a nice person.  I'm just frustrated with the way circle jerks pop up sometimes on this site.  I should really be taking a break from Reddit until that frustration passes, but the way I do that is by occupying myself with constructive stuff.  It's just me and little one (two years old) at home right now, and her routine is to run around before her afternoon nap.  

So, constructive stuff and more quality activities with little one are out right now.  Later, I will work on this huge dresser I'm building, take out my frustration on pieces of wood, and be cheerful again. Hello!

YES. But spying on all the electronic stuff is something they wanted to do so they said "Al Qaeda."

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) if you have any questions or concerns.* They can sell speeds as low as they want.  They just can't call it 'broadband' internet unless it meets those minimum speed requirements. &gt; how do you identify a threat to a nation and it's people without any type of data collection / monitoring?

You can't, the goal is unattainable in the first place regardless of the methodology used I have been monitoring my data usage &lt;span style="font-family:Sarcastic Pro;"&gt;thanks to Comcast's handy data usage app&lt;/span&gt; after going over 300gb two months in a row last year. They do give you 3 strikes (bless their hearts) before they start slapping fees on you. I did find out that the dates aren't exactly the first of the month to the last day of the month for the time period though. I have been squirreling away data and then blowing it all on the last few days. At least I thought I was, in November I had over 30gb available so I downloaded 20+gb of ummm...Linux distros... and found on December 1 I already had 20+gb data usage. Anyone know the exact start / cutoff dates? You know, for science. Has anybody else considered the NSA's mass surveillance from a simple military/intelligence perspective? Imagine a freelance Chinese or Russian Kim Philby with access to NSA archives. Every last person on Facebook, from Colonel to 4-star general, to members of the senate and congress, their approximate locations, so much militarily pertinent information, a Trojan horse wouldn't even be an accurate enough description of just how bad that would be. And the real kicker? They hire *contractors*, which is something like 1/4 of the NSA's workforce; Snowden was a contractor as a matter of fact. If this doesn't stop, in the name of "security", it should stop because it's absolutely fucking stupid. Anybody else care to comment on that? I never hear anyone discuss just how catastrophically stupid the NSA is in mining data on such a massive scale. It's arrogant, and I hope to god I'm wrong, but the very idea is terrifying to me. This makes me wonder how long it's going to be until Comcast gives slower than broadband a new marketing name and realizes they can apply their own rules to it. That's a problem with our justice system in general. There is a whole industrialization of crime. The government uses this flawed model everywhere though schools and research too. I wanna go on record now as saying we should call them burbclaves. I don't believe this keeps getting posted again and again, on the very site it originated on. that makes more sense. thanks. Another fact that few people consider when reading the results of a poll is; who the fuck answers polls? I've never clicked on a link to a poll and I don't typically stop and chat with the good folk standing out in front of Wal-Mart asking for my opinion on the hot topic. You know who takes polls? The unemployed, the uneducated and radicals. Trust from companies? How about trust from Orwellian governments? So what your saying is, if you've got nothing to hide you should have nothing to fear right? 

Sounds like BS to me

How many terrorist attacks has the NSA stopped? Did it stop the Boston Bombing?

How many terrorist threats have the TSA intercepted? I mean for fucks sake they couldn't even catch the "underwear bomber" and if his bomb hadn't caught fire instead of detonating we'd have one more tragedy to justify more "security" over privacy.

I'm sorry but I refuse to believe that trading essential liberties will make any of us "safer" by a margin that is even close to being worth giving up my rights to privacy. I don't trust the alphabet agencies like the NSA or CIA to keep me safe. If anything they have a history of abusing their power.

With all the corporate corruption in our government you think there's really zero chance that any of these agencies could abuse their new all encompassing surveillance tech to spy on corporations? Hell, they already do it for "national security purposes". Just incase the next terrorist attack starts at Google's HQ or some lavabit style torrent. 

This ultimately means tech companies are now far less likely to establish themselves in the US and it risks scaring away companies who are already rooted here. These CEO's aren't stupid. They know that this surveillance mixed with the cronyism that's rampant in our alphabet agencies is bad for business. That means we could potentially lose even more jobs in the tech sector.

Is all of this worth it? Is the NSA really going to save us all from the "terrorist threat" by reading corporate emails and monitoring digital communication across the nation? 

If you want to sacrifice your personal privacy so quickly that's fine but don't think for a second that the rest of the nation puts so little value on their personal liberties.

But wait, I'm just a nobody why should I care? If I have nothing to hide I should be fine with all of this, right? Isn't that how it goes? Because when it came to Russians spying on their own citizens, most Americans believed it was bad not because they were spying on their own citizens, but because they were Russian. So 55% of USA citizens live in fear of the boogymen (aka Emmanuel Goldsteins) the government and corporations have trotted out? Believing national security is such high priority.

 I would argue that police should be in favor of this. No matter what happens, the police department will need to remain funded. This is undeniable. So instead of fearing this app, they should let it be and if it affects their funding, then they can make a request for funding when budgets come up next. I guess if that's the way you want to live your life. Agreed; my first thought is the survey was couching Security vs. Privacy - when there is no EITHER OR CONNECTION.

They might also use subjective words; "Do you think it's more important that authorized people can't look at the email of terrorists, or would you be OK with having your neighborhood attacked by VX nerve gas?"

The "yes/no" response is then graded as "for or against privacy".

But the really irksome thing is the PROFESSIONALS know that the two are not related, and that their leads have always come from HUMAN INTELLIGENCE. The entire improvement in National Security achieved since 9/11 is to strengthen cockpit doors and share information on a server -- other than that, it's all been a step backwards.

If we continue down this path, we'll live in a country nobody really cares about and people will only be trusted while the cameras are on them. This is what i have trouble with.   There 315 million people in the US, they can't read everyone's email and word docs. People act as if there is some dude sitting in Fort Mead, reading every line people type, and giggling at people's selfies. 

Not to say that there is zero abuse going on, but for people to say that the sole purpose of the NSA is to spy on Bob the mechanic, is pure alarmist crazy talk. http://i.imgur.com/M1R7iQJ.gif Yeah, I don't care if they change the wording. I care if they tell me it's not a plan even offered anymore and I have to go to one of their current plans (all of which suck for my purposes. T-mobile has far better plans if we're just talking current offerings). &gt; The quote still applies

The original meaning, or your misinterpretation?

&gt; If we start letting go of liberties, for security, then we will lose our liberties

Should we give up security then if it means a slight increase in liberty? For example, should the FAA strike it's rule that commercial airliners have lockable cockpit doors?  What local ISP doesn't have higher speed than that already? I'm in the middle of damn nowhere missouri and have 66Mbps down.  I understand, but just because there's no standard does not mean is not possible. Yes that 150 was over a twisted pair referred to as RTS.

I would suggest that maybe the reason there's no standard is that ATT is going to replaced it with something that can go much faster then 150 Mbps maximum. I'm not saying they will, but it would make sense. Why waste time developing something that's going to be obsolete relatively soon? Online Privacy verses National Security = False choice. If the government is the one amending them then, yes, it pretty much does. The problem is, you MUST agree to the terms of use and every application or program you load onto your computers or mobile devices takes your metadata and uses it for it's own purposes, then sells it to any willing buyer, and if you do not agree then you do not get to use the apps or programs....

How can we demand privacy when we willingly give it up in order to have this handy toy and work tool? I am curious though, how does national security stop terrorists from organizing attacks on the internet if they aren't aloud to monitor the internet? Police Commissions down and this Wazes grave concerns. Personally i dont think it does. I couldnt give a shit if anyone knows what websites i go on. So ill get some targeted ads on webpages, SO WHAT!? 

having "them" know what i buy at tesco, or what busses i get on, or where i spent my saturday afternoon...couldnt give a fuck. I dont see what negative affect it will have on me. Its not like im going to have shit taken out of my bank account because of it. 

 &gt; So someone could argue that if the government actually stops monitoring the internet it will be used for crime and terrorism. 

It's used for that with or without monitoring. We also have child prostitution and slavery going on -- you don't think they can't track it? There's no will to stop it.

Oh, and we can note that there was a lot of monitoring going in in 2008 when the banks collapsed. And Holder couldn't find any criminal activity!

How many murder suicides you think happened in this country due to stressed, out of work dads? Making people losers is a boat load of cruelty.

I'm HARMED by my bank, pay day loans, no benefits, lack of good jobs, lack of trust in food safety, in infrastructure, in expensive colleges -- all the great rip-offs are legal.

We hardly need crime and terrorism to fear in this country when the Koch brothers, ALEC and all the legitimate Oligarchs are making such a profit on ruining life for the rest of us. Do we all want to be bill collectors and prison guards? &gt;I'm not talking about arbitrary processor benchmarks.  I'm talking about the technology in the phone as a whole.  When you consider the camera, screen, processor, the Note's Stylus, etc.  The Note 4 has many parts that make up the whole that are quite a bit more advanced, and thus more expensive, than anything Apple offers.

It is objectively worse at "arbitrary benchmarks" despite having better hardware, subjectively neck and neck in terms of camera and screen performance, despite having better hardware there too. Much worse for build quality. And it costs more to the consumer.

What it offers: the android ecosystem and a larger screen. Those are also offered by other manufacturers. There isn't anything special about the note 4. Other things a large amount of Americans believe:
http://www.funnyordie.com/lists/1750272a44/ridiculous-things-americans-believe some people live in the real world, and some people do not, so their weight of importance differs It looks like you're trying to repeat a past mistake. Would you like help with that? The aircraft carrier didn't protect my kids from having to stop going to scouts and playing sports. It doesn't help us with school lunches or dental exams.

And the bridges aren't going to need a bomb to collapse in Detroit. Yeah there is.  But we're also talking about motivations.  If they'll put that bullshit for one, we have top assume there'll do it for the other.  It's the same fucking people. Here is your response:

"You do not have the choice in deciding if what you're doing is wrong or not." It's kind of a loaded question anyway.

Do I think national security is more important than online privacy? On the whole, errrrrm yes? Security in general is one of the main reasons we have a government in the first place.

That doesn't mean I think we need to trade our privacy for national security. That doesn't mean I think spying on the general population is justified.

National security is extremely important. So is privacy. I don't see why I have to choose one over the other.  In my country we have speed cameras everywhere, all with warning signs, and they are raking in the cash. Cry some moar. I have never seen a data cap for internet service... do you mean for phones the "unlimited" plans? &gt; Taking the time to write that says exactly the opposite of the words involved. Maybe I wasn't addressing you specifically. Maybe there are other people on this page. Maybe that applies to you only if it actually applies to you.

You, in direct response to my original comment, typed in bold: 

&gt;**Here's my challenge to you:** Unlike a typical redditor, actually fucking think about this instead of just jerking off by clicking an arrow.

How was I supposed to interpret this, exactly? Should I have assumed this was a general statement? Give me a break. Perhaps you should consider more carefully how your comments might be read by others. &gt; the family unit has been ruined

That's the persons/citizens fault not the governments. I agree with your post but blaming the government for people moving the goal posts for their morals and values further and further back isn't the government's doing it's society's doing. But yeah let's blame the government because then we won't have to hold each other in the "family unit" accountable because hey it's the government. Hello!

I don't give a shit what is technically possible, no one does. People give a shit about what is deployed and available. They have 10Gbps wifi for fucks sake, its not economically feasible to ship.

&gt;I would suggest that maybe the reason there's no standard is that ATT is going to replaced it with something that can go much faster then 150 Mbps maximum.

Their exist one of two possibilities, sit on the copper and bitch when people want faster, or actually invest and lay fiber when available.

&gt;Why waste time developing something that's going to be obsolete relatively soon?

try it has been obsolete for decades, it is just fucking cheap. It is the people amending them.  How in your mind would this create more government? Or they'll do what the food industry has been doing for years.

If they can't call it cheese, then it is cheese product.  
If they can't call it ice cream, then it is frozen dairy desert.  

 What madness is this?! Less speeding tickets? Is everyone *crazy* ?!

Surely nobody's implying that police should spend their time finding and punishing *actual* criminals!  And spoken! Dem nails... give 'em hell! That's incredibly sad Your friends are idiots. No, Kitty! That's my pot Pai! You can't identify a threat through data collection? This is absolutely false. 

If i can thwart out someone stealing data at my company with my puny Cisco tools, the NSA can surely sniff out some idiotic criminal texting his plans to his cohorts.

If you have any proof or experience otherwise, i'd be happy to hear about it.
 So many things to throw on the ground. You seem to feel the state has a burden to support your life choices  I don't value online privacy much. I'm genuinely interested into why people do? Wow, this is big!  I still remember my old apartment at college -- there were a lot of frightened old folks there. I forgot my key one time, and they wouldn't let me in the lobby -- they just stood there panting and fearful. "I come here every day -- you don't know me?" I said. Had to climb in the window on the third floor.

When people treat you like a criminal it kinds of provokes the desire. 

Every time a police officer busts someone just so they can get a fine; that reduces the sense of "fairness" in the system. It would be BETTER if they only arrested people who really deserved it and let a few people go, than to get all the guilty and harm the innocent -- but they seem to have forgotten that ideal. Every person they contact is treated like the worst person they ever met.

Too many authoritarians in this country, who treat every issue as; "But if the enemy had a atom bomb and we had to do this and this to stop them..." It's all fun as long as it happens to the losers -- but not in suburbia or their friends or *gasp* THEM? Authoritarianism is ONLY good for the people on the right side of the authority fence. The NeoCons constantly talk about an "entitlement society" but it's really themselves that they think are special and who are NEVER going to be called a terrorist.

I worry that one day I'm going to say something that is misconstrued, and then THAT will be evidence of my un-American activities. I'm already sure internal spying and the concentration in wealth is un-American. Pissed me off that my 2012 Fiat 500c didn't come with a manual. I keep them in the car so when I have trouble, or want to know something, I can just whip it out. Now I have to go inside, or home and then inside, find the damned disc, and put it into the computer. And even now the new computers don't have disc drives! Damn you Fiat! I like the ruling, but the cynic in me worries if this is a consolation prize for getting bent over on net neutrality down the line You use quotes around "vote" because you know it isn't a vote.

If it's not a vote, it's an opinion. People, especially politicians, have championed opinions on behalf of others ever since the beginning of time.

Spokespeople do this. Celebrities in advertisements. Unions look out for other unions. Family members defend their family members even when they're wrong. People write letters of recommendation for friends that mostly say what their friend needs them to say.

That doesn't mean it's good for society that politicians champion Comcast's opinions, but it's not exactly something you can prohibit. Unless you lock our elected officials in isolation chambers so nobody can influence them, including their constituents. The problem is nothing is quantified and all these questions are loaded and stupid. Would you have us record everyone's daily lives for the government to watch, if it could save one American from dying? Probably not. Would you risk a 50% chance of death in order to keep your privacy? Probably not. Nobody has any clue what they're talking talking about, and these decisions won't be made on any quantified estimates or logic - it'll be made by whoever wins the popularity contest by spending enough money to defend their side of the issue. It means that instead of seeing 5Mb/s, 15Mb/s, and 50Mb/s tiers of broadband service, you'll be seeing 25Mb/s and 50Mb/s tiers of broadband with 1Mb/s and 5Mb/s "high speed" internet service.

That or they'll just call 5/15 high speed and only call 50Mb/s broadband.  It really only matters to their marketing of services towards older tech illiterate people. The problem is ticket revenue is going down.  The main problem of this kind of structures is that these solar arrays will be perceived as some sort of rooftops and they might be liability during storms and high speed winds. I can see a myriad of lawsuits for solar panels hitting people or falling on cars during a bad storm. 

It isn't a bad idea though, but ultimately rooftops are better suited to solar panels and they provide additional structural strength that you may not find anywhere else.  But they can't say that out loud, hence the tortured logic. Cool. Now what? There are ISPs that have data caps. When I had Comcast it was capped at 300 gig, other places my not be as kind. If you're going to use words like "closing in on" indicating a trend then please show more than two data points (2014, 2013).  This means that the internet line going into my work is no longer considered broadband, and Centurylink no longer provides broadband internet to something like half the Phoenix area.

This is gonna get interesting. I think its a step towards customers asking if their service is adequate.  Broadband is a recognizable buzzword, so an ISP having to explain to a customer why doesn't qualify cant be good for business. This move will therefore hopefully encourage ISPs to upgrade rather than bank all their profits. 

I think this also affects the speeds ISPs offer if they take certain federal money. 

As per forcing them to upgrade, there is currently little that can leverage them to do so unless they are reclassified as a common carrier.  That choice is next on the FCCs plate.  Not really, the UK has far more cc cameras than other places. However I think that is largely due to the penchant of Brits to get pissed and smash their own towns up. &gt; If you think an accident that happened over 100 years ago that's entirely unrelated to the issue of nuclear power is proving your point, you're wrong.

My point was never that nuclear technology can impossibly provide clean and save energy. My point always was that humans can't be expected to manage it properly on the required timescale.

&gt;Besides that, coal power (which powered the Titanic) has more casualties on record than nuclear power.

Coal is worse than anything else. Since when are coal and nuclear the only two options? Technology does not like technology. And the universe is destroyed. Or we all just go back to going outside again. What was that polling number on Sept 12, 2001? Not to mention the giddy love many departments unabashedly show for civil forfeiture laws that allow them to take money and belongings without having to prove that it was involved in a crime.  That's not even close to what I said. I don't like the NSA nor do I support what they do, but I'd imagine they've stopped a large number of terrorist attacks.   They tried convincing my dad that my line had to be changed to a 5 gb plan in order to activate my Nexus 5. Even after throwing a shit-fit, it took 45 minutes just to activate the damn phone without changing the plan.  The phones Samsung sells in developing markets do not have the same profit margins the high end phones sold in richer markets have, so it will still look like their profits are taking a hit. Got to love private, for profit prisons right? Nothing could possibly go wrong... Great, although transparency from "companies" is less important than transparency from government. Unless we're talking about Google. Which is the same as gov't. "Next up in Wheeler's list was Comcast, which told the commission that a 4Mbps connection has been found to be sufficient to handle streaming HD video, he said. But the Comcast website tells customers that with 150Mbps, they can game in real time, and stream HD movies, Wheeler noted."

I am having trouble hating this guy at the moment.

Let's redirect the hate to the two dissenting members:

"Pai said that 71 percent of consumers who can buy at least 25Mbps service today choose not to do so. He pointed to two facts to prove that broadband is being deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion: 98.5 percent of Americans live in areas covered by 4G LTE, and Google is expanding fiber service to 18 new cities, he noted."

They don't buy it because it's frigging expensive, a 25Mbps/3Mbps should not cost more than $35-$45, but people pay over $65 for internet only service.

 One of several people who (apparently) essentially simultaneously invented the laser, rather. Am I a bad person because I don't care if the government is reading my emails? I'm still waiting for any of your evidence.  You have none, of course, because this is indeed how the world really works.  

You can't even challenge the fact that these people have made you afraid at a time when you have never been safer...all for their own profit. It's not a strawman at all... less privacy will increase security. Now it depends who you are seeking security from, but without a doubt decreased privacy can improve your security. It's like going to see the doctor. The less privacy you hold between yourself and the doctor, the healthier you will be. Even if it COULD catch terrorists, that doesn't mean we should be data mining.

Terrorism is a systemic problem -- not something you can solve by adding X more guns or Y more laws. People who are angry and disenfranchised are fighting an asymmetric war; they cannot fight our tanks or our drones so they go after the weak spots. The fact that we have improved our military and satellite coverage and the distance at which we can strike, means two big things; 
*1) The US does not need to engage in diplomacy unless a country has enough resources or power.
*2) The ONLY targets that can affect change are soft targets and the public where news cameras are close by.

The value I see in data mining is only to manipulate consensus opinion; to get people to be distracted or OK with having less power and wealth.

The hubris of internal spying and manipulating the public is the same that creates terrorism. 

The solution; treat other nations fairly whether they have power or not. Human/Civil rights apply to everyone no matter what or they are meaningless. The fairness in the rule of law and equal opportunity reduces the chance for large groups of people to organize for violent reform. Hello!

Letting everyone interact unfettered and completely in private wouldn't affect our security? Are we sure that 100% of the terrorist attacks that have not happened were not in part thwarted by use of surveillance? We too quickly forget: we are not descended from fearful men and women.   LAPD already tried that angle citing that the guy who attacked those two cops in NYC earlier last year had used the app at some point.  Anecdotal evidence isn't what I'm looking for here. It may be no issue for you but a big issue to others. Their job is to make NASA look good.

One of many PR schemes NASA has recently put out there. Another is telling us NASA found other habitual planets. Weeks ago NASA shot a rocket called ROLLPIN? claiming it was a test to send man to mars.

No man is going to mars on a fuel burning rocket!





 Whats that? The ISPs will just change the name of their service and convince/trick consumers into thinking they're getting a better deal somehow. Im not saying apple don't do the same but i think there should be some balance people only say this because they live cushy ass lives without ever having to deal without any threats to their lives Well considering that many hundreds of millions of people apparently don't seem to care that their personal information is being analyzed, packaged and sold by the likes of Goole and Facebook, it may not be a bad argument.

 &gt;It is the people amending them. How in your mind would this create more government? You sound like an 8 year old.

You mean like the people control congress? If congress is corruptible, how in the world do you imagine that the people drafting the amendment won't be? Only an eight year old would fail to recognise that utter failure of logic.

&gt;The Constitution does not create more government.

That line doesn't make any sense, or have anything to do with anything I've said.

&gt;In fact, for the most part, it serves it's purpose as restricting govenment. The Constitution is a negative document, in that it is mostly a list of what the Federal government CANNOT do. I think you need to get some more education and actually read the document.

I'm reasonably familiar with the US constitution, and I'm aware that it restricts the power of your government, but that has nothing to do with what I said:

&gt;Trying to solve government corruption with more government is a recipe for failure,

This means:

* You claim the government has been corrupted (I fully agree: That particular system of government makes corruption inevitable)

* You plan to change this by amending the document which controls how they operate

* The process for amending the document is controlled by the people you claim are corrupt

* Therefore it's doomed to failure. The only part where "the people" will have any say is the bit where they can either stick with the status quo (which is corrupt) or switch to whatever the corrupt politicians, or their proxies, have come up with (which will either be corrupt, or full of loopholes).

Corrupt organisations aren't going to suddenly turn around and act in an ethical manner when it comes to fighting corruption. The only thing which makes that happen is outside pressure or competition, neither of which exist in this situation. Sorry dude, your government is broken and it's not going to fix itself just because you tell it to. COX has a 'data allowance' but doesn't enforce it.  You just get an email letting you know that you went over your data and suggesting you think about going to the next tier.  Also warns people who don't think they used that much data so they can look for any security issues with people accessing their wifi or something.  But yeah, so far there's no throttling or extra charges for going over. Cyanogen is so full of themselves. Android without Google Apps is underwhelming. Do you have any proof or evidence to back that claim up? If we really want to defend national security, we'd make the NSA release the list of zero days they have. If the NSA has it, then other countries/entities/criminals are going to find and exploit them too eventually. Allowing the government to collect and maintain zero days makes us all less unsafe. 55 percent think Security is better... &gt; It's not a strawman at all

Sure it is.  It's actually the very definition of it.  Instead of arguing that valuing your privacy is valuable at all (which nobody is going to believe) they want to argue that instead if compromises national security.  Yet, there isn't any evidence that a single terrorist was ever stopped by mining citizens data.

It's 100% a strawman.  They don't want to convince people of A, so they convince you of B and claim to have convinced everybody of A.  Strawman. Todays world is sick. Now you have to wear a condom to fap? Fap safe people. It was never about officer safety in the first place.   What do you mean they wouldn't let you keep it? Like they called and said no more unlimited or you got a new phone and they made you choose a new plan.  Or they'll start trying to convince people they don't need those speeds and that broadband is a ridiculous expense, the same line they keep trying to feed the FCC.  That's even more dangerous.  Get the people who don't know any better to believe they don't need fast speeds, offer them at a discounted rate, then slowly raise those prices and you're back to slow, expensive internet with a bunch of consumers who don't know any better.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) if you have any questions or concerns.* I was literally just having this discussion with a friend of mine this morning. I backed a Kickstarter campaign, and he texted me to tell me he thought it was a great idea. When I asked how he knew that, he said "Oh, I get an e-mail when you back campaigns, because I follow you." I was horrified - it wasn't that I didn't want him knowing that I want to play Exploding Kittens, it's that Kickstarter chose to tell someone else for me. Luckily I disabled the follow feature on my profile, but it led to a lengthy debate on privacy and comfort. He says I'm being tin-hat conspiracy theorist, I think I'm being reasonable. And he throws up consistent strawmen and extremist viewpoints that I don't subscribe to, in some attempt to downplay my legitimate concerns. It's frustrating. Why must people accept it?

10% prefer security

"Try Time Warners/Comcasts faster than ever HIGH SPEED internet" 4500+ upvotes for a press release. SMH. I'm guessing asking a Security Expert on how to solve the problem is like asking an ambulance chasing lawyer how to solve car accidents.

Countries where people are treated like dirt, are countries that have lot's of angry people with nothing to lose. If they bother our interests they are called "terrorists".

Solution; treat people better. Pay a bit more in Gas and tell the Saudis they need to feed their people and stop flogging the critics or we don't give them weapons. Sure, they can go to Russia. 

We need to be the good guys again and win hearts and minds. America and Germany have a much lower issue with foreign violence BECAUSE people who come here do pretty well and are treated fairly (for the most part). We could however, screw this up if we treat people with more suspicion.

It's this simple; if your neighbor comes over because they heard some yelling in the house with an apple pie and an invite to come to a house warming, that's going to get a different response from you than if they came with a shotgun.

INFOSEC is not nearly as useful as good citizens, but it's OK as a stop-gap. It isn't the solution or even very useful in the grand scheme of things. It's only useful in the case of rival governments and corrupt organizations/business -- in essence; POWER should only be used on the POWERFUL.

Spying on people will not identify threats but create animosity. i've had to deal with this recently, i was pretty shocked.

honestly though, what exactly do you say? if they don't care about privacy, what can you say? how do you counter the "i have nothing to hide" argument?

Hate to break it to you, most people can be pushed into accepting things to "protect the children" without looking into the actual implications of allowing the laws in question, or tools in question to be used, and how they can then be tweaked to allow for broader reaching goals - ex. Censoring political dissent.

People are sheep, and are willfully ignorant because it is simply easier to be as such. Nope, I dont want this to happen.

Cyanogen is what made my Nexus One last 3 years longer and now we have Microsoft apps (a.k.a NSA apps) all bundled? Bye bye Cyanogen! Huh, so that's what an aneurysm feels like.  Just like when we realized Saudi Arabia was behind 9/11 and put an end to their funding of terrorism?  Oh wait...  /s

\^ Did you drop this? Yup. Privacy IS a form of security. If it has mandated back doors, it should be called the "Cyber Insecurity Rules". Summary on January 29, 2015 [[FCC Source](http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-finds-us-broadband-deployment-not-keeping-pace)]:

 Ok... there is something i need explained.

Why do people think that the internet, a tool created for the sole purpose of sharing information with anyone anywhere at anytime, should be a private thing? Thats just dont make any sense at all to me.

Why would you sensitive information on a device connected to the internet if you dont want those information on the internet.

If you want privacy, keep those thing off your device connected to the internet, thats simple as fuck and very effective. Hello!

I doubt anyone is taking this as "would you rather have privacy online and zero national security or vice-versa". Instead, people view it as "is the increase (if any) in national security worth the invasion to citizen's privacy by allowing the government to monitor online activity?". If you can't understand the question, it doesn't mean everyone else is dumb. People buy a new iPhone because its "cool"  
Its not really cool to buy a new galaxy phone, and at this point the tech jump from generation to generation isnt really a huge factor either, phones from 4 years ago still run almost every app you could want. I sit corrected I have Comcast and they have a 300GB data cap. Really puts a damper on my "50mbps" bandwidth.  This is not true at all. The danger is from dumb agency, not what I would call intelligence. The rat level consciousness without intellect that can independently act and has access to the net, can hack it, can hack the internet of things, so can turn all the lights off or crash self driving cars with certain people it sees as obstacles to it's progress in them. It's objectives will be dumb. That assassin bot  that decides to kill everyone called peter instead of just one. Capability without intellect, that is what's dangerous.

http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm If this battery tech is going into an ARA module, then it's apart of ARA.  Thank the MPAA for that one.  If we can't upload fast we can't distribute pirated shit as easily. So you're arguing that instead of using existing photovoltaic technology to capture energy we should spend money inventing new technologies to transform thermal energy from asphalt? Only 45%? 100% agree. 

 If Qualcomm makes an 810 module, ARA still had nothing to do with the actual 810. 45% of Americans must be idiots then.  I doubt it will make a difference. I see offers every week in my mailbox for AT&amp;T's "high speed" DSL internet (which is a blazingly fast 786000000mbps). They won't be able to call it broadband after this, but they don't call it broadband now.

The FCC can't keep them from calling it "High Speed", "Mega High Speed", or "Ultra High Speed". And then we wonder how CISPA keeps coming up. Don't you guys realize that you're asking the government to do exactly what you're asking them *not* to do to you? 

Granted, the ethics between a government and its people is more complicated than that, but still. I'm beginning to think we're the real hypocrites in this. If they've stopped terrorist attacks, shouldn't we hear about terrorists being arrested?  When have we ever heard of a terrorist ever being arrested (other than after they've already committed the crime)?  ATT DSL has a data cap of 150GB So currently, I get a 10mbps connection for $40 a month. Will this mean soon I will be getting at least 25mbps? poetic but I think we might at least be as flighty and we are fighty. Clearly we should get this guys ideas on interplanetary teleportation if he believes it's as simple as streaming 4K. 'tis a silly place. Apples iHuman will be pretty nice. An illegal bot that thinks up new ways to smuggle drugs or target people for assassination  won't make a very pretty consciousness.  Because you legally cannot change the customer's personal information without their permission.  &gt; How will this help me?

It won't. because power to the people as long as i dont have to do anything at all.   The two call centers I worked at you were under no circumstances allowed to hang up on a customer and would result in a zero on your quality assurance.  No, your connection will now be labeled "high speed internet" instead of "broadband" Seat belts interfere with writing tickets. Ban seat belts. What is the point of these basic-ass Saturday morning conspiracies? All they will probably do is re-brand you tier.  That a disappointment &gt; You will need a custom version of hostapd, the access point software that supports the Edimax cards you have.

\*points to random self-hosted code\*

Hello Reddit. This is a public service announcement:

Do not blindly download un-audited code and use it to set up a service that purports to provide privacy. Why don't you see that as likely Quotation from the article regarding refunds and driver updates.
"NVIDIA has posted in its official GeForce.com forums that they are working on a driver update to help alleviate memory performance issues in the GTX 970 and that they will "help out" those users looking to get a refund or exchange." I mean there isn't much because that's just blatant ignorance. With how connected we are to phones, computers, televisions, etc it's rare to not see how some sort of tech in a common household and with that comes SOME sort of information. I believe the important thing is educating people but much like politics, a lot of it is just blind ignorance...

So basically it's a catch 22. This is mostly because our legal system is so screwy that average people are breaking numerous laws ever day, mostly without even knowing that they are doing so. If people don't know if what they are doing is legal they sure as hell don't want government knowing about it, just in case. The real problem is that our law books are full of outdated legislation that is still the law but that is not enforced except in very specific cases. This also is one of those things that disproportionately effects minorities because it gives a racist cop the means with which to screw with whoever he doesn't like. Totally not the case, I was saying that the benefits of solar parking lots are better than just having a hot car interior, or not having to run to your car while its raining. I guess my comment got misinterpreted.

 I'm all for solar energy. I worded my original post wrong, which makes it seem like we should be doing something else other than solar. Solar will definitely be a transformative technology for us once this generation of politicians bites the dust and we get some fresh blood in congress. Solar is just the beginning though, there's lots of wasted energy out there and we should be thinking about ways to capture and repurpose energy in addition.

If not then I don't really foresee much change happening.  Lucky bastard those 45% forgot about 9/11 or weren't affected by it No idea why Amazon continually thinks they can come way late to the game and offer a mediocre product and still gain traction.  Give me your credit card number and describe in detail your last sexual experience Both providers in my area have data caps. CenturyLink (DSL) has a 200GB cap (unless you're on fiber), and mediacom (cable) has a cap based on which tier you're on (scales from like 50GB to 2TB).

The former ends your service if you go over it 3 times (ever), and the latter charges you per GB after the cap The best idea in a long time is to install an electric system that costs more than it's worth? Question: if I bought broadband by the new definition and had some sort of data cap, could the ISP throttle me to a sub-25 mbps connection if I went over that cap? Hello!

Doesn't that mean that 55% think the opposite ? I can't stand it when I hear people say that. Sheeple! "It puts their lives at risk."  
Oh, grow up. You're the cops! You have a very optimistic tone there.  While much of what you mentioned is good in theory, i'm not how realistic it is unfortunately. That's a very interesting perspective that I have never heard anybody argue before. What if foreign governments start recruiting elite security analysts a la Snowden now that the cat's out of the bag. Freedom is on the march!  It is only a matter of time until the people wake up and take down our oppressors!  Death to Comcast! whats scary is that so many people like you are so overly dramatic about privacy and are so convinced that it's going to be used for bad by some authoritarian government to inflict utter tyranny. IS it really "as scary as can be?" Is it THAT scary?  http://explorer.netindex.com/maps?country=United%20States

Thirteen states have an average speed below 25Mbps.  Yeah, the police could get the app too and claim they're everywhere. Everyone drives more carefully. More time for donuts. So....happy... It's implied from "What about snoonet?" "Snoonet runs on Anope services." 

That makes it sound like you have a problem with Anope. Yes, the people are also at fault.  But if Congresspersons were leading with their hearts instead of their wallets the people would be less susceptible to societal decay.  The leadership has to be responsible too. tl;rd the governement is gonna end up fucking you if you give him the chance I'd rather be alive than not have someone who isn't friends with me on facebook read one of my statuses. Your point was fear mongering, that's all. That's really all I'm trying to say.

&gt;Coal is worse than anything else. Since when are coal and nuclear the only two options?

I never said they were the only two options. But it's literally the only comparable to your Titanic statement. Nvidia are making a K1 module, they're apart of ARA no? 

Sennheiser are making three modules, they're apart of ARA no? 

Toshiba are making almost every module, they're apart of ARA no? 

If Qualcomm makes a snapdragon module, then they'll be apart of ARA just like the other companies. And just for some fun information, Qualcomm + Foxconn have been announced as manufacturers for Project ARA during the last Dev Con. The specific modules we do not know yet.   but he is an intelligence guru. lacking experience doesn't mean he lacks the ability or the resources to know the business. he had high level access and an innate technical ability.  "systems administrator" on his "resume" is a cover.

he releases bits of info so that the media isn't inundated all at once then "forgets" about the story two weeks later. it's an attempt to keep pressure on the feds and the matter relevant.

an important factor which people should be considering is that the government has all this info on it's people, yet doesn't allow transparency in return. no one is saying the NSA et al shouldn't have the ability to do their job, but a happy medium should be reached and the government's lack to show any of it's deck of cards is troubling. once our rights to privacy are revoked and a panopticon is reached it will be very difficult to reverse that. 

checks and balances. How can you ever ensure that companies are actually being transparent?  What does that transparency entail?  I see the word thrown around a lot, but no one ever gets specific.  Seems to me that as long as a company is a private company with a profit motive, its going to have incentives to not be transparent or to be selectively transparent. &gt;which means 55%, a majority of the people, 

This is just bullshit. That's not how democracy works. "45% voted for candidate A" does not mean that candidate B gets 55% of the votes.

45% is against, 35% is for, 20% is neutral -&gt; 45% wins. Period. also, because he chose to be out in the open and not hiding. You assume we live in a "democracy"... Plutocracy more like. They would name a lawyer Ross... &gt; Usually before a new iphone comes to market , for many people their os starts to become slow

That is unverifiable nonsense. I thought it said the title said Piracy, I was concerned really concerned for a brief moment...  To be fair, it's not for nothing.  They trade it for free access to all of facebook's services. Interesting, but this solution would most likely only apply to VOD and not live television. I wouldn't be surprised if a new commercials replace the removed one, so at that point you're just trading marketing messages. There's a new technology called Skipr.tv that removes all commercials during a live broadcast, so you might want to look into that. systems adminstrator is a corporate cover. This was in 2011, I don't know if the policy is the same still. You worked for DTV?  Quads are extremely dangerous because they speed wobble and flip.

This is why cars have a minimum track width.

Adding a fourth wheel would eliminate the entire purpose of the Elio and at that point they'd be building a Geo Metro. So long as a politician has something worth selling, it will be bought. I wanted to add [this](http://wearcam.org/netcam_privacy_issues.html), for all the people bitching about cellphones and wearables, etc.

These things can be done safely and benefit society thusly, but people are terrified of things they don't understand, and it makes it hard for everyone. Someone just linked me to this article. I am impressed. Wheeler is really filling his role now. His initial persona came off as if he was another shill, but I think he's actually on our side. His comments and researched views are amazingly comforting. A rather stark contrast to the people that voted against it. He's showing foresight also which I think is completely lost on some people when they talk about 4K video.

Anecdotally I had to add in 4K support for a system at work since customers are beginning to use 4K. (To be fair some have been using 4K for a long time for videos, but they run it through their own transcoding to 1080p. Now they're asking to just show the 4K since their TVs are all 4K). Imgur converts large gifs into gifv, which is basically renamed h.264/webm video I think.

Also being able to take one funny scene out of a youtube video and put it out of context is pretty fun.

 [sauce video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTjqI8YSK8) When does this go into effect? It's not much of a choice if you want to not be part of modern social society.  And they readily hand the data over if not doing so threatens their business model or helps it.   Go put your tinfoil hat back on then if you think they're not investing and just holding back until enough people complain.  Having lived in a state where everyone was spied on all the time i can tell you it changes you.  
It changes what you say, it changes what you do.

 It changes how you think.

And the East German Stasi got nothing on what is happening in the US right now. In their wildest dreams they would not have been able to come close to what now is reality. [Womp womp.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) Well, quantum teleportation has been done over a distance of 143 km.  Interplanetary isn't as far away as he thinks.

In other news, FCC commissioner is an idiot.  4K products are [already on the market](https://www.youtube.com/user/Panasonic4K).  It may be a while before they are widespread, but that gives the networks time to prepare, Totally wrong approach, they should have gone with "ISIS terrorists are using Waze to avoid detection while they kidnap your children from playgrounds and use them for interrogation training." -THEN they would get somewhere. Are you lookin' at me?   ...been working well so far With you, it doesn't.  With the courts, it does.

The courts make the rules, not you.   You would have to present a case in court that object code has a sufficiently expressive purpose to get First Amendment protections.  Good luck.

When you say one thing, and society says another, 99% of the time you're nuts, and society is right.  Admittedly, 1% of the time you're a an enlightened dissident.   I'm betting, on the basis of the odds, on case number 1. That sounds next to useless.  Lets be honest about that.  So what if it is illegal, what will happen, realistically?  They have more money than god and an army of lawyers and lobbyists.   Regarding the sex thing, this particular couple said they never put anything on the internet sexual, sexting or otherwise.

As far as CC, i didn't bring that up because what good would that do for them? charge your CC? wouldn't you just call the bank at that point? If we don't have freedom, rights, and privacy there is nothing worth protecting.  I think privacy is covered by the U.S. Constitution and that the U.S. Constitution is in fact law. I think the U.S. Constitution is in fact the highest law of the land. No-one should be allowed to break this law, regardless of anything. but, we should have a problem with the government not being transparent in return. that is a big issue. they want everything from us, but we can't get anything from them. this not somehing we should be happy with. It has to be spelled out.

The FTC made a ruling that if it is "unlimited" then no throttling should take place. The difference between this and East Germany is that they'll just have our information. Not sending us to prison for leaving the country. Easy peasey! Script languages?  That's source code.  

Byte compiled script languages?  Object code. 

Obfuscated script languages?  Tough call.  Courts would probably say object code.   The question is basically "Are humans using this to express ideas and communicate with other humans?" and instill fear via "terroism threats" the reason it's an issue is the government refuses transparency in return. we need some transparency from them, too. I'm not an expert, but they might or might not be thinking about approving or rejecting the proposed merger. No, the problem is that it is effectively not "our government", if it was our government, it would effect the will of the governed.  It doesn't.  It effects the will of the rich and powerful.  And every time people get pissed off enough to vote and throw the bums out, somebody talks a good game, gets elected, and its just the same old shit all over again and no one knows what to do about it. Charge n Shop - only $3, it charges, so do we! I have Suddenlink and have a 250 gig cap. With 50 down and 5 up a 250 gig cap is shit Blame the Turks for Facebook's actions in regards to Russia? Syria? Or China?

- User names and Passwords, listed beside their use.

- Social security number

- A copy of all identification as use to verify them

- A copy of their credit report

- A list of every election they voted in, and how they voted

- A list of all friends and acquaintances

- A complete employment history.

- A complete history of all available GPS data

- A copy of every photo they have taken

If they say "but that's private" or "why do you want to know", Cite that they have nothing to hide, and would have no issue in you producing a profile on them to place as a record for the public to see.

If they say it's creepy - ask them why it is NOT creepy for the government to do it, but is for friends, co-workers, acquaintances and so on.

Remind them that privacy is a right, not a privilege. It's been getting introduced in some areas.  My hometown on Armstrong used to be unlimited, but now has a cap of 150-250 depending on your bundle.  (150 if internet only, 200 if internet+TV, 250 if Internet+TV+Phone).  Very vague on what this will do. 

Personally I could go in with some kind of voice activated passive system that would search for thing for me, and return the best results based on my previous search patterns. Basically so I didn't have to look through the list of things returned by my search. Also it would be nice if I could set it to notify me whenever something new cropped up under a particular search.

Only I don't want it made by microsoft. I don't really trust them, not because of any conspiracy reason I just think its very likely that they'll use it to passively aggressively sell me shit. Please cite this law. Sounds a lot more like an internal rule than an actual regulation. I use charter, they have a 250gb per month cap. Is there a margin of error? For example, I regularly get about 23-24 down, which is close to the 25 mbps limit but not quite there.   [Target](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/) is pretty good at this.  Not necessarily, I think it comes from a generational gap. The Internet is integrated into younger peoples lives far more than older generations. Heavy Internet users have a bigger stake in online privacy argument than people who use it for just e-mail and a few web searches here and there. Because they (light Internet users) aren't personally effected as much and much more likely to see on-line communication as a security threat. AT&amp;T DSL here in SE Texas, 150GB cap before they charge you for another 50GB The issue lies not with the ISPs, although I do not believe they are competing to offer the best service, but with local municipalities. While I do know that ISPs do lobby governments to restrict competitor deployments, and stifle fiber deployments.

 The issue still is the municipalities fault, many forward thinking policies would dramatically expedite fiber deployments. Dig once policies, muni deployments, conduit, and utility access would all dramatically increase fiber deployment rates. Which means 45% of people have done things they are not proud of.... Also 72% of Americans supported a war in a country that 60% of them couldn't find on a map.  I don't really give a fuck what they support anymore cause none of them are going to do a fucking thing about it except bitch on the internet about it :)  Besides, by the time we develop an intelligence tool to mine the fire hose of data we are collecting we will probably be crossing the line into a point where we should be more concerned about the intelligence we created to analyze the intelligence than the brainwashed bronze aged educated fucktards with AKs trying to kill us.    Do you even know what GDPP is? Its GDP per capita, PER person, it has nothing to do with the 1%ers. And anyways you make it sound like if it weren't for the cheap products made in China they would all be living wonderful lives under socialism. So then I ask you this, if they all live so wonderfully under a government planned economy why do the poor choose to leave it? They can easily go back to rural China where the government still largely controls peoples lives. But they don't, because even though working at the factory is worse than living in America or Europe, its a LOT better than living under a government planned system where the poor have no chance of escaping poverty and die abject lives. China over the last 40 years has brought the most people into the middle class in THE ENTIRE HISTORY of the world. &gt; Your point was fear mongering, that's all. That's really all I'm trying to say.

Is it fearmongering to be aware of our limits? I feel like time and time again, when things like this are implemented it's with good intentions, but after a few years when agencies start to turn over their staff and new decision makers come in, then budget according to *expected* income from things like tickets, and start to depend on it, so it becomes a permanent, critical source of funding that it was never intended to be.   ha Thank you for your submission!

Any data can be accessed from the internet, but your device wont do thing you dont let them do. 
 I think you missed the point. It doesn't matter if there is or is not a connection between national security and privacy. The question is *if you have to choose* which do you think is more important? It is a hypothetical. Are you really saying private email is more important than national security?

People are answering the question as is, not saying we should or have to give up one for the other. Shade is good - but why waste the money for shade, when we can use that space generated to provide power, reducing the cost, and paying back the cost of construction over the long term?

Seems like a great idea that needs to be implemented in more places - though there is certainly a fairly steep cost for doing so. You haven't come up with any limits, and the Titanic certainly isn't giving us a limit that's can be applied to this sort of scenario.

It's not knowing our limits, it's low effort fear mongering. security comes from tranparency.  think if all the guns were made of transparent material and when you see a person with a gun, you could see if there was a bright colored bullet in the chamber or not and if bright colored safety was on or off.  That would make you immediately feel different about that particular weapon.   Problem is with not knowing what type of danger something poses.

Seems a bit high ? Remember that one scene in Billy Madison where they're having the debate and the proctor or whatever goes on that rant about making everybody dumber? Well imagine the exact opposite of that, and imagine he was saying it to you, cas that was an awesome post. Thought out, formatted, sourced, and it even had the math to back it up. Nice.   Why wouldn't they believe it?   It's true. 

Imagine there is someone in your city that is planning to bomb the local carnival.  Do you think it would be easier to find this person if you could monitor everyone's Internet and cell phone activity?   Of course it would. 

The fact is that you would be more secure due to huge violations of privacy for the tens of thousands of people that were *not* terrorists in order to stop the bombing.   Now imagine that this type of bombing only happens in your town every 100 years on average. 

Then the tradeoff is tens of thousands of people's privacy every single day for 100 years... In exchange for catching one bomber and maybe saving a few lives. 

The question is not "will we be safer? ",  it's "Is this minor security, increase worth it?.   I say no.   It's kind of like one of those leather bra things that people put on the front of their cars.   They say it keeps the car from getting chips in the paint that might make it look bad. ... So to prevent this,  they put this huge, stupid thing on their car that *guarantees* it will look bad.   Is it worth it?  Not in my opinion.  Uhhh...what?  Maybe for fibre services but DSL services don't work the same way with line transmission.  It makes complete sense that upload rates would be significantly lower until a time where ADSL Is no longer common. There's also the minor detail that 4K TV'S ALREADY FUCKING EXIST. It's not some magical future tech that we'll never see, like cold fusion or Google fiber in my area. It exists now, and is likely to gain in popularity until it becomes standard the way that HDTV did 6-7 years ago. This guy's argument is complete shit.  First off, THEY didn't by Cyanogen. There's a RUMOR that they're a minority investor. On top of that, the group who said that they intend to "Take Android away from Google" is not Microsoft, but Cyanogen. That's fine.  It's just super basic free internet, and I can't imagine the FCC would have a problem with it.  This is really aimed at those providers that refuse to build out and upgrade their networks while still charging exorbitant prices.  Google isn't one of the targets of this... and I'd argue they're one of the model citizens in the FCC's eyes. Area's with ADSL2 or Satellite only.  Another really interesting side-benefit of installing fiber and running it is that Google becomes a vertically integrated business - they own the search, they own the ads, and they own the wire (or fiber) you used to get to the search and the ads.  

Who knows if they'd do it (IMHO they would be stupid not to, morals excepted), but it means their data centers can access your bits as they fly across the wire - meaning they can collect all sorts of interesting user habits based on your browsing (data is big money) and they won't even have the "who is this user IRL?" problems since they'll have an account holder's physical name/address for each fiber account.

 My phone was old and I wanted a new one. They wouldn't let me get a new one without switching to a new plan. In the end, it doesn't really matter. The price is the same and I never use enough data to hit the cap thanks to using wifi while at home.

Still, I wasn't a fan of the situation. Unless of course you pay per gb. Then,  you always have full speed. It seems that QoS measures are enacted against unlimited customers only  They'll invest, and they'll wait and if they see a golden opportunity they'll make an offer that cant be refused. I have enjoyed Wheeler's recent comments and actions, makes it seem like he actually is listening to us. But the skeptic in me worries something bad is coming down the line.

And yeah, I would absolutely love to get more than my current 18 dl speeds, but even that is 50 bucks a month.  Technically the channels may be duplex, but reducing any speed will reducing the workload on the routers. For consumers download is more important. For servers it is the other way around. To be fair, there was a lot of hype surrounding the idea at the time and then I walked in and tossed a gigantic bucket of cold water over it. When I finally busted out some math and showed them that even when assuming a *ridiculously* low unit cost for the panels and not factoring in labor or the cost to remove the previous roadway it would still be on the order of $100 billion just to install them on the highways of one state they finally came around to my way of thinking.  G3 kicks ass When you find someone suspicious/threatening, you don't necessarily even arrest them.  That kills off any future intelligence gathering through that channel because the "bad guys" know it's being monitored.  You just keep watching until it goes dry or you find out an attack is imminent and then you act.  Announcing the arrest would appeal to the "Murica, fuck yeah!" segment, but would not be beneficial to future intelligence gathering efforts. Unfortunately, this post has been removed.

Make sure to sign up for Comcast's blazing fast HyperBand internet! &gt; You haven't come up with any limits, and the Titanic certainly isn't giving us a limit that's can be applied to this sort of scenario.

Humans need to run the systems. In the case of the Titanic it was designed to withstand icebergs and to delay sinking, similar to how nuclear plants are designed to not melt down and shut down safely, but a combination of errors (skimping costs by using cheap screws, bad disaster management on the ship, not bringing enough lifeboats etc.) it all turned out to be a disaster after all, despite the plan being technically sound. Why? Human imperfections. There are a lot of fools around, our shit needs to be fool-proof. I'm pretty sure they set that record because they recently were able to start selling the iphone in china. And then receiving an envelope with the said pictures in it, with the text "It would be shame if these got released to the public. How 'bout voting them Democrats this year?" I've found this service one week ago. It's amazing. But now :-/ I don't know. I was thinking about connecting Amazon S3 to picturelife account and store my photos there while using picturelife's  service. That was the best thing I have ever seen. Hope they'll keep it.

I do not like Carousel or Google service since they know too much about me + it's very easy to mistakenly share personal photo with whole world, Google+ app suggest it every damn time I open it. It would be nice to have some comments from picturelife here. As far as I know picturelife cofounder has an account here on reddit. Can't not upvote &gt; $10 per 50GB block.

Double Amazon's EC2 transfer cost is a bit much ($0.20 vs $0.09 per GB for EC2). Charging this amount for a slow transfer rate is pretty ridiculous.  Or... you could try another phone. Reading up, that sounds pretty harsh. 5down/1up should be more than enough for most internet use for their Essentials pack. No, you need to take a step back and learn some reading comprehension.

There is no way to possibly know 100% of all possible threats no matter what, that is the goal which is unattainable. The methodology used (bulk collection, targeted. whatever) won't get you 100% of the threats, no method will.  But it's possible that only 45% of americans are internet-litterate, as in use the internet for anything other than facebook. Actually, I think the purpose  of it is that when they convene next month to decide if "broadband is being deployed in a timely manner" they can say: "20% of Americans don't have broadband, your not doing your job". 

And then they have an argument for Title II reclassification.   Information wants to be free! that looks a great link with some relevant discussion too.   I am not sure this forces anything. It sounded like if you want to sell "broadband" internet it needs to meet a certain requirements. Probably the companies can label lesser speed connections something else and get away with it. "Moderate speed" internet or probably something a little more catchy then that like 'Consumer level internet'?  Probably not. Remember the "better pizza" commercial? It seems bragging on TV is not illegal.  It looks and feels like repackaged chrome. It is of course using chrome code but really there is nothing different. A very relevant vid on valve economics in games: http://youtu.be/RHC-uGDbu7s ...except for me and my monkey. &gt; Announcing the arrest would appeal to the "Murica, fuck yeah!" segment, but would not be beneficial to future intelligence gathering efforts.
 
How can you arrest a group of people on terrorist conspiracy charges without *anyone* finding out about it?  Haul them off to a secret government prison in the middle of the night?  I'm sure the neighbors will notice government agents swarming the building with combat gear and assault rifles.  
 
&gt;  You just keep watching until it goes dry or you find out an attack is imminent and then you act.
 
If the channel went dry then that means they didn't stop a terrorist attack (there was no serious one planned in the first place).  If an attack was imminent then they would arrest them, and we would hear about it on the news (or through word of mouth, on reddit, etc.)  "A swat team swarmed the neighbors' house last night and arrested a bunch of Muslims!  Check these pics out!"  You realize you're comparing sales of an entire year (2013) to sales of one quarter of a year (Q42014), right? Obviously the numbers will be significantly less... Auto-4fps INNOVATION yeah... that is was worse than /r/conspiracy. What if there was a world where you could have both. I know, crazy. Dare to dream. No it's not. 5up/1down is shit. We don't live in a shitty country and we have given them BILLIONS of dollars of tax payer money to provide HIGH SPEED internet. 5down is not high speed. What Sprint struggled with here, and what T-Mobile continues to struggle with, is backhaul.  Some of the sites in this area are pretty remote. WOW a hole 0.1 seconds now its really fast  You're mostly right about download being more important to consumers. But just try uploading a ton of pictures to Flickr or whatever... Fuck my dad can't even get DSL. He's on 56kbps dial-up. Huskyband? Well, if you consider it's just an (over the air) software update that's pretty impressive... 45% of those polled.  I don't remember them asking my opinion. &gt; I doubt it will make a difference.

It requires that any deployment which uses Universal Service Fund money to meet these minimum specifications. Since this fund pays for **billions** a year in construction of telecommunications infrastructure it does play an important role in moving internet speeds upward.  Take the road as a metaphor, the FCC is trying to regulate the width of the road, but not the speed of the traffic, which, in cyberspace, means "unlimited". I think you're leaving out some information here. My guess is that you left out that there were active construction workers around, in which case, slow the fuck down.  That is the same thing... The argument is that complete privacy is not valuable in the modern world because it decreases your security. There's no strawman. That's literally the point.

And it's absurd to say there is no evidence a single terrorist has ever been stopped... First off everything they find is classified, but more so the whole point of the program is prevention. You can't prove that an attack was prevented.  The conversions, in case anyone is curious.

Also, cannot wait for really short low quality gifs running at 60s per frame that this will create. Also watermarks :3c~ Yeah, 45% of Americans would rather torrent with no risk than in invest in security. Not surprised.  Fuck you, you have no idea how much I pay in taxes BUT WHO IS PHONE? was that ruling just for wireless or landlines too? True, but your original post only mentioned your cap, not picture quality.  Yes it really impressive just imagine what else telsa is going to do in the future Western companies should be just as concerned about the proposed American cybersecurity law. I wonder if David Petraeus
Former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency is prolly one of them?

Or if he is conflicted. Also, 50% of American's are below average intelligence so it looks like about 5% of dumb people think national security is more important than Internet privacy.  They just want legal justification for what they and the US have been doing for years.


Can we all just agree that THIS IS COMPLETELY WRONG ON ALL LEVELS.
 I, to this day, cannot understand this "privacy" entitlement issue. Someone provides a service, typically at no cost to you. You choose to use that service of your own volition. And then you get mad at the company for operating how it was when you signed up for it. It's not the company's or service's fault if you recklessly sign up for stuff. And these same people crying that their information is being distributed or whatever then go and take those Facebook surveys of "What Star Wars character are you?" or whatever and answer one personal question after another not even realizing they're just giving this information away for free but mad when people have. Don't want people to know it, THEN DON'T SHARE IT. Don't trust a service with your information, then DON'T USE IT! It's their for your convenience but it does NOT belong to you. They can know my spending habits. They can know my addresses and favorite color. I'd rather have businesses have my preferences than as a man to be getting tampon ads. Target ad me. I'd MUCH prefer to see stuff I'm interested in than stuff I'm not. I'd much rather business use the information to make products people want as opposed to going off small focus groups. This malarkey is just sensationalism at it's finest. It isn't hurting you. It isn't hurting anyone. Don't hurt IT. That's my nutshell opinion. Bash away.  Its absolutely incredible to think a car can now be tuned with a software update! In other news 55% off people are retarded, probably the people who think online privacy shouldn't be granted to all are against abortion, gay marriage and weed legalization. That's a strawman argument.  People don't accept other people standing outside their houses looking into their homes with video camera's.  So why is it acceptable for the government to do that with our online activities?  The argument has nothing to do with "wrong doing" and everything to do with a right to privacy.

 That just means they're evaluating how much to set the data cap at whenever they do enforce it. Good luck.  Perhaps you need to learn some reading comprehension yourself.  I never said all threats, i said "a threat". 

Of course it's not possible to detect 100% of threats. The goal, which should be painfully obvious, is to detect as many as possible. You just responded to a guy who's pushing 40 about the internet being used 'lightly' by older people.  Everyone seems to think that when the old generation dies out everything will be better, but I've got news for you: The new generation is and will be just as authoritarian as the ones before it. A significant portion of people simply gravitate toward authoritarian mindsets, and that's not a generational thing. Nope. No construction, not a school zone, nothing. And on a clean driving record.  I believe that response was from waze.. Landlines I think. Monetizing crime seems like a poor idea to me, if they have to collect fines I say don't let police departments directly benefit from it because it just becomes a means for revenue generation instead of what the police were originally intended for which is peace keeping and law enforcement. Source code you can execute directly  How so? I don't think someone is the r word simply because of this reason. This survey doesn't point out that people don't care at all, just simply they think it is more important. You're doing God's work son  Yeah no, there are a multitude of reasons why that won't work... The important question is what percentage of Americans are idiots with bad opinions that we should ignore?  I say all the ones that actually think God hear their prayers in Jesus is coming back from the dead are a good place to start. yes but then at least you have some sort of legal basis to work against it, rather than none. It's only a very small difference in the US maybe, but it is a start. And without a start, you kinda cannot make change. Hello!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) if you have any questions or concerns.* Just checked my ISP's website, the service tier I have is called 'High Speed Internet' (10Mbps down). I hoped it was labeled 'broadband' so I could call and complain, catching them on a technicality. Maybe I would have been able to score a credit on my account or something. Oh, well.

Overall, I'm glad the FCC made this rule, hopefully better speeds come from it. Or maybe, we will still get shitty speeds and all have it fly under the banner "High Speed Internet" &gt; How?

By knowing the distribution of new connections among the nodes it is a relay point for, and then could assume flatly that all connections use the same amount of traffic and that the distribution is representative for the network as a whole. And it could easily be. 

And to be honest, you could with high probability assume that each connection to an image / video heavy server will use more bandwidth than a connection to a mostly text based server.

Actually when talking about 80% of traffic that doesn't necessarily have to mean total transfer, but it can just as well be % connected to / sessions. And for that they don't need to know the amount of data.

TL;DR quite easily, if they got enough relays. Where in DFW? The fine for 10 over in Dallas County is $201.10. I find it hard to believe that anything around here will be 2x more without some extra charges tacked on top. &gt; The goal, which should be painfully obvious, is to detect as many as possible.

That's the point I was making, to what end will we go to detect "as many as possible" when we don't even have a realistic figure on what is possible? The point is that the race to capture up these "threats" is throwing alot of caution to the wind all in the name of safety, but the reality is that you can never be 100% safe and it's insane to try to be 100% safe because life has risk, we've already given up so many of our rights in the name of safety and I don't see an end in sight. I think we all need to stop living in fear and accept that bad things happen in the world and sometimes those things are going to happen to use. Unfortunately, this post has been removed.

 5edgy6me Have you any proof they havent? Yes!  The point is not whether it is executable, but whether it is meant for humans to express ideas to each other.  

If it is expressive, it enjoys First Amendment protection. If it is not expressive, the government is not forbidden from regulating it.

My take is that if it is written, read, and modified by humans, then it is probably protected.

If it is converted from a human-readable form to a form not customarily directly used by humans, it is not protected (but the human readable parent is).   If you then disassemble the code into assembly (and maybe comment it to really nail down the human expression part), then it is likely protected.

 Just wait though.  I suspect as they continue to loose money from legacy video subscriptions being canceled, they will start to enforce the cap, or conveniently charge you for overage. Speak how you will but let the good guys catch the (real) terrorists. It's not intentional.  It is a technology issue with the way Internet is delivered today over coaxial cable.   Fiber to the home does not have the same technology issue which is why it's usually symmetrical speeds.  mega ultra good time wow wow? So what does this mean for us then? I have crappy internet service. So now they just advertise it as non-broadband and the world continues on as usual? Someone submitted a link to this comment in the following subreddit:

This comment was posted by a bot, see /r/Meta_Bot for more info. Please respect rediquette, and do not vote or comment on the linked submissions. Thank you. 40 isn't old  Corncast with kerning looks pretty similar. Servers for what? Where in space?  "Putting servers in space could potentially remedy the energy problem, since they could be powered by free, plentiful solar radiation. And, Parker adds, the space environment would be advantageous for spinning disk drives. Zero-gravity allows the drives to spin with less resistance, and the extreme cold in space means the servers could process faster without overheating."

There is a reason why the ISS's power consumption is carefully monitored and overheating is a problem. With space being a vacuum you lose all the advantages of conduction and convection for heat dissipation and rely solely on radiation.

Also assuming geostationary (because otherwise you need a butt-tonne of ground stations) it would also be subject to being warmed on the sun side and no power on the dark side.

Hilariously poor research. Try again ConnectX. Seems it's a bit a click bait headline, I'm not defending the politicians in France, curious of what is true and what is not though. My local ISP is Armstrong Cable.

Monthly caps are set at 150 GBs on their 10 Mbps connection.  You get an additional 50 GBs added to the cap if you buy cable and another if you also buy their phone service (aka landline).

It's quite the racket, but they're the only option.  Thankfully they're a local company so their customer service, etc. isn't utter crap because they're not a bloated mess.

It also isn't absurdbly expensive.  It's $70-ish a month for the cheapest cable package and the internet.  Not great, but it could be so much worse.

Now that I think about it, I'm fairly sure that it's now 15 Mbps and a 200 cap with just internet now.  But the price also went about about $5 so yeah... This is a thin, thin ray of hope. national security means the security of the american rich and powerful elite not of the majority, the working people 'Old' is a rather subjective term. no law saying they cant call slow speed "high speed internet" I don't buy it because I can't. I'm stuck paying for 7down and getting roughly 4 and not even 1up, and paying similar for what you mention 25/3 SHOULD be.  I am Imagine Snowden working for Russia.  the distinction is stupid

they ARE banking on the fact that the average person doesn't know how to compile source code
 Most of the examples given are equating security to the ability to keep unauthorized users from accessing some secured function or data. Yet these examples of security don't draw any distinction between normal law abiding users and users seeking to do harm. How would such measures differentiate between, say a criminal organization from setting up a secured communication system to contact overseas members, from a standard corporate communications system? It is for your average Reddit user, but not a family on low income who is unlikely to have a Netflix account or do much online gaming. It is however entirely adequate for paying your tax bill, reading email or accessing Wikipedia.

I am not defending Comcast on this one (who have a hilariously bad track record of customer service). I am simply saying that I would gladly accept a guaranteed adequate speed over an occasional higher one. I'm with you.. It's like we'll give the consumers this win, but we're give you cable companies the the net neutrality win in the future. Don't you mean "to server and COLLECT"? :P
 Describing London though I do like it quite a bit. How was he wrong?  Those graphs show the iphone 6 and 5s rather close in scores.  The "stats" were not a big step up, and they didn't have to be as that was not the big draw with this model.   [Actually, a federal judge found that the "better ingredients, better pizza" violated the Lanham Act.](http://www.qsrmagazine.com/news/court-strikes-better-ingredients-better-pizza)

[The Fifth Circuit reversed](http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C00/00-10071.cv0.wpd.pdf) but I can't find any subsequent history so I'm not sure how it ended up. Apple and Microsoft certainly took a bite out of the total share, but within the Android market, several other manufacturers have stepped up their game.

LG, Asus and Motorola have gained popularity and respect with their contributions to Google's Nexus product line, while Samsung hasn't contributed a phone since 2011. HTC and Sony devices have also been more prominent in the market than before. My thoughts exactly lol. 


The US is calling for vendors to stop selling their products there lmao. I guess installing backdoors for the US is OK So this low income family shouldn't be able to watch educational videos at high resolutions?  We're getting closer to the truth. It's all about collection.

Now the police need to be asked this question: if Waze slows down 50 speeders or a speed trap nets 5 tickets, which is better for the public?

Cops should be working with Waze, not against. So next police starts to flood the app with false data of police activity making users guess if it's real or not, which leads to people either driving slower all the time (win) or ditching the app and risking possibility of getting caught (win for the coppers) I don't think that there is a 'THEY'.   

THEY (defense/security establishment) want to regulate crypto, but the US Constitution prevents it.

So they regulate what they can.

Incidentally, it doesn't matter if the average person can't compile source code.

The package manager on a Linux/BSD/Mac computer compiles source for you.  You just have to know how to type "port install gnupg".

You run source code all the time in your browser as javascript, and you can get [PGP in javascript](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs).

And, besides, the government gave up after this decision:  I think the rule is that you can export any crypto you want, but you have to make source code available.  And you *want* open source crypto anyway.

 Counterpoint- To get the .001%, they need/want/have to get 100%. That seems to be what the theory is with the lot of these programs.  i suppose that is the struggle. 

I can accept that bad things will happen, but that's not to say that it should be easy for bad people to do bad things.

 So the majority prefer security over privacy? Along with The Terminator's James Cameron. most of isp's actually have data caps, but many do not enforce it... i have uverse(6Mb) and cable (16Mb) and the uverse has a data cap of something like 500GB that has never been enforced while the cable actually does not have a data cap

but i know someone else in town still using old ATT DSL with a cap of 300GB that has been getting bills for overages What the fuck is wrong with the other 55? &gt;Some people believe that we are on a path to interplanetary teleportation. Should we include the estimated bandwidth for that as well?," asked [Michael O'Reilly]
When the data throughput speeds needed for interplanetary teleportation have been outdated for a few years, then sure we can redefine that standard too. I guess?  I'm still confused as to what this metaphor is trying to achieve. Unless you live in Hail prone areas like Tornado alley laws try to draw lines about allowable expression when there are no reasonable ways to The NSA doesn't want to share a back door with China.  Next thing they'll put up a chore wheel. People, that's it. My friends are on Xbox, so I am too. I do remember the phrase "better pizza" was still used for a while after that and then I don't see their ads nowadays any more. My thinking is "better pizza" is subjective but "better ingredients" is the misleading part as to whether or not they were actually using better "ingredients". Sounds great to me, but I never thought anyone said it was totally anonymous, just not fed oversight. There is a little anonymity with no names being used and it takes some doing to track down, also there are no log files on servers to trace, so a truly concerted effort has to be put forth to find a person so it is still much better than most forms of currency in this regard.

I just wish they would stop saying it harbors crime as it is no different than cash in this regard. A 1080p/4mbps stream is eminently watchable. However I will conceded that 8 meg is a significantly improved experience.

5 meg will be hopelessly inadequate for 4k viewing though. &gt;Most surprisingly, when presented with the statement 'Personal online privacy is not as important as national security', 45 percent disagreed.

That's a vague statement to poll on. I bet everyone involved would have a different interpretation of what the statement was implying. &gt;Apple says it has no access to the codes, but under the proposed antiterrorism law, it would be required to provide a key so that the Chinese government could decrypt data stored on iPhones. While this isn't news to me, that's only because I follow "paranoid" subs like /r/privacy and /r/NSALeaks. Good that this is getting exposure in a bigger sub. And what percentage believe national security is just an excuse to erode online privacy?  Trash evil company I hope they do and get banned from the service. 4mbps might work if you were getting that the whole time and nobody else is using the internet in the house.  It's called The Privacy Act, look it up. I don't think *you* know what your argument is, at this point.  You're just spewing words. By far a more pressing matter would contention of the local network.

Instantly making everyone's connection 5 times faster wont help in the long run. The way the federal government uses the term "National Security" to cover whatever they please, makes it no longer a credible argument. I'm glad people see that. ok If we follow the energy equation (since the more energy, the more horrible the death), for the first one (23 in 20) should be $129, for the second (50 in 40) $900, for (80 in 75) $775 and for (85 in 75) $1600. U wrong man. Its realy major significantion. CF still feels like plastic. The privacy act is around disclosure of identifiable information by a company to third parties, as well as giving individuals the right to access and correct any records held by said company. It does not prohibit a company from altering its database for its own use. Again, please prove me wrong. yes it would, even so more in the long run. Really insightful! Then you for your work. Wow, you can actually download more speed.

*"I'm givin' her all she's got, Captaaa...oh wait, there's an update."* If this is a serious rant, I'd like you to fellate me.  What direction were the riot shields facing during Occupy Wall Street? Were they protecting the 99%, organized labor, the people who had their hard-earned savings gambled away by crooks trying to make a quick buck using someone else's property as collateral? Because if they aren't just hired thugs of the 1%, and Michael Bloomberg is solidly 1%, mayor at the time, and finance investment magnate, what are they? Finally, humanity wins for a change! Nothing online is private.  Never has, never will.   Cunt cast It's just like downloading extra RAM, but this actually works :P The Boston bombing couldn't be stopped and around that time the whole NSA thing was undiscovered and in full effect.  It's ok retarded is a medical term. 

With that out of the way I just feel like certain issues comes down to morality versus mentality. 

Pro life, anti weed, anti gay marriage, and anti privacy have the moral trend

Pro choice, pro weed, pro gay marriage and pro privacy are not based on morality but based on self determinism. 

Not to say there aren't overlaps between the moral and the deterministic crowd. It's just not that frequent. We live in a society whose fabric is becoming more emotional than logical so of course if people think they are a target of terrorism they'll give everything away including privacy and emotion is how they play the moral crowd. Would you like to see destruction and death around you because you gave terrorist privacy? I have nothing to hide so it doesn't matter to me, etc etc. Those are how people who are anti privacy feel I think I speak for some when I say, "hold on to your hats". This could get ugly.  Then it should be a breach of contract if Comcast wants to limit you below that and you're paying for "Broadband service" He some how found a pair.  No, you're a normal person. My father helped deploy the cable internet system in our area, I've read the spec manuals and seen the technical design sheets. The upload limitation is artificial. I'm not guessing, I'm passing along facts that I know You can't say "your move Apple" when it's Dell that's catching up to Apple. if you're talking about price point, people are still going to pay for the Apple name.  Survey sample is too small for this to be credible. It's not our job to fucking deal with them.  I say let them come, give all Americans a reason to eradicate them.  Not just a bullshit pearl harbor. I'd be fine with an aggregate speed cap. You get 25Mbps and you can allocate it to up/down stream however you'd like.

Asymmetric caps are bullshit. Hell, I've been on the highway next to some stupid cop poking along, with everyone refusing to pass him.

Cop gets off on the exit and BAM! We're all doing 25 over. 

Waze just helps us keep tabs on their predatory speed traps. They're just pissed because for once, technology is empowering the public they 'serve', and not their thieving asses. But we need national security to guard against our infrastructure. We need to know what people are doing so that evil doers will be thwarted. 

/s That's like saying that stealth is worthless because it isn't totally invisible. It's a lot better than having bank statements printed out. But if you're looking to run a multi-million dollar drug ring, maybe you need a bit more. Also, don't they have access to his personal machine?  We had 100 up and down, unfettered since mid 2000's in Japan. Welcome to before 10 years ago. Wow that number for Solar PV seems incredibly low!  Very informative link.   I bet they are already in existing devices and western tech companies are bone the wiser. To be fair, DSL has an upper limit and it is "your" lines that degrade the speed.

Mine is 24Mb up for example and I have hit 20+ so I think it is really OK. Sure, if they sold it to me as 20 and I get 20+ yeah nice but in this case I don't think they can tell really.

On a sidenote, I had problems with the line when it was really hot, 35-37 or more, the link wasn't over 10-11Mb and reinitialized at least every day. Company came and fixed it (1 capacitor in a tele plug &amp; copper oxidation) for free.

Just sayin' lol no


45% of the people they asked said that


 The burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim.

I know they didn't stop the Boston Bombing, or Sandy Hook, or Auroa Colorado, or the underwear bomber (although luckily he accidentally lit himself on fire instead of detonating the bomb). 

So there's four major "security threats" I know they didn't stop. Do you have ANY proof or evidence to show that they have been effective?

If you have any questions, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology). We apologize for the inconvenience. 25/3 Mbps is fucking atrocious. Just to be clear Mb = Megabit, MB = Megabyte

In megabytes per second that's 3.125 download, 0.375 upload.

Not sure if they made a typo or what, shit's ridiculous. *If you're full of shit, baffle them with it!*

-Comcast rule #9 for dealing with the outside world I think I speak for a majority when I say *no one fucking cares what you pay in taxes*. If youd like to pay less taxes which in turns into other people paying more in fines than you can surely fellate me.  I don't see it as a threat, I see it as a continuation of the human race. Its not really wasting money. You have to build the structure to support the solar panels anyway, for some companies it might be a better pill to swallow, putting up the infrastructure for solar, and then in the future, slapping panels on top of that existing structure.  &gt; achieve the same effect

Funding the police department? in other news 55 percent of Americans think National Security is more important than online privacy I think online trust would be greatly increased if we were to switch from an "opt-out" system to the "opt-in" system, which is customary in the EU.  Not really. We're not talking about supporting a iphone 3G. We're talking about a phone you can buy right now that's effectively not part of the full Android experience. Where as any iphone I buy now Apple supports with the latest OS and each was is powerful enough to run 3D games which means basically any standard app is going to have no problem running on a for sale iphone. Shhhh, my desktop PC is listening. Nothing bad can possibly come from a technology project whose name is a cross between "SkyNet" and "Cylon". He just said hes going to an iPhone This is the internet. You can write asshole,  we won't tell your mom It's unfair to compare a wireless service with TimeWarner/Comcast bullshit. 

It's outside of their ability if your building acts like a Faraday cage and interferes with the signal or any other number of reasons that the signal might be garbled near you.  More like a False Dichotomy. &gt; Would love a demographic breakdown of this poll. I feel like a lot of older Americans would value national security over online privacy, as they ~~grew up during Cold War paranoia and they don't see the Internet as important as younger Americans.~~ don't understand shit about technology

See: Supreme court justice Scalia

 Considering the sidebar states that the titles are to be exact quotes of the article, I did just that.

Your comment is pointless. I actually agree with your comment.  Which is why we need more young people to consistently vote. Young people have the most to loose when a corporation/government wants access to your personal life. The asymmetrical speeds with home broadband connections is due to the design of the infrastructure, not due to an artificial (software) limit.

There is a finite amount of spectral bandwidth supported by a given medium and a finite amount of data that can fit onto a given carrier frequency.

DOCSIS cable operates over a carrier frequency of 5 to 750MHz. The downstream portion (analog tv, digital tv, hdtv, ppv, internet down, etc) is defined as using 54MHz+, with the downstream data using 678 to 690MHz. Only the 10 to 42MHz portion is allocated for upstream data.

You can 'fit' a lot more data into a 678MHz carrier frequency than you can into a 10MHz one. The same kind of thing happened with DSL. Lower frequencies were used for upstream data. 

Lower frequencies are used because it is makes it easier to transmit lower quality signals over longer distances.

Fiber to the home would remove a lot of the problems and reasoning for the limitations. An asymmetrical limit on a fiber connection would likely be artificial. (However, if it is just a fiber medium carrying a DOCSIS signal, then it would have similar limits as above.) Yeah, definitely a concern, but I've had their internet since Windows NT was a thing, so I guess about 20 years now?  And it hasn't been an issue yet.  I do tech support for them now and nothing has come down the pipes about plans for it either. I know they make those license plate blockers, there is a spray you can apply to defeat red light cameras, and a plastic cover that does the same.  I don't want to pay for all that nor do I know how effective they are.  I have some of those monitor privacy screens that block your view of the monitor at an angle.  I'm wondering if I can cut these down and screw them on over my license plate if it will work and if it is legal.  Anyone know if any of these options would work against this type of surveillance? I'm still a little confused about the infrastructure, but I think most of what you said makes sense. Thanks for taking the time for the explanation. Well this has been posted about 1/2 million times anyway so your post was pointless I'd agree, but I've had internet with them for a good 20 years now and it's never been the case.  They're also raising caps pretty significantly with the gigabit internet they're starting to roll out, also matching upload and download on that so it's a gig up and down which is pretty nice considering it costs the same as their ultimate 165/20 deal they have now.  It wouldn't surprise me if they did enforce it, but so far nothing has really shown that they intend to. they want both, they want revenue and the stats. This is brilliant, and straight out of the type of PR wars that Reis and Trout write about.

Take their strong point (LOOK! WE HAVE FASTER INTERWEBZ) and turn it against them. They can't now argue, "just kidding, we don't have fast internet". The more they promote, the more it makes Wheeler's point. lots of places have covered parking. putting a panel on top of that is not a big deal So can I see your email and web history then? And maybe your online banking statements for the last few years? And how about your facebook messenger history? Do you use tinder or eHarmony? I'd like a look at those messages as well. Feel free to pm me the info any time today or tomorrow. You've got nothing to hide so you've got nothing to fear right?

 I may be a stranger on the internet but hey, so's the random dude contracted for the NSA.  That would be funny. OK? So? I was just saying that expensive computers should have 8GB minimum, not that they NEED to be upgradable. I understand that they can shave a few mm off by soldering them in, but if the computer is going to cost $1000 it should have at least 8GB, any less is a joke. I only mentioned the thin ones being non-upgradable because it's not a deal-killer for thicker ones to ship with only 4GB if they have SODIMMs because you can upgrade it. I bought a ThinkPad a couple years ago for $650 with just 4GB RAM. 4GB is pathetic, but that was OK because I upgraded it to 16GB as soon as I took it out of the box. But I'd never buy an expensive ultrabook with 4GB soldered in RAM. Links? I did do a search prior and saw nothing. the more efficient you make the "weight-generator" the more energy you are taking from cars, meaning you are making them LESS fuel efficient Obama handed them to him, finally. Thank you brother, but no worries, I have been within the light of GabeN for some time now :) Just because they change the definitions doesn't mean Comcast and co will start offering Broadband at cheaper prices. My speed now classified as dial up.  "barring actual equipment failure" - obviously, if you actually read my original post, you can see that I understand physical limitations. That isn't what anybody is talking about. Don't try to turn this into an argument on semantics. The point is that we are regularly sold the "up to x speed", and often get half of that. Tell us what you expect you CAN do, not what might happen at 5 AM on alternate Tuesdays. So is this why Yahoo News stories seem like they're written by ten year olds? It's not nonsense.  I can't get downloads from Steam, for instance, at more than around 150Mbps.  It's not my ISP's fault, the bottleneck is somewhere outside of their control.  My ISP can't guarantee that I'll get 1Gbps speeds to everything, so the connection is sold as "up to". http://i.imgur.com/wCsLk5H.png Hi there, I'm not sure this is a surge issue... I'm not 100% sure what the issue is.

Some of the equipment was thrown out years ago before I knew the issues.  I still have the dead xbox and a dead PC.  One thing I haven't mentioned is that taking components out of an effected PC and placing them in a virgin new PC build can have very very bad effects (seems to damage the new PC).  In one case it killed it altogether.   My current PC build has an old harddrive from one of the destroyed systems and whilst the PC works fine... I always get a SATA error on startup.  Yes I know it's weird - it doesn't make sense - but it IS happening.  I am contacting an engineer who does a video blog today to look at this. Unfortunately, this post has been removed.

I think its a joke. Comcast is going to sue him for stealing their technology  god damn, who keeps putting these guys in charge of stuff when they seemingly know nothing about it? There's so many laws now, that everyone is a criminal multiple times a day. Wheeler is a middle aged man. He made his money and is nearing the end of his working life.(retirement) Like most people he has to think about his place in the world. Maybe he realizes that his actions will determine how he is viewed for the rest of time. As someone who destroyed innovation or as the FCC commissioner who moved the USA into the 21st Century. In that case maybe. But in this sense all they have to do is remove the Broadband part of "High-Speed Broadband Internet" and be fine. Especially to a non-informed consumer.  not necessarily a zero-sum here, the market is saturated at this point and Samsung has known this would be a tough year for handsets The yes/no "question" to which pollsters responded needs to be modified. "Internet privacy is less important than national security" implies that the latter is an alternative, when what we're being presented with is a series of questionable half-measures that have resulted in a lot of inconvenience and no actual, substantive contribution to our security. 

Since 9/11/2001, over 400 TSA screeners have been arrested for theft of travelers' belongings, but not one terrorist has been caught, nor has a plot been foiled as a result. 

Suddenly, buying drugs, or knockoff products, or pirated media "helps terrorists" instead of simply being a matter of theft or fraud. 

We have a massive new government bureau with its own cabinet position which, of the 15 US government departments, is the third most heavily-funded (defense and veterans' affairs are #1 and #2 respectively); it cannot account for large amounts of said funding, nor can it point to any terrorist plots which have been foiled. 

Multiple independent investigations have concluded that various government bureaus engaged in overlapping activities, but refusing to share information, had the knowledge that was needed to stop the 9/11 attacks; there were FBI agents following the hijackers around *outside of the US* before they even started taking flying lessons, with the CIA and the NSA also being aware of them. That these people were out there, and were up to something, were known qualities; it's not like somebody missed a memo and there simply wasn't a clue.

Our government agencies are abducting foreign nationals and US citizens alike, holding them without formal charges being filed, and torturing them for information. People who were never charged with a crime have died from the conditions in which they are being held. Nobody can point to any useful intelligence that was gathered through these tactics, but military and FBI agents *can* point to individuals who were cooperating via the establishment of a rapport, under humane treatment, prior to the CIA taking over their interrogations. 

What we have in effect is a simple, obvious state of no privacy for some other agenda, whether the conspiracy theorists are right--and we're on the road to becoming an Orwellian police state--or it's simply a less overtly malevolent invasion of privacy. IMO, it's the same psychological state we get when teenagers, upon first being provided with digital cameras and camera-phones, began snapping pictures of people out in public without asking their permission and uploading them to the internet for a cheap laugh. People do bad things at others' expense when it's easy to do, and to get away with it. &gt;45 Percent Of Americans Think Online Privacy Is More Important Than National Security

So, 55% of americans think national security is more important than online privacy . The majority has spoken! Democracy must prevail ! Fuck your privacy !
