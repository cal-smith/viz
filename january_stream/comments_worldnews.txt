The word 'Dutch' means 'from Belgium' where you come from? I would imagine that the strategic value of the location of Guantanamo Bay has decreased a lot since he days of the Spanish American war.

You're hit by 2-3 hefty fines before they even consider dumping you in jail. And even then, you really only get caught when you're really fucking unlucky and a rare cop car spots you, or if some asshole decides to rat on you (which never happens).

So it's really a pretty rare occurrence. I saw more cop cars when I went to the US for 2 weeks than I did in Singapore for the entirety of 2014. http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-07/news/mn-13892_1_soviets I don't think you understand evolution very well. I suggest you do some research for yourself. It really isnt that hard.  What this gentleman seems to really be saying is the problem is not so much with religion, but with he tribalistic aspects of religion that lead people to be intolerant, unaccepting, and fearful of others who are different (xenophobic). 

I am not a religious person, but I think his assumptions are a bit misguided. Religion does not create xenophobic tendencies, but can be used to support such pre-existing world views. There are plenty of people who exhibit these tribalistic qualities without believing in a deity just as there are people who are very religious who do not exhibit these tendencies.  I was assuming by your statement that you were in support of am exchange People wanting a more reliable source. Oh look another Americunt ignoring evidence but accepts random propaganda as fact I live in the suburbs in the us...the closest thing is like a convenience store a mile away...I have to drive everywhere. Except when im at college, where i can walk to almost everywhere. Except for like grocery, but then I dont have a car so i have to get a ride from someone. Its tough m8. ANYONE ELSE THOUGHT OF [THIS](http://i.huffpost.com/gen/570504/thumbs/s-BLOBFISH-MEN-IN-BLACK-III-large300.jpg?4) IMMEDIATELY

  Honestly, I don't know about the tax so I won't comment on something I don't know. I just know that as the consumer, the goods that I had purchased were mostly counterfeits... How do I know they were counterfeited? You know they are counterfeited when your seller sends you a link as the product to his private download site along with an unique access code. Also I would be amazed if the rolex (which was tagged with "" = It's real totes not fake) I bought for less than 10 quid turned out to be real. That could feed the village for a week. &gt; I just think they have no right to argue about religion, like I have no right to argue about their personal beliefs

All personal beliefs should be open to inquiry; otherwise, the person who says: "I'm so sick of people telling me the earth goes around the sun or that vaccinations cure diseases or that I shouldn't behead apostates or hold slaves or that women are equal to men or that all races are of equal intelligence or defaming the King of Thailand isn't disgusting. Don't they know these are my personal beliefs?" is perfectly justified and will never be forced to reflect on why she believes these things or search for evidence to support her claims.  You're an idiot. There are way more reported rapes because in India there is the fear of reporting rape and being outcastes from your own family. Having loved there for a while, I know the year the girls go through. It's a third world country, comparing it using only the reported metric is laughable. Ahh, fun times. Its a shark with downs. We kind of are related to lettuce.. That's why countries have radars. Expecting military planes of other countries to at all times announce where they are and where they are going in international airspace is absurd.  I wish the mermaid story wasn't complete bs. No, it's likely that the animal in the video is in distress.  Many surface level encounters man has with deep-sea creatures are a result of an unhealthy animal in the process of dying.  There are some exceptions to this.  For instance, certain deep-dwelling squid (Giant &amp; Humbolt) may ascend from their usual depths to feed at night. britain has become a comedy show of its own.  R.I.P. strong gals. I wonder if the future could ever hold a day when no human dies to defend their lives? Such a beast humans seem to be... How can you swap ribosome genes, when a cell can't even develop without those genes. That's why they are so conserved it's the most important machinery in the cell. Literally every single point could be said about America. Literally. Too bad nobody in western europe can get a gun anywhere apart from a drive to syria and back again. Humans are dragging us down.

Without religion the world would just still be as fucked up Right here, sport If you ever find a cure just keep quiet about it while you pour it in the drinking water. Otherwise billions of people will be out for your head. Perhaps a war is needed, I can't see another way in which isis can be truly eradicated.  Haircuts? Good thing the pope is cool with gay dudes. He should have realized the internet is a threat to mankind, of course an intelligent independently working AI could be dangerous. Did he ever think of the world wide shift he caused after the invention of the internet though? Gates you already fucked up our culture we're all tv and internet people now. If all religions have extremists and they are a problem and they base their beliefs on a literal interpretation of the religious text then the religion is a problem. Furthermore it is often religion that suppresses education for the sake of keeping their followers ignorant and those same religions are sucking the money out of their followers pockets in order to build pretty buildings. Also, kids don't just pick up guns and kill people because you tell them, they do it when you brainwash them into believing that they have god on their side.

&gt;When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.  - HST I wish they would take UN intervention more seriously and that the UN would set standards for lasting peace in this conflict and then stick behind it. Insecurity is the problem holding back humanity. It is a problem in religion, politics, business, sports, relationships, and every other f&amp;@$in thing humans do! Different insecurities are more destructive to human progress than others! filter out the insecurity and religion becomes a more beautiful thing. One with a warhead and a rocket engine? That kinda drone?  Fallacy.

If there's a lot more than a few bad apples, something is very rotten in the orchard. **Source please, even one from Russia Today, that shows NATO mirroring the type of Russian actions we're seeing here.** You mean [that great big, empty building](http://latest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Vatican.jpeg)?

I searched for a tea set for my daughter two weeks ago. I ended up buying one from Craig's list.

 &gt; Where are the armies of interstellar super intelligent nanobots?

They're somewhere in between the stars, obviously. We will kill nature with technology. for someone who's a star trek nerd, their king doesn't fuck around. Life is fair now? When did this change? Yes the original article talks about them eating a sample of dorsal muscle. They prepared it three ways and apparently tempura style was preferred. This would seem that it's not particularly tasty.  Yeah, I was reading through the Wikipedia article on these things and was legitimately shocked after seeing that.  shitty luck shark So, it was you who rang the bells of awakening? It all seems to stem from an Isreali paper in the 80s, I'm not sure if it actually happened but here's an apparent version of events.:

http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-07/news/mn-13892_1_soviets

http://articles.philly.com/1988-02-26/news/26242928_1_islamic-liberation-organization-soviets-hezbollah

tl;dr:

- Hezbollah captures 4 soviet diplomats. 

- Russia opens up talks to get them freed.

- the body of one of the Soviet diplomats was found

- The KGB then apparently kidnaped and killed a relative of an unnamed leader of the Shias' Hezbollah

- Sent body parts to hezbollah, promising more to follow if the diplomats weren't freed.

- diplomats were freed.

- The newspaper quoted "observers in Jerusalem" as saying: "This is the way the Soviets operate. They do things--they don't talk. And this is the language Hezbollah understands."

tl;dr of tl;dr 

The KGB are more brutal than you, don't try and beat them that way.
 yes it does.  I can't really say that he's right or wrong because the article has no proof for how religion ties humanity down. Religion has done a lot of good things, but also a lot of bad things... trying to frame religion as just only bad or only good is just ignorance at it's finest.  Senpai finally noticed me! I'm telling you? ^this

 Given how much the world has changed in the past 100 years, I'd argue it's unwise to claim that we wont see intelligent AI in our lifetime. The problem is that AI doesn't need to be human-like to cause harm. It only needs to be able to cause harm. &gt; it's not a bad thing if they start to realise that once they get captured by another arab army they will face a medieval execution

They should hire women to carry out the executions. That will maximize the effect because dying at a woman's hand is what those guys are most afraid of. It's their Room 101.

Edit: No, it's not a myth. [In this interview](http://vimeo.com/116362347) an ISIS prisoner talks about how it is the worst fear of ISIS fighters that they get killed by female Peshmerga fighters.  Wow you're so fucking corrupt and stupid I just felt insulted being a human being.

**Not murdering people without trial is what seperates us from them, if you LOVE the way Jordan works feel free to fucking go there and experience the glory of dictatorships first-hand**

Fucking teenage shitheads being brave behind computer-screens having never experiences true war, misery or death. And yes before you ask I have my uncle was tortured for 6 years, they broke his spine 4 times.  I went to a school in the South that actually taught us about that though. 

And can....can you provide me a source, even one from Russia Today, that shows the United States &amp; NATO mirroring what we're seeing Russia do now-a-days in regards to this? My favorite part of these comments is that no one read the article and is commenting purely based on the title. After that Russia arrested a woman for high treason for her informing ukrainian embassy about russian soldiers go to Donbass. Pfft. *Amateur*. I've jacked it four times since I opened this thread. dunkey pls Exactly what don't people get about this. This is the reason for the denial of the Armenian genocide in Turkey:

&gt;["It is not possible for those who belong to the Muslim faith to carry out genocide," Erdogan told ruling party members.](http://www.haaretz.com/news/turkey-pm-israel-war-crimes-worse-than-sudan-1.4547)

And it's also why they will never recognize it happened. They are now trying to make their position appear more rational by claiming they simply don't have any evidence but this is utter bullshit and insulting. The religious on this site love to pull this bullshit. Don't talk about extremist beliefs in Islam, don't talk about Christian kiddiefuckers or the suppression of education, just say /r/Atheism is leaking and /r/circlejerk and pretend that a bunch of Atheists making mean comments is the same as religious extremism and the whole thing is magically solved!   
  
I am all of having a reasonable and respectful discussion on belief, faith and religion, but on this site anyone who isn't religious is painted as a horrible person. You know, the kind of thing Jesus would do... And thank god too, that's a face only a mother could love. I always felt the [Basking shark](http://imgur.com/gallery/aP2zU) was more deserving of the title "Megamouth" Just another edgy comment about religion.

The issue isn't religion as much as it is *humans*. As humans, we need to get smart about religion to where scientific progress isn't prevented. There are people in congress that are trying deny climate change, and that one asshole that said only God can fix this problem. Fortunately, these people are generally from an older generation, and as people today are introduced to different beliefs, conservative understanding of the texts will be reformed to adhere to scientific and social change.

The minute gay marriage begins to be made legal, churches begin changing their rhetoric. So it's not religion, it's humans. Humans will literally find ANY reason to riot, to cause harm, and to be ignorant to one another. People riot over BASEBALL games, and you're telling me *religion* is the problem? It's apparently as much of a problem as baseball if you want to boil it down to how trivial both are. 

It's not religion because *we* are ultimately responsible for the actions we take, not a religious text. With further education and a new generation already largely abandoning religion, it will just take time for the conservative Christian majority to die out. After that, we'll begin to see change. In the mean time, I would advocate a re-evaluation of certain religious texts (bible) to focus more on the allegorical aspects without trying to turn it into a "THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED" argument. Many, many people have been reminded of Airheads. As you could have known if you'd browsed a little ITT. Classic Boris. Yes and the world will be better off for it.  There is a lot of business operation out of Switzerland. Unfortunately, it is. Someone saying something makes up a lot of this subreddit. Dat username..

Deeper water have slower currents so there is no need to develop strong muscles. by inane do you mean breaking social norms that affect the entire world that have previously been seen as divine law for centuries?

(You can stop speaking now.) "the enemy of my enemy is my....... Friend?" Spoof movie called black jaws. Starring megamouth. Holy hell that is terrifying  You give money to terrorists, they will use that money to fund even more terrorism. Bin Laden himself directed AQ to kidnap foreigners for ransom money because AQ was very strapped for cash.  good comment. Mine was obviously very ignorant but the choice of going to university is no longer entirely an academic one. In fact, I guess I was part of the HE boomer generation, it was almost expected of us that we would go to university and almost everyone in my year group did, regardless of how academically capable. I remember the saying 'well, theres always sports science' being banded about more than once when predicted grades were discussed. Now prices have increased exponentially I would expect that to have some impact on the market (other factors aside) with domestic demand falling (being filled by foreign students) and supply being picked up by other options such as apprenticeships. My initial comment was trying to suggest that these are more attractive to males and women dont want to be seen as 'just a housewife' so need to strive academically to achieve the level of job they expect. This is a societal issue, it is no easier or more desirable for women to attain (traditionally) mens jobs than 40 years ago however there is also an expectation for them to be professional achievers, inherently giving them fewer options. What about if they got a female hangman in? Don't they have something against being killed by women? To all the cynical haters expressing doubt, take it on authority from perhaps the greatest Enlightenment era Poet:

"For forms of government let fools contest;	/
Whateer is best administerd is best:	/
For modes of faith, let graceless zealots fight;/	
His cant be wrong whose life is in the right:	/      
In faith and hope the world will disagree,/
But all mankinds concern is Charity:/
All must be false that thwart this one great end;/
And all of God, that bless mankind, or mend." Believe it or not it's slightly more difficult to launch a missile or bomb from a plane traveling several times the speed of sound in the stratosphere than from a stationary platform in the ocean. you keep responding lol.  we may have discovered the rare paid troll. seriously? Lack of knowledge doesn't always mean lack of guile. They may not know about the geography outside or the latest technology but I bet they know enough about human nature to believe you completely. That isn't really the point I was trying to make, police are supposed to incapacitate a target, not shoot to kill. Let me try once more. At the risk of sounding corny: More power means more responsibility. A bigger impact bullet forces an officer to consider longer before firing and to be more careful aiming.  &gt; 90% of Europe's problems can be solved

Andf 92% of all percentages are made up. The Ukrainian army pulled out of the airport, the airport was not all of Donetsk. Don't you think that's the first thing that would have been reported? Something like:


&gt;Separatists shell themselves, killing six in the process. The real problem is that the Shias made the movie. Many Sunnis don't considers Shias Muslim and believe that they distort the Islamic teaching.  Or nuclear waste if you are the poetic kind. The existence of a God and a belief in that God is not the same thing as a literal interpretation of religious texts. And when those texts fall apart, so do the religions, but not always the belief in a God. It's just there for the Double Down Dog. 1.

 Also, why didn't this lawsuit occur in India where the problem occurred?

I'm no expert in law but I don't know how to expect US Laws to help an Indian woman with an issue that happened in India. I understand that Uber is based in the US but they should probably be sued in Indian courts where the issue occurred. Similarly, in Australia lots of shit washes out our beaches.

This explains one politician. The article refers to Whale Sharks as "Mostly Vegetarian".

Is that because they eat mostly plankton and krill which are little animals? &gt; That's right, call a whole country of people ignorant.

What, who did that?   Not knowing much about it until just now reading the lease, it looks like its in perpetuity, with no method of ending the lease.

Then that's not really a lease. Its a spoil of war written on a piece of paper.  I needs to be a high enough penalty that people would NOT rationalize it away easily.   
  *'Oh it's only 2 days.  IF i get caught.'*

We could tie it as direct feedback from distracted driving deaths and injurys.       
(3,328 in 2012. An estimated 421,000 people were injured )

some % of those #'s.   The bigger the problem the bigger the penalty until it equalizes at some very low number hopefully.

You'll never fix it completely.  But we could at least minimize it. Thanks for the clarification??? They care about women as long as they don't get uppity and want to be priests. The video on that page is totally worth watching, especially for the moment at 1.15. 
Oh man, so good! Look up Myths to Live By by Joseph Smith...he agrees we **need** something, but he disagrees that thing is religion.   The people may see it " illegitimate" but treaties that are recognized internationally don't just go away when a new gov't takes over from a previous gov't. Do treaties of the United States have the right to be broken if a Democratic president comes to office? it doesn't work that way. BTW, this treaty goes back to 1903. Long before Batista was in power.  &gt; If they eat jellyfish

Speculation. Interesting.

&gt; I am just happy to learn something eats jellyfish.

Wait what? When did that become a fact. That thing is really ugly yet somehow cute and endearing. His face is like "how the hell did I get here and why are there so many people around me?" I condemn stockpiling lots of cash and not endorsing and encouraging the use of condoms to help prevent the sexual transmission of HIV "Cuntery" against the human race. Take note, these are Syrian civilians being treated in ISRAELI hospitals. &gt; That's a terrible excuse. You must really want to believe that the US is not evil.

The US is pretty damn nice for a super power. There isn't a single one in history that has held back like we have. Our foreign policy is selfish yes, but EVERY COUNTRY'S IS. Foreign policy is supposed to in the interest of the state, you just don't see people whining at places like Belgium because they haven't been able to project power in 100 years. 

Yeah we give money to some really bad people and do some very morally questionable things in our national interest. Know what else our foreign policy does in our national interest though?

Keeps the oceans and seas safer and more open for world trade than at any point in human history.

Keeps Japan from having to seriously rearm, thus keeping China from shitting a brick.

Protects Taiwan from China.

Protects everyone else involved in the South China Sea from China.

Keeps Europe from having to spend much on military and lets them focus more on economic and social policy. You take the US out of NATO and suddenly all these states have to rearm in a pretty major way and some are definitely not going to like some of the others doing that for historical reasons. What starts as passive aggressive bickering on the floor of the EU becomes active hostility, Russia starts gnashing its teeth in the east and then... 

Oh dear, Europe has played this song and dance before...

etc... We do plenty of stuff that helps the rest of the world. I generally hate the royal family, but I do like Charles Culture center is like 8 kilometers away from nearest Ukrainian positions. There are a TON of narratives flying around. It's had to know what to think. One side paints them as "poor souls who got caught up in a witch hunt because their neighbor hated them so turned them in to the USA." 

How does this data point fit that narrative? 

Someone we were WILLING TO LET GO - so I assume one that we thought was likely to be not that important, not THAT bad, "one of the likely to be good ones" turned into an ISIS commander. . . . .  I wasn't really making an anecdotal argument, more of an appeal to authority. I'm making the same appeal to authority that the article quoting E.O. Wilson made.

People love arguing on the internet.

It's fine though, just downvote the idiot scientist who has a different view on religion and move on with your day. Well played. I've been to both, but there's a certain feeling walking on the same ground as giants did, to pick up a fist of dirt knowing that dirt has seen marvelous things.  &gt;breaking social norms

He's not breaking them, at best he is getting up to date as not to seem too irrelevant. See, that's your problem, no one reads the actual articles, it's all about the titles to gloss over and freak out about. It looks like a retarded shark. I'm pretty sure every species can have retarded offsprings. 

[Proof](http://i.imgur.com/mrbRpDx.jpg) I feel like they're the opposite, that's why they're so angry i think he has a fancy mustache.  I also heard you could start pouring pigs blood or other pork product over the bodies so they can't go to heaven? Scares most of the other guys into not fighting?  Who knew Stalin was a famed biologist?


 'Suicide bombers', isn't it their fancy way to call a woman? Somewhere, a writer at SyFy is frantically including this thing in Sharknado 3. Agreed. jesus christ it's ugly as fck  this dude is going to get downvoted but he has it right, as much as i hate isis, not living in a dictatorship &amp; having fair trials is fucking ace Ashur sounds like a really cool deity actually. PROOF THAT THE ULTRA MEGAMOUTH SHARK EXISTS!!!! after this 8 minute commercial break STAY TUNED!  Greece I guess. Mah, just some Russians on holiday. Maybe they wanted to get some jeans or something  I encountered a megamouth a few years ago myself.  Dated her for quite a while.  Hey-oh! Aww, precious &lt;3 No they have ruled that companies cannot use their positions as ISP to stifle competition by other service providers.

Canada is more of a democracy than the USA, since in Canada it is illegal to buy a politician.

USA has stopped being a democracy a long time ago.  Uh huh. You know that people like Julian Assange and Edward Snowdon often have the "terrorist" label applied? Well, apparently no one has any idea how long a shark can live. pfft, he came from space. This is why I will not go in the ocean. Not that I'm afraid I'll get eaten. I just don't like the idea of something this giant and creepy-looking being underneath me without me knowing.  We did it during the Cold War.

Remember the context. The Soviet Union is gone, Germany is whole &amp; the Iron Curtain is no more. 

And can I get a source on NATO or the United States being as provocative as Russia is here and just as frequently as well? Maybe, but fact is that the world still has very few long-term storage places ready. Seems like no one is interested in investing this money. 

So what we have is growing pile (currently 360000 tons) of highly radioactive material. This is not without risk. We can't have charities without religion, like Doctors without Borders? And when you say charities, do you include people like Mother Theresa, who are held up as saints but basically let the poor and sick suffer and die in their care? Or Christian "charities" in Africa, who told a nation of HIV/AIDS sufferers that condoms are a sin and went there to spread the bible first and help later?   
  
It's very easy for the religious to pretend that they spread love and peace and help through their "charities", but the reality is a little different. If you truly want to help the poor and sick you leave religion out of it. Only Wahabism is that retarded. Well I took my time to post that comment because I found it weird and I've never heard anyone saying that Singapore's tap waters may taste weird. Air quality is pretty good because smokers aren't allowed to smoke outside of smoking areas, and cars have to pass emissions tests. Also, the fact that owning a car requires a Certificate of Entitlement that is valid only for 10 years means that the cars on the roads are pretty much modern models.

Water can be drank straight from the tap. The government has also invested heavily in NEWater, which is a water desalination technique using reverse osmosis that converts sewage to pure drinking water. Solve the same class of problems as Turing machines.  I don't get it :( Antitheism isn't the solution.  Lots of people find comfort in religion and it'd be cruel to take that away.  What needs to happen is for religious individuals to understand that others they live among do not share their religion.  They need to stop trying to base government actions on religious morality because it doesn't apply to everyone.  Government should be practical and inclusive and shouldn't be limited by religious groups bickering about morality on an issue that could alternatively make other citizen's lives better without actually affecting the religious people who don't want to be involved; abortions, gay rights, drugs.


For this to happen, religious parties either need to absolve themselves of any responsibility for other's actions (the whole, "Oh, but I'm saving them from going to Hell" bit) and/or stop living in an alternate reality and remain true to their values while also living a grounded, worldly existence with their neighbors of different religions. Pretty much any nuclear-capable nation operated bomber is. 10-12 years later, the Indian economy is still the same as it was before. Think what frostiitue was getting at is that there is more equality in the US than in India. ISIS killing tons of people isn't about religion, it's just an excuse. Nah I do see your point, I actually edited my comment because I originally basically said "it's not that, it's this..." When really that isn't true either. I think you're definitely right that part of what's going on here is the effect of raised tuition, and how that factors in to life prospects for each gender. Ultimately it's a pretty complex issue, as you outline. old bear bombers could be shot-down in a heartbeat. the main prob is they turn-off their tracking beacons and become a hazard for other aircraft. Wow, the stupid here hurts. Erdogan is closer to being an emperor than Elizabeth is to a queen in terms of executive power.  Nothing broken, is true Korea! Diversionary bullshit designed to distract from the real issues. I originally didn't agree with this. I assumed we would keep certain systems isolated of others but looking at how the world is going, towards everything connected i can see why this becomes a problem.

What if an AI could change the code in your pacemaker. The same for any type of say electronic oriented implants (hearts, insulin pumps etc). What if the AI could re-write the code currently being upload to TESLA cars, causes them to crash - maybe because a certain type of person, because of their life profile implies a disposition for something deemed unacceptable.

I think the big problem here is when these machines can write and enhance their own code / are designed to automatically "fix" errors in existing code.

this isn't something that will happen tomorrow but.. if civilization lasts peacefully say another 20 years i think this will be a major issue.


Also to those people saying - these guys didn't study AI... then, the people who are have already developed this technology? / KNOW how its going to work.. if they knew they would have it already. Id side with caution as from my experience, people who claim to have knowledge without clear proof tend to be quite self serving. Surely coinciding with Operation Lets Be Dicks Nonstop. Case in point... &gt; having fair trials

Where? Was your uncle involved in the slaughter of unarmed innocents based on religious extemism? Really glad somone else made this connection. Alright here are your options:

* feed your kids

* help preserve a species of shark

What's your decision? It's really easy to care about nature when your livelihood isn't threatened. I feel like a lot of people in western countries don't understand this. MY SIDES JUST WENT INTO ORBIT The museum here (Perth, Australia) had one of these in a tank that was set in the ground. 
It used to terrify me as a child to the point id cover my eyes and let it past that area of the museum every time it was there. 

So creepy
 Wow. It's like African nations *want* to go into the shitter. The Jurassic Park movies have done a disservice to Paleontology.  They cause most people to believe that all dinosaurs were alive at the same time.  Tyrannosaurus rex lived near the end of the Cretaceous Period- not the Jurassic.  Qijianglong was already a fossil for nearly ninety three million years by the time T. rex appeared on the Earth. She was already sentenced to death in 2006. 

God damn teenagers and their ability to utilize google and do a little research.  If I'm remembering my chemistry right, any alkali metal bonded with any halogen is considered a salt. NaCl is just one specific salt that we know as table salt. There's something going on there I've not seen anywhere else.

I've been able to make good arguments that don't align with the popular opinion, that nevertheless leave me with a positive upvote spread after a day or two.

Only for said comments to be slowly downvoted afterwards for weeks till they're in the negative. 
Very weird. I think there are obviously people who care about the board enough to want it not to be a circlejerk. But if you insist that it isn't, I don't think you really know the first thing about how reddit works. Nigeria is to government like Buzzfeed is to journalism.  The article link to "strange shark sightings" has one shark.  No, he was a professor in linguistics and theology at the university of Tunis, as well as being a imam, he spoke against the dictatorship and the execution of civilians. 

But hey no worries, most fuckers here seem to think that's a great price to pay just as long as a few bad apples like ISIS get murdered.  One just needs to stop playing a Russian shill fool to see. You can tell it's from the deep sea because it's ugly as fucking sin. I believe he was making fun of Steven Tyler who has a mouth roughly the same size as this shark.  You're welcome? Are you kidding me? We are destroying each other because of religion in the middle east. We have been destroying each other because of religion for the past 2000 years. Read a book for God's sake.  That's what I meant, I just phrased it poorly. Someone ELI5 what in the leapin librararian fuck is this thing and why is it so elusive? I want to see what it looks like with it's mouth all the way open. Don't forget baseball. Maybe they don't but they definitely care about the way the situation is perceived, that's why they're trying to have the failed suicide bomber freed. "Civis romanus sum"

Of course, that was probably never true, but it's an interesting idea. The west is generally a bit cagey about civilian casualties. That's not to say they won't  (or don't) cause them in enormous numbers at times, but it seems that in general we do feel some discomfort with the idea. We're _trying_ to only kill the fighting forces, sometimes non-combatants get caught up in that. 

But what if your policy is "Fine, you kill one of ours, we kill 100 of yours, and we're not going to be picky about where we draw that 100 from. We're not kidding, that hostage dies, we carpet bomb a town."

Part of me can't help but wonder how long a rag-tag band like IS would be able to hold up once they knew that they were going to be met with like-for-like levels of brutality. 

I genuinely have no idea where I stand on the morality of this.  By whom? As long as that government sticks to the definition of a terrorist. Anyone who fights for IS deserves to be hanged regardless.  Pretty crazyy
 Define terrorists. The terrorists that America is fighting, or the ones they support because they're fighting someone America doesn't like. Obama isn't exactly the first president to have "changed all that stuff" Oh I don't have a source for that part, that was /u/jesus_is_gay. Not sure about the validity of it; I was just reminded of the cuban missile crisis example.  Justin Timberlake is just going through a really rough time right now. we could reach mars with sides powered spacecraft 
* I had thought Prince Chuck's expertise was in architecture criticism.
* I notice that his ears are still much too big for the rest of him. Russia just does not give a fuck, and tbh that's kind of scary to think about.  Putin knows he can do whatever the fuck he wants with minimal to no opposition. That heart-wipe in the embedded video around :45 just cracked me the hell up.  How high or how angry at the crew was the person who edited that? I was lucky to be 5 seconds late to my own funeral one day.  I was driving to a T intersection and a kid looking down at his cell ran the stop line without any hesitation (at full speed).  Had I got there a few seconds sooner I may have been in the intersection when he crossed.  The kid didn't even look up as I blasted my car horn at him.  

People really don't get how dangerous it is to take your eyes off the road for ANYTHING (cell, gps, radio, ham sandwich).  They're far too complacent. Haha get it? because Steven Tyler is 15 feet long... nice one! It would've been better if he had been more specific and said that "organised religion" needs to be eliminated  No, he's just an idiot, American's are allowed to have maps. You know how homophobic conservatives turn out to suck more dick than a prostitute on the day the sailors come home?

Same principle  I've yet to read a paper that has definitive proof that populations are booming. There's speculation, but no one did enough population studies in the past to compare against. martyred by return fire, is that a new thing now? i was assuming by your comment you didn't read the headline or article and were born after contra. Hey now, are you really going to suggest that *everyone* eats bread?  Why would Jews be immune to this? This [curve](https://www.google.com/search?q=normal+distribution&amp;client=ms-android-sprint-us&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=do_LVJf1G5etyAT-4YKgBQ&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=640#imgrc=E5LEkOHZg8y0FM%253A%3B5HpvyLlcNsEFLM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.katemarshallmaths.com%252Fuploads%252F1%252F8%252F8%252F2%252F18821302%252F3956551_orig.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fpsychlopedia.wikispaces.com%252FNormal%252Bdistribution%3B497%3B291) applies to every society I don't think you quite understand how favorable the terms of the treaty were to Cuba following the Spanish-American war where the United States passed the Teller Amendment ( making it illegal to annex Cuba) and driving Spain out of Cuba ( who the Cubans detested due to concentration camps etc ). The U.S invested a lot of money and time into modernizing Cuba under the occupational gov't of Leonard Wood. Believe it or not, the Platt Amendment ( which this treaty is part of) protected Cuban sovereignty from other outside great powers of the time period who would want to conquer Cuba for their own geopolitical ambitions ( America was not the superpower in 1903 as it is today in 2015).  &gt; Unlike their leaders, the Isis fighters will be affected by this

Though likely it would make them more likely to fight to the death &amp; less likely to agree to/trust any kind of settlement to make peace &amp; allow them to walk away form their past as ISIS members. 

I'm not saying Jordon is wrong with this policy, in my gut I want to see how ISIS likes it if their enemies act as ruthlessly as they do. The problem is escalation leading to total war/almost genocide doesn't work when your opponent isn't a nation that can be conquered by taking territory &amp; bombing its cities &amp; means of production. ISIS &amp; Al Qaeda are more like online gaming clans that any asshole can join, so we can't defeat them like we did Germany &amp; Japan. 

I guess if Jordan limits the executions to ISIS terrorists &amp; war criminals &amp; doesn't apply it to all their foot soldiers I think it could work. The reason for showing a bit of mercy to battlefield prisoners of war is to peal away the large numbers of less bat shit crazy fighters- many join militias etc for the money &amp; food &amp; because if you don't have a gang every side is gonna fuck you up. 

The hardcore ISIS guys should be killed or used as bargaining chips. In fact it wouldn't be a bad idea for Spec Ops to take some hostages of our own. You cut off a prisoners head, we kidnap members of your family. You know, war the old fashioned way. 

-sorry for ramble.

 How interesting would it be if 9/11 was funded by this Salman guy's money and US interests covered it up due to political alliances with the then-king?

 Megamouth used "disgust" it's very effective! Laughter is the best medicine. &gt; I guess I understand why Japan has no other agendas other than development and growth

This has more to do with Japan's post-war agreement to basically have no foreign policy whatsoever. However, there is definitely a culture self reliance and inward facing governance in the Far East. Even China plays much less of a role in foreign affairs than the other two super powers. It is thought that they do. Chill  What is it with the discovery channel, history channel and national geographic all having a huge amount of made up and exaggerated content? Upvote for puscifer Yeah man. Cuz people talk about them today here. That's for sure. **/s** :P

Ah. Now I know why this comment was made.  You're arguing with ppl who have had a lifetime of indoctrination.

 I don't get the people that say Shell is dutch. I know that. So because they're dutch, why do I have so many of their gas stations in my city? BP is British.  They're here too. They're at fault for one of the biggest oil spills off our coast. 

What I'm implying is we went to Iraq and Afghanistan not for freedom, but for minerals, precious metals, and other natural resources. People thinking that the wars overseas are solely based on freedom or whatever other crap the media feeds them are just sheep to the slaughter. 

 Suddenly? perhaps scapegoating would be a better term, or bullying ... but prolonged bullying of one nationality at some point becomes racism. The surprise would be if Russia had a bomber still in service that *wasn't* nuclear capable, wouldn't it? No, actually 1st Chinese, 2nd Korea(both North and South)

[proof pdf file at the last page (jp)](http://www.stat.go.jp/data/nihon/pdf/n0200000.pdf) if you doubt Going into territories that IS has locked down is proving difficult and costly in terms of lives. If they actually tried invading somewhere new, an invading force would not have the 'human shield' protection they get from embedding themselves as they normally do, and the full force of international military coalitions could obliterate them in a heartbeat. This is exactly why IS will expand much more conservatively once it gets beyond a certain point - they're hardly going to expand like the Nazi empire did. They are only staying around this long because they've embedded themselves among civilians - as soon as they start making an 'invasion force' and go for a country with a real military, they'd be a much simpler target. They almost certainly know this. The extreme fine is one thing but the jail time is pretty authoritarian IMO.  It's crazy how little we still know about the ocean and everything in it. Wonder how much is still out there that we have never seen before Ok, but what happens when push comes to shove and religion says one thing and science says another? You can NOMA http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-overlapping_magisteria all you want and pretend that there is no conflict, but obviously, there is a lot of fucking conflict between science and religion, because they talk about a lot of the same things--where did we come from, how did the universe begin, is there extraterrestrial intelligence, etc. And oftentimes, religious people will willfully ignore scientific evidence if it conflicts with their beliefs.

The great thing about science is it's up for debate. If you have a better theory, then you can present evidence and change the way we look at things. Whereas with religion, you cannot question the story. Therefore, the only logical way to resolve the conflicts in religion is to leave religion. It's amazing to me that a creature as big as this one can be this elusive even in today's age. It makes me wonder what kind of other weird creatures are lurking around in the ocean undiscovered. Nah, don't worry you probably can't help being stupid  Man, I wish I was paid.  I just take stuff too seriously, and I will be damned if I let anyone else have the last word. I find this to be one of the most enjoyable things one can do on the interweb [I smiled]( http://media.nj.com/entertainment_impact_music/photo/steven-tyler-quit-areosmith-stephen-tylerjpgjpg-e254c0455deda1c5_large.jpg)  CHAAAAANGE NOW?

Plan A didn't sound good, until I read Plan B.....


&gt; Street children as young as five are being caged in brutal detention centres alongside adult criminals in a cynical drive to smarten up the Philippines capital ahead of a visit by Pope Francis this week.


&gt; .......  the terrified children are locked up in filthy detention centres where they sleep on concrete floors and where many of them are beaten or abused by older inmates and adult prisoners and, in some cases, starved and chained to pillars.

I'm sorry I started my day reading this, but I'm glad I read it. Hopefully shining a spotlight on the problem will result in better solutions. Plan C is definitely needed. 

 You probably don't mean this in a "fuck those savages" sort of way but as an African, living in Africa (Kenya) your comment hit me like a stab in the heart. As an English speaker i find it funny that i kind of know what you mean. Am I the only one who thinks this sounds like Dr. Breen from half-life? ITT : dumb people saying stupid things... Then... they ate it... :(

EDIT: Before getting downvoted to an oblivion it's [happened before](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/07/megamouth-shark-rare-fish-endangered). i think there's probably a lot of japanese dudes with 5 dicks each that would say 'yo fuck science they made a bomb that blasted our shit up'

and then you and i would have to swoop in and say, 'hey man, medicine and airplanes and stuff. science aint so bad.'

and then some chick would come in and say 'hey my son was hit by a car'

and someone else would say 'hey my dad lost a lot of memories in electroshocktherapy'

and on and on and on about all the guns and missiles and what not that have killed people over the last couple of centuries

and then you and i would have to convince them that 'hey science and engineering arent bad'

but theyd never get it. not for a second. thered always be a rebuttal about 'how its all bad.' :/

oh well. people gotta shit on things The singer has a giant mouth. Been known to swallow citybuses whole. Given all the pope-wank stories that get to the front page I think it makes a nice change. I mean, out of this biologist and the catholic church, guess which one brought back exorcism in 2014?  As bad as this is was colonialism worse or at this point was it better? I'm a motorcyclist who's been sideswiped by a negligent, drifting driver. I wish this was a law in the US.  Think he's being downvoted because he's wrong. My girlfriend is a first grade teacher, and all of her kids know where each ocean is located.

Close, but not Europe. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe#mediaviewer/File:Europe_orthographic_Caucasus_Urals_boundary.svg I was under the impression jihad was a good thing. Thanks for clearing that up. ['MURICA](http://imgur.com/gallery/EgxZy) That's where Bababooey went on vacation!   If that were truly the case, why are they trying to do a prisoner exchange? They care deeply about their inner-circle, commanders etc. Foot soldiers they couldn't give a damn about, but clearly this particular prisoner is more important to them, or the wouldn't be attempting to make this deal. We should take a leaf out of video game AI and make the machines come at us one by one. Did anyone else read that as Megalodon? When's its birthday? Looks like shark adobo's back on the menu boys! I do that quite often. Something to occupy your free hand with. Sometimes I get a pen and click it for a while. Not everyone has to have their hands at the 10 and 2 positions to drive.  They said they need 4 purchases not 3. So yes you may have stumped them by not meeting their qualifications  who gives a shit. nerd.  If religion didn't exist at all, I assure you people would have been destroying each other regardless, just simply for different reasons. The first 59 encounters, ok kinda cool.  Now it's just getting tedious. I accidentally read that as, "eroticism" and was like....the Catholics? Maybe? What did I miss?! Can confirm.

We can clearly see it attempting a splash. Why would IS be attempting a prisoner exchange if they didn't want them back? That second one looks like it has a mustache. Haha [It's a cat...](http://www.catster.com/files/post_images/133c0b6587bbd080366c3b4988705024.jpg) Poland must be close:

Russia just wants to provoke some thing that they won't be able to finish  How does one "estimate" the numbers of confirmed human encounters? they're an insurgent organization. However, they've clearly demonstrated that they're a terrorist organization. Not all insurgencies rely on terrorism.  Basically.  The thought that the absolute erasure of religion will solve all our world problems is so hare-brained, it's about as ridiculous as any beliefs religious extremists hold.  Bill Maher is basically like the antitheist equivalent of a radical Imam.  I mean, when I first discovered Reddit, he was a bit entertaining because he said a lot of true shit about how heavy religious influence affects the world negatively.  But he doesn't focus on the families that spend time together because of religion.  He doesn't focus on the people who were lifted out of the darkest times in their lives by religion.  Religion, just like all free speech, can be used to hurt and to heal. It was also very much Illegal. Blood will be on the Russian hands. Specifically Putin's hands Nope.

&gt;* WASHINGTON: The US does not consider Afghan Taliban as a terrorist outfit, but conceded the tactics adopted by them similar to terrorism."They (the Taliban) do carry out tactics that are akin to terrorism.

&gt;* They do pursue terror attacks in an effort to try to advance their agenda," the White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest told reporters yesterday.The United States, he noted has designating the Taliban in such a way so as to put in place some financial sanctions against the leaders of that organisation, in a way that's been beneficial to its ongoing efforts against the Taliban."Now, what's also true, is that it's important to draw a distinction between the Taliban and Al Qaida.The Taliban has resorted to terror tactics, but those terror tactics have principally been focused on Afghanistan," he said.The reason that the US is concerned about that is there obviously are a significant number of American personnel, including American military personnel, in Afghanistan that are in harm's way, he said."The Taliban is a very dangerous organization.

&gt;* What the President has pursued is a clear strategy for building up the central government of Afghanistan and the Afghan security forces, so that they could be responsible for security in their own country and take the fight to the Taliban," Earnest said."That, however, is different than the strategy that we have pursued against Al Qaida.

So this is at the level above consumer interaction? 

I figure if Bell offered unlimited data they'd get ALL the business. Thought this ruling was saying that they et Al could not offer such a thing Shrekt How can you estimate confirmed encounters? I think it was Canada. Di they see ISIS as some sort of law enforcement /miltary?  How come we dont hear about vigilantes standing up and taking  action? Yessir, but dumb people also have two hands and can use guns and kill the Jews they were falsely told were behind evil deeds.  Killing soldiers is not terrorism. Bombing hotels and markets and funerals is terrorism.The Taliban is most certainly a terrorist organization. "files on the use of crop duster aircraft"

What?   So there's actually "crop-dusting"??
edit: obviously you can spray pesticides by crop dusting.,.. I mean what does 'crop dusting" have to do with the Saudi royal family or the attack on the uss cole? I actually believe that completely. I took Dynamics and the equations are badass.  The issue with religion begins earlier. It begins at point when you feel morally superior to someone because of your beliefs. Surely it's not an *estimate* if we're talking about *confirmed* encounters. The two are mutually exclusive. such is the product of 24hour news coverage and click bait revenue streams That joke was so forced my butthole tore a little I don't know why you are downvoted. The log/log graphs of nearly every phenomenon tends to be a straight line. On reddit people exaggerate titles for fake Internet points.
Just like that- but with real points, so it's even worse. 
It's a really good way to find out who idiots are though. I had a room mate once who was convinced megladon was real. We are no longer room mates.  &gt; These are all people connected to religion and/or enabled by religion to do what they did.

Being an atheist in those times was no small matter, so drawing a connection and claiming a causal relationship between religion and science is disingenuous at best. Why is it, do you think, that in the modern world there are so many atheist scientists? I'd say partially because our knowledge of truth is better, and also that it is much more socially acceptable in most places to be an atheist. 

I'd say that those people would likely have been scientists regardless of affiliation to religion, but really all it shows is that people can manipulate their religions to be compatible with a scientific mindset by compartmentalizing. They only embrace scientific values when answering questions that don't present a significant challenge religious dogmas. If they do challenge religious dogmas they are stomped on, see: Galileo, John Philoponus (condemned as a heretic for having his own ideas about the Trinity and trying to make science and religion compatible), Origen.

Has religion influenced science, sometimes for good or bad? Of course. Was religion necessary? Absolutely not. Religion was fine with science until it started showing them how wrong their claims were, which is a big reason why the golden age in islam faded coinciding with the rise of the Ashari school. As soon as science gets in the way of religious control, they turned on it. Tell that to the 100,000s of civilians who died during the Roman conquest of Gaul, and those were just within a couple of years in Rome's millennial history. Exxon did something similar. They concluded that governments will not significantly curtail carbon emissions, and so they were under no obligation to change their business model. I don't expect Shell will be quite as brazen but I do expect a similar result. If you want to truly remove radical Islam then you need to bomb Saudi Arabia too.  If you did that then the US government would come after you. So.....we got you throwing around Cold War tech, Cold War actions &amp; incidents that happened 14 years ago that didn't even involve Russia?

And...that's pertinent to a Post-Cold War situation revolving around the past year.....how?  Non-Muslim? lets not care then.  Honestly, as a resident Singaporean, no. The tensions and pressures between the various cultures and peoples present is too high; its kept in check by the governments firm control but a loss of that and it'd blow up like a pressure cooker left on too long. So...Scar was just following the rules? I need to rethink everything I believe. The budgets of drug companies actually are mostly spending on advertising and lobbying, research is not as high as they would have you believe at all. And their recent trend has been trying to extend their existing patents in what amount to unscrupulous tactics which end up killing people because they can't afford drugs they need. 

This is a very good [article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1261198/) on this misleading propaganda from 2006, by the two best known experts on the subject of drug pricing. Nothing has changed since then.

Or ask scientists in the field. Nobody is more honest about this stuff than the people who do it. ISIS would just blow them up in the name of Allah. At least they don't murder cartoonists. I'm a professional wikipedia-reader and it said they filter for plankton and jellies. Agreed. I too was once a browser of /r/atheism until the users just spewed too much hatred. The 1934 modified the terms of the 1903 lease somewhat, but this has to be done mutually. Annexation means the land officially belongs to one particular country. The world ( as does Cuba and the U.S) recognizes the land has to be mutually agreed upon to be transferred. Their is a method of exit, if the U.S violates any of the conditions of the treaty. It's not like we have to give up Detroit to Canada if we violate a treaty with Canada, because Detroit is officially annexed part of the U.S from after the War of 1812. This is  very different. We have treaty obligations we need to fulfill to keep our end of the bargain.  &gt; I don't understand why people don't like English food

Maybe due to the (possibly more historical) lack of quality fresh ingredients compared to, say, those countries near the Mediterranean? Or maybe we ate to live, compared to those other cultures. In any case the cuisine never became internationally popular despite the spread of British culture. Looks like Rio Ferdinand. Bingo. It's the same problem with poachers in Africa. Don't blame the poor people that kill the Elephants, blame the people buying the ivory. It's all fine trying to physically protect them, but the real problem is that there is a very high demand on ivory. Well pro palestinian priests arent known to be intelligent Can buy a bomber at any 2nd hand shop.
 It's because he has fins you bloody moron.  "You kids have never experienced true horror.  And before you call me a hypocrite, my UNCLE was tortured.  So yeah, take that."   Singapore doesn't mess around. They don't even let you chew gum in that country or eat food in the metro.

   Hilarious and totally bogus.    Ruble continues to be essentially worthless, the exchange rate is 1 Ruble = 0.013 Euro.    Probably got hit by a plane.



Too soon? isn't Russia burning up enough money trying to prop up the ruble? I think I read China was bailing out russia? 

In any case, the current pinyin system *was invented by the Chinese government*. The former pinyin system just wasn't appropriate for standard Mandarin which is taught in the mainland.  [It was taught as part of a literacy campaign among adults, particularly for pronunciation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin). Standard Mandarin is actually a constructed language which is based off of the Beijing dialect. Pronunciation guides would be useful if I were born in northern Sichuan.
 Well if war happens, your country will be the battleground. Pissed off about people killing people? Better kill some people. Whats dragged humanity down was not having freedom of thought, which goes along with freedom of religion.



Which means this biologist believes like ISIS, or the Taliban that everyone has to believe in what they believe!


Personally, people with those types of beliefs can all go fuck themselves! Well, fixed up with duct tape and a hammer anyway. *chomping noises* Seriously.  While I certainly agree that religion has caused many horrible conflicts, I think idiotic political decisions have led to more deaths, "in this era," whatever that means. Someonewould mentio the holocaust and the discussion would be over then you don't know our politicans. Are you saying that our imaginations are running out of control? I've met rational people who prefer organic where possible. One made this very apt comparison that changed my view on it: "buying organic is like being recycled products. You don't do it for the health or nutrition values of the food itself, but to support farming practices that don't have excessive broad-spectrum antibiotic usage and/or pesticide run off contaminating ground water."

It's the wholesale "all GMO is evil and unnatural" people that worry me. Does that explain all his weird pauses whilst speaking? I've seen him stop talking mid sentence in a place that makes no sense to stop for a good 5-6 seconds. It's short enough to not disrupt the conversation, but long enough to be very very awkward.  I guess you ignored the link showing us doing it huh? Was this so you could feel warm and fuzzy about your point of view? Thanks for playing, go home.  This is a myth.  I think you're telling the truth, but why are you saying it like you're lying? It looks like they're getting their ideas from Heavy Metal album covers Given their track records with women, I don't think daesh cares. "Kazuhiro Nakayaan ichthyologist and one of the only people on the planet to have dissected a megamouthnoted a surge in reports of the strange shark since the early 2000s, which he attributed to growing interest and public attention."

The reality that humans are mostly good, and most malice is ignorance in disguise?

 They've been doing this a lot over the past years or so, just not exclusively with the UK.
 Yes. What modern conflicts have been instigated by religion with no ulterior motives or causes? Religion is generally peripheral to the root conflict and is a convenient way to divide into sides over collective identities. Yeah but someone has to tell it what the metric is - it has to be told about the task, it's a great step forward but it's not AI in the doomsday sense and can also fail badly if there is noisy data - note that video game pixels have zero noise.

I was studying the use of deep learning methods for EEG before deciding to graduate with a masters due to the difficulty of dealing with the noisy data and the fact that I wanted to work in industry on applied problems and a masters in computational neuroscience seemed enough to do that.

Doomsday AI is just not a concern right now - I'd be far more worried about climate change or geo-political instability or socio-economic civil unrest. http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/09/28/report-feds-have-stinger-missiles-in-nyc/

&gt;We didnt want to be totally defenseless in a situation where two oclock in the morning you have a crop duster airplane thats flying over New York City distributing anthrax, Kelly told CBS 2s Marcia Kramer. Wouldn't it have been great if Europe had originally set them up with their own independent state instead of basically carving things up so they would constantly be at each others throats? I would hazard a guess that internal politics require at least the illusion of negotiation before they can claim evil foreigners. They are still built of people, after all. 

Does anybody know the internal workings of groups like ISIS? That would be an interesting read. How do you keep fanatical members satiated? Contrary to popular belief, religion doesn't make people stupid. Stupid people just happen to use religion as an excuse for their ignorance a lot of the time. 


Take away religion and they'll just find something else to blame it on.  Just to make sure you understand: Again, it's not my opinion, that there are radars that can detect stealth aircraft, there are multiple, independent sources claiming that and I'm just quoting them. The ones I posted before are just a few ones I found then after googling (since I'm not native English speaker, I got these informations through other pages and had to refind English versions), but it's not RTNews or PutinTV,  and at least MIT must be a trustworthy resource. The ones I read in german are trustworthy. 

I know you were not talking about the B-2, and I'm aware that the F-117 was the first stealth try, but the F-117 was not detected by some extremly modern secret new radar. It was detected by an obsolet soviet radar with some modifications. But the reason why I mentioned the F-117 was because the guy asked about Iraq, and these airplanes struck 40% of strategic targets during the Iraq War. (The post you answered to was an answer to a post of another guy.)

You got a very valid point tough, which I asked myself aswell: Why are they building stealth aircrafts themselves then?!

I guess (mind the word guess) it's harder to detect so called stealth aircraft. I think it's a trade-off between camoflage and function. If you have different fighters engaging each other, it may be more valuable to be detecter later, than have better aerodynamics instead.

And I don't think it's that hard for a technological advanced nation to find out, how stealthy an aircraft on their radars is, if they know exactely how the planes looks like. All that is left is the material and they could for example guess it's the same material like the F-117 (which they got), or assume it's the same material they use for their own stealth aircraft. Should give a pretty good assumption. Additionally the Chinese are said to have stolen blueprints via hacker attacks. Maybe they know exactley what material the US uses. No that is US imperialism; so really the US forcing their corrupt version of Democracy on them is the problem... These wars are all capitalist wars that have been framed by religion to justify it.  ha ha, jokes on you, i still use paper moneys to buy my products anomalously!  &gt; e. If it is 5000 BCE then the person probably knows nothing else about the sun. And guess what, many people worried some day the sun might disappear. Be it Ragnark or the Aztecs, many predictions of the end of the world involved the disappearance of the sun.

The scale here is pretty relevant.  everything dies Does fapping make me a terrorist, or am I a terrorist because I fap? My thought exactly.  What kind of sick asshole can still pretend to believe in progress? 35% isn't certainly a chunk of the orchard Because we obviously didn't learn from Hitler... **Socio**biologist.  Specifically, this is predominantly sociology, with a biological perspective added. This is very similar to anthropology and evo-psych, et al. Thank you for your concern, citizen. /agreed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqxmJc9Ezk0 This kind of shark looks sharp to me, especially the head part, sort of badass. It was an echo to what German troops did to Russian citizens.  "60th confirmed human encounter" just doesn't sound that rare.  Giant Squid is rare.  Several ISPs offer unlimited data for a small extra fee on cable and DSL, unlimited data on mobile is much rarer and always comes with fine print. 

This ruling isn't about that, though, just not prioritizing certain traffic by making it 'not count'. First thought was of Megalodon, got worried. i hadn't thought about them but you're absolutely right, this guy sucks. Why not estimated to 63 or 59? I thought they sent the terrorist's brother's severed head as proof that they had him. Terrorists have taken over Imaginationland! &gt; We are reaching a point where the new jobs will just go to the machines because the humans can't learn as quickly as the machines can be programed.

That's a plausible mechanism. What evidence is there that's happening?  That's not really accurate. Hitler was raised Christian, but dropped the faith. 

Hitler was an atheist who hated all faiths. He recognized the power Christianity had in the hearts of Germans, so he did not confront Christianity directly, as long as it stayed out of the way. 

But he didn't start the Holocaust because of a religious disagreement with Jewish people. It wasn't a "They don't accept Jesus in their hearts - kill them!" type of thing. Blasts in Pakistan are no longer rare People to not mess with:

air support just to help a town called Kobani, which still took awhile to retake...he's dreaming big....too big. you don't have to go very far back to find science, or men speaking in its name, justifying and committing atrocities.

Lobotomy as a fad comes immediately to mind.  
So does forced sterilization of the poor.

Those are two examples of many, and I fear there will be more to come.

Now, you'll tell me with a straight face that those men were misrepresenting science, that they were not scientists.

Trouble is, there's lots of folks who will tell me with a straight face that the religious counterparts doing shitty things in the name of god are misrepresenting jesus, that they are not real christians, not real muslems, not real jews, not real whatevers.

If your bad apples aren't real scientists, then their bad apples aren't real christians.

  Most scientists (or those who respect it as an institution) are not running around telling others what to do or forcing others to do what they want.

  Most religious folk (or the merely spiritual) are not running around telling others what to do or forcing others to do what they want.  In fact, at least two of them flat out say to not do exactly that.

So why throw all of them out with the rest when they manage to use religion, the same way you use science, without demonstrating the same disrespectful arrogance bad apples on both sides demonstrate?

The bad science behind lobotomies died.
Plenty of religions have died.
Most surviving religions look absolutely nothing like they used to, because if they don't adapt every generation they die out too, just like science that doesn't adapt.

How can you ask the unscientific to have faith that science will correct its own mistakes going forwards if you can't show them the same courtesy?

&gt; Every single religion on the earth is a lie. How is that productive to society? How is that conducive to progress?

Every single scientific model we've had to discard for a newer, more comprehensive model was a lie.  How was that productive to society?  How was that conducive to progress?

We learn by fucking up.  The path that concerns itself with mechanics has mechanical costs for its failure.  Why do you expect we can have social progress without social costs for our failures?

You want a crusade?  Crusade against crusaders, those who would apply their agenda, by force, unto others; because whether its science or religion, we aren't going to know if what we're doing is a mistake until its too late to undo it. For some reason I'd love to eat it. I'd enjoy knowing that I've eaten something that only very few or none have had before. Not a live one but one that is dead of course. Ok Rumsfeld. Settle down. "Whether a nation "deserves" independence is for them to decide but when external actors encourage it they need to be fully aware that telling other countries to surrender land will very likely incite hostility towards the people who are the cause of that."

The Israel-supporters on here don't seem to understand this concept at all. Dude, people, will, eat, anything. We (as a species) used to grind up old mummies and take them in pills. I would be more inclined to eat the shark than the mummies. But if the megamouth's population is growing due to jellyfish numbers growing it could be a devastating population boom for the jellies. But if you are a hungry island lady, this thing would probably make a bomb stew for your 6 kids. And who knows what kind of "medicine" people want to make from it. Good.

I thought the rebels said they pushed them much farther out, beyond the airport?  Religion does lead to the rejection of opposing views though.  You can overcome tribalistic thinking but it requires you to think critically about the stereotypes and prejudices you and your society hold.  Religion though strongly discourages critical thought and instead encourages authoritarian thought.  This problem gets worse the more fundamentalist the religion becomes. Citation.  Might want to ask the Russians how this plan worked out 70 years ago A still from Majid Majidis Muhammad, Messenger of God.

You're grasping at straws. Head over to /r/opiates if you're fiending  That's a poor analogy. Military bases all have detention centers, mostly for military prisoners.

But it would be nice to finally have someone have our back since the invention of a firearm. Someone could make nearly an identical argument about the incredible drop in need of agricultural jobs and many other jobs that were removed by mechanization and improved agricultural techniques in the last 200 years. So what part of your argument doesn't apply to that time span?  en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalodon ...? You mean the link to the incident which happened 14 years ago between the United States &amp; China?

The one that has nothing to do with the past year, present situation in relation to tension over Ukraine or even Russia?

No, I didn't ignore that one. Even mentioned it. :) I'm sure you're right, but that isn't the point - they're not sending these planes to pick a fight, it's just some weird pissing contest. It's a show to say 'look how close we can get', and 'remember we have a military still'... but most of all it's good home propaganda. Russian people probably think this is a great show of strength. Ironic, isn't it? Nigeria is an economic powerhouse compared to Chad. The money is definitely there to build a competent military. It's a political decision to deny the military funding and resources, and civilians end up paying the price. Nasty business all around.   I don't believe the Ukraine army was in range. Just last week they were interviewing people in Donetsk saying they haven't heard shelling since the battle at the airport.  An opinion that leads to murder all too often. Here a fight for you: Did i used the right to/too/two?
 Jesus, KGB keeps it real. Steven Tyler's worth about $130 million.  I think he's swimming along just fine.

So BH found yet another use for goats then or because of the other one goats went suicidal? Plankton are a diverse group of animals, protists, archaea, algae, and bacteria. Besides eating jellyfish, they only seem to eat tiny "non-animal" things. Scientific labeling is weird. As a scientist who knows a number of "big dog" scientists in their field who also happen to be Christian/Catholic, I can confidently say that religion and science can coexist. What needs to be eliminated is ignorance. Would have taken many years over here, also the payout would have been reasonable.  "The NOS building was evacuated on Thursday evening when the 19-year-old got into the building by allegedly threatening a security guard with the weapon."

Being religious myself, I try not to let my beliefs dictate decisions that affect others, especially those don't hold the same beliefs. Personally, I'm all for gay marriage and am happy that my state is now leaning towards legalizing it. I believe religion should be inward and personal, keep it out of politics for the most part. Really the only issue I am outspoken about that has religious ties is abortion because I believe that it does more than affect the personal life of one person, it ends one.

The Pope, and his actions, are followed by more than 1.2 billion people. And that is just those that recognize the authority of the Bishop of Rome. Because of that almost everything he does is going to be significant. 

If this biologist has a following anywhere near that I think it is fair game, but my guess is he is at least 1 billion short.  RIP the real super heroes They keep doing this around the world, sooner or later there'll be a retaliation. Perhaps they want this. They have *tried* set it up to side-step these legal obligations. This doesn't mean they were successful, and they have been banned or are currently being litigated in many European countries which appear to have a bit more of a stricter view of this than the US. Frances airforce was woeful. They had 1 decent fighter/interceptor, the dewotine. Even it was argueably outclassed by the BF109s, which the germans had many more of. Then you have to factor in the german pilots would have been better trained, being fresh from spain and all...

How 'very beginning' are we talking? Once germany decided that poland was going down, no single nation could have stopped them. Britain was just lucky they have a channel between them and had a good airforce/navy Not that this is neccesarily the right place to ask... but what's the deal with people's sides? When I laugh, I feel it in the muscles center over my belly-button, but never my sides. Why has that become a thing? Megalodon! Please tell me someone else saw the heart wipe transition in the video after he talks about his relationship with the shark. Plus the kid demanding to know how the shark died in the museum. I personally blame whoever stole the 2 trillion dollars. I was also just finishing the quote from "Life of Brian"

The correct response would have been a John Cleese-esque, "Oh, Shut up!" Megalodon *is* real, just extinct. &gt; But the point is that these things aren't 'a few years' away. Modern AIs can do one task well, and struggle to generalize.

This may be an issue with how you unpack few years. So instead of "few" let's use a specific timeline. Does 30 years seem plausible? 40 years? 50 years?

&gt; They're using their clout to spread some false notion that AIs are a thing the general populace should be worried about.

I don't think the argument by Gates and others is that the general population needs to worry about anything: the point is where funding should go.  there is only 1 confirmed aerosmith in existence. think about that the next time you put on a pair of headphones.  Only when they're disingenuous statements in the form of a question. The Jesuits are up for a debate too. You keep repeating yourself. There is no one outside of Pakistani educated individuals who wouldn't pretend that there wasn't a large scale genocide of East Pakistanis that caused India to intervene. 
India would definitely have relished splitting Pakistan, but you're kidding yourself if you think there wasn't a huge humanitarian component. You don't just cause a huge wave of refugees to pour into a country suffering from a famine at the point and expect said country to stand back watching idly. If they're confirmed encounters, why do we need to estimate? The sword is the only thing those animals understand. They won't respond to diplomacy. I saw a video once where three people appeared to be trying to make a baby. It was very interesting. are we on tumblr That's because lionesses don't go into heat when they are caring for young. So the new alpha male kills the cubs to get the lionesses in heat. That scenario doesn't apply to humans. The cost, of course, is that you have a government that is willing to torture innocent people. Based on how Russia looks today, I'd say the Russian people lost in the end, despite the government winning this round against Hezbollah. Oh... Ha... This sounds dangerous. We should probably nuke it. Fun fact: Captain Gantu was actually inspired from mega mouth sharks! And at which point does it go from "the brig" to "the prison camp"?

If those cells were used to house US military personell that broke the rules, you reasoning could be sound -because that's what cells on military complexes are for.

As it stands, it is a prison camp, and one that is filled with a large percentage of innocent people at that. That can't be compared to the regular "brig" in any way. Oh haha, I get it now 
 This year on Shark Week: Megaladon secretly walks the cities at night, security cameras suggest. Found the japanese Guy. Please do tell. In this day and age, what does the location of Guantanamo bring to the U.S.? Your reasons were that "it's close to Florida and the Gulf of Mexico"... So its strategic because it's close to land we already have and it's close to a body of water on which we have thousand of miles of coastline and unfettered access to already? What am I missing here? Because your reasoning makes no sense at all to me. Did it make it? Jay Z's cousin Well, its obvious to me that you have been laughing wrong your whole life. Dogmatic belief is stupid and wrong and should be ridiculed. The moment someone is trying to sell you their doctrine and doesn't allow you to question it, MAKE SURE YOU QUESTION IT.  all of those cases you talked about that are "not in the name of religion" happened because of power, greed, and control (mostly). those reasons are are very inherently different than doing any of those atrocities "in the name of religion". if u cant understand that, ill paint a picture for you why its so different.

2 guys rob a house. the first guy says he robbed be house because he wanted money, for what ever reason. thr second guy says he robbed the house because god told him it was fine and justifies it with his ancient holy book.

we will never be able to eliminate crimes for the first reason, because people need money. but if people didnt believe religion we could eliminate those crimes.

then come the religious apologist. they will come say, "well those people robbing in the name of religion arent truly religious. you cant condemn religion because look im religious and not robbing." 

so you are left not being able to stop the cause of the religious robbings because you cant criticize religion (the cause of the religious robbings), without offending all the religious moderates and their rights to peacefully practice their religion.

so back to ur main point, which was "most of the important issues we should be worrying about arent happening because of religion". say 75% of the problems arent religion related. that leaves 25% of the problems being religious and we could easily make this world 25% better if we got rid of the cause of the religious problems. now these arent supposed to be scientific calculations, just representations.

another thing, a lot of those problems like global warming and seemingly nonreligious related problems, are actually effected because of religion. a noticeable problem in america is the fact that the religious right are antiglobal warming. the reasons vary, but there is a portion of them that straight up think it doesn't matter because jesus is coming back and rapturing the end of the world and we dont need to worry or focus our efforts and money on preserve the earth. also a lot of scientific research has been delayed or straight up hindered because of it goes against SOME peoples religious morals.

this issue is really hard though and it IS very insensitive to just tell nice normal religious moderates that you shouldnt be religious. but the fact is that the religious moderates enable the religious extremists. SO. BRAVE. They will recruit the most capable of goats, donkeys, camels and cows.

Donkeys be like http://therightscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/donkey-suicide-bomber.jpg

Soon enough we'll have animal rights activists invading Nigeria.

 We cannot consciously eliminate religion. It will push back, violently if necessary. What we must do is provide people with adequate knowledge so they can weigh it against their beliefs and make up their own minds. Like poison from a wound we can draw it out of society slowly, but it ***will*** be slow, and ***must*** be slow.  Otherwise we risk giving them fuel for a crusade.  

I have my own Christian beliefs, but I'm not a fan of the religious mentality. I've weighed my beliefs against new thought and found a happy middle without any trace of zealotry. But I'm young. My mind is malleable and open to change. Give us a handful of generations and adequate education, and we'll be right as rain.  

It is something that cannot be forced, lest the tribal attitude become more prevalent.   I see your point but poaching isn't a super great example. The poachers commonly hack off the elephant's or rhino's faces while they are still alive. Apparently it is much easier to use a machete on flesh than it is a saw on ivory. That isn't something they do because they need to do it. If that were the case, they would (could?) sedate the animals and cut off the ivory. I absolutely blame the people doing the harvesting. To me this goes beyond caring about nature and sits squarely in the realm of having no soul.

I absolutely agree that curbing demand is the way to stop poaching, though.  Politics in Canada is a shitshow. Both sides are just as bad as the other, and then you have the NDP. Here's to a fun election that's coming up soon, Canada. They tore buttholes forcefully? What the hell is that thing Just wait until Ukraine finishes rebuilding its nuclear weapons.  I think you're on the wrong website. Yahoo.com's news section is that way ----&gt; okay Chinese students, put your heads in the sand. "Properly defined language" is what they call obscuring the truth. These people ARE terrorists, they are using terror tactics. Al Jazeera wants to be "impartial" because to some people they aren't terroriists but freedom fighters, using terrorist tactics, in reality they are taking the side of the terrorists by not calling them what they are. Nobody needs to blow up his child in a religious place or a market. That's terrorism and aimed at terrorizing minorities or people in general to create a more radical environment of fear.

Al Jazeera is being tied up in another sickening wave of political correct to appease the never ending to cry muslims. These muslims should be loyal to the modern world, but they prefer to identify with their religious group that they have nothing actual in common with except the same fairy tales are taken too seriously. 

And I emphasize I am generalizing here and not talking about every single muslim, regarding the the reason why aljazeera made this choice. Al Qaeda is an offshoot from the afghan mujihadeen, which is the precursor to the Taliban. The American government was directly responsible for getting Osama affiliated with the mujihadeen during operation cyclone. Don't you just love the heart swipe when he talks about his relationship with the shark! Haha I'm dyin over here! That has nothing to do with religion itself though? just because some people believe that and use religion as an excuse doesn't mean it's the fault of religion. Same can be said for all those politicians that feel superior and above anything because of their power. Yes, this is true, but the beliefs of one person or group shouldn't be used to argue that all religion is bad. I'm a moderate follower of my religion, like most people, so I would never do any of the things you mentioned in your comment. But when an outsider links all followers of Christianity to the inquisition or all Hindus to sati and the caste system, it really does hurt. It's individuals that corrupt religion, not the other way around  Imaginaaaaaaatiooonn, Imaginnnnaaaaaattttiiion, Iiiimmagggginnnnnnatioooon. I think that was the password, let's go! These are just not comparable things. None of this is good, but there is a particular, very real and present danger doing this over the English channel. I don't know if you realise just how small and intensely busy it is. If you look at an airline route map you'll see. Flying there with no warning and transponder off is almost kamikaze-level. Fake raids are terrifying and that is a good discussion to have, but it's not the same as the imminent danger of this. This isn't good news for russia considering how the old cold war went for them... And I'll see YOU in my nightmares.  Haha, I'm Irish. If I was Japanese I'd like to eat a live one. Wait, you think *writing to your MP* makes a difference? Haha. That's cute. Do you also get a response telling you how good it is to hear your voice blah blah, and then basically the rest of the letter saying you can go suck on a hard one? That's usually the response. You have to be willing to to target innocent people which is a very shitty thing to do. Compare Russia to the USA. I think Pitt way of doing things ultimately serves us better in the end.  Can't. Unsee. Mustache.

 No, it hasn't. China and Russia are actively involved in Caribbean politics and cash infusion to local economies. Initially, we had the Monroe Doctrine to prevent the European powers like France, Britain, and Spain from intervening in Latin America and the Caribbean. By the 20th century that changed to the Holy Alliance of Prussia, Austria, and Czarist Russia who were installing gov'ts in Mexico and other countries ( Roosevelt Corollary)...the same thing is  today with Russia and China intervention.  YES, and I was so excited until my pre-coffee eyes finally focused.  Oh, well.... nope, mandatory death sentence, luggage, flat, car - doesn't matter, you will be hanged. Well, if you are white, they will let you go. read "Once A Jolly Hangman" They call him . . . World Eater Seems unlikely after they inadvertently supplied weapons to the syrian rebels who turned out to be ISIS.... or at least ISIS can in and assimilated the rebellion. Anyways, the policy now is to simply not provide weapons to any non-state actors in the entire region. They're going to screw their own economy. I hope he was able to swim away when they were all done taking pictures of him and shit.  YES!! You've never heard the phrase, "side-splitting?" Who cares? I guess this is the most scathing report we can expect from VICE since Rupert Murdoch bought them out.  I mean... when you mention it... I guess I can't really remember ever being thaught how to laugh properly. http://0.tqn.com/d/urbanlegends/1/S/a/f/1/black-jack-pershing.jpg &gt; Gorbachev has called for a kind of perestroika or restructuring of societies around the world,

Yeah cause perestroika worked so well for the soviet union... This guy was one of the biggest disasters of the 20th century.  They were the latest of the Abrahamic religion, they have a lot of grounds to make up for. I thought  the diplodocus looked ridiculous, but holy shit look at it This all depends on how terrorism is defined, which especially in American rhetoric can be understood as a lot of things. 

I would say that the Taliban is not a terrorist organization, but  has on occasions turned to tactics which can be deemed as "acts of terror". (albeit I do not have intimate knowledge of Taliban activities) 

Leaning on a "normal" definition of terrorism as, politically motivated, targeted at someone else than the ones directly affected, by a non state actor, etc Personal accusations again, eh?  You clearly are not able to engage debates on this topic in a critical manner, without resorting to caricatures of the conflict nor without pushing yourself out of the Fox news discourse.  Your insistence on responding to my comments with personal accusations rather than clever parlaying or debating indicates lack of knowlege of the conflict itself and a reliance on popular, conservative media bullet points.  This regurgitation does not help lead to peace in the region but exacerbates the conflict. big mouth The editorialised (or maybe original) title here is very deceptive as that is the maximum punishment.  There are many laws in every country where the maximum sentence has never been given.  The title makes it sound like this is the one and only outcome. I dunno, last time I murdered a kid, you should have seen how turned on her mom got. 

Now I feel bad. don't you have work to do? WOLOLO Would one not agree that after about 50 times, perhaps it's not so rare anymore? What's the scientific benchmark? Although, in the end, it doesn't make much difference for the average citizen, I guess most people would prefer being ruled by a dictator of their own nationality rather than the dictator in Moscow. No bananas? Putin's such a troll! 

It's his best comeback against sanctions...and yes, it's comical. I'm sad for the people in Russia, but I hope those crippling sanctions continue and clown Putin loses power. 

 Are you denying that religion played a prominent role in the Nazi rise to power? There's a whole sub dedicated to pointing out the racists in the conspiracy sub. Check it out for yourself: /r/isrconspiracyracist

Spoiler: Yes, a lot of them are. Alcohol dunk tanks with balls made from bacon thrown by unveiled Jewish lesbians as they drive by blaring western pop music Jordan XIs, so sick.  Shame about their lack of sunlight though. 
Only about 1500hrs of sunlight per year(UK average).  This technically isn't an encounter. It's a dead body of a strange shark.  Anyone with social science beyond a high school level knows that more than anything, power is the major (and I mean absolutely *major*) drive behind any group interferring with the political state of any area. This is true for both democratic parties, revolutionary groups, and militant religious organizations. Religion is merely a tool to achive that goal, and it's very effective. Also, you're wrong, Islam does not encourage terrorism, definitely not the murder of innocent people. No doubt you've read a lot of quotes from the quran about "killing the infidels", but do you know the context of which they were written? The quran is not an easy read by any means, and just like any other religious scripture, is full of contradictions and passages open to interpretation/exploitation. Even reading the translated complete version for me meant a lot of head scratching, and a constant need for a dictionary and rereading of passages as their meaning was rarely ever cut clearly out in capital letters for one. However, to get back on track, rather than listing up a long line of examples of exploitation and misinterpretation of islamic verses, try reading [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2rz5dn/the_muslim_clerk_at_the_paris_kosher_store_risked/cnkvvw6) - it goes quite well in depth with the issue, and is a regardless what you believe, an fascinating, educational, and well written read.

Also, you clearly don't know a lot about history. The middle east experienced far more longer streaks of peacefull times than clashes of warfare (look up the islamic golden age for a starting example). Especially when compared to Europe, they've been in the historical perspective significantly better at not only upholding peace, stability, and avoid major conflicts, but also coexisting with other cultures and religions. 

Also, the idea of islam being a political system is a logical fallacy. Is christianity a political system because of the Vatican? Is Judaism so because of Jerusalem? Both of those religions has a law/rule system just like islam has with Sharia. That theocratic states exist doesn't make islam a political system any more than catholicism is. A wheel doesn't make a bike, but you can apply a wheel to a bike to make it run, regardless of what philosophy it stems from. Religions differ from political ideologies through that they're guiding philosophies, using the bike metaphor, wheels on their own. Political ideologies are meant to function on a grander scale, but cannot be applied on the individual. Kinda like how the parts of an aeroplane can collectively function to make itself fly, but a massive fiberglass wing on it's own is completely useless.

I think you should expand your horizon - Once one tries to look past single-cause scapegoats, you'll realize that the situation is far more complex than you can imagine. The history of both the middle east and islam is a fascinating one, and is can be an amazing eye-opener to how religion functions in our world, where the global age is taking us, and which consequences it can have, both for the better and for the worse. Well more and more nations are getting tired of the ISIS threat, won't be much longer before they are hunted down like the animals they are and I only hope that none of them are given the honors of their religion as far as burrials and postmortem treatment. I hope they get rolled into a ditch and covered in lye and forgotten forever.  When we bombed Hiroshima we were aiming at Hiroshima castle which we thought housed upto 400000 troops. What we didn't realize is they were moved to Kyushu. It was also their major supply depot. 

In Nagasaki we were aiming for the shipyards, arms plant, and steel plant. Destroying these three which was difficult and very costly in life to do traditionally made sense. 

Both had a very strategic point. Destroying their largest force and their ability to make new ships and weapons would end the war. And sadly yes there would be civilian casualties. 

I would like to know what strategic military target a school for girls has? Turkey has access to source code and blueprints for a lot of NATO type-standardized computers and software and other equipment. Stuff like flight computers in F-16s and air to air missiles and radar systems. They might be holding that data hostage. The video someone posted said it eats plankton.  Sometime you laugh so hard that the ( side) muscles,  around the ribcage area, cramp up or spasm. You seem like a good and wise person.  Looks kind of like the eel in Mario. Go home. You're boring. We chose a period of his life about which there is no difference between different Shia and Sunni scholars and groups, he said. We made this film with the view of bringing unity [to] the Muslim world.

that's interesting.  I'm not accustomed to these type of limits, it's interesting to see how this subject is handled. Yes, but I still don't quite understand that either. Has anyone's sides ever actually split in a laughing-related incident? Thats not news Some programmer is going to get killed, that corporate robot got into  long pause loop. &gt;*WHAT ARE YEH DOING IN MAH SWAMP??*

 Holy shit!! That is so bad I couldn't even finish it, it felt like an RPG and he was going through text options while everything paused around him. No, faith is, as you said, belief without evidence. That, by itself, doesn't make one ignorant.

Choosing to ignore evidence, however, promotes ignorance. And no, ignorance should not be our goal. One of the earlier specimens is still on display in Perth. Growing up it was definitely the highlight for any museum trip. 

So in 1988 a bunch of surfers see what they believe to be a whale about to beach itself off the coast. In typical australian fashion they swim out and try to coax it back towards the sea. The next day they found  it washed up dead, realised what it actually was, and then carted it off to Perth to be preserved in formaldehyde. 

While this one might be around the 60th ever seen, the one I'm referring to was only the third.

tl;dr: one washed up where I live and we all thought it was a fucking whale.

[Here it is in 1988](http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/megamouth/sites/default/files/megamouth-homepage.jpg), and [here again on display at the museum](http://www.waywardwandering.com/gallery/au-wa-perth-western-australia-museum/04-megamouth-shark.jpg). One time I tried to grab a straw but I ended up slipping and getting it all over my face. Julio got mad and kicked me out. He said my seizures were disturbing product output.  I figured it was said by the person you responded to. 

 Rendition centers were set up all over the globe. There are plenty of governments out there that'll let you wash your dirty laundry for some loose change, or because they have their interests aligned with yours.  How often can it be chocolate bread, when it must be the least eaten type of loaf, since I have never seen one outside of a REALLY fancy bakery Am I the only one who thinks it looks like a penis? My Vertebrate Zoology class is currently studying sharks and we literally discussed this species yesterday - making a point to talk about how humans barely encounter them. Figures that the next day, one washes up and it's making headlines.  now everyone is peeing their pants, should have thought of that shit before y'all went fucking with Ukraine. Most of the minerals and metals in Afghanistan became known after the invasion already happened, so it doesn't seem to me that the invasion was for that reason. I think that was to find and kill every single member of Al Qaeda they could find, and to root out the Taliban which was the puppet government. I'd agree. Feelings of superiority is a character issue, not a religious one. I've seen plenty of "holier than thou" Christians" and dislike it, but I've also been laughed at by atheists for believing in God and told that I'm intellectually lacking because of my beliefs. It really can swing both ways.  Whale played *Shudders* Think of all that ranch dressing. Yes.

The oldest known insect at 400,000 million years old already had fully developed wings. Stats? Do people grow up believing the crap they show though? germany also remembers hitler. those austrians. No because there is no way of quantifying how much trade Cuba missed out on. Besides, for most of Cuba's history they sold exclusively to the USSR. The US held that treaties with the French that were made with the French king in 1778 were not with the Revolutionary government and so would not directly aid Revolutionary France in 1793. Lots of governments refuse to recognize treaties of past governments after a violent revolution (i.e. complete foundational transformation of the nationstate, not just a transference of power within the guidelines like an election). This just an easy to remember high profile example, mind. That is a lot of corpses.  I think you'd have to agree that there is a considerable difference because of the type of aircraft being flown. In your example the US was flying an EP-3, which is a Recon aircraft. A TU-95 is a nuclear capable bomber. Tell you me see the difference. No I think he's one of the lizard people from beneath the earths surface. Iam in japan right now, I was talking to an american whos girlfriend is japanese. He was from Alabama and said when his dad invited them over for fishing they catched a stingray they throw it back of course but she really want to try it, he said if she had soysauce this poor animal would fear about its existence. It's because he's receiving new orders from the masters. Terrorist is a term with a clear and accepted definitional meaning. According to Wikipedia: "Terrorism is commonly defined as violent acts (or threat of violent acts) intended to create fear (terror), perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal, and which deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians)." When you hear that there has been a "terrorist" down the street from your office, you know exactly what that means. When you hear that there is a "gunman" down the street from your office, you don't. Further investigation is required. Is it a terrorist? Is it a schizophrenic person in the middle of an episode? Is it a common criminal attempting to escape from a bank robbery? All of these have different meaning and will elicit a different response from you. Al Jazeera is plainly targeting established definitional terms with the implicit motivation of white-washing their religion by hiding or excusing the explicit motivations of Islamic terrorists. To describe Osama Bin Laden or Breivik as someone's "freedom fighter" is moral relativism at its worst. If they are someone else's "freedom fighter" then that person is the enemy of humanity and their opinion doesn't count in determining our society's definitions of those who would harm us. "Terrorist" is an established definitional term describing someone who attacks civilians for political or ideological ends. The term therefore precludes a non-denominational, apolitical random act of violence. The alternates they purpose restore this ambiguity to the explicitly religious or political motivations of Islamic terrorists. Any of the terms proposed here are more misleading and more ambiguous than simply calling them what they are. It is not being "neutral" to apply a neutral term to someone who is not neutral themselves.

We are literally right back where we started despite the entrance of women (half the population) into the workforce.

I don't know what you mean by right back where we started. By what metric?

&gt; Software, over the last several decades, in nearly every sector of the economy. We are seeing companies with STAGGERING amounts of productivity. Just look at a company like Instagram. 13 employees, 100 million users, purchased by Facebook for a billion dollars.

With how much real value? That's an example like many that looks a lot more like a bubble than anything else. People were in the late 1990s purchasing tech companies also for ridiculous sums of money and then the bubble burst. We're in another tech bubble now.

&gt; Ask yourself how 13 employees could serve 100 million customers in any industry prior to the invention of software.

But a big part of that is that in Web 2.0 (or whatever they are calling it now) you have people essentially providing their own content: essentially it offloads work on to the general population. That's not a reduction in labor done although it might be a reduction in what labor gets paid. And you aren't seeing much productivity in any sense of it being a traditional job being replaced: if anything those are examples of new jobs created and possible because of the new technology. And other successful tech companies have many employees- Google and Facebook are examples: the jobs their wouldn't even exist  without developing technology. 

I do agree that software has been reducing the need for some jobs, but that's been going on since you had big mainframes in the 1960s, and mechanical calculators and other positions were already replacing "computers" before that. And that software has itself led to many new jobs, programmers, engineers and others.  So people grow up believing the crap from those channels? Megalodon(s) aren't real? Well than the tweet probably is wrong More importantly, did it taste good? Then he was a very out of date conspiracy theorist. The NSA's tracking abilities had been widely reported for at least 6 years before the Snowden leaks. Anyone down for Sinigang ng Shark? Megamouth Shark adobo?  Cell companies in Canada are evil, can confirm from personal experience and experience of others. The amount of horror stories i've heard from customers of Bell and Rogers are numerous.  Oh I thought I was reading about New Jersey. haha It would have been much more legitimate if it had a fixed term in years ignoring the whole dictator thing.   What mission? The mission to harass Briton? Everybody is chuckling at how derpy it is and I'm sitting here thanking god I don't go into the ocean.

 NATO isn't going to invade Russia, pretty much ever, even if Russia didn't have nukes. 

That being said, if Russia had no nukes their military couldn't stand up against NATO. Or even China.  You're not showing that the US is doing it *constantly*. You pointed out *one instance*. You have to show something where the US/Nato is doing it on a weekly or biweekly or monthly basis as the Russians are doing. Why is it bad theology?  It's not theology at all.

His heart was estimated to have beaten at between 250 and 500 beats per minute, before he succumbed to cardiac arrest, also causing his sides split.[\[21\]](https://web.archive.org/web/20080412072030/http://www.canongate.net/Lists/Death/9PeopleWhoDiedLaughing) So err... Is it alive or dead? The article only says washed up which is helpful /s  I must live a sheltered life.  Prior to finding that link I did not know there was such a thing. Specialized seeds are feminized NOT genetically modified. And no GM seeds are allowed in that particular seed bank, I don't think they are even taking modern hybrids. It is meant as a germ-plasm apocalypse protection for the world Sure. I was more talking about the whole people not caring about nature because poor thing. I can find literally no evidence that this statement is true and in fact can find evidence directly contradicting that.  Do you have a source? Can NATO fly their own bombers the same way? I think they can.

Or are they just a bunch of pussies? I got extremely excited for five seconds!! the 61st encounter is a doozy.. One year just past Yep. This actually makes me sad. Ah no what I meant was that I believe ISIS are using the captive as a bargaining tool in order to get their members released - which I thought implied they did care about their own. A fourth here for extra ooomph.  The best course of action is to nuke our imagination Chile is definitely not a third world country. Iunno considering they originally said they would kill both Japanese prisoners for money, and then when that demand wasn't met they only killed one and changed their ransom for the other. It looks like they still want something out of it otherwise wouldn't they have killed both right away? Do you laugh in English? A looooooot of people thought that mermaid bs was real. It was embarrassing.  Make sure its women who take care of the whole procedure. I hear ISIS hates being killed by women. Geneva conventions be dammmed? Frampt?

On the other hand, the economic crimes Cuba committed against its own citizens have been well documented.  I don't think they were Behind 9/11, I think they were off to the side. According to NPR this female terrorist is buddies with ISIS higher ups, wife of some dude who was around at the start when they were still al-qaeda in iraq. They might care, but that pilots probably already dead. And then we named a swimming pool centre after him. Yep, that's a derp shark If i remember correctly, Akkad who's previously made a movie about Mohammad had to consult with many Muslim clerics from different sects. Half of the important characters were invisible in that movie.  hey, how's your ruble doing?  Near doesn't mean within mortar range.  I will check the book out. Thank you for the recommendation.  Don't know who downvoted you, but you're right. We don't have any decent transport aircraft, for instance, and have to rent Russian Antonovs to get our gear back from Afghanistan. What a shame.

We switched from conscription to professional soldiers only a few years ago, but on the cheap. Far too few want to join. The Chinese communist party must have a special inferiority-complex naming committee that regulates the naming of fossils to uniquely Chinese sounding names.  Yes, we have *Albertosaurus*, etc. - but everything that comes out of China is *Jingjangosaurus eggfooyoungi* or some variant.  The PRC needs to get a grip, already. **Article summary:**

&gt;* SAO PAULO (AP) -- The worst drought to hit Brazil's biggest city in decades may leave residents with water service only two days a week.

&gt;* Sao Paulo water utility company Sabesp says a five days-off, two days-on system would be a last-ditch effort to prevent the collapse of the Cantareira water system.

&gt;* The reservoir is the largest of six that provide water to some 6 million of the 20 million people living in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo.

If you don't care about hurting innocent people, and you have far superior technology, it isn't hard to win a war.

Problem with that, of course, is that you'll be hated by the local population, and there will be more uprisings, riots and terrorists as soon as you turn your back. So you have to go the way of Russia, and start conquering lands and scattering the natives. Clearly a perfect strategy. And one of Abdullah's sons (head of the National Guard) also kept his job. If he was worried about Abdullah's sons revolting, he probably wouldn't have left one of them in charge of 200,000 soldiers. Alternatively we could start drowning them in pig blood. Worth a crack.

Hue hue hue hue hue It says 6th in the video. And that looks like it's from the 80s That's weird, becaus even when I have laughed my hardest, I've only ever felt pain in the center. I pointed it out in [this drawing].  I think the population of the US is somewhere around 350 million, 1.25 billion wings would be approx 3.5 wings per person. 

I'm gonna eat like 15 so some of you are slacking. I thought it meant they were saying it appears they could owe up to 6.392 billion, but they can still hack away at that in further accounting.  But my accounting days were almost 30 years ago so things may be different in this modern world. Better than nothing. Could be their first step toward rehabilitation.

 There would be no fight. You'd be killed as a child. Probably as a baby.  How many people do you think there are in the U.S? That's just a obtuse way of saying the people who run it are idiots. Every one of these encounters has been in international airspace. I get the anti Russian opinions, but these articles come out so frequently it's insane. They are not doing anything new, the recent coverage is just scare tactics.  This joke is underrated On the flipside, how bad would an assassin tasked with killing someone and making it look like suicide have to be to take two shots to the guys head? Have you busted a nut? I would argue that the benefits of religion that you listed can be matched by non-religious means rather easily. Plenty of families spend time together without religion. People also get lifted out of the darkest times by a HUGE arsenal of tools at our disposal, ranging from social programs to supervised medication. Scientifically-speaking, religion is a placebo, a sugar pill, when it comes to benefits. But also like a sugar pill, it can give you diabetes if you take too much of it (i.e. religious intolerance, extremism, etc.) I would honestly argue that with religion, the ends do not justify the means. Yes, but salt in everyday speech refers to table salt and no other salt as far as I know.

*edit: formatting, added the links Your assurance of something is hardly evidence of it. There is no proof, even basic reasoning, that political (or any other type) violence would somehow increase to fill the void and overall things would be the same. The worship of the Abrahamic prophets is cult worship,  except unlike David Koresh or Jim Jones said prophets aren't around to be questioned or ridiculed. It's amazing to me how much scorn we have for modern cultists while murdering each other over ancient ones.  Poland, on paper, has the #3 military in Europe, from all the stuff the USSR gave it back in the day. It also imports a lot of new European weapons to replace old Warsaw Pact equipment.

Then again, on paper, Ukraine has #2. Sometimes it's the only way to get people to listen. I really doubt it's going to be enforced often, maybe two or three times to set up an exemple and get people to understand. **DON'T TEXT or call or check instagram or whatever AND DRIVE**.

Man, I am fucking terrified of the ocean. As a grown adult, being on boat in the middle of the ocean is probably my worst nightmare...  http://i.imgur.com/rDoHYgC.jpg


It seems Putin plays on the Obama side My point was that posting images of Muhammad can be equally as hurtful for muslims as praising nazism in front of a jew. 

But in the western world. Only one of these options are allowed. One is defended by "free speech". The other is criminalized by popular demand. 

Facebook has choosen a neutral stance by blocking "anything" that a large population could consider offensive. I for one, commend them for it. 







 &gt; Also, the idea of islam being a political system is a logical fallacy. 

Most of what you claim is garbage, however it's late and this was the easiest to disprove and I couldn't be f**cked invalidating all of your nonsense!

[Educate yourself in your own leasure!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_aspects_of_Islam)

Your claim that the most common hadiths do not promote murder of innocent people is fall-down-laughing ludicrous also! [This disprove your claims, however there are oceans of more examples!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_blasphemy) The Taliban does use terrorism, but I'd say that the majority of their attacks aren't terrorism. If you bomb a checkpoint or shoot up a police academy, that's not terrorism. Honestly, my first thought was "at least they aren't using children." % same as any other religion or none at all. What? Me: "Hey Wal-Mart, I don't like you, so I'm not going to do business with you."

... 50 years later ...

Wal-Mart: "I see you're warming up to us again. Give us the money you owe us by not shopping here."

It's an absolutely ridiculous claim. Not all Africans. Just the tyrants and the people who prop them up. I think you are understating the power of the US at that time, especially in the Caribbean. 1903 was the same year Teddy essentially used the Monroe Doctrine as grounds to try to establish US hegemony in the Western Hemisphere. adobo  I agree that we do need a "secular philosophy" to replace religion. Something that not just creates ideological moral rules because then you just replace religion with a different ideology. A framework of rational thinking and ethics (e.g. [Kants Categorical Imperative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative)).

But also how to find peace in our universe, that what we leave behind after our death is not just our genes in our offspring but how we change the culture of people around us and the hoefully enlightened goal we as a species move towards.

I always say that I believe in the *idea of God* just not in God as a reality. It will humans goal to strive towards "god" in the sense that one day we will *create* god.

Imagine for example we create a benign super intelligent artificial intelligence. A networked software that is programmed to be a mix between Jesus, Ghandi and the Dalai Lama (just secular) and can talk with every single person on the planet at the same time. A friend and mentor that intrinsically loves you that you can talk to and help you grow as a person. Science fiction now but not for that long. Islamist Civil War! Islamist Civil War! Islamist Civil War! That's not terrorism. They aren't civilians.  and while you're at it, Death to Smoochy. [Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/WhgdqtA.png)

Don't like this? Message me! Actually George Washington was wrong when he made that speech in 1793 saying the 1778 treaty was annulled and proclaiming neutrality..technically we were not neutral..we supplied France with goods while they were at war with Britain . Technically that treaty of mutual defensive commitments remained in effect until 1800 following the Quasi-War:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_of_1800 My question is, if they have nothing but guesses on where these things typically live, why don't they implant a tracking device like they do whales?  It seems like that would be one easy way to find out. There are rumors of a fabled MHETO shark at the bottom of the ocean. Some say it's as big as a plane. He is targeting more than just this following of 1.2 billion people. What he says doesn't just concern the 1.2 billion people but every other religious person in this world. It crosses any boundaries in religion, countries, etc. It's an analogy.  Honestly, who cares about Ukraine? Nobody cares, except Russia.

US does not care at all about suffering of Ukraine. All it cares about is bad behaviour of Russia. True to your username.

How about maths, astronomy, pushing the foundation of the scientific method, pushing the boundaries of alchemy (the precursor to chemistry), medical advancements, philosophy, and many others.

You saying "Islam ruined everything" is like someone coming in 1000 years from now saying "America ruined everything. They did nothing but wars, torture, spying, and destroying civil liberties." Everything has to die at some point, there's billions of things living in the sea, I'm surprised there aren't hundreds and thousands of dead things washed up daily.

Fortunately I know the context so your comment is just that of an ignorant tool who is making an attempt at being PC. you are wrong. Go tell people who know more than anybody else that they are full of shit. Believe reddit over them... Christ lol. I dont comment on youtube. Im not a conspiracy theorist. i dont believe what people who were desperate to bomb the nukes tell us at face value. I read history. I listen to experts. Who are at best divided on this. But you are adamant that you know best because people on reddit say so. You think if someone has a differing opinion, which might even fall in line with experts more than yours, then they must be full of shit..It is absolutely flabbergasting.

That is one of the ugliest animals i have seen.. yeah yeah yeah. now you're complaining but once we germans arm up again you guys get nervous. I don't get this. 

A lot of women decides voluntarily to have plastic surgery and it is still aggression to them?

And when men does it is not wrong?





[ok](http://imgur.com/NlgPmzR) Terrorism actually means something. The Taliban used terrorism sometimes, but their ficus is attacking soldiers and policemen. That's evil and despicable, but it doesn't fit the definition of a terrorist organization. Shark adobo, kapag kumakain, nag kakamay. &gt; as you get your dream?

I think he may be Serbian mate.... Well you need them big churches for all them people. Correct. Our brains do not work like a computer. Think of it this way: a computer has to be ultra-precise, because even a small error can snowball and ruin your data. A brain, however, processes information through tangled neural networks and approximation. It doesn't matter if a few mistakes are made because the end result will be good enough to be functional.  Because they didn't outright ban homosexuality? Stop being lazy and use the wonder that is the internet to diversify your news sources. It works wonders for avoiding taking someone else's agenda as your own. Intersting situation - this would be against the laws of war and international law, but it's ISIS, so would the UN, the EU and the ICC turn a blind eye? Would that create a precedent that it's okay to sumarily execute prisoners so long as they were part of a group deemed sufficiently bad?  That mindset is part of the reason, no sentience wishes to be subservient. We must coexist or one will destroy the other, or we will destroy eachother.

I love the fact that these things eat jellyfish. It may be big, but it's probably not a farmable fish for food.. stupid final paragraph.  Ohhh I agree we had a desire for hegemony in the Caribbean. But we were not a global power on the scale of Britain and the reach of other imperial powers and their desires at the time for colonial conquests. The terms ( for the time period it took place in) were favorable compared to what Spain, Britain, Portugal, etc would exact from it's possessions.  Why are germans given farms in paraguay when paraguains are dirt poor and in need of farmland...

So much of south american leadership are slaves to europeans. Sellout traitors to their own people just to kowtow the europeans. Not true. Our economy is incredibly diverse. We used to be the world's largest manufacturer of hard drives, we're currently the world's largest manufacturer of oil rigs, we do oil refinery, pharmaceuticals, law, banking, education, R&amp;D, and a whole lot of other services that I can't remember off the top of my head. This is going to go down well.  Members of ISIS believe in a heaven, so I doubt they'd be terrified of being killed seeing as they're convinced that they've done everything right and are going to get into their heaven. They also threaten to level the Islamic holy city of Qam(sic?) if the hostage were not returned.  I'm not pretending or retarded, I'm just asking about this whole "sides" thing. Genuinly. I don't see how that makes me retarded. Yes? If someone dies laughing it's automatic. Kinda like how a lot of people poop when they die.  $200 and 2 points off your license where I'm from.

I've seen police dress up as homeless guys begging for change and watching people at red lights.  If they see you on your phone you get flagged and a cruiser down the street pulls you over.

 Fuck Turkey, if they want to pretend their the Ottoman Empire still we should treat them like it, they are now the sick, old, dead and now somehow reborn and dying again... Man of Europe. I would support gutting northern Turkey to give the Kurds much needed nationhood.  Spot on, I couldn't have said it any better. You can find religious people that are the most selfless beings in the world and do nothing but help or the complete opposite. Same for non religious people. It's more a reflection of humanity as a whole and not any specific reason. Maybe its the source of these claims? One of the first acts of the Greek far Left government was to fire the highly paid 'economic advisers' and re-hire hundreds of women who cleaned government buildings.  The women were fired so on the advice of the economic advisers who made much more than the honest cleaning women could make.  Send the economic advisers to Germany to work cleaning the banks there.   
 And neither has dropped a bomb yet.

Through space and time..the number is 60 :) Anybody know the lifespan of these creatures?  They look ancient. Oh, I see now. Of course.  While religious organizations founded universities in the past, and many old scientists were religious, you can't day outright that religion pushed science. Copernicus delayed the publication of his book because he feared for what the church would do to him for his theory. Galileo was branded a heretic by the church for his heliocentric writings. While the church backed these scientist, it only did so if they stayed within acceptable boundaries and it was not going to take free thinkers lightly.  Baby that's a fact Yeah, mostly a desert type of breads, I had a chocolate spice bread once and my grandma used to make a chocolate buttermilk bread.

&gt;How about maths, astronomy, pushing the foundation of the scientific method, pushing the boundaries of alchemy (the precursor to chemistry), medical advancements, philosophy, and many others.

All prior to 1200AD. Very little was done after 1200 AD. You ask why? Muslims became majority in 1200 after centuries of murdering everyone else.

&gt;You saying "Islam ruined everything" is like someone coming in 1000 years from now saying "America ruined everything. 

IF America were to stop all innovation and start behaving like spreading "Americanism" is the only thing left to do in the world, then yes. 

 I await the tons of whattaboutery to flood this thread. &gt; /r/worldnews is for major news from around the world except US-internal news

 IIRC, it was the severed penis, stuffed into the corpse's mouth. I found a online google books with that particular passage a few weeks ago.  US has around 360M  50% of the human population is stupid. And another 50% are even stupider than that. &gt;Religion does lead to the rejection of opposing views though.  

Human life leads to the rejection of opposing views. It is natural for folks to not be accepting of different ideas. Lack of education also contributes to this, as well. It does not seem fair to blame religion for only reinforcing what people tend to do naturally. Religion is not the root cause. 

&gt;Religion though strongly discourages critical thought and instead encourages authoritarian thought.  This problem gets worse the more fundamentalist the religion becomes.

Is it correct to say authoritarian views and critical thought are diverging, even opposing and contradictory ideas? I was in what would be considered a heavily fundamentalist religion that encouraged both submission to authority as well as critical thinking and intellectual pursuits. 

To reiterate my original point: religion is not the cause of humanity's woes. It is an easy target because people use their religion as justification. However, if you removed every ounce of religion from the world, people would likely be just as scared of change, greedy for power, etc. as they are now.  While I personally think education and self-awareness is a solution to these issues, I would not say the eradication of religion would positively benefit humanity.  "Scientists were as baffled as the crewmen: though loosely related to two other, mostly vegetarian, shark behemothsthe whale shark and the basking shark"

"mostly vegetarian"

....  I used to think Australia was as chilled as the netherlands, with a common sense approach. Nowadays its quickly devolving into some corrupt backwards country like belarus. &gt; Megalodon

As cool as it would be to just see one, that shit would be terrifying. I think nationalism did. 

I think the common people viewed Christianity as part of their national identity.  I think Jewish people were target more for being "foreigners," in a conspiracy theory about banks, etc more than because of a different belief about Jesus.

I think masterminds, Hitler, Goebbels, etc were atheists, who recognized that opposing Christianity was not prudent. I think the Church was scared of Hitler, and did very little to oppose him, so Hitler did not focus on them much.

I don't think this is a unusual view - there is a wikipedia page dedicated to Hitler's religious views.

I also think saying "the Church didn't start Hitler, it just didn't stop him," isn't much of a compliment for the Church. Seriously, [Four lions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BjDUJF4KZg) was meant to be a parody, not a training video... George Washington was wrong in the same way the Cubans are wrong. They are refusing to recognize a portion of a treaty they deem inconvenient based on the foundational change of government. The 1778 treaty required both economic and military support.

My point is that the Cuban claim is not without precedent in the slightest. Not saying its right, but this is a pretty standard move after revolution. I don't think we should give up the base at all, but renegotiation would be a pretty realistic move in my mind. I hear that you can get ten people around a buoy and one will show up. Not too sure though, Kevin wasn't that descriptive. It is; however, easy to defend yourself from such attacks through discussion and the person making over-generalizations can learn something (which is a bonus for everyone). Furthermore, it is a very useful tool to be able to put your emotions aside and have a calm discussion, but to develop that skill you need to endure a little pain (like learning anything else that is difficult). As for your last sentence, I'm convinced that religion is created and modified by individuals, so blaming individuals doesn't abnegate responsibility from religion. It's saying the same thing. Ultimately though, the best way for corruption to be expunged is through discussion, debate, and ensuing reforms.  &gt; By whom?

By members of the bodies you're blindly trusting to only execute people who fit _your_ definition of terrorist.

I won't take issue with the death penalty for people undeniably guilty of atrocities such as those IS are behind, but simply saying "terrorists = executed" is _far_ too generous given how fast and loose the word is used. That actually looks like John Travolta... STOP RESISTING ARREST  &gt; Our president is too busy trying to get re-elected so he hasn't been paying attention to any of this.

You would think these events would have a little bit of relevance for the elections. So, the legitimate rulers of Jordan would kills multiple humans to protest the death of a single human?

You think we havent seen aliens because they don't exist? Nah, its shit like this. No alien would bring a physical body any where near this insane planet... This is what occurs when Sharks eat wrongly disposed botox needles.
 This is all a bit like a Monty Python skit.

We have a problem with extremists. Most extremists look at porn. So, if we get rid of the porn... the extremists will go away! You can also test a scientific theory if you want, too.

Religion can't really be tested, which should raise some red flags. Steve Zissou has a new movie coming out. Wait... are you telling me they are actually playing *INSIDE MY HEADPHONES?!?!?!?* In sweden they do. Just google "russian airspace violations in sweden" and you will find many examples, just last year. on the first image it looks like, a wild Wailmer suddenly appeared. I don't know how much one can glean from one sensationalist click-bait article, but merely stating that "theologies are dangerous because they're tribalism..." is incredibly reductionist and overly simplistic in and of itself. It really doesn't add anything new to the discourse (on the politics and sociology of religion), since this exact same tired argument has been made time and again.

Moreover, empiricism (assuming that this is what you mean by "evidence"), while incredibly valuable, does not posses a monopoly on truth. 

 No sorries given. Just a friendly reminder that /r/science comments are required to be on topic, please refrain from jokes, etc. I doubt that's really a concern. Turkey's placement at the crossroads between Europe and the ME, as well as control over the Black Sea, means their geopolitical role will always be larger than their economic or technological role should allow. Left or right handed, is the key question? Why do so many people hate on Catholics, as a Catholic my self I don't understand. (Serious question) the only thing they bring up is how all of them are molesters, which simply is not true. You don't act like a cunt just because someone else is acting like a cunt. Hey it works Although Putin has corruption on his side, which is a big factor in regards to the overall power of the head of state. I know a few megamouths.  they never shutup &gt; can always....... provided you have a permit.

how it can be called as always?

 Sooo peaceful.  Thanks for the nightmares  Laugh a long time, suddenly pain on one or both sides. Either a spasm or muscle exhaustion. I guess the exhaustion pain wouldn't be sudden. &gt; The Kurd are an Iranian people. It is very, very likely that a Kurdistan would be allied with Iran

What are you smoking? That is a *very* weird conclusion to come to. The fact that the Kurds are *Iranic* means fuck all. Poles are slavic, doesn't mean they like Russia. 

If the Kurds were *Shiite* then you might have a point, but they're not that either. They're Sunni. They have also been fighting with Iran for quite a while. How on earth did you come to this conclusion? Yep. I hope this is obvious to most at this point. 

However, that doesn't mean NATO countries don't use covert means and proxy wars to antagonist the Russian Bear (Ukraine). Gotta love that heart-shaped transition in that video.  I have no idea what you mean by "regular atheists" nor why you believe these people should be stereotyped. Nah man, American's doing good around the world..  You can say that about any of the big countries. Modern armies have little experience in real ground combat and they mostly cannot succeed against other guerrilla fighters in cities or jungles. Without heavy air power most of these nations including US,China and Russia are weak against guerrilla fighters for example:  Afganistan,Vietnam, Somalia, Iraq.Even with such powerful weapons  like airpower very determined nations with willing fighters* weapons flow support can hold back big armies like the US or Russia. 

* fighter moral and determination is the most important. you can have all the weapons, but if your fighters don't belive in the fight. It is over. Example: Ukrainian Army.
 Sooo... Adam?
 http://i.imgur.com/5IahLdI.gif fun fact the only shia sect considered muslim by sunnis is Zaydi Shi'a, a tiny fraction of the overall shia population. the shia in this article are Twelver Shi'a, the largest branch of shia islam. according to wikipedia Twelver shia make up the majority of the population in Iran (90%), Azerbaijan (85%), Bahrain (70%), Iraq (65%), Lebanon (65% of Muslims). &gt;I am not a religious person, but I think his assumptions are a bit misguided. Religion does not create xenophobic tendencies, but can be used to support such pre-existing world views.

Men are above women. There goes half the Earth's population.

"Men are in charge of women by what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend for maintenance from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in the husband's absence what Allah would have them guard. But those wives from whom you fear arrogance - first advise them; if they persist forsake them in bed; and finally strike them." Quran 4:34

"A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner." 1 Timothy 2:11-14

"And call to witness, from among your men, two witnesses. And if two men be not found then a man and two women." Quran 2:282

Gays deserve death.

"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them." Leviticus 20:13

Not in our club? Tough shit.

"Surely the vilest of animals in Allahs sight are those who disbelieve" Quran 8:55

"I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them" Quran 8:12

&gt;There are plenty of people who exhibit these tribalistic qualities without believing in a deity just as there are people who are very religious who do not exhibit these tendencies.

Supremacist, misogynistic, divisive. These views come from several places but to say religion isn't one of them is simply not true.
 yup thats why german arms are all over the world right now.  
you're probably talking about ww2 where german equipment was build by slave labour.  
that doesn't apply anymore today. well if you consider the wages it might to some extend. Restaurant at the end of the universe... Before I read the book I imagined it at the end of the universe, like the edge, not the end if time. Words can be so ambiguous sometimes This video in the article has a super adorable moment when [some kids ask questions about the shark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32qp_GMFoFs#t=66). Good This looks just like the serpents from Dark Souls Turk here. Come and fucking get it.

edit: I've got absolutely nothing against the Kurdish people. I just find it absolutely ridicilous that one's *freedom* can be **decreed** by someone sitting on a cushy chair thousands of miles away. The social lottery is a sad addiction. Thats why it supported the coup? And helped install the leaders?  Haha dude you are so naive This isn't Israel, so don't really expect worldwide condemnation if Jordan goes through with it.  Greetings, chosen undead No..... Any idea what that thing eats? Does it filter feed or eat whatever it can fit in its mouth? Usually an aquatic animal with an abnormally large mouth filter feeds to increase water volume it can intake, but I could also see it eating fish.  As long as NATO holds together things will stay that way. Russia is playing divide-and-conquer and sadly it has a realistic chance of working. There are many extremist parties in the EU like Syriza who hate the US, EU, and NATO and want to rip up the international security system and cut deals with Putin. And then there are those like Gerhard Schroeder who have clearly been corrupted by Russian money. And he's still alive.

People keep saying that Mugabe only has "few months more to live". He's only had a few more months to live for the last 5 years now. I agree that machine learning is a powerful technique but I believe it will only augment human decision making not replace it as t cannot self identify new tasks and relevant metrics. 

To be honest I'm not sure if AI will ever be a danger but it certainly won't in the next 50 years. The US and NATO don't have to sabre rattle like Putin is doing to get any point across. Putin is showing signs of desperation and reverting to cold war tactics.  I'm with you. My abs get a work out after laughing really hard for a while.  If she stayed inside her house she wouldn't be raped just sayin. 
Only kidding.  European missile shield...that's the provocation.  http://thediplomat.com/2013/11/us-bombers-challenge-chinas-air-defense-identification-zone/ That's Israel's land anyways &gt; after centuries of murdering everyone else

They murdered everyone, and I mean everyone. You're right. That's why Jews were still in Yemen, Iraq, and many other parts of where Muslims went before the founding of modern Israel. It's also why Christians still thrive in Egypt and are were in Iraq until the recent war. Not to mention the tons of other religions in Muslim countries which are here to this day. by the fact you have one and they guy above was paying $500 a year. "What'd you catch it on?"
"Corn Dog." They are on holiday Can the UK please do some 19th century-style archaeological preservation? The Nineveh exhibit in the British Museum could do with an expansion... And thanks to our friends in Europe, they have plenty of money to fund those activities. Yeah, the title is definitely a bit sensationalist. Obviously this is a stupid statement or at least one that is impossible to substantiate so the real question is, "What is the objective of broadcasting this stupidity?" And the answer is to smear Palestinians. And on r/worldnews. How surprising. "Pro-Palestinian = Anti-Jew" That's the point of this headline otherwise the stupidity of this priest's utterance could die a stupid and peaceful death like all other statements that don't warrant repeating. Going off to another country to fight for a non ally should be treated as what it is, high treason. It shouldn't be seen as a phase. These aren't kids listening to shitty music.

I'm honestly happy I left Sweden.  You play your game, no one cares. Carrying bombs is strategically foolish and expensive.

http://thediplomat.com/2013/11/us-bombers-challenge-chinas-air-defense-identification-zone/ I've been to Singapore and I think the rules are bullshit. Or the bodycount. Certain sea turtle species eat jellyfish. Just another reason to love them! According to the source, the least miserable country is Brunei, and the 3rd least miserable country is China.

So, yeah. Booooooring  Let me make a prediction: nobody west of Donetsk will give a flying fuck as always. Can we call it Jay Z? Such an eloquent speaker.... Sad, but true... :-( &gt;Russians are pathetic, flying these 1950's metal shitboxes around. 

&gt;.. these pathetic propeller planes!

Do you know how many 1950s P3s are flying in air forces.  Are the people of all those countries pathetic?

The United States still uses P3s too.  Any amount of money would make a terrible boat What is your definition of "terrorism" Never heard that Zaydis are considered Muslim by Sunnis. Do you have any source for that?  &gt; All it cares about is bad behaviour of Russia.

Yea, thats what it cares about. Yea, its got a whip and is getting ready to punish big bad Russia for being a naughty boy. y u du dis [haHA!](http://i.imgur.com/2mW4m.gif) yeah because one shark is going to solve world hunger.  If it used the move "attract" it'll fail every time  Crimea Dollar costs 71 roubles now. It was 69 yesterday. What's half of 1.25 billion? Why is it incredible simplistic?  The explanation he gives in the article is a little more nuanced than the title:

&gt; All the ideologies and religions have their own answers for the big questions, but these are usually bound as a dogma to some kind of tribe, he said. Religions in particular feature supernatural elements that other tribes  other faiths  cannot accept  And every tribe, no matter how generous, benign, loving and charitable, nonetheless looks down on all other tribes. Whats dragging us down is religious faith.

Empiricism might not have a "monopoly on truth," whatever you mean by that, but it's by the far the best thing we have - and since adopting it, we've built planes, gone to the moon, and figured out what humans are made of.  Religion and magical thinking, however complex and nuanced, haven't given us much more than ideas to reflect on.  (And speaking of tired arguments, what's more boring than theological discussions that have lasted for centuries and proved nothing?) I wish there was some kind of middle ground.  On the one hand dictatorships are bad and do truly horrible things to their people (beyond simply miss-managing the countries they rule).  Plus even the US has a really disgusting death penalty system that ends up executing people based on skin color.  On the other hand sometimes you have to admire being able to go to town on terrorists or truly despicable criminals.  I wish we could have some kind of quota system like ten criminals a decade who once fairly convicted at trial can be horribly executed based on public vote.  Oh the terrorists want their buddy back?  Toss him off a skyscraper!  Oh Ted Bundy is coming up for parole? Shoot him in the back of the head!  Ten per decade.  Avoid the fundamental injustice of a dictatorship, abolish the death penalty otherwise, but for the absolute worst of the worst give ourselves a pass and really let them have it. Homeless kids can also replace their Free Shave Card for a slice of bread. What they did was [basic fighter maneuvers (BFM)](http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/in-focus-german-eurofighters-impress-during-red-flag-373312/), which means chasing tails with guns. This is a solved problem in the 70s when the fighter mafia figured out energy maneuverability theory. It is generally accepted that sustained turning rate is the most crucial characteristic in a gun-only dogfight. The Typhoon is designed to be a light weight fighter with very powerful engines, which makes it ideal in this regard.

Now, thrust vectoring as a maneuver tool is sorta like canard, they both sacrifice energy for great instantaneous turn rate. This is useful in modern WVR dogfight because modern WVR missiles benefit from large off-axis angle and support for head mount display targeting, which means you don't need to get a firm hold on the tail of your opponent, just suddenly point your nose in his general direction and you'll get a firing chance. A firing chance is very advantageous because it sends your opponent scrambling and even if it misses you'll get the time to gain a better position for a second attack. 

This is not helpful in BFM because guns are dumb and you can't just suddenly point your gun in his general direction and say "I got you", your opponent will just laugh it off and continue working on your six.  In Donetsk DK Kuibyshev was hit by mortar fire on the street Panfilov, 86. 5 people standing in line for humanitarian aid have died. In addition, shelling destroyed the trolley and shuttle bus. 12 people since the beginning of the day. Yesterday, it was reported only in Donetsk 11 civilians have died from military actions. The shelling was carried from the village of Optinoye.

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B8mRcAeIQAEqXA2.jpg:large A thousand years from now, some future antiques expert will be able to date these carpets by what kind of drone was woven into the fabric. So Putin's actions are vindicated by a crisis that happened over 50 years ago?????

Well in that case Poland and Finland should send out patrols in Ukraine just in case of another soviet invasion.  Lol YPG isn't a terrorist group, and Kobane always was in control of Kurds 
another explanation for this discrepancy between the size of the players claimed their roles is hard to think An anti-protest group is going to have a protest against protests.

Russians are going to put comedians out of work. The OP article says filter feed The west can find a lot of use in the Kurds, giving them military support and governance over ethnically mixed areas on the condition they respect rights could solve some of the problems. For one, look at your dates.  The latest one was 47 years ago.  Two, none were as close to Russia as these Russian planes were to the UK and France.  Apples and oranges man. This might be true, but there's little chance we'll go on consuming oil at this rate to the very last drop. Many markets and industries will likely have transitioned away from oil by 2089 (74 years from now). So they might have a lot more than 74 years left, once demand drops off - but that will also bring prices down, so it's anyone's guess, really. In any case, the sooner they lose this stream of money, much of which appears to be funding global terrorism, the better. Come on now. Let's not let the acts of a small number of Muslims generalize the whole population.  Giving a sponge bath or saying that 'poverty is bad' isn't going to change anything that his followers say or do anymore than if he eats Belgium waffles or corn flakes for breakfast. So, why is one news worthy while we never hear about the other? He has 1.2 billion followers so all of his mundane activities are of public interest, correct?  This guy gets it.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2S12_Sani

Out of range.  &gt;They were the latest of the Abrahamic religion

I think Rastafarianism holds that honor.  The Kurds have done pretty well defending their homeland in the mountains of Iraq with inferior firepower. They stopped every assault Baghdad sent there way and gave Saddam a bloody nose during those attacks. The US has repeatedly left them out in cold. 
The power vacuum that was created with the deposition of Saddam allowed the Kurds to expand their territory and take back historic lands.  The OP article says that humans have only seen a megamouth around 60 times with most of those times being sharks that were caught by fishing boats. I would assume no science vessel has ever come across one alive to tag. Better yet offer them a deal, "keep respecting the rights of the minorities and we'll ship you weapons and promise to bomb anyone who fucks with you". Are you always this adorable? This is inhumane and violates the Geneva Conventions to which Jordan is a signatory. ISIL is abhorrent and it should be met with force. However, no matter what goal we are fighting for, inhumane treatment of captured soldiers is unacceptable.

These conventions were adopted because of the horrific crimes of states during WWII and stand as a means by which future crimes might be prevented. We can't go down this road or accept other countries going down this road.

IANAL so I'm not fully sure how the Geneva Conventions work in law, but surely threatening to kill captured soldiers violates their right to due process - if they should be executed, it should be after a trial. If we believe in the rule of law, we have to uphold due process even in the case of terrible crimes and actions committed by enemy combatants.

You're a brute if you don't believe we should uphold rule of law in certain situations. All the rare ocean life look so derpy Oh my ged Finger Licken Chicken! KFC booms business Depends on what you want to do. Do you just want to decimate a country or do you want to occupy it?  at least Hammurabi will be proud Animal planet did a special on sharks near beaches and washing up. Turns out Asian fishermen who, just collect the fins and dump the dying sharks back into the middle(-ish) of the oceans they fish, the sharks release a stress chemical that warns other sharks not to go near there. So these fishing paths have corralled thousands of sharks closer to shore.  How do we know its not a regular shark that got stung in its mouth by a bunch of bees? Cool Russia, launch one of those ICBMs from the 80s, and we will see if it ever reaches anywhere close to it's intended target. We just created the first aquatic animal laser program, and the most promising have been the sharks... So don't go. It's simple. I don't get it. I thought it was because both have skinny bodies. Well, if you find a picture, don't post it to shittyfoodporn. Putin? A communist? Ha! &gt;  assyrians

There are I think not that many of them left sadly. A hundred years ago there were literally millions, now, maybe 1 million? DAW IM A SHARK HUH MICKEY HUH! Best korea launches its rockets I dont think there are any big sea creatures remaining to be discovered. I think the british/french have that right dont they?

Wow, /r/worlnewsers really do lack basic reading comprehension. 

&gt; but those 5000 could be stopped by Putin and they are not.

&gt;*one* in 5000 Here are some that I found - 

http://rt.com/news/215047-pentagon-confrims-nato-buildup/

&gt;The Pentagon has confirmed the military buildup along Russias borders to ensure long-term peace and stability in the region. Earlier Moscow accused NATO of a sharp increase in air activity and intelligence flights in the border zone.

&gt;In the meantime, NATO jets will be patrolling the airspace of the Baltic States on a permanent basis, flying along Russia's border. Russia did not set forth any claims about it.

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-15/russia-says-u-s-nato-increased-spy-flights-seven-fold You can actually die from it... That's why ppl say "I'm dying" or "stop it you're killing me" when something is really funny

Source: I'm graduated top of my class at Harvard medical school and have won 2 Nobel Prizes This is the second megamouth shark that's appeared in the Philippines in the past decade  &gt; Russia has handed a multi-billion dollar contract to build a bridge to the Crimea peninsula to an ally and former judo partner of Vladimir Putin who is under Western sanctions.

&gt;**The company's primary expertise is in building gas pipelines and related infrastructure and *it has not built a bridge before*.** It was unclear exactly how long the bridge would be, but the strait varies from around 4-15 kilometers in width (2.5-9 miles). &gt; BTW, this treaty goes back to 1903. Long before Batista was in power.

My mistake.

&gt; The people may see it " illegitimate" but treaties that are recognized internationally don't just go away when a new gov't takes over from a previous gov't. Do treaties of the United States have the right to be broken if a Democratic president comes to office? it doesn't work that way.

The agreement was made with a government, not with the people of the country. When that political entity ceases to exist entirely, who is now liable to uphold the agreement, and how can it be fair to be transferrable to the people of the nation? It may be the way it works, but I would have thought if the US government had any real intention of being fair or reasonable this should be something that is addressed. You do not even know what the word "coup" means. It's so rare that we found 60 of them. THANK YOU! I was going to post this and you beat me to it.  She's an unfortunate moron and needs to be condemned.  Does he still work for Microsoft? Thus ends the honeymoon. I find it interesting that you felt the need to quote that, considering it's the only word in his comment.

It would be pretty awesome though. I never had to travel by boat anyway. But NATO does fly around Russian borders it's just that you don't interested in it. its even more simple: they are fucking lunatic wankers who want to do fucking lunatic wanker shit One instance from 2001 and one from 2014. That qualifies as "constantly"? As an American I fucking hope not. If this is how we treat our friends, then we don't deserve any Nope.

See, another example of you spending so much time trying to prove someone else wrong that you miss the whole point.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(esotericism)


Again, try thinking on a higher plane.


 Nuclear wouldn't make energy cheaper. The main reason it didn't take off is once you make it safe the costs are roughly comparable to wind power. Are they real U.S. citizens or political Saudi U.S. citizens? I need to know their names before I can give a fuck. No, I'm making fun of the subreddit /r/atheism, not the average person Oh yes and riding his private jet around the world to places. Not if you're Walmart. But probably too ridiculous for a sensible nation like Cuba.  Did that shark also spend $150,000 to look like kim kardashian? You are  both the same side of the coin, just a different face. Betas... I prefer to look at it this way - inequality for the poor is written into the law itself.  The privilege of the rich is not due to corruption, but rather an imperfect legal system.  You might say - one law to rule them all, and in the darkness bind them. You asked if there was a "specific incident". That made me question your mental prowess. 

Anyway, idk the origin, it's a 150 year old idiom. Try /r/askhistorians if you're honestly curious. How many naval bases including a concentration camp does the USA have?..  It can only stop a couple missiles, and even then there's a chance one can get through. 

Russia's armament of tactical nukes could overwhelm it, and I'm not even going to mention ICBMs.

If you're Iran or North Korea, sure, it could stop your missiles, but Russia? *lol* And don't forget that it's defensive, not offensive, in nature. 

Plus the original assertion was the United States does *this* all the time to Russia in reference to bombers &amp; such....but no other source seems to corroborate that..... 

Also....it's a little odd that this coincides more with the conflict in Ukraine than it does the missile shield....... Jordan: "Two can play at that game you stupid shit heels" Bedankt! I know ISIS kind of deserves execution and all, but isn't a legal system supposed to decide on a punishment for a criminal's actions regardless of the actions of other criminals? Dear Jordan, this is not how you're supposed to do law. Best Regards, Amanoo.

'MURICA! &gt; Turkmen

Turks. Turkmen are from Turkmenistan. &gt;Most bases overseas should be closed. In Germany there are random US Army facilities dotted all over the countryside that serve no purpose.

Who do you think trains NATO? Protects infrastructure and trade? Or has a defensive agreement? 

&gt;I'm all for pulling everything out of Korea, Japan, UK, Italy, and most of the Germany (Ramstein is actually a reasonable jumping off point to Africa, SW Asia, and Eastern Europe)

If we pulled out of Korea and Japan neither would have the training, manpower or technology (I don't mean the advancement but the volume of tech). The UK, Italy and German governments all generally want the US there to provide "free" training and access to the "standard" of military doctrine and tech. Ramstein is not even close to a reasonable jump off point to the southern arab region which is why we have so many forces built up around the horn of Africa. Eastern Europe makes sense for Ramstein but apparently you don't know where SW Asia is on the map.

&gt;As for Guantanamo, that is actually strategic to the US because all of the goods that flow out of the Mississippi watershed via New Orleans to the rest of the world is massive economic interest for the US. 

Guantanamo does not support the strategic area of the Mississippi trade nearly as much as other bases in Florida and Texas. Guantanamo does more in terms of offering space in the Caribbean where there isn't a lot. If Guantanamo was shut down the US would have a hard time finding enough land to have a comprehensive base in the region without paying a large premium or reducing the tourist economy on one of their islands in the Caribbean.  [cow slap] Uh, it's a negotiating tactic being used with savages. I have first hand experience of these fuckers when I was over there. The people themselves will tell you that there is a northern alliance against the southern tribes f the Taliban. There is even a fucking vice documentary about it. Educate yourself you cunt I'll just wait over here and see if they are any campaigns or political action to encourage more men to go to college and fix a gender gap. 

 At least one too many. That was just a joke/hyperbole, but I see now how you might have thought I was acting retarded. http://www.timecube.com is also targeting all those people. Targeting doesn't mean much if you don't have a large following.  It's like having a little shop in the bottom of a hospital, I love a good little shop. Fuck it, Putin gets to fuck with the west because we hold back, start shipping crates of weapons to Ukraine in the most OBVIOUS way possible and *play dumb*. Send fighter jets without transponders all along common flight paths into russia and *play dumb*. Offer unlimited paid leave to NATO troops who want to take a "holiday" and fight for Ukraine. Is anyone else wondering why the hell the US Navy was using a sand-filled parachute as an anchor? Not really no, you have the same definition many have which is wrong.  You could pretty much go to the "religion" page of wikipedia if you want a real definition.  

/u/ticsuap explained it well.  

Also, you don't "have" evidence; you believe what other people say is evidence.  Everything you know is dependent on someone else's ideals, not yours; you don't "know" anything you only "know" what someone else before you taught you.  

Science as you know it, to you personally is a theory unless you do the same experiments that the people before you did. 

Under your words and definition it's another faith. 
 Just like everything going on in Nigeria, but no fuck will be flown either Why post a picture of his wife? Blob fish Which is why Putin is so damn cold. 

KBG keeping shit real for a looooong time, even after they've been dismantled. That, the music choice, and the scientist explaining his relationship with shark. 

Beautiful. Well I'm assuming that he'd try to speak his piece online in some form or fashion before attempting something like this right?  (if indeed he is *not* schizo. spectrum or etc)

His story probably wasn't paid much attention to wherever he tried to post it, so he thought that this would have a larger reach.

So maybe to hear his "speech" we just have to follow the trail of his online history.  I mean, we know his facebook profile right?   The first check was cashed during the chaos of the revolution, but no checks have been cashed since.  Mocking his clothing choices isn't going to make him worth any less. Plus, Aerosmith played the opening theme to Dazed and Confused (Sweet Emotion). but what we REALLY want to know about megamouth's is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32qp_GMFoFs&amp;t=1m15s They're in wuv :3 If they do, then why negotiate for prisoners? It is contrary to any "belief".

the whole shit pile is nihilism actually. Isis/Isil/Daesh whatever, are nihilists. I hope they get a fatwa put on them. Might escalate? Or did Russia quickly bring that situation to an end, unlike what everyone else is doing with IS today? An AI can be smart but lack ethics and all things we think of as common sense. An AI with the sole purpose and goal of solving questions given to it by humans could still be very dangerous, through so called [perverse instantiation](http://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.nl/2014/07/bostrom-on-superintelligence-4.html). 

A simple example is you ask it to try and minimize human suffering on Earth. It could solve this task perfectly by deciding to kill all humans, because then there can't be suffering. A human would understand that that wasn't the intention of the request, but the machine's only goal is optimizing a solution for the problem. Humans could try and come up with all kind of bounds, like don't kill humans, but we can never predict what other unexpected solutions the AI finds. No, it isn't.  Read that wrong and thought it said "Megalodon", almost shat myself. Yah that's the shark I was thinking of when I heard megamouth. Another potential candidate for megamouth would be the [whale shark](http://cdn2.arkive.org/media/F1/F121C21F-3EAE-4078-B188-096F830F8515/Presentation.Large/Whale-shark-feeding.jpg), but its current name is already pretty descriptive.  He was probably very sick already to have come to the surface. Deep sea creatures can't equalize to the lack of pressure on the surface very well. Afghanistan primary explains  the point why wars certainly won't work. .. Sorry but you're mistaken. Petrodollar warfare is the whole reason we have sanctions on Russia ATM and why we have attacked many other country that have tryd to get away from the petrodollar system. Our enemies know the petrodollar is the weak spot in our national security. This is the whole reason that Brazil,Russia,India and China are working to form a BRIC's currency. They are NOTHING, not even 2% of the population. Some survived by paying heavy "Jiziya", others fled and came back later. Furthermore Jews and Christians have *some* protections afforded by the virtue of being "people of the book", pagans didn't have that. Were slaughtered. Zoroastrian and other pagan religions were killed en mass. Today the last known Zoroastrians live in India, they had to flee THAT far to escape from horrid Muslims.  

Don't compare flourishing populations to fringe populations who lived/live in extreme fear of being murdered anytime.  I do wish Cuba would stop with this song and dance. They want normalized relations, if they dont get on the fast track with a second term president on the way out they're going to have to wait 8-16 more years for this. Haha this is awesome! My 7 year old brother likes mega mouth sharks, as he saw a picture of one in a book I showed him. Can't wait to show him this, too!

On another note its always interesting to hear about these very large creatures being so gentle. I can't help but get a sense of adrenaline/fear when I think about being next to these creatures in the water,  but I love all animals and I'd like to see as many as I can in the flesh.

This was an oddly happy post for me. I guess it brought out my inner child XD Your comment is creeping me out, skynet. I don't think they had Selfies back in the 80s...I hope. &gt;.&gt;  I would count blowing up a police academy as terrorism. Its still a school. Fffuuuu!! Nobody in their right minds is going deciminate another country, unless they feel they are going to be destroyed first. Destroying a country is the easy part, but capturing and controlling a country is the real art of war. In 2007 I wrote a paper for a college class on the possibility of insurgency in Nigeria. Though I mentioned Boko Haram, I was focused on MEND. The transnationalism of Islamic Insurgency in Africa though, shows a clear bridge of ideology stretching the entire Sahel. The importation of heroine and opium from Afghanistan. Proximity to Libya, Algeria, and Chad, plus the shell state of Nigeria, has led to a situation that is completely out of control. Nigeria, I believe is the #1 economy in Africa, and nearly a complete failure of a state.  Maybe if the Jordanians get as hard core about this type of stuff as the Russians things might change.  Here`s a cautionary NSFW tale:  http://articles.philly.com/1986-01-15/news/26052630_1_hostage-crisis-soviet-captives-islamic-liberation-organization
 We could also survive without that "toehold". We don't really need a "toehold" in the Caribbean. We have MacDill AFB in Tampa and they can reach out and touch anybody in the vicinity in minutes. Finland times is a Russian propaganda front. I still think Garbodor's uglier  So you're using **one person** to describe the effectiveness of the **entire system?**

Did you not read the articles I linked you to?  The USA has the **worst** health care system among **all** developed nations.  It has the least efficient health care system of **all** nations in the world!

What about that doesn't make sense to you? Yeah, it is.  Not if the southern voting parts don't care enough for the north.

Kind of like a Rebpublican presidential candidate ran with "Kill all gays" knowing that 51% would be ok with (not true but you get the idea).

He doens't need to please everyone. Just 50%+1. Hey Palestinian supporters... this is your comrade. Eat shit Venezuela. Democratic countries VERY VERY VERY rarely go to war, ever. Those of us in sane land (ie. not "russia stronk" putin land) have realised it's fucking retarded to blow each other up. This is why we can't have nice things in India. Turkey and Iran will ensure that doesn't happen.  http://i.imgur.com/Rof3Z1t.jpg Isn't that proactive on China's part though? I mean....it's centered on territory disputed by both Japan &amp; South Korea, both of whom we consider to be the legitimate holder. 

China did more than provoke there, they tried to outright claim what Japan &amp; us consider to be Japanese territory.

I...I don't think Portugal or the United Kingdom are disputed territory of Russia.  The British government was supposed to only be allowing America to use its airports to transfer suspects for torture.

This is pretty damming and means that Tony Blair should definitely be tried for war crimes and or treason. Way to swim, retard. Your entire species was keeping themselves on the down-low, and you swam right onto land, like a dumbass. Stupid fish. I see my droll sense of humor failed to come across well in text.  Apologies.  100% agree with this article.  Branding and semiotics is disgustingly powerful and avoiding overloaded political language will always advance discussions.

With that being said, I'm perfectly fine with labeling certain actions sadist, genocidal, totalitarian, etc. if they fit the bill.  Call something "terrorism" doesn't define anything since anything can be "terrifying."  I find certain actions of my government "terrifying" are they "terrorists" too?

 &gt;In Germany there are random US Army facilities dotted all over the countryside that serve no purpose.

Whenever someone brings up Chalmers Johnson's thesis that American military bases overseas amount to being an empire I like to remind the world that several of those bases are golf courses in Germany. Yeah he will just ceremoniously execute political rivals or politicians who ignore him. I don't know where that came from, I think he may have told that to some of his fellow students at the TU. It seems he might have had some problems with his parents and there are rumors that they had divorced, but I cannot confirm either of these things. All I know is they are in fact alive. A government theoretically represents the people. You don't negotiate treaties with Joe Schmo on the street. You negotiate with designated representatives of that gov't. Treaties don't get abrogated when a new gov't comes to power. Some gov'ts do this unilaterally and sometimes that results in war or sanctions. The U.S has renegotiated the lease previously, the last one in 1934 I believe. Perhaps it will renegotiate the terms if we get some concessions from Cuba.  I love Boris. He's proper, *proper* mental &gt; The related costs are insane and prevent proper infrastructure and social investment in the US.

Can I see he numbers behind this. And how will I get home today seeing as there is no proper infrastructure? Did they pawn the trains? Unaccounted for  stolen. Seems like an actually decent plan. Well done, Jordan. &gt; ~~Left or right handed~~

Lotion or No-Lotion

 But he/she didn't... Who feels that they are stuck with PR? PR is awesome.... I'd be sad if they voted for independence. Obviously you know nothing about the powers of the executive office.

Obviously you have not been paying attention to the unprecedented governance by mandate by a president who has openly declared that he does not need the consent of congress to further his agenda.

 I think old mate tony would have necked himself if he found out he had in fact arrived here on a beach Crimea Yep, that's why she left.  All I had to offer her was a sperm whale. &gt;But I believe we should avoid taking incremental steps before we know how far we are willing to go, he said. This is a territory 300 miles from Moscow, and therefore has special security implications.

Translated into plain English: If we get involved openly supporting one side of a Ukrainian civil war (in an area that's just a 6 hour drive from Moscow) the Russians may react a lot more strongly than we expect. The US could manufacture thousands of nuclear weapons in a month's time. Don't give us a reason to. Yeh as far as I know I can't stand Boris as a politian, however this is an incredibly clever way to stop recruitment by these IS 'wankers'. Now we need to fund some scientific reseach that will find they they all have tiny winkies too. Sadly this is the language these groups understand. This type of reaction is what gets noticed by these people. If you get caught in a cut and dry manner, say, with an explosive vest..... There is no reason not to hurry up with the execution....


On a personal note, I hope the pilot is alive and well. They need to put a tracker in her and have him personally carpet bomb the square mile she's in once he's up to flying again. Following doesn't mean much, when the issue he is discussing can't be confined to one religion or nation. Its a worldwide issue and belongs in worldwide discussion. Different flavors of Islam.  Iran doesn't give a shit about Egypt's opinions.   My 'rents got solar panels installed towards the end of last year and the cost/benefit is definitely worth the investment. Are you saying I hired a female commando to roam the middle east smothering insurgents in pork for nothing? If you go to /r/combatfootage you will find plenty of videos of Russians intercepting NATO bombers too. And if you read the comments made by actual/former pilots/staff you will soon realize that this is a common occurrence yet nobody ever reports on their own bombers being intercepted. 

For example: http://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/2tirji/russian_su27_flanker_intercepts_p3_orion_over/ Seems like they're only binding the students with less money or political clout to party blinkers. You get that from a Kurdish facebook page with an average age of 13? &gt;cult followers



As much a cult as Christianity is... but that's not what I'm talking about. The Ukranians have been saying for over a year about what appears to be the entire Russian army operating there. Surely with all the victories they've had, they should be able to find a single active duty body? 
 Boris is more or less an intelligent clown. A very intelligent clown. Short man syndrome, have you seen this dudes shoes? Fuckn heels. &gt; The thought that the absolute erasure of religion will solve all our world problems is so hare-brained

He doesn't say that though...he says it's dragging us down. I assume you mean both sides are democratic?  Because democratic countries go to war all the time. Makes me that much more sure that I don't want to be the guy who goes out and finds whatever could be down there. I agree that the US is fucked up.  We have a horrible government, a serious money problem, religious morons are trying to turn the US into a nazi christian state, and it STILL is not nearly as fucked up as russia.  When you as a country are worse then the US.... This all comes down to the standard terms of international law. It's law so long as both parties can enforce it and if you want it to go away you need to be more powerful than the other guy. The parties in this case have a disproportionate balance of power and the cubans forcing the US out of Guantanamo is quite unlikely. Therefore the US is upholding international law.

Also they really did ruin the sugar plantations we had going there...and that Cuba was like the Vegas of the East Coast. The good Vegas where it was owned by the mob and hookers and blackjack. When fighting a group that refuses to be bound by rules of war you are handicapping yourself by following by rules. What I meant is that they execute their people. We execute other countries' people. Well it's purely economic misery; it considers only interest rates, inflation, and unemployment.  So if that's all you care about, then yeah I guess being in China is OK. Marine Biologist and shark enthusiast here. They're known to eat plankton and *some* species of jellies. And as far as I know, seeing them more often because of jellyfish populations is just speculation at this point. Hooray! Oh... :( I came here to say I concur with you. They're going bowling with their cousins. Were there any air conditioning units nearby? /s
Yeah yeah, the glorious and noble Ukrainian army was nowhere bear and couldn't have done it. It was probably the separaritists blowing themselves up as they have been this entire conflict. 

Loving the apologist pseudo impartial comments here. "Before we blame anyone, let's investigate. Oh let's see the range of a randomly picked artillery is insufficient to shell this area. And poroshenko himself told us that the artillery is at least 1000000km away from the front line" there, investigation complete, conscience cleared, the blood is of course on Putin's hands and we are backing the good guys. Phew, that was a close call. Let's upvote something nasty about Russia now. &gt; You can't blame the Cubans for the attitude they have towards the United States. A lengthy history of meddling with Cuban affairs,

This goes both ways.

&gt;conomic warfare all because the Cuban government didn't transfer it's soverognty over to the US.

Oh ok you're not worth the time. A picture of the shark

 He's a smart guy and he's not wrong.

These people are often total hypocrites. There are numerous photos of Islamist terrorist supporter Anjem Choudary drinking and doing naughty things.

 Economic pressure is all you have.

Meanwhile, Russia will control regions that it cares about. Don't forget the Branch Davidians.

Anyone can claim their religion to be a descendant of Abraham.  Calling Islam and "Abrahamic religion" is like calling black people "Canaanites" ITT "Oh so brave";"tipping fedoras";"m'lady"; "atheism is a cesspool!" and a whole of predigested  repetitive bullshit tripe dismissing what should be painfully obvious by now. 

Sure, it may not be an immediate threat and it may seem to infringe on belief systems human rights, which many hold so dear here but few understand them or respect the purpose of said liberties. 

So, the chasm deepens between those willing to reach for the stars and those willing to held back in class and surrender responsibility to a cruel petty deity. Give it enough time and it will consume the world. I guarantee it.jpg Again I agree with you that The uk isn't a Christian nation, but certainly I would say that Christianity did help to influence the development of the state. 

&gt;England existed before Christianity.

This is a claim that I'm not sure that I agree with. Anglo-Saxon history is certainly an interest of mine and It would be hard to understate the influence that Christianity brought to the unification of the English tribes and petty kingdoms into a single nation. 

The people we today call the English were a mix of north sea tribes, as well as, various Celtic tribes that they conquered. The coming of Christianity brought written language and important trade with the rest of Europe. But most importantly it served as a railing tool against the 'Great Heathen Army' of Vikings that invaded, allowing Alfred to united the English into one force and drive back the Vikings. Alfred and following kings then used Baptism as a political tool, choosing to baptise defeated opponents instead of executing them and therefore building a more peaceful land. 

&gt;things that make the West distinct from the rest of the world are actually antithetical to Christianity. 

This is something that I agree with. The notion of Democracy and free speech is something that is far more cultural and goes back a lot further than Jesus Christ. The oldest parliaments in the world are located in the west, the 'Thing' of the Norse or the Tynwald of the Isle of man. Tacitus claims that the Germanic tribes elected leaders and the early English had the Witan and other moots. Not to mention the Ancient Greeks who came before. 

Generally I'd say that the Church has been more of a hindrance to the development of the UK and should be marginalised to the back of politics, however, lets not forget the historical importance the Church once held. 

 Giving cops the roadside power to determine you are guilty of a crime with a six months sentence based on their word alone?

**WHAT COULD** ***POSSIBLY*** **GO WRONG!?**  The jail time is really meant as a deterrent. Even with other laws involving fines or jail time, our AGC almost always issues a fine for the first offense. As a porn watching wanker I resemble that remark. Yes, but those are literally the Baltics, whom border Russia.

So we have NATO airplanes patrolling NATO airspace.

The United Kingdom &amp; Portugal do not border Russia, nor are they in Russian airspace.  Purposeful ignorance of reality is boring  Except the sharks themselves, and they ain't talking. I think his point was that once religion is gone, we can focus on fixing the problems. The ocean scares the shit out of me.  Come, mister Taliban, hand over Bin Laden... Are you still under 18? I may need to place a call to social services if you are.  I kek'd

She is like the personified Russian /pol/ I don't think so, no. Sad. Yes, but those are literally the Baltics, whom border Russia.

So we have NATO airplanes patrolling NATO airspace.

The United Kingdom &amp; Portugal do not border Russia, nor are they in Russian airspace.  Why do you keep bringing up Christianity? We are not talking about it. If you don't have any argument, stop replying, this pathetic deflection is not working.

BTW I agree, Christianity is no better, except one thing. You won't get murdered for leaving Christianity. 

 In short he wants his son to take over when eventually somebody puts a bullet in his skull. Hopefully it doesn't end well. Putin - obama's dirty puppet Between you and me, I think he's joking. I'll take "Things I never said" for $400, Alex.  Even better: I pretended that I thought it was real, and used the "found footage" in the show as proof of their existence to my friend. He bought it hook, line and sinker.

Him: "THAT IS CLEARLY CGI!!"
Me: No way bro, why are they so scared if it's "just" CGI?!
 Old news, happened 250,000 years ago just empty calories and male curiosity..ehhh Georgie I like this comment by him. Usually, always, he is portrayed as a bumbling buffoon. 

They are just young men in desperate need of self-esteem who do not have a particular mission in life, who feel that they are losers and this thing makes them feel strong  like winners. 

He makes sense, in most of the things he says, but the media just go by the sensationalistic headlines. Kind of ironic that the only private citizens who can afford this are home owners - house owners, even, not flats - when at the same time homeownership is its lowest in many decades, and fewer and fewer people can afford to buy a home, let alone invest in solar panels. It's a shame, as these are the people who could most do with the long-term cost savings they can bring. Even with the various grant schemes available, you have to have already had enough money to buy the home in the first place.

That's not to detract from the extremely good news in this story. Are all military bases created equal now? I didn't know this was he case... better move the entire armored division to Guantanamo.. Except his actions have had significant reactions. Catholic priests are reporting increased attendance, bishops have been removed, churches have been reducing staff pay/benefits while increasing their social spending, and donors have increased their giving. 

The U.S. hasn't seen the church attendance boost that Europe has, but it has seen the increased donations with over 3/4 polled saying their increased donations are because of Pope Francis.  That's preety cool you almost never see those sharks I wonder what happen Do you disagree with him then? 

And if you had read the article, you'd know that he said this after meeting the Kurdistan Regional Government representative Dlawar Azhgayi, he didn't just randomly decide to chip in. When Islamic fundamentalism plunges half of the world into darkness, this administration is going to be ridiculed and despised for ages. Went to see Kermit Apio and Brian Regan at one of their stand up shows.

I was laughing so much my face hurt. I went with the evil one. Frampt can suck a fat cock. Christ what an awful graph. I like how it's Cuba fault.  A college degree is not worth as much as it was before and men have the option of more physical labor with less preparation &gt; concentration camps

I would entertain conversation with you until I saw this.  When you say things like that, you absolutely undermine any credability you might have had.

Internment camp?  Sure.  But concentration camp is a loaded word and you know it. It's funny that you say that. Because if I recall correctly, the pictured shark was from ~5 years ago and scientists were frantically getting ready to head over to the shore where this shark had washed up. They wanted to do studies on such a rare specimen and begged the locals not to do anything dumb with it. When the scientists got there, they learned that the shark had been eaten. 

TL;DR: one man's rare shark is another's family dinner.  Oh my goodness, dats terriruble. U hav muh support where du i dounate? Because it was totally possible for the British to put all the Sunnis on one side, all the Jews on another, all the shiite Muslims somewhere else, and the oil happily in the middle for all to share....

Hollandaise.  Hollandaise suass. No, I'm past that. I guess they got away with it. They should just stick to religion. &gt;  and/or stop living in an alternate reality and remain true to their values while also living a grounded, worldly existence with their neighbors of different religions.

But I think that's the extremely slippery slope of religious belief - it's not founded on reality, it's founded on personal instinct, experience, or a religious text, or a set of shared cultural beliefs.  You can't tell one religion to stop believing in hell if you're also cool with them believing in angels just because one aspect's negative and one positive - they're two sides to the same coin.  The problem, IMHO, is a lack of respect for empiricism, critical thinking, and scientific knowledge. Ok. I tried to read the "article" and this is all I saw:

**"Britain summoned the Russian ambassador on Thursday and asked him to explain why two Russian Bear long-range bombers had flown over the English channel the previous day, a move that forced British authorities to divert civil aircraft.

 
"We summoned the Russian ambassador to account for the incident which disrupted civil aviation," a Foreign Office spokeswoman told Reuters.

 
British Typhoon fighter jets were scrambled to intercept the two Russian planes, which were flying close to UK airspace, on Wednesday."**

Didi I miss something? Because I expected more than four sentences. Not roughly. It's EXACTLY the same size! Mortar range? The ukraine army is outside of Mortar range.  You should probably see a doctor about that. The vast majority of experts disagree with you.  &gt; Plus, Aerosmith played the opening theme to Dazed and Confused (Sweet Emotion).

I'm sure they list this as one of their career achievements.  That's how I see it, yeah. You see it differently, and I'm happy for you. If it weren't for the people I love, I couldn't give a shit if I lived or died. What is death if life is pointless? You mean your abdominal muscles :| Probably because the Ukraine army is out mortar range.  Right... I love to nuke my imagination with a q-tip and a lot of hard thrusts in the earhole. http://www.snopes.com/rumors/pershing.asp

learn to do a quick google please. Maybe we can use the blood as lube... Lol. I wonder what are you using mate? I'm pretty sure it's illegal even in Netherlands.  At the risk of being an idiot I have to admit I don't get this either! Oh so your reference to the Cuban missile crisis is moot then?  I don't know, the Pope's ramblings end up on here every other week. I don't get it, why does everyone Afghanistan so bad? Well sometimes it isn't immediately clear who is responsible and an investigation is needed. In other cases like the Mariumpol shelling and the MH17 it is obvious who is responsible and blame is apportioned in the interest of swift justice delivery. /s Ik zie taystey hollandaise suass.

Thats good data. Thank you!

I am surprised becuase most americans cant read and think evolution is a myth but at least you actually contributed to the conversation with something real other than anger.

Thats pretty much why they are getting shit on. And Granada. I thought this place was named "The Doomsday Seedbank." Ukraine was destroyed when When TechCamp operates of the United States intelligence agency infliltrated their  Maidan and pro democracy groups trying to reign in the corruption of the Yanukovich goverment. if we have learned anything in the last 5 years , it that the people's hopes and uprising will be subjugated and perverted by shopadowy agencies whether Russian or Western agencies. I would be weary of any protest groups. Yeaaaaaa thats a dinosaur Russia and Nazi Germany had those policies during various occupations. It usually didn't work that well. Will it be built out of bones? Good thing the Ukrainian government never asked for the Russians to leave or anything. If tis morning is any indication, I guess the terrorists really are winning. :( why oh why have we let this happen Mother Earth? I don't want them to split the nation in half. My solution Is that we give all of current Israel back to the Palestinians as it belongs to them and we make Israel the 51st state and place it somewhere in mainland USA. With how much dough they get  from us they're practically already part of the USA. It's rather ugly.  To be fair NATO has expanded right up to Russian borders when they said they wouldnt.  le donkey fly They do it all the time. Nations do it to each other all the time. It just depends on what side of the media you are on. Who gives a shit? It's not like being killed as a baby would traumatise me later in life. &gt;They do have substantial cash reserves.

Which they may need themselves, with the price of oil and gas having fallen so far, and economic sanctions hitting the Russian economy.  Fine! Let us take as a premise that human intelligence on machines is possible.  The next step would be to go a bit beyond with such intelligence. I cannot see how the humans who are just a little bit above the average intelligence are a threat to a humankind just because they are intelligent.  Therefore, it all comes down to what those individuals do. On the same account, it all comes down to what those machines will to to make such a threat. I know about even a bigger, and understandable threat and that is the HUMAN STUPIDITY.

Because your premise is not supported by anything but an assumption and a belief. Isn't it, you know, theirs? It's pretty much US's Crimea. Jordan is bad ass. Anything else is just begging the bully "please dont hit my anymore". That doesn't work. You dont want the bully to hit you anymore? Punch him in the face. He will likely leave you alone after that.  International airspace that is controlled by Britain and France, for commercial aircraft. What's wrong Hobbits? well if you actual read the context of what i said ( although now the guy has deleted his comment) is was most about his situation.

im english love me nhs and i think your system is insane and make fun of it all the time, im not sure why you are getting so angry here.

but is it better than it use to be with obama care? Please show me Ukrainian army's location and their longest range mortar data at the time of the incident. Or just carry on spamming this assertion in all related discussions and it will stick eventually right? A couple of people on here have commented that they know the guy through someone else and they've all said his parents being dead isn't right.

Make of that what you will obviously. Because they want to try every dish at The Crazy Asshole Buffet.

Are you angry about not being able to bang the white women in the country in which you live? Self imposed feelings of inferiority? Well come on down to The Crazy Asshole Buffet and get your fill! Haha, hasn't the British radar been top notch since WWII? 
The new subs in the British fleet use top of the range radar equipment in that too. I am, really interested in fact. Do we regularly fly nuclear bombers towards Russian airspace? No, no we don't. 

Sure, there's Nato air patrols over Nato states in Eastern Europe, but these are all interceptors and fighter planes, not nuclear capable bombers designed to level cities. Plus, they remain within the respective Nato allies airspace.

 Blobfish shark Fuck... This hurts. I don't know what it is, but the destruction of history is worse than just about anything. This is our past, the evidence of what came before us. Maybe its a cultural thing, but hearing about this shit fucking kills me. More than the population of the USA.  More sex tapes. Or he did not feel confident enough to move against him yet Son, starving people aren't eating sharks That was a good read. It piqued my interest in megamouth sharks. Kudos, homo erectus! No, they do not. Gengis Khan did pretty well, IIRC. Of course, he didn't have to worry about human rights.  Ukraine propaganda is my least favorite one.  They were going to move the patients from the moment the leak was detected due to the risk, but there just wasn't enough time before the explosion (probably also the reason there's good footage of the explosion, people were filming the emergency services).

There are also some reports that the gas truck might have been obstructing an emergency exit which made evacuation more difficult.

After, most of the building collapsed and the parts left standing are too unstable to even consider keeping them operational, they are already demolishing parts of the building since it's less dangerous than just let them eventually collapse (which seems like a very likely outcome due to the extent of the damage). 
 **Wanker** is by far the greatest English word. &gt; can track a 1000 targets each traveling over three times the speed of sound and no bigger than a cricket ball. It also has onboard Aster missiles that can take out ICBMs. 

Well, at least we're covered for mass alien invasions. Jesus, does it ever close it's mouth? Sharks are so dumb. Israel is wisely helping by bombing Hezbollah. If they attacked ISIS the Islamic world would start questioning whether ISIS is really a bad thing. Now they bomb Hezbollah, an enemy of ISIS, so that the rest of the Arab world hates ISIS even more The danger from AI is not that we will one day have **autonomous** robots destroying humanity. Instead it is simply the same danger that all technological progress presents. It can be used for good or for evil. The difference between AI and say nuclear weapons, is that AI can be applied much more  subtlety by a select few to dominate humanity. They can carry cruise missiles. The bomber itself is very vulnerable, but it's not meant to be flying directly over the target. considering the size and depth of the ocean and how unadapted humans are for it, i would be shocked if there ISN'T large animals in the ocean we haven't discovered. So you're making a claim of this based on what exactly? Dude what is wrong with you. You think it's better to 'save nature' than allow your poor ass family eat to survive? These are literally fishermen subsisting on the minimal catch they receive everyday by bringing a few dangling pieces of fish to market. 

Think before you open your mouth next time.  Right so if the oppressed victims just changed their minds everything would have been super.  No one is following the Geneva Convention anymore. USA isn't. Russia isn't. China isn't. It was a great idea, i'm sorry it didn't work out. But at this point talking about the Geneva Convention is like kicking a dead horse.  But we are NOT growing sustainably. Until we figure that part out we are doing a bad thing. This guy gets it.  Would probably be better to leave them alive, killing them just makes them martyrs in their eyes. Keeping them alive denies them that. &gt; Salman bin Abdulaziz

This guy is the new king?  Shit. If the IS has reduced us to savages, they've already won. Clickbait sensationalized title? Check Baseless speculation. To be accurate, that never happened. Sure, but they might be selling it. That on a level is a betrayal of trust. Also an abuse of your position as his friend.

But he still dumb for believing it for one second. Great, you have complete superiority in a weapon that you can't use without being completely exterminated yourself.  A lesson that the US learned the hard way from Vietnam, to Iraq is that nukes are useless at projecting power.  They keep you from being invaded but that is it.  And nobody was planning on invading Russian in the first place. I think king of saudi arabia do right things ectually indian media and government expose president obama morethan what ectual he is I've never quite understood what makes it "sterile". When I visited Singapore it always game me the feeling that its government was very OCD about everything. Like trying to play the perfect game of Simcity.  Rules were made to be broken, amirite? One time, in Iraq, I was pulling gate guard duty to the entrance to our FOB. In the pre duty briefing we would get a bolo report on suspected vehicles and other dangerous shit to look out for. We had heard reports of insurgents placing motor rounds on donkeys and sending them into check points. Well, early one morning, as the day was getting started, a donkey had made its way into our checkpoint from an opening from some railroad tracks that ran through it. It was a weak spot in our security. There were donkeys all over the place so this wasn't too unusual. However, this donkey had a pack on its back. As it approached someone called it out on the radio and we all proceeded to flip shit. If you've ever seen a bomb go off you'll know it's not some shit you want to be around. One of the tower guards shot the donkey killing it on the spot. We shut down the gate,  cordoned off the area, and called EOD (explosive ordnance disposal). This is the first time I got to see the robot. It was pretty cool. Anyway, the robot removed this pack from the dead donkey and searched it thoroughly. Fortunately there was nothing in the bag. We had the donkey removed and went about our day. 

This honestly isn't anything too new. It's just never made big news because it's not a very successful strategy. But they'll keep trying to kill people any way they can.  it's important for ukrainians to make it look as much as possible as a war against Russia, because ukrainian men don't want to go and fight against other ukrainians. Noone has any proof of russian soldiersMobile crematoriums are a convenient device to come up with in order to explain where russian bodies go. 

There were as far as I heard only 2-3 cases of russian families receiving bodies of their serving men with place and circumstances of death unclear (ukraine, clearly, but officials are mumbling bullshit).

For the rebels it's importnat to maintain that there are legioners fighting for Ukraine. Partly for the same reason probably, partly to cover up the mismatch between their claims of casualties they caused, and the truth.

As for surrendering, if ukrainian men being mobilised realize how many deflect with no concequences, it'll be easier for them to act that intention.

This is a horrible bitch war. Fucked up as the planet is, that shit in the middle of Europe does not belong to it. Or, they could put the Reddit alien in the upper left hand corner if you are being watched.... As opposed to the Russian fighters, which are also nuclear capable. Only difference is the range and the payload. But in either case, ICBMs are more effective than either. So, this is just sabre rattling. "Don't mess with me... or I'll slit my own throat and bleed all over your nice suit." Thats actually a Basking Shark. &gt; Religion and science can Co exist.

Which religion are you talking about?  

Some Christians believe the earth is 6,000 years old, science says 4.54 billion years.

The Quran believes the sun orbits the earth.

And on and on... But, what if Man-Bear Pig gets out? Or a spike in its population.   Hard to say when we don't know much about it.  People pay in the west to be flogged harder then that. takes two to tango. Beggars can't be choosers. I may just be an optimist in this situation, but I believe the two states should not try to expand, especially further into illegal territory, until some kind of resolution is agreed upon. Now, I understand how difficult it is to determine which set of laws are to be followed, so in that regard, I do understand your argument. http://i.imgur.com/h1NwDiv.png &gt; Especially when you consider not only did he not hurt anyone, but he didn't even have the capabilities to hurt anyone

 I have a better idea: we send Putin and his cabinet and government offices glitter bombs. Thousands of glitter bombs.

I know I know, it's against UN chemical warfare treaties but fuck it &gt; And then schools here in America act like Russia was the one being a dick by putting missiles in Cuba.

They were. That's how things work. You don't give your enemy an advantage. Should the Allies have notified the Germans about d-day or were they dicks too? "Confound it! Gerald T. White you bring back my dentures this instant or I will be so cross!" He's small fish compared to the UK government's boy-fucking and murdering tendencies. Maybe they sent the planes to check if the UK has some top-secret boy-fucking technology that they can adopt. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2S12_Sani

At the bottom of the ocean is a cave where leftover imaginations take physical form. You are that stupid. 

To ignore the message and instead focus on picking apart idioms.  It's like fucking Hoover vacuum  It looks like a deflated penis "Going to Donbass" was a complete conjecture on her part. All she knew was that a military base was vacated. Unfortunately for her, the leaving soldiers were a radio surveillance brigade working for intelligence, so informing foreign officials about their movement can be very easily seen as treason. longest range mortar Ukraine has: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2S12_Sani ...and religious belief needlessly exacerbates those tensions. Wouldn't that tell google, the NSA and all other agencies that I would be interested in privacy and wouldn't they put my data onto the "potential terrorist" list?

\*only halfway non-serious\* :(  It's amongst organized crime in the Dutch 'Moroccan' underworld (Dutch criminals of Moroccan descent). What basically happened is that a shitton of coke disappeared in the port of Antwerp (Belgium), and now the animals are all killing each other off because they accuse each other of stealing it.

The general public doesn't cares that much for it because they only kill each other and innocent civilians don't have a lot to fear (although some guy did accidentally got shot because they had him confused with someone else). Why is it so easy for children to break into the Pentagon?  ISIS deploys first ICBM (Intercontinental Ballistic Mule).

 Well it depends, from what I understand, a person is a subcontractor if 

1) The "master" did not provide the "agent" with the tools (I.E, the car).

2) The "master" does not supervise the resulting work. 

If both case applies, then he is a subcontractor, not a employee.

http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2u6nx9/a_rare_megamouth_shark_just_washed_up_in_the/co5oa8t Yeah but they don't live in the past like turks do, I guarantee turks would be continuing the ottoman genocide if they could right now, that's the difference, kurds and assyrians lived side by side together in iraq for years and continue to do so, assyrians hold position in their governmental system equal to the population, so it is a relatively fair representation. whether they do this to gain legitimacy/support to their agenda for a kurdish state, is for people to decide. to be honest, i have not met kurds when i was in iraq that were hostile to any sort of people, every group has their bad apples though and i will not deny that. i don't hold people accountable for their past if they have asked for forgiveness and changed their ways.  There is already the Kurdish autonomous zone inside Iraq, assuming they liberate the Kurdish regions of north east Syria what right does Assad's govt. have to ask for its return? You can kill civilians and not be a terrorist organization. For example, hitler killed a lot of civilians but he is not a terrorist. To be a terrorist, you need to kill civilians in order to spread terror and advance your political goals. The world "will not accept" Erdogen ruling in Turkey. Why does that matter?

You think the retards who gush over their troops are any different to supporters of ISIS? Downtown Mexico is built on clay base, but a large part of the city is built on more solid ground.

There are parts of the city where gas lines are already installed and working, but due to a very efective fearmongering campaing ('Just imagine what will happen in the event of a quake!' 'This is Mexico, you know they're going to do a shit job') as well as rumours of much much higher prices than gas truck delivery,it's only available only on few parts of the city and extreme opposition makes it unlikely it will ever become widespread.

 As much as i believe the right of one people to choose as its own sovereign, without some patronship of a big guy this won't happen. 
Also keep in mind that the middle-eastern borders were drawn up by the british and french, creating "nation-states" where there was none, and up until today through military and other "help" kept them running. You'd need, at least, those powerful to be willing that the given configuration would change, meaning they'd lose their influence on an other wise conflict-ridden region -let the kurds, sunni and shiite etc. fight over water and oil- easy to control.

Why are we are letting celebrities like Michael Jordan have prisoners, and why is it ok for him to be killing them? Talk about due process being meaningless nowadays.

Wait... I did use the term, "move." Neither did the root post.  If it cheers you up, lots of people have now said that his parents didn't die, and the police have interviewed his dad so he's definitely not dead. &gt; Are you saying there is nothing at all to fear at all from hundreds of Canadian Muslim youths who have traveled across the globe to voluntarily join a group that cuts the heads of tens of thousands of prisoners and mass rapes little girls? 

Quit with the sophistry and talk like a person not a manipulator.

We have police, csis , the army and a broad array of laws already on the books. These are plenty strong enough to stop any openly planned shit from happening.  We do not need our rights curtailed further.  
The government is already protecting us. They do not need further powers. That doesn't even remotely work. He runs that on recycled Worcestershire Sauce and the tears of orphans.   Oh thanks for the correction  To be fair, 44 soldiers just got killed in a mission secretly sanctioned by the president. The secretary of the interior had no idea until shit went down. And then when the bodies were brought back to Manila, he attended a car plant ribbon cutting instead. We're all rather antsy at the moment. Calling shenanigans. Unless time is involved, then maybe.  Why? You let them have their own country you won't have Kurdish terrorists attacking your country anymore. You defend yourself when you are being attacked or you lose.

No third option is given. It did. Why do you think it didn't? Er... ? Lets remember these are kids giving their opinions, recanted second hand into another language by their teacher.

Stupid kids are universal, not just a muslim thing. Your initial response was quite the opposite. Resorting to boasting about their nuclear power shows how weak their hand really is. NATO could easily take out russia (during the summer) without resorting to nuclear weapons.  Do the Russian people really believe this BS?  No There is no turks in Iraq, they are Turkmens and shia muslim i believe Did you see the "evil" ending? It's pretty messed up. I almost regretted it. *Almost* He wasn't, as that would be illegal under Dutch law. Tazing an unarmed suspect who has already surrendered, and is on his knees and fully complying with police orders is the fastest way for a police officer to not only get fired but face criminal charges. i would move back to iraq in a heart beat if we got our own state, including thousands of others, iraq should have been 4 countries a while ago  "n Donetsk DK Kuibyshev was hit by mortar fire on the street Panfilov, 86. 5 people standing in line for humanitarian aid have died. In addition, shelling destroyed the trolley and shuttle bus. 12 people since the beginning of the day. Yesterday, it was reported only in Donetsk 11 civilians have died from military actions. The shelling was carried from the village of Optinoye."

The rebel commander did it for me.  Say what?! However nukes do not have to be state of art modern, they can still destroy pretty much every city in the world.  I am a first hand no fan of them, but misleading information is no help either.  The US has several reasons to support an independent and strong Ukraine. Eastern Europe has basically been Russia's bitch since the partitioning of Poland and the fall of the Ottoman Empire. By ensuring strong democratic Eastern European nations exist the US can limit Russia's ambitions at Re-Annexing it's former satellite states. 

This in turn limits the suffering of the native peoples, it ensures a greater economic prosperity for both that nation and the Eurozone as a whole, and it directly supports the international treaties we have made with these states to defend them from foreign aggression. 

Russia's decision to invade and annex Crimea and to continually have a presence in Ukraine is one of the dumbest decisions it could have made and one of the best for long term European success. Unfortunately so will all the innocent people that continue to die at the hands of both Israel and Hamas But why _there_? ... because it didn't. You're wrong, stop being wrong. And I don't see any value in conversations with the narcissist scum that insists on nice euphemisms like "internment" and "enhanced interrogation" for abducting people and systematically torturing them to death. The likes of you are the reason why the Islamic Resistance movements grow stronger every day. Thanks to the USA. So why should Syria and Iraq pay for the mistakes  of the USA? Reminds me of the scene in The Dark Knight where Batman's beating the shit out of the Joker and the Joker's just laughing and laughing... Seconded 1) That's an automatic grenade launcher

2) It's range is just over a mile. 

I think you just proved the rebels did this.  wouldn't know? This strongly reminds me of some movie... 
four lions anyone ? 

 i am. When you've thought about what you've done and learned your lesson you can come back Australia. You are still on the naughty step/continent until then. I'm depressed as shit. I don't have a career, I have a job. People with jobs can't afford to get careers. I'm a cog in a machine that produces wealth for other people while I remain in indentured servitude. If it weren't for the people I love I would have plastered my worthless grey matter onto a wall by now. thats the thing, the only people who would like to see the two state solution is the US. And the continual pursuit of the two state solution actually increases the tension between the two peoples because you are forcing a result that neither party will settle with.  They are in no way a threat to the west, or their interests, what interests what the west have in afghanistan there is nothing there. Haha, that was stupid. Fixed. Idunno, Maybe it's those.... "ribs" looking things in their mouths ?
I just imagine that swimming towards me and I freaking the Fuck out  Oh no not him again Maybe if you combed the Hot Pockets crumbs out of your neck beard, you wouldn't be so bitter. Which was fucking ridiculous because the guy totally had it coming, and the courts agreed. To answer your first question: apparently no one. But I guess I don't see the US as being very pragmatic with its foreign policy, especially toward Cuba. I say this because it is overwhelmingly likely that more cordial relations between the two countries would benefit each country's populace. Instead the US has relied on military force in order to occupy many other countries and this has come at an incredible cost in treasure and lives. But I guess we have to consider who benefits...and that is namely a small wedge of the business class. So long as we confine our analysis to what is good for this small group of corporations then I would agree with you...but I don't share this myopic view of yours. My concerns don't lie with this tiny elite group; my concerns lie with the overall wealth and health of nations  as a whole. As for my rejection of hegemony I can only argue that it is not only morally wrong to impose your will on others via force but also that this is destructive to democracy and human rights. From a pragmatic paradigm I'd argue that we cannot achieve our goals by increasingly relying on military power to oppress our neighbors...all previous empires culminated with this and all of them have fallen. Your argument only holds if we merely talking about the short term interests of a sliver of extremely wealthy and powerful folks among the US population...it doesn't apply to the vast majority of either country's citizenry.  Do you know why the rebels keep claiming these are mortar strikes? Instead of using something that has a much longer range and therefore makes more sense? 

The blasts are really small when it comes to mortars.  I kno The reason we have sanctions on Russia at the moment is because they invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, and then engaged in a protracted and bloody war of aggression using proxies and deflagged Russian troops. 

The BRICS are a loosely affiliated collection of states with few shared interests, and multiple internal rivalries.  They aren't plotting to dethrone the dollar as the world's reserve currency and they couldn't do it if they even wanted to. Besides a history of brutally suppressing opposition which started the current mess in the Middle East? Get real.  Haha I'm currently on my first playthrough of Dark Souls and was thinking the exact same thing.  What a shit legal system  or an English teacher Just in case their payload is big, still it can be launched. In all probability it wont be, just saying [**Did NATO Promise Not to Enlarge? Gorbachev Says** "***No***'](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/11/06-nato-no-promise-enlarge-gorbachev-pifer)

&gt;We now have a very authoritative voice from Moscow confirming this understanding. Russia behind the Headlines has published an interview with Gorbachev, who was Soviet president during the discussions and treaty negotiations concerning German reunification. The interviewer asked why Gorbachev did not *insist that the promises made to you [Gorbachev]particularly U.S. Secretary of State James Bakers promise that NATO would not expand into the Eastbe legally encoded?* Gorbachev replied: *The topic of NATO expansion was not discussed at all, and it wasnt brought up in those years.  Another issue we brought up was discussed: making sure that NATOs military structures would not advance and that additional armed forces would not be deployed on the territory of the then-GDR after German reunification. Bakers statement was made in that context Everything that could have been and needed to be done to solidify that political obligation was done. And fulfilled.*

&gt;Gorbachev continued that *The agreement on a final settlement with Germany said that no new military structures would be created in the eastern part of the country; no additional troops would be deployed; no weapons of mass destruction would be placed there. It has been obeyed all these years.* To be sure, the former Soviet president criticized NATO enlargement and called it a violation of the spirit of the assurances given Moscow in 1990, but he made clear there was no promise regarding broader enlargement.

I don't really know why you're shifting the blame from religion, when religion is just a set of ideas created and maintained and modified by humans. Pope's Barbershop has a nice ring to it.

You have defended the US Health Care system repeatedly.  That's something I have a huge issue with, because you're stating things that go 100% against everything the WHO and facts state.

I'm angry because it's ignorance like yours that perpetuates the problem.  You don't see there is a problem and you defend the current state of affairs, which only makes things worse. Cuba knows it wont get Guantanamo back. Cuba would benefit far more than the US would from normalized relations. Cuba putting up obstructions to this process is a waste of time and the only reason to do it is to try to appear not to be going 100% with the US. 

Calls to return Guantanamo are simple obstructionism, nothing more. Did they have a judge permission to bug ukrainian embassy? Thanks for the invite, hope your reading skills are up for a lengthy quote... since the whole Cuba thing isn't easily explained in a couple of Twitter style sentences. We'll start just before the Spanish-American war :

&gt;But Spanish Cuba remained the thorn in the side of the United States. The Florida and Yucatan straits were narrow. Although the Spaniards, even in their weakened state, might have been able to block U.S. trade routes, it was the British who worried the Americans most. Based in the Bahamas, near Cuba, the British, of many conflicting minds on the United States, could seize Cuba and impose an almost impregnable blockade, crippling the U.S. economy. The British depended on American grain, and it couldn't be ruled out that they would seek to gain control over exports from the Midwest in order to guarantee their own economic security. The fear of British power helped define the Civil War and the decades afterward.

&gt;Cuba was the key. In the hands of a hostile foreign power, it was as effective a plug to the Mississippi as taking New Orleans. The weakness of the Spaniards frightened the Americans. Any powerful European power  the British or, after 1871, the Germans  could easily knock the Spaniards out of Cuba. And the United States, lacking a powerful navy, would not be able to cope. Seizing Cuba became an imperative of U.S. strategy. Theodore Roosevelt, who as president would oversee America's emergence as a major naval power  and who helped ensure the construction of the Panama Canal, which was critical to a two-ocean navy  became the symbol of the U.S. seizure of Cuba in the Spanish-American War of 1898-1900.

&gt;With that seizure, New Orleans-Atlantic transit was secured. The United States maintained effective control over Cuba until the rise of Fidel Castro. But the United States remained anxious about Cuba's security. By itself, the island could not threaten the supply lines. In the hands of a significant hostile power, however, Cuba could become a base for strangling the United States. Before World War II, when there were some rumblings of German influence in Cuba, the United States did what it could to assure the rise of former Cuban leader Fulgencio Batista, considered an American ally or puppet, depending on how you looked at it. But this is the key: Whenever a major foreign power showed interest in Cuba, the United States had to react, which it did effectively until Castro seized power in 1959.

&gt;The Soviet Influence

&gt;If the Soviets were looking for a single point from which they could threaten American interests, they would find no place more attractive than Cuba. Therefore, whether Fidel Castro was a communist prior to seizing power, it would seem that he would wind up a communist ally of the Soviets in the end. I suspect he had become a communist years before he took power but wisely hid this, knowing that an openly communist ruler in Cuba would revive America's old fears. Alternatively, he might not have been a communist but turned to the Soviets out of fear of U.S. intervention. The United States, unable to read the revolution, automatically moved toward increasing its control. Castro, as a communist or agrarian reformer or whatever he was, needed an ally against U.S. involvement. Whether the arrangement was planned for years, as I suspect, or in a sudden rush, the Soviets saw it as a marriage made in heaven.

&gt;Had the Soviets never placed nuclear weapons in Cuba, the United States still would have opposed a Soviet ally in control of Cuba during the Cold War. This was hardwired into American geopolitics. But the Soviets did place missiles there, which is a story that must be touched on as well.

&gt;The Soviet air force lacked long-range strategic bombardment aircraft. In World War II, they had focused on shorter range, close air support aircraft to assist ground operations. The United States, engaging both Germany and Japan from the air at long range, had extensive experience with long-range bombing. Therefore, during the 1950s, the United States based aircraft in Europe, and then, with the B-52 in the continental United States, was able to attack the Soviet Union with nuclear weapons. The Soviets, lacking a long-range bomber fleet, could not retaliate against the United States. The balance of power completely favored the United States.

&gt;The Soviets planned to leapfrog the difficult construction of a manned bomber fleet by moving to intercontinental ballistic missiles. By the early 1960s, the design of these missiles had advanced, but their deployment had not. The Soviets had no effective deterrent against a U.S. nuclear attack except for their still-underdeveloped submarine fleet. The atmosphere between the United States and the Soviet Union was venomous, and Moscow could not assume that Washington would not use its dwindling window of opportunity to strike safely against the Soviets.

&gt;The Soviets did have effective intermediate range ballistic missiles. Though they could not reach the United States from the Soviet Union, they could cover almost all of the United States from Cuba. The Russians needed to buy just a little time to deploy a massive intercontinental ballistic missile and submarine force. Cuba was the perfect spot from which to deploy it. Had they succeeded, the Soviets would have closed the U.S. window of opportunity by placing a deterrent force in Cuba. They were caught before they were ready. The United States threatened invasion, and the Soviets had to assume that the Americans also were threatening an overwhelming nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. They had to back down. As it happened, the United States intended no such attack, but the Soviets could not know that.

&gt;Cuba was seared into the U.S. strategic mentality in two layers. It was never a threat by itself. Under the control of a foreign naval power, it could strangle the United States. After the Soviet Union tried to deploy intermediate range ballistic missiles there, a new layer was created in which Cuba was a potential threat to the American mainland, as well as to trade routes. The agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union included American guarantees not to invade Cuba and Soviet guarantees not to base nuclear weapons there. But Cuba remained a problem for the United States. If there were a war in Europe, Cuba would be a base from which to threaten American control of the Caribbean, and with it, the ability to transit ships from the U.S. Pacific Fleet to the Atlantic. The United States never relieved pressure on Cuba, the Soviets used it as a base for many things aside from nuclear weapons (we assume), and the Castro regime clung to the Soviets for security while supporting wars of national liberation, as they were called, in Latin America and Africa that served Soviet strategic interests.


So Cuba, strategic location. USA does not want foreign power to locate there because it's been a big problem in the past. Therefore, not very eager to let go of Guantanamo. Whether I think this reasoning is right or wrong is not relevant. This is the attitude of the US towards Cuba.
 America and Britain Should Support Ukraine's Sovereignty Under the Budapest Memorandum -

http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ukraine._Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances History has proven that land belongs to whoever can hold it.  awsome news If that's true, Iraq is more screwed up than I thought. If they the Iraqi government through the Iraqi army can't protect its cities, the the Kurds should get their own country.  The rest of the comments

He explained that he didn't mean every one and I apologized Interesting. I didn't know that. Thanks for the info.  Surprised this is not already happening. A normal murderer would be hanged no? Does anyone know where in the Philippines this happened? Deflecting? The rebel commander said it was a mortar shell and said it came from Optinoye, which is well outside mortar range.  Because it takes more than money to have a good military. It's an ingredient towards that result, but it's not the only thing. Just look at Saudi Arabia, they spend a ton of money on equipment and stuff, but from what I understand their ground troops don't amount to much. Just another army ruled by tinpot dictators/monarchs, only good at suppressing the national population. The airforce is better, but that's because they're better trained, etc. 

Corruption has a tendency to devour armies from within, because officers siphon away money and sell supplies and equipment for even more money. Nigeria has a big problem with corruption. You also need good military leaders, who are also lacking in corruption.

I suspect there's a general lack of 'giving a shit' on the part of most of the troops, as well. It's probably a similar issue that Iraq saw. . .they're there for a paycheck, and if shit gets rough they'll bug out. The few soldiers who intend to do their jobs are ill-equipped and ill-trained, and poorly led and organized. Russia has never, in its entire history, been the superior military, even on the continent.  Boasting about how many nukes you have is a suicide vest mentality disguising a deep insecurity. The ocean is an absolutely fascinating place. Always the same story, just look at the mental gymnastics they go through to justify being responsible for the deaths of 60,000+ civilians in a second.

&gt; muh h-h-harbour :'(

 A lamenting Amerifat  I had no idea. Thanks for clearing that up.  One way or another the dead body of a large sea creature ends up on land. We already knew about giant squids before we actually saw them.

The probability of finding an undiscovered large sea creature is low because there are no unidentified dead bodies on land Europe? We patrol the airspace of NATO member-states whom border Russia.

With some of those member-states being the ones whom are the most frequent targets for Russian air intrusions. Figure that. 

We don't go out of our way to proactively &amp; frequently violate Russian air space, much less so with bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons.  Most retarded looking shark I've ever seen The Soviet Union engaged in "diversity" (also known as "Russification") by dispersing Russians throughout their territories. Russians can be found in every former Soviet State. Cool. Another species to make extinct due to climate change if you cant come up with a better solution, im afraid so. When pigs fly. If this is really getting built it's time to short the chinese market.  I can explain in what way it looks like Travolta, but you're absolutely right. Maybe it's the eyes.  "dragon".

Best not to give them what they want. was anyone else disturbed by japanese social media mocking one of ISIS hostages?  it just seems like they enjoy their isolation as if the rest of the world is a fiction Good luck then. "Please don't show the film. Or else we will have to burn our own houses down, bomb our own markets and schools, and kill our own people." Like in *Sphere*? (book or movie) &gt; Megalodon Who watched the embedded Youtube video? That heart-shaped scene transition was priceless after the man talked about how hot and bothered he was for the shark. By the way, to what degree do you think this attempted thawing of US/Cuba relations has to do with the recent US policy changes to healthcare? Do you think that the projected shortage of doctors may have something to do with this? I ask because Cuba has an extremely high density of doctors, and we could really use them here in the states. I cant say one way or the other, but am interested in what you think about this facet of it.  [Ukraine on Her Knees...
Chaos reigns as 'untouchable' thugs rule the streets and oligarch unleash private marauders; 'the next Libya on the doorstep of Europe'](http://observer.com/2015/01/ukraine-on-her-knees/#ixzz3QJkcowqO)


[Photo - what it is to be western Ukrainian, on your knees worshiping fallen kiborgs' (in Russian, *coffin* spelled backward)  ](https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/ff677267a5a1e5a9d375bb0cd36.jpg?w=970) It's from a game called Dark Souls PUTIN It wouldn't be the first time.  In 266 BC the siege of Megara was broken when the locals doused some pigs with combustible pitch, crude oil or resin, set them alight, and drove them towards the enemy's massed war elephants. The elephants bolted in terror from the flaming, squealing pigs, often killing great numbers of their own soldiers by trampling them to death. No, no, you know that scene in Lord of of the Rings where they pull the Urukai out of the deep dark pits of the earth? That's where they come from.   I think if Cuba takes unilateral action to take it back, it's standing especially among Latin American countries will be seriously enhanced. The British are roughly 70% responsible for the modern Middle Eastern situation. The French get about 30% of that blame but since they're French no one pays attention to them.

Had the British kept their word at the end of WW1 and created the Palastinian state they promised the arabs there would be far less contention in the middle east. Had they not divided Syria, lebanon, etc into the Mandate system the west would get a hell of a lot less blame.

I do understand why the british did it. It was a way to balkanize and ensure their continued power over the middle east after claiming it from Ottoman domination. It still doesnt make it any less of a shit idea looking back on it from 80 years out. IIRC they were very crafty with the sabotage. They Sabotaged just enough to hurt the war effort but not enough to be caught. The Germans would just write them off as "Oh that was a bad batch of rocket motors. Get QC on that!"  then while they were doing that another part of the rocket would start to malfunction... wash rinse repeat.  I agree completely.  It's okay if they kill their own kind, just as long as they aren't a "threat" to us. It's only terrorism if we're on the receiving end. No those are Crab people.   60th confirmed human encounter. 60 divided by 10 is 6. Half of 6 is 3. HALF LIFE 3 COMFIRMED How cute. What about all the abuse of children in higher political circles? I really wish they would just be wankers. But in that case it is in the interest of the country, i guess. Riiight. You seem to be an expert.  &gt; Come on baby, forgive my terrorism, it was just the tip.

If say that about summarizes your level of analysis. You say something factually wrong (Hamas broke the 2012 ceasefire first) and then get your point across with a crude joke. This is why I love internet arguments. I meet the most thoughtful, analytical people. To quote what I said before:

&gt;Isn't that provocative on China's part though? I mean....it's centered on territory disputed by both Japan &amp; South Korea, both of whom we consider to be the legitimate holder of their respective disputes. 

&gt;China did more than a poke with a patrol there, they tried to outright claim what Japan &amp; us consider to be Japanese territory.

&gt;I...I don't think Portugal or the United Kingdom are disputed territory of Russia.  I know that ,but I would think that a license suspension for maybe a year or more would be better. But according to the US they are not military prisoners. That's why the US denies them the Geneva Convention rights, and it's also why they are being held there without a trial. The whole situation is completely contrary to law.

So, from the perspective of the international right, Guantanamo bay is not a military prison. No. its. not. Its the Arabic version of ISIS. It literally means and operates the same. It is an Arabic Acronym.  Good effort. Are human beings naturally accepting, tolerant, and welcoming of others?  Are we to believe that without religion, mankind would be completely accepting of differing cultures and embrace the diversity that is human life?  Was the world a beautiful, harmonious place until religion came along?

The answer to these questions is: no.  

Human beings are naturally inclined to reject those who are not like them.  Religion does not CREATE these inclinations.  Religion can be used to endorse these inclinations, to substantiate them, and to even encourage them.  But religion does not CREATE them nor does religion uphold them.  The foundation of xenophobic (tribalistic) tendencies referenced in this article are from mankind itself, not from the religious structures people choose to follow. 

Dissolving religion will not dissolve the intrinsic attributes of humanity.  The USSR was an atheistic powerhouse and yet it committed some terrible atrocities against its own people.  It had state-sponsored rejection of religion and yet was a vile regime.  The same can be said of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge who slaughtered millions of innocent Cambodians, particularly educated Cambodians.  

Please understand: religion is not the source of supremacist views, misogyny, or divisiveness.  Religion is not the point of origination nor is it the bedrock that maintains these things.  These attributes occur naturally in human beings and, in my opinion, can only be resolved with education and self-awareness.   Iraqi Kurdistan has been used as a proxy since they gained autonomy. First Iran supplied the Kurds in their rebellion with the help of mossad in the years before the iranian revolution. This backfired on the kurds, who after being pushed to the iranian border by the Iraqi army were cut off by the Iranians who didn't want to face up iraq over the kurds. So there the Kurds were expecting help from Iran but being cut off. 

Then again during the Iran-Iraq war the Iranians used the Kurds to fund their rebellion so the Iraqis had to contend with two fronts. Again this backfired massively resulting in chemical attacks killing a hundrerd thousand civilians and causing a million refugees. Iran didn't give a fuck, using the kurds was just a way for them to inconvenience Iraq. Nyc to know
 Pfft. Call us back when you're a Navy Seal with 200 confirmed kills. Enough of one to deal with the likes of Boko Haram. Dudes a highlander stupid long fish Sea turtles eat jellyfish.  If I'm not mistaken, I've just been one-upped. &gt; pro palestinians ~~priests~~ arent known to be intelligent Now, I never said what agreement they should decide, whether it be a two state, one state or no state. I'm just saying tensions are high enough as they are. 
 I'm pretty passionate about all of those things, but I feel like they will happen despite me, not because of me. I'm struck with a feeling of overwhelming futility. Sure, one person can make a difference, but that person isn't me. I'm the guy in the crowd listening to a great speech, not the speaker. I am an interchangeable cog in a machine that will move forward with or without me.

In 100 years, when everyone who knew me has died, I may as well have not existed. I have, and will never, achieve anything beyond (maybe) home ownership. 

Fuck, I need to stop talking. It's bad enough that I want to die, let alone depressing other people. The condition in Pakistan is very complicated, basically they created a mess now they can't get out of the mess, in short they just can't, it's impossible for them unless some superpower helps them. &gt; I know ISIS kind of deserves execution and all, but isn't a legal system supposed to decide on a punishment for a criminal's actions regardless of the actions of other criminals?

A legal system was not used for the prisoners America took and held at Gitmo. For some of us they're abominable muscles.  I'm surprised they didn't eat it.  It worked out well in the 1980's, didn't it? Yes and I'm pretty disappointed since it is a shitty shark. Knew it! We're back to oil when discussing terrorists! There seems to be a lot of confusion here: 

* The rapist is already facing prosecution for rape and is currently jail.

* Uber India is being sued in India for not complying with legal requirements for doing background verification of the driver and for misrepresnting the safety of its services. 

* The parent company is being sued in the US because it failed to implement safety precautions in its subsidiary.  Good luck, friend. Allah Akbar! OMG you guys I got the 4000th upvote and it felt so good. Henry Kissinger,

How I'm missin' yer,

You're the doctor of my dreams... Of course Russia shouldn't get a free pass. My point was that it's a progressive escalation by both sides, and that's not the narrative taught in school.  Almost as fun as looking up pictures of giant animals. 1.25 billion/2 = 625 million. &gt; kraine's Sover

I agree, it's important to be sceptical regarding such statements.

What I thought was strange about this article was the DPR PM accused the Ukrainian army of doing the same thing in a press conference last week.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdDLSzLFFrc [Imgur mirror](http://i.imgur.com/RQh3BMN.jpg) The West has no monopoly on separation of power and government accountability. China will never ascend to the heights it desires if it continues to insist on insulating itself from anything that threatens the communist party. Having no heat or power in those conditions is horrible, and I hope it is resolved soon. That said, social media isn't going to help you, your government is. Notify the right people instead of tweeting about it.

Also, it's Siberia. Russia's entire history involves banishing various douchewaffles or dissidents out there for a reason: it's an inhospitable, often uninhabitable tundra. There's certain places you just aren't supposed to live, pretty sure Siberia is up there on the list.  Fucking hypocrites.  Never stopped us before.

 No one cares that you have purposely chosen to ignore reality to feed your tiny world view  This may be the first article. I've seen that said "homes" in the title. I'm glad for that, because many people seem to think that every time settlement news comes up, Israel is going out, taking land, and building; they perceive it as a number of new settlements instead. ;) ...

Can't get laid? Religion doesn't allow sex? Become a suicide bomber and get eternal glory and 72 virgins to appease that sexual frustration. Ugh.

This is what i was afraid of when the usa starting using them.

Also, it was technically 5/6ths of a solar system... my name is based on everyone's favourite arabic-titled refreshment.  Worthless Russian rubles that Greece can only use to buy gas and oil.

Once you decide to leave in order to fight for extremists and kill in the name of the gingerbread man Mohammed, you'll forfeit your citizenship or visa. At least that's how it should be. Mental instability is not an excuse to take hostages. Whether he needs professional help or not, he should be put away for a long time. He is obviously dangerous. religion acts as an unnatural barrier between the people. and it - just like the other borders we made - can guide us through this seemingly endless world.

i guess religion's original goal was to mistify common things and troll other people for the lolz. it sure was a fun thing until it was used modest. but then came the avatars.

all the modern churches are based on the ancient proverb divide et impera. religions hide knowledge from the people and can show other religions through a narrow cross section. its always easier to tell people "we are the good" and look, this is the borderline, and there is the evil on the other side, but no worries, i can save you, provided...

religion can slow us down, but it also generates tension. and tension is energy. energy means movement. and movement is survival. with this paradox you can undeniably prove anything. or the opposite

+bonus: its always easier to blame an imaginary friend, than taking actual response for your life or the good and bad things that happen to you.

That is a *consequence* when donors stop giving that still doesn't answer *why* the donors stopped donating. 

&gt;Why not try looking for them instead of postulating about it?

The only thing that I could find pertaining my question is [this](http://www.voanews.com/content/un-relief-agency-halts-gaza-aid-urges-donors-to-fulfill-pledges/2616520.html#hash=relatedInfoContainer)

&gt;"Five-point-four billion dollars was pledged at the Cairo conference last October and virtually none of it has reached Gaza. This is distressing and unacceptable."

I'm not suggesting that Netanyahu has an influence for every country that pledged to donate but his sphere of influence does include the [US](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/06/congress-cut-aid-palestine-reconciliation-hamas.html)

And the US is a big player in the UN. 

I do have a basis for my claims, it's not so much of a conspiracy as you'd like to say.  Something something Khardashian. The Russians are talking to their own, uninformed, general population.

Experts on the subject would cite "mutual assured destruction" as the guiding principle of USA, NATO, and Russian military policies.

 I have my opinions, but they don't matter. I find many aspects of Africa fascinating and it really bugs me to see constant struggle in many parts of the continent. But, realistically, the only way I think solutions can even be attempted is when people see themselves as part of a larger entity, that although they identify themselves with a particular group, tribe, or state/country; they see themselves as part of something larger. It is really what the USA is. You have to look at the USA as a conglomeration of smaller countries to really understand it. 

I personally think that the USA is even too large of a common identity and we see a constant struggle to keep that from not coming apart at the seams even though we have many different advantages, tools, and resources available to us for that purpose. Europe is trying the same kind of model, but it's definitely a rough going. I think regions of Africa should probably also try to unify into smaller common identity, but I am not sure that, e.g., Ghana, Togo, Benin, and Nigeria could come together and form an overarching identity and a kind a common security pack (like NATO is) to assure that they protect, secure, stabilize, and trade with each each other.

I would also think that in order to make any headwind, people of Africa and its diaspora would really need to get in the face of the USA and Europe, especially, to stop the kleptomaniac and nepotistic idiots that many African leaders turn out to be from stealing and depositing money in the USA and Europe. But the challenge is also a lot bigger, because there do not seem to be many systematic incentive structures to keep people from simply voting for the particular person that belongs to their local, ethnic identity. That's not a challenge that is in any way unique to Africa or Nigeria, just look at what is going on in the USA, but it is a rather pernicious one that seems to be rather common in Africa; the inability for empathy for anyone outside of your small perspective.  Hezbollah is much more powerful and mature than it was in 2006. If Israel tries to attack it, it would be a big mistake!! Lately? It must be a year or two since atheism started getting shunned from the rest of Reddit. It's been embarrassed to show its face since even before the m'lady Fedora memes got popular. I think most Reddit users probably don't even remember the days when religion was held in the same opinion that Comcast is right now. Seems pretty concrete though.   Maybe we do, and nobody notices cause it's Bulgaria **Article summary:**

I think it's pretty reasonable, given that we're talking about preventing the loss of lives here. Even if the law isn't enforced it acts as a reminder/deterrent. LOL Winter is coming... Where did it wash up? I think she was passed out in the back seat after partying. This guy took the car in a secluded area and she woke up to him molesting her. Then he threatened to kill her unless she relented.

He's done this before...he used to park outside malls which had clubs and waited for single women whom he could prey upon. Even got away with it several times but it was on his record too.

Did you see his [face](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2038029!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/uber9n-6-web.jpg)? I think Russia will just not give a fuck and shoot them down the second they enter russian airspace. I dunno, this is kind of how the Fremen happened in Dune. Lizard people come from beneath Mar's crust then.  Doesn't really fucking matter. There is far too much technological advance in every possible field to not be at least a little proud.  Can they get a shave... elsewhere? ...as you hide among and use civilians as shields and make zero ground contributing to your cause. What a joke. Hezbollah and Hamas among the rest of the idiots plaguing this world and hindering actual progress need to be exterminated. They would be too if the world applied their own tactics against then and showed no remorse to loss of life Doesn't matter if it's an effective shield...it's considered a provocation, and that's all that matters. 

Flying a bomber along Irish borders isn't exactly an "effective threat" either compared to a missile shield...because that bomber could be overwhelmed too. In Britain there is certainly no shortage of fresh ingredients. I agree that it never took off, I just wonder why. I imagine the reason to most likely be that we assimilated so many cultures cuisine that we never really had anything to call our own. Excepting of course, the engineering magnificence of the Yorkshire pud. Or they just want what they are legally entitled to have back... They don't even have superiority in nukes. The US alone has more warheads than Russia, and then you can add the arsenals of France and the UK to that number. Any-thing you can do, I can do betterrrrr...

And the Palestinians have done a horrible job making any allies anywhere in the Arab world. And not to many of those nations are willing to give any consequences to Israel for its actions. Everyone is waiting for the US to suddenly not have any relations with Israel. Which is clearly not going to happen.  Why you steal Michael Justin's quote? Who cares?  I hope they all kill each other over there!  I know that seems callous, but this nonsense has been going on for thousands of years.  It's all they know!  Until they all wipe each other out, it won't stop.  The governments are religious groups themselves, and as one group takes over they fight with the other until someone else takes over and it starts all over. Uruguay?  I'll bet it's Uruguay.  They have a coastline, right? I'm pro-Israel and pro-Palestine. Everybody is in the wrong in some way in the Middle-East, but others don't seem to realize that.  That's why nothing will get done in regards to creating peace: People are to be busy getting all emotional about who's more evil , but not actually compromising and calling everybody out on wrongdoing. I made examples where neither side are "the good guys"to  express that joining either just furthers the problem. It's nothing personal against Israel.  Not 'too'.  I've never even heard of Fury.

"Everybody always hate on the poor muslims" Leatherbacks, FTW! I remember seeing it discussed earlier in the battles against Isis whether or not Israel entering the fray would be a good idea. Many agree that it would not.

Israel is considered to be an enemy or at least highly disliked by many surrounding nations, and Israel's involvement could threaten the unified attack they are mounting against ISIS. Israel may have a powerful military, but it's not worth the risk of other countries refusing to fight alongside them. probably has a stomach full of plastic "All ISIS wants is a state, and to be left alone! But thanks to IsraHELL and their APARTHEID, the poor Islamists can't practice their own religion the way they want! #FreeIslamicState #VoteLiberal" Still not a desert. And Europe has been waging war with itself since day 1.  No shit I love that mustache.  only the ones that float end up on land.

what about the possibility of ones that sink to the bottom and never reach land because they are too dense? or because they live in the bottom of an ocean trench?

not everything ends up on land. TechCamp operates? Google thinks I speak Russian. Weird. Maybe before they reach land they get eaten or breakdown faster.  The initial sanctions and then deposing Saddam left a power void so large every scholar on the matter predicted this and it was known by top policy makers in Washington as well. No 

In terms of scale, what the US invasion meant for the destruction of cultural history in Iraq is far larger than the snippets of reports coming out about ISIS. It's propaganda, it makes headlines when the bad guys do it. 

The global policy forum has plenty of articles about what took place after the invasion in terms of destruction/looting of historical sites: https://www.globalpolicy.org/humanitarian-issues-in-iraq/consequences-of-the-war-and-occupation-of-iraq/destruction-of-iraqs-cultural-heritage.html The Church is also the worlds largest provider of HIV AIDS care bjt hey.. I guess that doesnt count according to the original poster for some reason....

&gt;Statistics from the Vatican in 2012 indicate that Catholic Church-related organizations provide approximately a quarter of all HIV treatment, care, and support throughout the world and run more than 5,000 hospitals, 18,000 dispensaries, and 9,000 orphanages, many involved in AIDS-related activities."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_HIV/AIDS What's even cooler about those "ribs" in their mouths is that these evolved into inner ear bones in terrestrial animals. The government of Cuba signed a lease. It's enforced by international law, the US is stronger than Cuba therefore it's legal, and with the full backing of the law it's not getting the land returned to it.

Cuba knows it's not getting it back. Cuba knows there's no chance of it. So why is Cuba throwing this out when the US is offering to let it's sanctions drop? The only one who loses from this is Cuba. I came here because I read megamammoth shark. I was hoping for something close to a megalodon. Still wasn't disappointed though. Never heard of megamouth either. TIL That movie wasn't even that funny. British humor  I'm impressed by your ability to determine what's going on on my computer. You didn't install surveillance software on my computer, did you? While you're at it, why don't you tell me where I am right now?

I read your silly article. Palestinian textbooks have been studied by international organizations ad nauseam. The article you cite makes claims about them that go far beyond what other organizations claim. Given the publisher, and the lack of specifics in the article, I'm inclined not to put much stock in it. It looks like another fringe website propagating typical myths. We do clickbait on Reddit now too?  Holy fuck so.. america... how does it feel to be the victim for once... I get that way with English and Spanish. I can read Spanish and attempt to write it. My grammar may become a bit mixed up in translation but if I were to sit and listen, I get lost and can only pick out a few words at a time. /r/worldnews everyone! Jesus fuck what the hell. How about you figure out how reality works, then come back and visit again. We'll wait.  Are you saying the only people who oppress homosexuals are homosexuals themselves?  Because, uh, I highly disagree. As long as they're dead, who cares? He exists!

http://youtu.be/XFtZuPYsHeM Just out of curiosity, were there efforts to put this beauty back in the water? Of course, that's the way it is in the US too. I don't think that's even a common thing to see unless the suspect is resisting. Lots of criticism goes into each use of force administered by police, unfortunately I feel that the punishments aren't adequate for the violations and bad cops get away with shit like that too lightly. I can't verify this, but I feel like some police departments are either understaffed or overworked and can't afford to fire or suspend officers for stuff like that.  While Europe slept. &gt; (Russia's) military couldn't stand up against NATO. Or even China. 

Somebody else had a similar opinion back in 1941. 

He was wrong too. Rebels did not claim that it was mortar strike. I just realized how awesome your username is Isis brought piss to a shit fight. 

 Not really, I meant "those guys" as the guys at /r/atheism, I assumed people would undertand that since the initial comment talked about a circle jerk at /r/atheism How many military bases have prisons/internment camps?  Quite a few, actually.

Concentration camps?  Zero. I've got a [better way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3j1oKAqgdA) Looks like the primordial serpents from Dark Souls. best ..!! North Korea is a notable exception It looks like a shark that was just kinda thrown together  Israel sees Hezbollah as a bigger threat than ISIS Uganda. The U-boats of Uganda. Duh. . . How is it not stable?

Not that I ever said that, but I'm curious at how firing someone shows instability. Shaim Sabbagh supported the military overthrow of the elected Islamist government by the Egyptian military and police.  Then, the same military and police she supported against the Muslim Brotherhood shot her dead in the street.   The Catholic Church has been providing care for the poor and sick and orphaned for nearly the entirety of its existence. Crack opena book sometime, the Church HAS been doing shit like this for 1500 years. I know, even as an Indian myself I don't agree with "Kill each other"(relating to the tension between India and Pakistan), there are literally thousands of innocent people who've been gripped by the situation, they deserve a better life :( On wait my bad, I fucked up  What is it with old politicians hating porn? I don't even think these kinds of stories are particularly worth discussing. These kinds of "events" are routine and have been for decades. Hardly are upsetting to any country. "Just another day at the office" kind of attitude.  Could be political or could be just a country's due diligence to see how responsive (or lack theirof) one's defense is. Or both.   You sound upset. %of yearly income fines might. Goats? **THOSE MONSTERS!!!** And only a few are needed to absolutely destroy the world. Obama invaded Ukraine? Is the entire game that gray? Every screenshot I see is just gray Caribbean countries rely on the U.S for a good deal of their imports. If they took any action toward the U.S it would be bad for them. They need U.S tourism and U.S imports. Venezuela is openly hostile to the U.S...look at how isolated and weak they are today.  Yes. Too bad it's all the other people they're trying to convince. &gt;Do you have any sources that give specific motivations that people have?

It was a Pew Research Survey. Here is a HuffPost article about it. 

http://huffpost.com/us/entry/4959201 Go ahead and suggest they destory the Kaaba if it's just the direction that matters, see how people react Sorry. I read it too fast. And, 5000, well, OK, maybe. 1 in 5000, no don't believe it. Not without some "motivation" from above. Right in the vagina. This is a big middle finger to Erdogan. No I mean directly after 9/11, not after he was elected. Yes. It falls under the 'HatfieldMcCoy' doctrine. The Catholic Church is the worlds largest charitable organization, fool. Oh shit, I always assumed the "-edeen" was etymologically the same as "al-din" or "uddin/addin" which appears in a ton of Muslim names (e.g. Aladdin) and means "(of) the Faith". Guess I was wrong. &gt; The gun is rifled too so the tank gets better long range accuracy and velocity.

This isn't accurate at all. There are differences between using rifled barrels vs smooth bore but range and velocity aren't in the rifled barrel's favor.

The fastest round I can find for the Chally 2 is 1,534 metres per second, vs 1,580 to 1,750 m/s (5,200 to 5,700 ft/s) for the Rheinmetall 120 mm, which can also be accurate up to 8000m. 
Rifled barrels allow for HESH rounds, though. 

Brits have the best armor and tea making capabilities in NATO. The best gun belongs to the Germans and Americans. The best fire control belongs to the US, unless the new Leo 2a7 has passed it.  
  One of the reasons why I often call the US government a terrorist organisation.  Obama has been playing the long game with international politics from day 1.  The long game often takes years to pay off, but it does pay off.

The right wingers demanded "boots on the ground" or direct intervention in Crimea and Ukraine.  They said Putin was a great leader and Obama was weak because he wouldn't stand up to him.  Obama, on the other hand, understood the fragility of the Russian economy and its dependence on high oil prices. He started with sanctions, slowly metering them out in different waves to keep the news cycle tuned in as long as possible.  This hurt the Russian economy, but it alone would never be enough.  

Obama cut a deal with the Saudis, having them ignore OPEC pleas to cut production, so that global oil prices would fall.  The Saudis were happy to do so because it would screw their regional enemies in Iran, Syria, Iraq, and of course ISIS - all of whom are threats to the last major monarchy on the planet.  The Saudis publicly said it was to "limit the long term impact of the fracking industry" which is absolute BS.  

When you drill for oil, the bulk of the sunk expenses are spent before you even start producing oil.  Finding oil, drilling for it, and then pumping it are simply expensive.  Once you've spent that money, you're not going to shut down the well because $40/barrel (with $10 continuing expenses) is always better than nothing.  Sure, new fracking projects will be put on hold because it no longer makes financial sense to pay the costs to find, drill, and pump the oil, but the current projects will continue until they don't pump out enough to justify their continuing expenses.  Stated another way, the Saudi's stated reason for depressing oil prices doesn't hold water.

What do falling oil prices accomplish?  They crater economies that are dependent on high oil prices.  Putin is an oligarch, plain and simple.  Putin and his cronies have stolen billions - to the point where there are credible reports calling Putin the richest man on earth - from the Russian economy which has been propped up by $100/barrel oil.  In fact, the Russian government budget is dependent on $100/barrel oil! 

When the price drops, countries like Russia get whacked because they can no longer use their money coming out of the ground to support their policies.  Add in the sanctions and the Russian economy is simply fucked.   Putin will continue in Ukraine because he needs to keep the population distracted, but in reality that only amplifies the pain, because every dollar spent in Ukraine is one that isn't spent at home.

Where does this lead?  Revolution.  

**TL;DR:  Obama plays chess, Putin plays checkers.** Okay, thanks for posting that. Never read it. I was wrong. Il hold my hand up.

So now we know that it wasnt explicitly stated, but that it was a "violation of the spirit of the statements and assurances made to us in 1990" Why do you think NATO exists? Im not pro-Russian. Im anti imperialist - no matter how much one dominant superpower might have been better than the other. youre about 242,000 years off (depending if you count proto history as history); youre well into pre history, roughly between when Y chromosomal Adam appeared and the first homo sapiens. Funny thing is, I think many Greeks will agree with you atm... I am curious of the efficiency of solar panel in places that aren't so shinny. Britain isn't Thailand and I wonder how much of a difference it make. In Canada, it seems that solar panel aren't a very good solution unless coupled with others systems or batteries as we need electricity the most when it's cold and dark. He didn't offer the hostages donuts. Obviously not Canadian.  A little from column A, a little from column B. Yeah. 6 if you count ghost loads.  Dude. Chill out man.

What was his message anyway? That's some nice verbal acrobatics. There is one interview with one Syrian who says Jabhat an-Nusra isn't as bad as people say. I don't believe him, but that's hardly saying he "supports" them.

It's always interesting to see which side in the Syrian Civil War accuses Israel of supporting the other side and for what reason. Pro-Assad groups say Israel supports the rebels and anti-Assad groups say Israel supports him. Fact is Israel has stayed out of the war and only taken action when there was a direct threat to its citizens. Since most of the rebels are more interested in fighting Assad now (though are clear they will come after Israel once they win), Israel has largely left them alone and had no reason to engage with them (though it has arrested numerous Israeli Arabs who traveled to Syrian to join the Islamic State). Should the rebel attack Israel, you'd better believe Israel will retaliate.

Your attempt to make it seem like Israel is siding with America's enemies is laughable. Israel is America's greatest ally in the region and comes under attack from Jihadists on a daily basis.

I also find it interesting that in listing the attrocities of these Jihadists, you mention the attack on Charlie Hebdo, but ignore the attack on the Hyper Cacher Kosher Supermaket. You needed to ignore it in order to make your ludicrous point because if you admitted that these Jihadists attack Jews because they are Jewish then it would completely undermine your entire argument. its not how we treat our friends, the US doesnt have friends, its the global super power. its has intents and because the the super power, people have interest with it. It might possibly be because they live in very pressured water and when they come into (what is to them) low pressure area, their bodies just kinda go "bleugh". http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/653/456/2ee.gif The problem is more that conspiracy theorists fail to focus on real conspiracies. Because those are no secret. &gt;Then what value is religion if it's the claim to a higher truth, but is really just malleable to the current social norm?

This carries the assumption that the Bible is a historical account, therefore what's its value if this "history" can constantly change? The problem with that assessment, is taking the Bible as a historical account is something rather new, and wasn't previously understood this way.

Which brings me to its allegorical significance: As a piece of literature, the Bible is a massive work with clever literary devices at play across the work. There is deep significance in the language used, the stories represented, and what they tell us. That is what, I feel, ultimately matters with a work like the Bible. The Bible won't change, only our interpretation of it will become more refined as the conservative "all of this 100% actually happened" die out. Not to mention The Bible has the unfortunate place of being incorrectly translated on *multiple* occasions throughout history. The key is to understanding the stories, how they work within the framework of the Bible, and their significance. It's a beautiful work; but demands proper analysis to be truly enriching.

&gt;I don't really know why you're shifting the blame from religion, when religion is just a set of ideas created and maintained and modified by humans.

Many of these are due to mistranslations and misinterpretations from previous generations that didn't know as much about the Bible as we do now thanks to academia and research. 80 years ago, I highly doubt your average person knew that when "homosexuals" are mentioned in Paul's Letters to the Corinthians, it was due to a mistranslation (thanks to the King James Version). Now we know the correct translation are not references to homosexuals; but "sodomites". Sodomites were male prostitutes, which is a clear difference.

Further, as I've stated and what many seem not to get, a BOOK is not responsible for riots and killings. Corrupt institutions brought in to represent religion are more of the problem. Look at what happened after the crusades and the Knights Templar. They were hunted down, tortured, and burnt at the stake because someone made up a rumor they were worshiping a goat head, and the severed head of John the Baptist. Those responsible built a case against them, and forced the members into confession. Afterwards, members of the Knights Templar stated what they admitted to was bullshit. But guess what? They were burnt at the stake anyway.

You seem to miss the fact that people act a certain way over the most trivial shit. People rioted at a GUNS N ROSES CONCERT because Axl Rose refused to perform. People in Boston RIOTED after the world series....BECAUSE THEY WON. People do the dumbest shit, and it's lazy to assume that a BOOK is reponsible for those actions. No, people, and those people in power, are ultimately responsible. The blame must be shifted on the PEOPLE COMMITTING THE ACTS, not a book. Yes and America did nothing to stop it. Nothing! probably not joking, those people are out there but very much in the minority. Not "western" military, *NATO*.

Yes, Russia could be triumphant over Ukraine, which is very poor, whose equipment is outdated and is relatively small.

But the combined forces of NATO, even if you'd forget about the US, just the European countries, would **kick Russia's ass**.

And don't forget that the European part of NATO (again, even without the US) contains several countries with nuclear capabilities, so for people who are very scared of nukes: that works both ways.

 There's no denying that many politicians are sacks of shit.  Why that fact shows up in every thread, even ones about rare sharks, is beyond me.  Easy karma, I guess. Russia is obviously posturing, so what would have happened if the UK shot them down? It's what Russia wants the world. i have not defended anything, and i am certainly not perpetuating anything im not even in your country.

i simply stated that the US does have a health care system even if it is a shit one and that the other guys premium did not sound to bad. (and not to bad btw is still not good $500 a year to me in the uk still is insane)

My country (NL) is totally lagging behind! i hear the vatican &amp; its consortium have been offering children full physical examinations for hundreds of years... how noble The point is if he did both then the YouTube video would be linked in this thread and we'd all be able to know what his "important message" was. Instead no one knows what he was going to say so it was a complete failure on his part. Good idea. just make sure you never voice an opinion on a people or region unless you live there.  Yeah, there's lot of urban legend about Yugoslavian one.

And you've missed one interesting point of interview: aforementioned Colonel stated that they've calculated aircraft route **visually**, set spotters who warned AA position ahead and that spotters had **visual** identification.

That's why they managed to shot only one F-117.

If what site telling is true and any radars with "some modifications" can easily detect F-117, more planes will be shot.

tl;dr: pilots who got lazy and careless, can be shot down even in stealth planes. I know. I'd love so much to believe the legends of the monks who could levitate or light things on fire with a touch.

We see tiny pieces of evidence here and there, but the big ones are always mundane. It's not that they never were terrorists. It's just that after you massacre them to the point of non existence they have now become non terrorists as they pose no threat.  I think that if the Kurds are the ones to be the deciding factor in the war against ISIS, they should finally be given their own nation. The also currently control a lot of land in Syria which I think Syria assumes will be given back to them at the end of this conflict. But what if the Kurds just hold on to it? Things will be interesting. Hey, as we saw with [Saipan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saipan#Civilian_casualties), where more than 20,000 civilians died, or [Okinawa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Okinawa#Civilian_losses.2C_suicides_and_atrocities), where most estimates have more than 100,000 civilians dying, I'm sure things would've been just fucking *peachy* for Japanese civilians during what would've been the largest battle of the Pacific.

[**Good analysis for the reasoning there.**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Downfall#Estimated_casualties)

&gt;A study done for Secretary of War Henry Stimson's staff by William Shockley estimated that conquering Japan would cost 1.74 million American casualties, including 400,000800,000 fatalities, and five to ten million Japanese fatalities. The key assumption was large-scale participation by civilians in the defense of Japan.

&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------

&gt;In a study done by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in April, the figures of 7.45 casualties/1,000 man-days and 1.78 fatalities/1,000 man-days were developed. This implied that a 90-day Olympic campaign would cost 456,000 casualties, including 109,000 dead or missing. If Coronet took another 90 days, the combined cost would be 1,200,000 casualties, with 267,000 fatalities. There are countless of stories coming from the US about excessive force, though. People tazerd over and over again in the same setting, stuff like that. Also the amount of people killed at the hands of the police is disproportional stateside.

I'm not sure how they age them or came to that conclusion I agree that atheism was a difficult matter in those times. But you have to think about what motivates people in their lives. What drives them? That differs for everyone. That motivation can come from anything, anywhere. 
That also counts in the case of some of these influential men and women of history. For some of these accomplished people that shaped out future, that motivation has been religion. And some of these religious leaders have been essential in allowing that motivation to work, in prospering it, in understanding the value of knowledge, understanding how it can compliment our lives. Even today, religion motivates people in their goals in life and there's nothing wrong with that. 

Sure atheism was hard back then, but noone forced copernicus in that time to be a PRIEST. Noone forced Avicenna to read the entire quran every three days on his deathbed until he passed. 

PS: Also the islamic golden age didn't fade. It violently ended by the sacking of baghdad by the mongols. Baghdad was the seat of the caliphate and held the largest library in the world at that time.

 &gt;For what reason? They just went to the neighbor country, which doesn't even requires visa.

To serve Putin's agenda. If he did not want them going they would not go. He has the power. Since they are going...

&gt;It's not working like that.

Perhaps, but it should. Imagine a Russian soldier going to fight on the Ukrainian side. You don't think his commanders would do something about it, when he came back? Yemen, Somalia... I'm waiting for the JDAM: Joint Direct Attack Mule The Nigerian army isn't really all too bad. Its just that they're a bit neutered because (a) they have Boko Haram supporters within the military and (b) no one wants another military coup so problems that weaken or distract the military forces are generally ignored. I am sure Iran took good note of it.  Nature is fucking awesome.  It seems like all the extremists already have guns, so denying the rest of the population the right to defend themselves only puts them at the will of the extremists.

Boko Haram is also better equipped than the Nigerian army, so the argument that more guns into their hands would do more damage is meaningless. They have all the guns they need while the people they are terrorizing have none.  Too bad one of the bones that will last longest is the femur. If you're talking about helping the homeless generally, they **have** been doing it for 1500 years. If you're talking about St. Peter's Square specifically, consider that Vatican City is an independent state (that is, _not_ part of Italy) with a population of less than 1,000. It doesn't have lots of things, because it is focused on religious study and worship.

I'm happy to see it. I think Pope Frankie has been doing a bang up job and unless you're currently working with the homeless, kids in poverty or similar, you don't have much room to criticize when you are doing LESS. Pretty sure an Uruk called me that in Shadows of Mordor, right before I chopped his head off. Like the falsely accused guy who killed himself, or the two people who were killed while the police trailed the wrong person? Not what I'd call well. Yes but we are specifically talking about Singapore. If your some western hippy who thinks they have the right to smoke weed anywhere and anytime, heres a protip, don't go to Singapore. Not sure if you'd feel that way of some big nation took where you live and said "this is ours now" Somebody is having a hard-on for Hezbollah?

Hezbollah is invested in Syria and cannot maintain war with Israel, also this time Israel will avoid the "shmurot teva" and won't send infantry to those areas.

Big plus, Iron Dome wasn't up in 2006, so rocket attacks will be futile for Hezbollah, and any troops in the Israeli border will be met with IAF.

But yeah, big mistake. Or a whale shark that's been punched in the mouth  I'm just wondering how they keep the goat from eating the bomb. That's only due to the fact that IS is not at their border.  Israel has been helping out al-Nusra/FSA fighters by providing medical care, but they ultimately fear the Islamic State taking over those positions.  While al-Nusra/FSA are mainly focused on just taking down Assad, IS is focused on expanding territory.   Christianity literally branched from judaism. The three religions that dominate the world are the judeo-christian religions (though in reality only christianity and islam dominate the world, there are 13 odd million jews and a good portion aren't even religious)

The health care system IS bad.

I would say that saying we "have a health care system" in America is the same as saying an obese guy that walks from his bedroom to the pantry to get his chocolate bars is "getting exercise."

 I think this priest spent too much time on /r/conspiracy I don't think any organization which wishes to be taken seriously as a political religious force (regardless of how batshit crazy they actually are) would call themselves MILF if they watched porn...

Despite the look, it's actually got a crunch to it. The reason why the Cuban Missile Crisis was a crisis is because the United States perceived to deployment to be a major doctrinal shift in Soviet strategic thinking to a first strike policy--it was a massively destabilizing move because it changed the strategic situation so dramatically. The missiles were deployed in secret, in direct contradiction of stated American policy that the introduction of Soviet nuclear weapons to the Western hemisphere was unacceptable.  To the political and military leadership of the United States this looked very much like preparations for a preemptive surprise attack, akin to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  

The Jupiter missiles in Turkey were deployed in the open, in a pre-announced deployment alongside nuclear sharing Jupiters in Italy and USAF Thor missiles in Britain.  The deployments weren't secret insofar as there was foreknowledge that it was happening, and they didn't appear to change the strategic balance which massively favored the United States at the time.  

The reason why the deployment of missiles to Cuba was most unforgivable, though, is because it was entirely unnecessary.  These sorts of forward-deployed strategic ballistic missiles were already being made obsolete.  (the US had already concluded that the Jupiters were obsolete and were slated for removal)   Both the ICBM and SLBM were making it so that you could launch a missile at pretty much any target with very little notice.  All it managed to do was engender hostility between the United States and the Soviet Union, discredit Khrushchev in the eyes of hardliners while he was attempting to reform the Soviet government, and lock-in US-Cuban hostility for the next fifty years.   It was also attempted in the US Civil War with mules in 1862. No human casualties, but resulted in a stampede.  drunk Uranus, u boats from Uranus roaming the seas.  &gt;  and it would be very illegal for a bank to release that information without it.

Indeed it would. But the problem is, you'd need to prove that the data was given away by someone from your bank and even if you could do that, the bank would say they either found out who it was and fired him or "hackers broke in" and there was nothing to worry about anymore.

&gt; More to the point, without that information, it would also be clearly impossible to use several purchases to identify a specific individual without some other piece of information,

All they wanted to do (so far) was correlate purchases and maybe other data to a specific person, "identified" by a certain pseudonym. And they seemed to be able to do that with only 4 pseudo-anomymized data-items.

&gt; or illegal or costly means that are beyond the scope of the study.

AFAIU, not illegal, nor costly, just beyond the scope of the study: All they needed was one more data item *with* a full name they could correlate to their pseudonym. That could be achieved by setting up a trap like "You have already won!" &amp; "Just send in your address and answer a few questions". Or simply by digging some more. Hey now, I've only shot up one school, and in my defense it was an ITT Technical Institute so was it really a school?  Pot calling the kettle black. I've almost been hit so many times by people on their fucking phones. A societal shift in attitude towards phones while driving MUST change. So, "self-determination" is OK for Crimea but not for Dagestan?

They don't ban together to get rid of corruption.  They don't ban together to get rid of terrorists.  They don't make concessions with other groups and respect their rights to have their own beliefs.  They just fight!  That's all they have done for thousands of years.  You can't change a entire culture unless the majority want change.  They only want change until their group is in charge.....and then they try to suppress the other group until the tables are turned and it starts over. That is just way to cynical. I don't think it's sensible to look at it that way so do many many things. there are billions of religious people who are not using their religious status to justify being violent, they dont deserve to be treated as lesser because of some idiots. any attempt to curb religion by force/law would make us no better than the likes of bokoharam or isis . trying to educate people that religion is bad is just the same as religious indoctrination in my eyes, let them make their own choices. to give you an analogy, alcohol is legal despite it being very known for causing violent behavior, addiction , destroying familes etc. it is not really necessary for survival so we could easily ban it, but we dont, we allow people to make their own choices and those that do end up being violent while drunk are still punished by the law. i consider religion to be similar Personally not really, but if you happen to live in the EU it's easy enough to get started here :) I have no clue about non-EU nationalities though.  Eh? Everyone knows that the US is the strongest military power on earth. That's why countries resort to having nukes as a counter. &gt;this is purely an attention grabbing article designed to lure foreign investment

It's hilarious that you think any foreign corporation will take an article in the Times of India seriously, it is like the Daily Mail of India, but much worse. Sensationalist piece of crap paper, this article is of the same type. 

And btw, foreign investment in India is going to happen one way or another, a population of a billion is huge market. A Playstation costs you and an Indian the same price(actually it costs the Indian more), if you penetrate even a small percent of the market, that's still a huge number of Playstations sold.   Feminst War Witches - H. Clinton, Susan Rice, and Jen Psaki -- the creators of the Islamic Anarchist State of Libya.  Are women in Libya better off now?  The Feminist don't care, on to the next war with Victoria Nuland - "Fuck the EU."  Feminist like to show they are tougher than  men when it comes to making war on 'enemies.'   Fuck these civ jokes. Over used and irrelevant. That's how you play ball. Too bad our clueless administration thinks swapping 5 terrorists for a worthless deserter is a square deal.  How is the public transport? I can just imagine Putin silently competing with ISIS over who's the bigger bad guy.

IMO ISIS is evil, but Russia is what's really frightening They can't even defeat ISIS, Israel would have a field day opening a second front on Hezbollah right now. If Nazi Germany couldn't handle 2 fronts, what chance does Hezbollah have? But, but, MUSLIMS!!!! Not enough short as you want t this comment to be...... WHAT ARE YE DOIN' ON MY BEACH What if you just kill everyone and move in some new people?  Ugly for sure But good terms for the time doesn't mean it was a fair deal. I mean, your argument to me strikes me as "sure, they had a gun against their head, but it was a smaller gun than if it had been a British or Spanish gun. Because it was smaller, we demanded for less. Therefore the deal is totally fair." When you stoop to their level, what's the difference? That is actually an interesting question! I remember one of the newer James Bond movies had a scene in a Cuban clinic, and thought "they cant possibly be that good!" Then started doing a bit of reading and found that yes, they are the equals to anyone on earth and do have a great medical system. 

While I think maybe you could see a few of them come over, I just don't know how much it would have an impact when spread over 300 million to help the per capita shortage. Going forward maybe there will be benefits of institutions working together but we will see. 

My view on the shift in general is that the US is not really looking for "good" relations with Cuba. Simply not actively hostile. Even cool but non confrontational would remove may of the negative impacts of an actively enforced embargo, while doing what would be needed to have warm relations would cost too much for too little gain.

I would characterize my world view as borderline myopic, but not without good cause. International relations may not be a true zero sum game, but it is certainly one of active attempts by all parties of mutual exclusion to the greatest extent possible. I always find myself in agreement with the Neorealists. Chaos is very much the nature of the beast, any attempts to bring order to the structure will be imperfect at best, and while states may try to act in a rational way, it will always be in keeping with their perceived best interests. 

And a single comment about your statements about nations and where the power lies. Giving true agency(by this I mean the ability to impact the actions of the state) to every member of the state would be terrible. I can think of almost no form of government which would be more terrifying than true actualized Democracy, if your average person on the street can barely plan for the future, why would we ever be able to do so collectively. Yes the semi oligarchic system that has evolved is not perfect, but there is still a spectrum of policy beliefs represented, and it seems virtually the one thing all prominent politicians, govt leaders, and private leaders do all have in common is the proven ability to plan ahead.  Training can continue, but on NATO or host nation bases at their or at the collective expense. As for a jumping off point for Ramstein, I'm talking heavies, not fighters (none at Ramstein), though that could be accommodated with tankers. This is more for logistics and humanitarian operations in support of AFRICOM. And, yes, SW Asia is still in that sphere (keep the insults to yourself, please). Besides, Ramstein is good for presence. Otherwise, I would say close it as well. Coalition bases are better for integration and cost.  

Korea and Japan are quite capable. If they are lacking, then they need to fill those gaps at their expense, which they can accomplish. We are not post WWII or Korean War mode anymore. The threat from North Korea can be addressed by regional cooperation between South Korea and Japan. We'll have a presence with our navy, but there is truly no reason for us to ramp up and come to the rescue if the north comes south. Our forces are just speed bumps for the north and it's not ours to protect. Navy presence is enough, though a coalition base wouldn't be a bad idea. We have been in both countries over 65 years, so training and technology transfers can still happen without having bases there because that process is well established. They participate in plenty of exercises outside of their areas. An exercise in Korea is the same thing over and over again. Every year leadership states how "X" exercise was the best to date, and it was the same scenario as all previous exercises (self licking ice cream cone with "great" success). As for China, there's a plethora of alliances that can occur to counter them. The US Navy will still be deploying to the region, which is substantial and capable.  

Agreed about Guantanamo, but it does play a role in being closer to those shipping lanes than any other base, especially to the south. It's more about presence because nothing massive is launching out of there. How do I get some of that meat?  Yep. They had to land in open fields. A few really good pilots were killed/seriously injured during landing, the skid never opened and the landing force broke the pilot's backs. the article, read it.  Jrgen Tdenhofer (former german politician) spent 10 days with ISIS and is writing a book about its inner workings. He's also set to release a film within 4 weeks.  Why? Goat stomachs are hardcore, it would likely survive and become a hero goat. I think looking at it like the global community is a bunch of cliques of friends, is more a narrative than historically accurate. No, he actually meant "sculpture of limitations." Don't let him fool you. The story is almost certainly the other way around.  There is news about Ukraine almost on a daily basis. Yet, not a single evening news cast, here in the US is even mentioning it. Its just sad. I think there are a lot of people who care, but for some reason, MSM is choosing to ignore it with the hopes that it will boil over to something bigger. I get a feeling they want it to boil over.  For several reasons:

- If you automate everything you will have trouble selling your products to people with no jobs.

- If you automate everything you have nobody working for you and therefore no inferiors (which is the point of being filthy rich - having lots of inferiors).

- If we achieve a high degree of automation people will be able to create all of their own products via cooperative resource extraction and manufacturing plants. Making companies like Microsoft useless. Microsoft is already useless, it provides inferior products at huge prices while damaging open source communities. Being alive is better than being dead was my point in reply to your comment. "this is the true face of non-muslims, they take hostages at TV studios!"
 ddin't say dont be proud of technological advances, i'm proud of you guys for that, just remember that barbarism is in every single human being, just waitin to pounce out.

So, looking down on other races because they're currently having a bad time isn't that cool.  masarap! &gt;  And nobody was planning on invading Russian in the first place.

It means you can do some shit without worrying about an invasion.  he visited iran in april 2013 http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Report-Nasrallah-makes-secret-visit-to-Iran-310618 Wow great post dude Because to quote sir Archibald Mapsalot III,  

"There's nothing the Arab respects more, John, than a strong steady white hand drawing arbitrary lines betwixt there ridiculous tribal allegiances," I'll shed no tears. . . . .and sex slaves. Human beings have needs beyond food, shelter and clothing, and these little pieces of humane treatment matter a lot. &gt; That sounds like a wonderful justification, for the insane.

You're missing the point, you said that the Russian point of view should be dismissed because of the last 2 years, which implies the US viewpoint is the correct one. What about a common sense viewpoint where both entities are wrong which is the case here. Reminds me of Strange Wilderness, such an underrated movie. Don't forget the AMRAAM (A Moron Riding An Arthritic Mule) Democratic uprising. Gaddafy said the armed rebels in Libya were Al Qaida, and the Western media laughed at him.  But, surprise, they were Al Qaida.  Ambr Stevens helped arm the Islamist 'democracy' fighters.  Thenthey killed him.   My point exactly... I am sure Iran took good note of it. Megamouth Shrek (   ) for real tho i would eat the fuck out of megamouth kilawin You know, obviously this isn't a task for humans. It's a task for robots, for cataloging software, so it can be pulled out in a subpoena later.

I for one am interested in the archived internet pages in this database, when it gets declassified in the far future. You're showing a distinct lack of creativity and initiative. it's called an Enlighted Dictatorship and was the perfect form of government according to Voltaire. The trick is to find the guy who won't get corrupted by power. Iran trolling the Wahhabi radical terrorists more than anyone else, never though someone would do a better job than Israel in that regard.

Good job! We need a place to put those people.  Or the editors are shite.  There's a difference between censorship and making a choice not to spread more stupidity into a world already stuffed to the gills with it, especially when the internet is such a great vehicle for useful information. But thank you for blaming me for something I had no role in. Guess it would be kind of hypocritical for you to lambaste the priest now, huh? But, but, they were just freedom fighters fighting off western imperialist invaders   :/


They would *never* kill just to become a shahid and get their 28 pearly eyed boys in Janna 
 My first thought when seeing this pic is that all those people are holding a giant vacuum or floor buffer.. Naw, we just don't give them final meals. This is like saying you're going to win a marathon after giving the Kenyan team a 2 hour head start.  So? &gt;Shit is getting as hot as a pot of curry. - RZA &gt; The cost, of course, is that you have a government that is willing to torture innocent people.

so... the US? &gt; Early Soviet ideology was much different than the totalitarian regime we are used to thinking of, which was mostly cemented when Stalin came to power. The loosely organized Soviets (worker's communes) were often democratic in nature and the loose organization of the Soviet Union in the early days allowed lots of such governing especially in areas not particularly connected to the central government.

I recently read a few books about 1918-1924.

And I can remember there was no "loosely organized communes" and their ideology was not much different from totalitarian.

But I'll be glad to see some examples. Female commandos smothering me with pulled pork sandwiches?

I think I just found a new fetish.  I agree with the scholars. The most successful countries are monarchies that hide behind democracy.  It keeps the politicians in line and the people feel like they have a say. The heart transition on the video though. When he says the word relationship. 'oooooo mark and megamouth in the sea, k-i-s-s-i-n-g' Back in the early 90s, Russia was promised that NATO wouldn't expand to the east. NATO has now rolled across Eastern Europe up to Russia's borders, fomenting a coup in Ukraine to do so. Now how would you expect Russia to react from a party in celebration ?. Rare Newspaper Clips around the World published on Indian Independence day, 15th August 1947. This will give you goosebumps. You're wrong, though. 

A) It is the narrative taught in schools, i.e. it's part of the damn curriculum, and 

B) It wasn't a progressive escalation, the missiles were placed in Turkey as a means to deescalate border tensions by establishing an effective strike zone to match Russia's. It was a leveling of the playing field in Europe. Russia then decided to put nukes in strike distance of the heart of the US. That was uneven escalation. No wonder there are radicals, and I hope you will be victim one day.  &gt; Blood ~~will be~~ on the Russian hands. 

Blood **IS** on the Russian hands.  North Korea is a totalitarian state which is different from how dictatorships work because it adds personnality cult. Wait, I thought that was the Saudaukar? Nothing like a lil infinite loop in the morning dying in battle agaisnt a women is different than being executed by one after you've been captured/surrendered. From the Chalk Zone! "But despite the deep economic woes, he said the Russian military would receive more than 50 new intercontinental nuclear missiles this year."

It is so funny how the Russians are falling for the exact same thing we did to the USSR. Their economy is crumbling but they bought 50 new USELESS missiles while their people are suffering. And they are proud of it! Or Bahai   Infinitely creepier than any shark (except the Goblin). Wow amazing post how do you know that? the western media arent reporting this for obvious reasons, because the west is all about peace, you know. meanwhile the russian media arent reporting this because once the nation learns there are nato bombers all over the place there will be a huge demand for action and putin is obviously not in a position to shoot down a nato bomber. in the end, these incidents may be not about russia flexing its muscles just for the sake of it - it may be about russia giving a reply of sorts to some nato military activity Well in a perfect world every country that goes into negotiations will do so on equal terms. But the reality of geopolitics is that is hardly ever the case. We ( the U.S) hold a good deal of the cards in the negotiation process. For the time period it took place in, it should be considered lenient compared to other European and Asian (Japan) powers were doing. Should it be renegotiated? well it was in 1934. So it could be again in 2015..but we shouldn't just hand Cuba everything it wants.  Don't quote me on this, but over the years a few extensive studies have been made regarding Singapore's rather dismal happiness index ranking and these are the most commonly accepted conclusions:

1. We shot up economically at a breakneck speed, which came at a price. Since independence the country has done nothing but push itself forward as hard as it could, which means every working citizen down to the blue-collared laborer is driven to bettering themselves even when they're already over-qualified by international standards. To give you an example, last year one of our ministers released a statement saying our country had too many active lawyers, which was making law practice very hard to succeed in. The same can almost be said for other high paying white-collared jobs such as Medicine and engineering. This means to say, everyone is stressed from working hard, therefore happiness is lost.

2. As an offshoot of our hard work, one of the things that developed throughout the past few years was a culture of improvement. This was laid out pretty openly back in the 1960's when leaders were planning Singapore's future. The idea was to inculcate a national mindset of continual advancement, to make the individual want more than they already had. This would prevent citizens from getting lazy and stagnant. To a large extent, this has worked. Having finished 11 years in the education system here, I can tell you 99.9% of Singaporeans would be incredibly unhappy if they got anything less than a high-paying white collared job, which of course is its own problem but that's another discussion. So this culture of improvement led to increased discontent among citizens, which honestly is something that's pretty prevalent throughout most advanced first-world nations.

So no, we're not unhappy because the "evil government" is stepping on our necks with a steel studded boot. We're unhappy because we were born and raised to want more. I wish I could set an exchange rate for my work hours.  $1000 dollars per hour. Im really tired of hearing about ISIS.  I think there are only two solutions.  Either we nuke the motherfuckers and turn the entire area into a wasteland, or, we completely pull out and let the arab countries police themselves/kill each other.  Enough already. I feel it on my lower back. It hurts like hell. How many bells can you get for one of those? That Nook has been hassling me for the loan money. fuck nigeria... merely a cutout nation established by european colonialism. it's time the people carved out their own nations: e.g. canada, usa, austrailia, italy/rome.

it's time the cream was allowed to rise. "Or we could go catch some gnarly waves" Between certain countries there a ethnic and cultural connection that transcend politics. The alliance between the US and Canada is much more than a cynical political arrangement. As a nation we all like them, and were our politicians to do something bad to them they would pay the price on election day. They are out friends in more than just a political sense. Same with the UK, NZ and Australia among other places. Were someone to mess with Canada severely enough the US would certainly go to war even if it were against its own monetary or political interests. Thats just an example, but it happens all the time in different nations Technocracy means its being run by a group of technical elites.

The correct word is constitutional and means the society is governed by a preset group of established principles. 
The US is a constitutional democratic republic, meaning we have a constitution that outlays basic rules of society and the policies for having people elect a set of representives to govern them day to day. The democratic part of that says the people vote. The republic part says we generally vote for people to govern us, rather than governing directly through voting. 

An authoritarian contsitional technocracy with a free press would be a society where an elite group of rulers do so with an iron fist. However, the their power would be limited by a constitution, which would likely also provide a methodology for replacing leaders. The government would likely be efficient and continually utilize modern technology to do so. And lastly free press meaning people can say what they want... If the constitution of this society is respected and provides procedures for removing individual technocrats from power, you get a pretty interesting system. Leaders are given a wide scope of control to take the society in whatever direction they see fit, but the people can still dissent and eventually peacefully organize to remove bad leaders. It's in interesting thought at the very least. A long, drawn out suicide that some people attach some sort of meaning to and glorify. 

Human beings are weird. I'm just a house painter/network nerd from Montreal, I really know little on these things, other than what i can read in places like this... but it seems like things are heating up, and the voices of reason aren't very loud at all... we might say, NATO has no obligation to defend Ukraine if things escalate, but we might also have said, just a year ago, that "no way in hell would modern Russia ever again try to enlarge it's borders using force, ever again. totally unimagineable!" But here we are, and it just makes me wonder, what if push comes to shove... I remember a TV documentary about stealth, in which they gave a surprising amount of information about how the stealth materials and coatings work. It seemed to be at the time that enough must be publically known that researchers could start investigating how to create and detect stealth more easily than I thought.

There could be developments in anti-radar missiles and technology which makes stealth still worth investing in, though. As a porn-watching wanker, I'm very offended by this statement and demand an immediate retraction and apology! Talk to Elon. Torturing people is not good. Blowing up innocents is not good. Selling weapons to people that blow up innocents is not good. Setting up coups of elected governments is not good. Spying on your own people is not good. Violating your own constitution is not good. Enabling foreign financial interests to loot your own country is not good. Marginalizing religious and ethnic minorities is not good. Hegemony in general is not good. War the old fashioned way?

Kill all the men, kill all the women above the age of 16, sell the rest into slavery, salt the earth.

That is war "the old fashioned way". France's air force also had a kill-loss ratio of 2.35 to 1. Everyone seems to forget that the Russians invaded Poland as well. When Germany invaded, the Polish retreated to the Romanian Bridgehead, as was planned. Then, the Russian armies slammed into the backs of the regrouping poles.

Another thing about France, it was luck. The German general's staff never expected to counquer France. They wanted to push the French over the River Somme, and claim the low countries as theirs. Expecting to lose 500k men in the process. Instead, the French had the wonderfully retarded Gamelin to lead them, who left his flank open. &gt; The rest of the world can't just capitulate and give Russia the thumbs up to take over whatever neighboring nation that they deem appealing on that day

Russia didn't take whatever neighboring nation, its incursion (like in Georgia) was limited. Was Russia right to do so, of course not, but neither was NATO expanding its military threat at Russia's border knowing it would put the region at risk. 

And when compared to US invasions, the Russian one is child's play, where are the sanctions against the US when it destroys countries? 

&gt; Russia is the only one pushing things closer to aggression,

So you're dismissing the last 30 years of NATO expansion as if it was not real. Source: He makes shit up It tried to touch the butt. This is whats probably going on in the background. I am sure there are designs left over from USSR break up. A country can only take so much bullying.  Pretty much, yeah.  I'll wikipedia that, then, thanks. it's not complicated at all to get a permit, it's made like that to define a schedule so that two speakers don't end up talking at the same time.   You are going about it the wrong way and in a non-understanding fashion. &gt; Empiricism might not have a "monopoly on truth," whatever you mean by that, but it's by the far the best thing we have - and since adopting it, we've built planes, gone to the moon, and figured out what humans are made of.

Obviously. My point is, there are regimes of truth or epistemic paradigms that don't rely on observation and sense data and cannot be said to be "wrong" because they don't produce practical, material outcomes. 

Two other quick points: 1) I would wager that the scientistic community greatly overestimates the number of religious literalists in the world; and 2) I would be careful when suggesting that theologians (with whom I'd couple with philosophers of religion and so on) haven't "proved" anything--particularly when the preconditions for "proof" vary so widely depending on one's epistemology and worldview. 

I'm really not interested in debates around proving or disproving the existence of a literal, high-in-the-sky, God. I'm an atheist, who's skeptical of religion but I also appreciative of nuance. 

I'm not drunk enough for this.  Real Hackers use Wikileaks

And Tor. If he really had something useful to say, he should have been smart enough to book it like Edward Snowden and upload discreetly. Its all Ogre now. You are an extremely generous individual...

I personally wouldn't even grant that abomination the dignity of being recognized as a graph...

 That dinosaur dun seen some sweet ass booty. Reallyyyyy Not sure what you're asking
 [*RT's Cross Talk* - Nuland's Kiev](http://rt.com/shows/crosstalk/227731-ukraine-mobilization-nuland-statement/) Filipino politicians are so fucking terrible, that jokes are all they are really good for, to be honest. Like the Mongols, they LEVELED many cities, killing millions of people and destroying SO MUCH HISTORY 55 areas in Sweden where the police do not go. I'm sure there are a number of variables that contribute to why Russia is the only one consistently called on this behavior, and it isn't just politics given the specificity and number of sources.  I'm betting it has to do with their altitude being in that commercial range, for example.  They've done similar things with their subs lately as well, though that is more of a military gaffe than threatening civilians though for obvious reasons.  I think in he sub cases they are just getting caught where they aren't supposed to be versus actively endangering people.   russian shit bomber  loves putin mouth almost big enough to take my dick I'm not saying that Russia doesn't have any moves left. What I am saying, though, is that Russia doesn't have the ability (aside from nuclear war) to cause a catastrophe for the United States. 

-They don't have enough cash to truly pull China or India away from us.

-They can't cut off gas to the EU without further destroying their own economy. They also can't stop selling the west their metals for the same reason. 

-They can't support Daesh. Or, doing so would be extremely short-sighted giving Russia's history with Islamic fanatics. 

-Just because Ukraine is not a full NATO member doesn't mean that the west wouldn't supply it with weapons and training, if for nothing else than to undermine Russia's plans.

-It wouldn't require a draft to send enough soldiers / weapons to Ukraine to hinder Putin's plans.

Here's how I see it playing out: Russia openly backs the "rebels" in Ukraine. NATO sends EU troops (with some US) financially backed largely by the USA. The USA covertly supports the Taliban and other Islamic sects in Chechnya in order to create another front for Russia. We watch Russia bleed out financially just like we have been since 2013... except they don't have the economic infrastructure to recover. 

TL;DR: Russia can cause us problems, but all this nonsense rhetoric about catastrophe is exactly that, nonsense. We know they won't use their nukes, and that's their only real threat, to the USA anyway.  what if the nato squadrons are already cruising along the russian borders? i know, if it is not in the media then it didnt happen, but still... A man circling my house is not normal.

Flying bombers and recon planes to keep in touch with your oppositions military capabilities is a norm.

 Cato Institute? Bullshit, over 40,000 riots and domestic disturbances occur each year in China. Your average glue eating redditor won't know this because he gets his news from heavily censored American sources.  That's a really fancy way of saying you can't argue.  That's tricky. It used to be really good, so much so that breakdowns made it to front page headlines. In recent years, breakdowns have gotten so common that they don't generate as much buzz as before, although people still take to the Internet to complain.

However, in absolute standards, I guess it's still pretty good. Definitely not the best in the world, especially if you compare it to other cities like Hong Kong or Taipei, but pretty darn decent. Services aren't 24/7, but you can travel from one end of the country to the other in about an hour or so reliably. Where the cruise ship launches in the bay they have a gated community with everything on it  They might even have a clash of clans in the shark week after that. he is a knecht tho No, it's Becky. Killed while waiting in line to get some food. Sad. Except they did, the quote is in the comments in here.  New Pokemon generation confirmed! Google Tsar Bomba...they don't need to start a nuclear war to annihilate Ukraine. This is the problem; we're more at-risk if Russia initiates an all-out conventional offensive in Ukraine, because plausible deniability still prevails. Sure, if Russia pops off a few tactical nukes, the cat's out of the bag. If they start utilizing huge conventional mass explosives, they can still fall back on the "we're not involved" narrative. I'm getting the popcorn out for this. Sure - that unfairness is a problem inherent to the legal code itself, which applies to everyone, that's all I meant.  If we want things to change - and I do - we need to change things at a very deep level.  The "throw the bums out" mentality doesn't go far enough, because the system will ensure that new bums rise to the top. &gt; 80 years ago, I highly doubt your average person knew that when "homosexuals" are mentioned in Paul's Letters to the Corinthians, it was due to a mistranslation (thanks to the King James Version). Now we know the correct translation are not references to homosexuals; but "sodomites". Sodomites were male prostitutes, which is a clear difference.

Well we've still got Leviticus to settle pretty decisively any discussion about where the Bible stands about homosexuality.

I feel like you're doing a lot of heavy lifting to make the Bible relevant - what would society lose if we lost the Bible?  Would the human truths (if there are any, I don't think there's much beyond the Golden rule) inside be any less relevant or lost?  Plenty of other philosophies and just basic social etiquette promote the finer points of the Bible without all the hooey added in as well.

The Bible's kind of like a nursery rhyme the infant human race never got over. Oh absolutely, I'm not arguing that. I just think the Cubans have a pretty legitimate point and that now that we are (theoretically) post-colonial, willingness to renegotiate would mean a lot. I also think they are asking for more than they actually expect to get. When you are negotiating, you shoot for extremes and settle on the middle. If you shoot for the middle, you get pulled to the opposite extreme. maybe if i could afford a comb by saving $4 on gold for myself with a shitty comment it's just something that's well know, all the sunni sources i've read make this distinction. it also have to do with location, Zaydi Shia almost exclusively reside in Yemen, in a very Sunni neighborhood, so that may have helped to moderate their views and keep it within the parameters of what's acceptable for Sunnis. Actually, Russia reports on NATO intelligence planes Because it's 1941 and the combined economies of most of the world aren't strong enough to put down an economy the size of Italys.  Well it is a pretty dark game overall but it does have a certain beauty of it. And there's always Anor Londo

[**Did NATO Promise Not to Enlarge? Gorbachev Says** "***No***"](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/11/06-nato-no-promise-enlarge-gorbachev-pifer) NIKO IT IS YOUR COUSIN, WANT TO GO BOWLING TOGETHER? It's because of shit like this that nobody takes the Human Rights Watch seriously.

 Ok, I don't disagree with your general idea, but now walk that back to the topic at hand. Tell me how two oblivious russian spies are going to pull that off. Gitmo naval base =\= Gitmo prison.
To imply they are the same thing is stupid. Canada, though it's barely relevant. apparently if you bury them with pigs they believe it's damning. Probably worth a try. Now, what would actually happen if you got accidentally swept into that mouth? That looks absolutely terrifying. Could you get out or are you  fucked? D: It looks like it's about to do hyperbeam Sargon of Akkad approves of this message. Genghis Khan says "That is how we roll in The Golden Horde" &gt;Do we regularly fly nuclear bombers towards Russian airspace?

That's because missiles have made bombers old news since the mid 1960s.  Reading before clicking?


I dig your style. Right, well we didn't just choose to make canada a friend. Often we are actually related to them, do business with them, work with them, play with them. All these connections matter. When you have millions of people within the US with connections to a nation you will become 'friends'. But it is not something you just choose. If the Kurds all sent their kids to college in the US and lots of them married Americans or opened business here, they would begin to develop interests with the US. That's how friends are made, not picking who you think is more moral. Insert mindless Russia pun regarding Vodka , rouble, invasion , Putin..watch up-votes go up. This happened in the Netherlands, not Belgium. Part of Belgium speaks Dutch/Flemish as a language. Dutch as an adjective usually means things related to the Netherlands.  Are you serious...this is a thing!? Wow, I'm a professional art rendering expert, and the rendering of him is stunning, and it paints him as a trio-poided dinosaurous. For you common folk, that means 3 legs.  Still international. Controlled only means their towers manage the traffic.  Well...everything except salting the earth. Salt used to be expensive.  How can you estimate a confirmed number of encounters? Megamouth hahaha

That's my girlfriend's name! Huge suck of resources.  PR can't get  ahead when tied to the  dollar.  Kinda like Greece and EU. Is ISIS a nation state? Is it a signatory of the Geneva Conventions?  Both counts appear to be no. I'd say it didn't go well if that shit actually happened. Why? Dead people don't care that they're dead. They don't exist to care; they feel nothing. Even the absence of happiness means nothing to the dead. &gt;[2006 Lebanon War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War)

&gt;Due to these pressures, on 11 October, Admoni was replaced by retired justice Eliyahu Winograd as chair of the political probe, and the probe itself was elevated to the status of governmental commission with near-state commission mandate: the Winograd Commission. On 12 September, **former defense minister Moshe Arens spoke of "the defeat of Israel"** in calling for a state committee of inquiry. He said that **Israel had lost "to a very small group of people, 5,000 Hezbollah fighters,** which should have been no match at all for the IDF", and stated that the conflict could have "some very fateful consequences for the future." Disclosing his intent to shortly resign, Ilan Harari, the IDF's chief education officer, stated at a conference of senior IDF officers that **Israel lost the war,** becoming the first senior active duty officer to publicly state such an opinion The situation is much deeper and needs to be explained more thoughtfully than I am capable of. &gt; The crucial thing is that these are young men, principally young men who are growing up without much sense of success in their lives, without a feeling that the world holds much for them and  their problems need addressing in all sorts of ways.

This is a good point because it points to socioeconomic issues as well. As long as there is corruption, extreme poverty and suffering in any country, extremism and fundamentalism will flourish. This is a pretty well known fact in history.

Bad ideas are to blame as well of course, and I agree that Islam contains many bad ideas.

But if we want to create a peace in the middle east the solution will have to include working towards peace, prosperity for the population and education. Then they will figure it out themselves. That is why sanctions against Iran are just the wrong way to go about it because it makes the population suffer and rally behind whatever regime and create extremism. It's capturing the article title and no alter being made. Majid Majidi is a great filmmaker, and everyone should watch *The Color of Paradise* and *Children of Heaven* if they can. However, I have my doubts that a movie can work if it never shows its main character. SR-71 never flew over Russia. The U-2 stopped when they shot down Gary Power That feeling when the only self-aware characters in the lion king were probably Timon and Pumbaa and possible the Gilbert Gottfried bird And I agree, but having known and even worked with 40 or so cops I can say that they get accused of excessive use of force much more often than actually happens. Between what I've seen with my own eyes, the stories of heard, and how many times news agencies have been caught manipulating pictures, video, and eyewitness reports... I have huge doubts that it happens as often as it's made out to be. Hell, the whole Michael Brown thing was started because some people made claims that they later rebuked.  To "keep an edge", don't they need to have it to begin with? Very cool. But very sad a zoologist has to think ignorance of other species might actually be best, because as soon as word spreads humans set out to capture, kill and destroy every trace of them... Since they are really old, you can only assume the creator was rather young.  I agree. Russia is going to keep posturing and yelling. Sending bombers into airspace, and making NATO scramble jets. Same old bullshit that they did in the cold war.

It's just that we aren't as excitable this time, because we know they won't use the nukes. Putin's not insane like the Soviet leadership, he wants to enjoy his billions, not spend the rest of his life in a bunker under a scorched earth. 

I say the best response would be to treat him like a child, send him to his room (sanctions) and ignore him until he tires himself out (utterly destroys his own economy).   They stated on national Israeli tv that they were in the US to record the event.   &gt;They have their own "military"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Forces_(Ireland)

Under 10,000 personnel &gt; Didn't we pretty much do this constantly with the SR-71 and the U2 for a few decades?

Actually, we did it with B52's starting with Operation Head Start. The SR-71 and U2 are/were reconnaissance craft. "We see you" isn't as threatening as  "We're almost here." this 'defensive, not offensive' bullshit is for sheeple. calling it a 'shield' is the same type of bullshitting. ultimately this 'defensive shield' is a missile system and a missile can be launched both at an enemy's missile (defensive) or at an enemy's kremlin (offensive) They have been helping FSA, not Nusra with medical care as well as civilians.  Well then get drunk, stranger You mean that thing we didn't follow for a decade at Guantanamo? Oh, your dad fought in the Bosnian war... I see now why you are a Russian apologist. You are probably one of the Orthodox Serb militia members just waiting for orders from the Kremlin. How can you expect Western law to apply to people who have their own justice system? We are assuming our way of going about things is superior than theirs. It may be a better system for us given our previous history, but if the middle eastern countries aren't "up to date" with how to govern themselves, shouldn't we just let them flesh it out amongst themselves? We have been doing a terrible job in that regard. Yes, and if Russia wants to do these tests, the least they can do is to have their transponders on, so that commercial traffic can be aware and divert if needed.

They don't have the transponders on though. One time they will accidentally crash a bomber into a commercial airliner. They were close many times with the Swedish commercial aircraft. There's a goat joke in there, but this is not a light-hearted situation... Not entirely no, there are many different kinds of environments.  As a rule, though, it is usually a bit gloomy. True, Afghanistan was about rare earth metals, not oil. Russia already had a thing called winter to take care of that problem.

China probably has the smartest nuclear policy.  They have around 60 ICBMs and another 24 SLBMs.   That is a fairly small arsenal, but it is enough to ensure that nobody can threaten them with nukes without the assurance of retaliation.  Yet by having a small force then don't have to spend the vast sums of money to build up the thousands of missiles in the US and Russian arsenal.   They build just enough nukes to be sure that nobody would use nukes on China, but not so many that it broke the bank.    [Cato Institute](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/cato-institute) U mist have a mega one. Business will drive this to the last marginal penny, then turn around and ask why govt didn't stop them with a straight face.  They  actually may be right, as they just give what the consumer wants, including that hoarder.  Consumers need to start rewarding green businesses as we can't live nekkid like in Africa (which isn't doing too well, anyways).  Vote with yer wallets  I believe that Goku was real and he sacrificed his life to protect the universe multiple times. If you had something important to leak, give it to Wikileaks for gods sake. Don't go to the media with a fake gun and get thrown in the slammer before you can say a word. the crazies always claim they won the war, but we all know who will win and who actually won Bankrupt and out of the Euro in March. They are fast tracking their entry into the 3rd world. http://vimeo.com/116362347 To be fair I don't even care who wins the rhetorical war here anymore. I had my fill of innocent lives to realise it was (and never is) worth it. Its always the cunts in designer suits that benefit and never the every day people... If it's Russia that has to default before thing normalise, I am happy with that. If its another but peaceful maidan, I am happy. If it is Cameron or biden that are showed up as clowns, all good! I don't want to kill 100 innocents to get one bad guy... or even ten. One to one I could accept as long as I didn't know them. 
  
It is pretty clear from all the intel that most.people we pput in gitmo did ot belong there. Then after years of torture, we let.them go and we find them often radicalised..  funny that.

Youre comparing a mentally ill person to a religion all those terrorists use to validate their actions.

Collective ideology vs Personal ideology
 If you repeat this enough times, maybe it will become true in your fantasy world.   I made this point to a friend the other day: people spend billions per year on video games which are completely fictional, yet bring meaning to people's lives. Religion does the same thing. It's not *that* far fetched to believe that people are drawn to, essentially, hobbies that make life seem worth living. They did tag one off the coast of California which is how they showed they go deep in the day and up at night.  However, they have extremely soft skin so you would need a really good tracker. 

&gt;In 1990, a 4.9-m (16-foot) male megamouth shark was caught near the surface off Dana Point, California. This individual was eventually released with a small radio tag attached to its soft body. The tag relayed depth and time information over a two-day period. During the day, the shark swam at a depth of around 120160 m (400525 ft), but as the sun set, it would ascend and spend the night at depths of between 12 and 25 m (3980 ft). Both day and night, its progress was very slow at around 1.52.1 km/h (11.3 mph). This pattern of vertical migration is seen in many marine animals as they track the movement of plankton in the water column.[5] The shark captured in March 2009 was reportedly netted at a depth of 200 m (660 ft).

Wikipedia yo. HIYAAAAAAH!! What a joke US has become. How's it goin? The darkness is coming You hardly doubt they don't? That means they do no? English - do you speak it!!!!!! Dismantled? More like a decepticon transforming.  "Oh, we're not a giant robot with lasers anymore, we're just a giant tank with lasers." It's ISIS, I'm not sure they qualify. lol u dum &gt;Iran didn't give a fuck, using the kurds was just a way for them to inconvenience Iraq

Such is the nature of proxy warfare.  &gt;It's sad how many living artifacts of the past are destroyed in wars.

They weren't at war, they were the ruling power in Afghanistan at the time. It was destroyed in relative peace. The same thing has been done in Saudi Arabia, systematic destruction of all historic by the government due to their particular religious beliefs.  All things both stupid and not stupid should be known. I'm sorry that you're so butt sore that an Israeli publications published something that paints Arabs in a negative light. An Israeli publications is more likely to publish negative things about Arabs just like a Arab publications would be more likely to publish negative things about Israel. Its the media bro and they're all bias no matter what side. Reddit doesn't hate athiests, stop victimizing yourself. Reddit hates outspoken, know-it-all assholes who can't seem to get over their own petty biases. Some athiests happen to fit that description pretty well. &gt; I don't think they were Behind 9/11, I think they were off to the side.

I don't think you're insane, [I think you're just really misinformed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theories#Israel)

&gt;  On March 15, 2002, The Forward claimed that the FBI had concluded that the van's driver, Paul Kurzberg, and his brother Sivan, were indeed Mossad operatives, who were in America "spying on local Arabs".[62] ABC news cited this report on June 21, 2002, adding that the FBI had concluded that the five Israelis had no foreknowledge of the attacks.

&gt;  In 2002 several officials dismissed reports of a spy ring and said the allegations were made by a Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was angry that his theories had been dismissed. Oh dear! Someone made a not to do specificay this? That's hilarious! Not every city will be able to provide the same level of benefits and housing. So, if every city did this, it will soon be clear that some where in the nation you can get better housing than others, and so more homeless people will try to get to those cities (by foot, hitchhiking, w/e), creating bigger burdens for those cities than for others. You end up having people of one city paying more tax money to support the homeless, and some other city paying nearly nothing for that.

Another problem after that would be government realizing that it's better to keep the benefit at the basic minimum to make sure the burden on the city is fair and advantageous even. This will involve a lot of legislation and political argument back and forth, eventually delaying the process of offering the benefit. It's likely that in the end they just end up with very shitty housing, very much like homeless shelters we already have today.

It's much easier to have a policy within a smaller geographic region with limited people, but exponentially more difficult when you involve hundreds of millions of people across an entire nation. Well that's a ridiculous binary dichotomy. The world does not exist in solely black and white. ISIS doesn't hold onto territory. Wherever they did (Homs, Qalamoun, etc.), they were soundly beaten by Hezbollah. 

Israel on the other hand is a fixed entity and has much to lose from rockets etc. You have to remember this isn't a war between large armies of two countries. Gorilla warfare has very different dynamics and ground rules, which would always favor Hezbollah.
 Yeah the submarine, the Russians are getting restless. The answer here is simple. 
We give them what they want. Give them the area between Syria and Iraq for their caliphate. Act all friendly. "Legitimize" their government and have the UN help set everything up, while moving out anyone who doesn't want to be involved. Help them fence it in, set up borders with controlled access. Announce that the multinational coalition will pay and transport anyone in the world who wishes to live this way to the new "mecca". Let them think they now have a solid base to operate legally from as a new nation. 
2-3 years later, after all the extremists have flocked to it, and the innocents have been moved out -

Bright white flash, nuclear glass in the desert. Okay: I need an IV drip, medical tubing, a syringe, and a bottle of Spirytus.  That's the first thing I thought also. 

Damn it, Internet.  A smart person would anonymously upload to Wikileaks and move on with his life.

A dumb person would stick up a news center with a fake gun, and fail to say a word before he gets dumped in the slammer. False allegations have nothing to do with intelligence and everything to do with finding a convenient scapegoat that was already pre-meditated. Civilian aircraft don't have radar, not for collision avoidance at any rate... It's what europe wanted. Apparently gender equality and liberty are second to oppressive 7th century misogyny. as the easier oil dries up, production will get more expensive/fall.  also, around 20% of demand is for things like plastics ect.  That demand will either have to be replaced either by biomass (which can be very expensive to modify sufficiently) or oil.  I don't see demand for plastic slowing at all.

No, I think oil prices will rise.  I wouldn't be surprised to see $150-200 oil at some point.  A fluctuation of a few million barrels can double or halve prices. So I heard you like megamouth mudkips Some homeless people like being homeless. They don't care about gestures of goodwill and leech off society. 

*BUT* a good many *OTHERS* feel like they've been given up on and long for something better. They want the world to prove it cares. And these acts of kindness give them the drive to carry on. 
They are people after all.  China's government is mostly successful because they have successfully gone from a pre-indistrial economy to having one rivaling the US's in about 20 years. There is definitely some innate value to liberty, but if people have to choose between not being in poverty and personal liberty, they will choose the food every time. wtf Real stand up guys! definitely not terrorists!

Mcain just had dinner with them last night...  Fuck Islam. Leaving the bunker secretly, so brave. &gt; It is; however, easy to defend yourself from such attacks through discussion

I disagree. Usually, the person making those broad generalizations doesn't want to discuss it and will deliberately avoid debate in favor of insults and attacks.

Everyone _believes_ in different things. The problem is when those beliefs become unchallengeable dogma and when the believers push it on everyone else. The reason many persons distance themselves from the labels "atheism" and "atheist" is because of dogmatic persons like Dawkins and Harris and Maher, who treat all "theists" as ignorant little children and _won't_ debate it

It's not at all easy to defend yourself in that climate, any more than it is or was easy to defend yourself from Christians or Jews or Muslims or whoever, when they decry you as a heathen or a blasphemer or a heretic. They didn't want to debate it -- they knew the truth and if you didn't accept it, the punishments ran from social exclusion to physical violence. This is some 1984 level newspeak right here. Kudos to you, you demented bastard. Eh, Ukraine thought the same thing, until Russia annexed Crimea.

So yes, Russia is in the 'taking land from foreign nations' phase at the moment.

Being on the defense is a legitimate response to these unprovoked acts of aggression. Yup: [84% of Palestinians Believe Israel Behind Charlie Hebdo](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/190465#.VMX8rC6KJ9s) The Russian ruble is worthless -- the only thing you can buy with it is gas and oil, or space launch  vehicles.

http://imgur.com/b95DRRY I would, at the very least, expect them not launch monthly millitary operations encroaching on my non-nato member country's capital, Stockholm. Russia has repeatedly violated the spirit of the VSB peace treaty that Soviet signed with Finland, which has had a strong infulence in keeping Sweden and Finland out of Nato. It is clearly that the oligarchy in Kremlin is longer intrested in the status-quo, also known as peace and stability. The upscaling of Nato operations and deployments in eastern Europe is a direct respons to the new idea of non-linear warfare Russia has adopted. Somebody commented on an article yesterday (I can't link it), but they basically said words to the effect of "The government keeps the army in a state of disarray to reduce the chances of a military coup, which is just about always just around the corner".   It was obviously more detailed than that, but you get the gist... Yes, but that was around half-a-century ago during the height of the Cold War. I expect them to respect sovereign borders, not mess in their neighbours business, and not invade a nation simply because that nation does not want to be associated with them anymore.  I guess that's too much to ask though  What the fucking fuck?

My continent is such a clusterfuck. This shit is depressing.  I guess the cognate of fhig would be vaardig (able, skillful) in Dutch, so we use a different suffix. vatbaar means "feasible", I don't know the German cognate.

So they THEN classified all future research? 

If things don't work, they take it from classified to declassified.. they don't usually make it secret AFTER.

&gt; The project's initial success led to it becoming classified and no more details of how it developed after 1993 are available.

Nothing says 'going nowhere' like desiring no more information be released about the tech since 1993.... You're bringing up an example of a bomber flying over disputed territory. Last time I checked, the coast of Ireland isn't disputed territory. Evidence? I have yet to see a single shred of evidence of US involvement with Maidan outside of diplomatic/verbal support. No financial or other support. For it to be fair they would have to give up a different but equally useful piece of land.  hi i am america, what is a ukraine?  So you are saying that Israel, a country that according to its own Prime Minister faces constant existential threats, selects "crazies" to become Minister of Defense.

Take your time to deal with that cognitive dissonance before bothering to reply.

Saying this automatically makes you lose credibility. How is it uneven, though?

You have missles poised in a location that can hit my heartland without time for reaction - now we do too.

If they had done the political "savvy" thing like we did with turkey, with it being an announced process and very publicly known - we would have totally locked down the waters around Cuba and made it impossible for them to get into even strategic footing, in their eyes.

I mean; fuck everyone in this circumstance.. But is it surprising they viewed sneaking these missles in as a reasonable response?  We may have interpreted it as being a prep for a surprise attack; it could just as well have been the Russians doing their best to even the playing field - and announcing it wouldn't have allowed them to make the shipment at all.

It wasn't hard for us to put missiles in Europe and turkey cause they were our allies - much more difficult to pull off the stunt of getting them to Cuba and being "open" about it, as we were with the missiles going in turkey  Iron dome makes rocket attacks futile, Hezbollah will huff and puff as much as they want with that. the second their fighters live the bunkers they will be annihilated. Reason is better not piss off russia or they will do some bombers show off. It costs money. &gt;  lie in contracts

Contracts aren't considered speech.  They're legal obligations that exist regardless of the medium they're communicated in.  The restrictions are on the agreement, not how its communicated. Its from article, not from rebels. Besides the article does not mention anything about mortars. Putin really is playing with fire. Perhaps if he focused on working with the West things might improve in Russia also... Just a thought?
