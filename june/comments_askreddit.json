One of the people in the house was a hot chick and so he banged her and then a day or two later went on his way. \n\nHowever, every road he went on away from the house brought him BACK to the house, and every time he got back to the house the people wouldn't remember him.

A lot of people have suggested it. I BELIEVE there was some sort of ghost thing that happened (spoiler alert, but it's looking more and more like I imagined this all anyway).   \n\n*  There weren't any major celebrities in it that I can remember. I think it was a European film though so there may have been some European stars in it that' I'm not familiar with.\n\n* I remember it being really long. It was a cool movie but after the 6th or so time of him ending up at this house we were like, \"REALLY?! AGAIN?!\" so it wasn't a TV show. \n\n* I believe it took place in the past, like the 30s. \n\n**MOVIES PEOPLE HAVE GUESS THAT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT:** \nThe Dreamers, The Others, Tales of the Unexpected, Cemetery Man, Somewhere in Time, The Legacy, Killing Zoe, The Tenant, Novo", "gilded": 0, "score": 1623, "created": 1433218278.0},{"body": "Hope [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_featuring_time_loops) helps.

Add keywords if your friend had some defining characteristic, a physical disability, an obscure injury, some great skill, anything that might pop up.   \n3. Social Media. Go to every site that uses \"real names\" (Facebook, G+, and linkedin are good starters) and search for your friend there.  \n4.

Here's a bit of a back story about this duck (some info I've posted before, some is new):\n\nIn 1977, a toy company called Knickerbocker created a new toy called [Ernie's Rubber Duckie](http://i.imgur.com/sFrVREs.jpg).  Designed by famous toy inventor [Henry Orenstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Orenstein) (patent [USD260915](http://www.google.com/patents/USD260915)), this toy would lay the foundation for one of the most iconic rubber ducks in history.  In 1983, Knickerbocker was sold to Hasbro; which produced more of the ducks around 1985 through [Playskool](http://i.imgur.com/I4HZiLq.jpg).  Around that time, a Taiwanese factory got a hold of this toy and started creating [generic knockoffs of it](http://i.imgur.com/F5knoAj.jpg).  By 1992, Playskool discontinued production of their rubber duck, but the Taiwanese factory continued on.  Every few years, this anonymous factory produced replicas which would appear in toy stores across the United States.\n\nRemember [this stock photo](http://i.imgur.com/8CliVBH.jpg)?  It appeared in everything from Photoshop tutorials to the default Windows user account profile picture.  Some were even [used in an experiment to test the pollution caused by different kinds of jet ski engines](http://i.imgur.com/dHJvPYB.jpg).  Those particular ducks are now [mounted on the desk of politician Mark DeSaulnier, D-Calif](http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/rep-mark-desaulnier-d-calif-keeps-a-bottle-of-california-news-photo/465167140).  The last time I ever saw them was in a World Market around 2008 [(video evidence from 2005)](http://vimeo.com/28158).\n\nIf you have one of these, feel free to check the bottom and I guarantee you'll find the \"Made in Taiwan\".  They seem to all come from one source, yet I have never been able to track them down.  My dream is to some day discover where they're made and start my own store for them.\n\nEdit: I want to thank all the people who have tried looking for me!  Unfortunately, the search goes on.

You send it to someone directly, and due to many physical constraints, errors can happen, and they happen at a rate of 1%. Roughly 10 bits will be erroneous when the recipient gets your text. A 1000-bit long text is basically 125 characters long (a tweet). That means that you can have roughly 10 wrong characters out of the 125 you had in the beginning. That's bad. You don't want that. So instead, you encode them into 1500 bits with the property that you can decode with no error as long as less than 50 errors occur. Roughly 15 errors occur every time (because the error rate is 1% and you send 1500 bits). Therefore, you can recover your text with no error. That's what Error Correcting Codes are for.\n\nAnyways, back in the 1990, the scientific community that works on Error Correcting Codes basically considered that they had developed the best codes and that these could not really be beaten. They had graphs that showed the \"theoretical\" bound to how good these codes could be (in terms of how much more bits you need to send to provide a certain amount of protection to your message), and the performance of many codes, and all the best codes they had seemed to converge to a second \"practical\" limit, below the theoretical one.\n\nAnd this guy, with an education in electronics, not really known in the coding community at all, publishes this paper that is a bit too foreign to gauge without doing a lot of simulations. And he claims that he beat every other code by a relatively large margin, and approaches the actual theoretical limit. Many experts didn't even discuss the paper because of how strongly they believed it was impossible. And yet, every single standard in telecommunication since the early 2000s uses either that guy's codes (called Turbo Codes), or LDPC codes that use the same kind of principles in their decoders.\n\nIt's probably just me, knowing the guy and the field, but I really like that story.", "gilded": 1, "score": 224, "created": 1434600713.0},{"body": "I was taught in college in the 90s that glass was a liquid.

It did not\n\nTrue story coming up.\n\nIn 1994, my family regularly attended a church in  Minnesota. One day, they had a guest speaker. He claimed he was a prophet. His name was Dimitri Duduman. I'll never forget that name because it's Dimitri Duduman. Pronounced \"Doo-doo-man\".\n\nAnyway, Duduman showed us a segment of the New Testament he had decoded. And he was alarmed to learn that the end of the world would commence in the year 1996.\n\nHe had proof. Word choice that relate to old Hebrew numbers, and so on.\n\nHere's one specific. The book of revelations (Written by the Apostle John) mentions a vision of a mountain being cast into the sea and giant black locusts with faces of men. According to Duduman, what John was seeing was nuclear war. When you detonate a nuclear warhead underwater, it creates a big mountain-shaped explosion. John saw this and described it the best way he could. And the locusts with man-faces? These were noisy black helicopters,  and the man-faces were simply the faces of the pilots inside the aircraft. Again, John wouldn't know what a helicopter was, so if he saw one in a vision, he would probably describe it as a giant black locust with a man's face. \n\nThese are just two of the things Duduman determined and shared with us. He gave us pamphlets with a map of the USA, and several mushroom clouds lining the coasts, indicating where nuclear missles would blow up as the tribulation commenced, initiating the apocalypse. \n\nFor those who dont know, the tribulation is 7 years of agony and suffering during which you will wish for death and God won't allow you to die because you gotta suffer through it. The good people are magically teleported to Heaven before the tribulation in an event known as the Catching Up of the Ecclesia, more commonly called \"The Rapture\".\n\nWe lived in rural minnesota, living off the land. We raised animals, grew crops and we were home-schooled because President Clinton was gonna to order Martial Law and take children from their parents to be re-educated. So we lived in hiding.\n\nI lived in constant fear.\n\nOne day, when I was 10, I woke up late. I went downstairs and my parents were gone. So was my brother. I was all alone in my house. I ran outside, screaming hysterically. I fell to my face and begged God to kill me so I didnt have to suffer through the tribulation. I didn't care if I had to go to Hell,  I just didn't want to experience the tribualtion alone. \n\nI heard a vehicle coming down our long, rural driveway. I ran inside and ran upstairs and locked my door. It must be government agents. They were here to take me. I'm still begging God to kill me. I consider jumping from my second story bedroom window to run away, but I'm too scared. I wish I had grabbed my shotgun (yes, 10year old me had a 20 gauge).\n\nThe front door opens and someone comes in... I'm quietly and frantically begging God for death. I slide my window open, knowing I won't die if I jump, but I'll probably break my legs.\n\nAnd then...\n\n\"Hey, [xxxx](enter my real name here)!!\" My mom's voice calls out, \"We had to go Mr. Benson's today to buy some beef.  Come help us carry it in!\" (We bought beef in half-cows).\n\nIt was my mom and family. I almost jumped. I begged for death. I thought I was done for. I would've shot them on accident if I had my gun. And it was just my mom.\n\nAfter that, I'd wake up all night every hour or so and I'd run into my mom's room to make sure she was still there.\n\nSo that's my entry. Thats what we believed in 1994-95 that turned out to be bullshit. \n\nIn 1997, my brother and I left my mom to move in with my drug-addled father. \n\nI'm still not sure if that was the right choice. I suppose it was. My dad is awesome, even though he likes drugs a lot. At least he loves us more than anything. More than God, more than meth, more than anything.

His name was Leo Major.\n\n\nMajor started his overseas tour in 1941, serving in Le Regiment de la Chaudiere. On D-Day, he was wounded by a grenade, resulting in the partial loss of vision in his left eye. Major refused to be sent home, arguing that he only needed one good eye to sight a rifle. He was placed in the scout platoon and became handy with his rifle, earning himself a reputation as an excellent sniper.\n\nIn April 1945, Major\u2019s regiment was approaching the city of Zwolle.  His commanding officers asked for two volunteers to do a reconnaissance run and report on the  number of German troops patrolling the city. If possible, the volunteers were also asked to get in contact with the Dutch resistance as the Chaudiere regiment was to start firing on the city the next day. At the time, Zwolle had a population of around 50,000 people and it was likely that innocent civilians would number among the casualties.\n\nAlong with his friend Willy Arseneault, Major started to creep toward the city. Willy was killed by German soldiers around midnight after the pair ran across a roadblock. Reportedly, Willy was able to kill his attacker before dying himself. Understandably angry, Major picked up his friend\u2019s machine gun and ran at the enemy, killing two of the remaining German soldiers; the rest fled in a vehicle.\n\nMajor continued on and soon ambushed a staff vehicle and captured the German driver who he had lead him to an officer drinking in a nearby tavern. He informed the officer that Canadian forces would begin firing heavy artillery on the city, resulting in the deaths of many German soldiers and Zwolle civilians alike. He didn\u2019t mention that he was alone.\n\nAfterwards, Major gave the man his gun back and, with that seed of knowledge soon to be spread throughout the German troops, he immediately began running up and down the streets shooting a machine gun and tossing grenades. The grenades made a lot of noise, but he made sure to place them where they wouldn\u2019t cause much damage to the town or its citizens.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, he stumbled upon a group of eight soldiers. Though they pulled a gun on him, he killed four and caused the rest to flee. Major himself escaped the confrontation without injury and only one regret: he later stated he felt he should have killed all of them.\n\nAs he continued his campaign of terror throughout the night, the German soldiers began to panic, thinking a large body of Canadian forces were attacking them.  By 4 a.m., the Germans had vanished. An entire garrison\u2014estimated to have been made up of several hundred soldiers\u2014had been made so afraid of nothing more than a single, one-eyed man that they fled the town. The city of Zwolle had been liberated without the need for the death of civilians or many of the soldiers on both sides of the lines that would have taken part in the messy battle.\n\nRather than fall asleep after running around the city in the wee hours of morning avoiding German gunfire and causing all kinds of mayhem, Major enlisted the help of several Dutch civilians to retrieve the body of his friend Willy. Only after his friend\u2019s body had been recovered did Major report to his commanding officer that there was \u201cno enemy\u201d in the city. The Canadian army marched in to the sound of cheers rather than gun shots. For his actions at Zwolle, Major received a Distinguished Conduct Medal.\n\nThat's only one of his heroics.

If Japanese folklore was strong before the Tokugawa shogunate, then the 200+ years that followed acted as a fermenting chamber.\n\nIt certainly wasn't perfect, especially if you weren't part of the samurai caste; the warriors of generations old became more of a symbolic power, and in many cases they became bureaucrats and lawmakers, with only the younger samurai becoming retainers to their feudal lords.

They had a spy plane fly over where they *knew* the ship would be, *then* they sunk it. So the crew are all like \"oh shit we got spotted.\" They also had to hide the broken codes from their own soldiers, lest they be revealed under careless talk. So they sent out other spy planes knowing nothing would be found, so crews wouldn't wonder how mission found an enemy every time. \n\nThey would *never* attack until they had a \"cover story\". Men undoubtedly died, by attacks the government knew were coming, because they would not compromise Ultra. \n\nOne of the few times they were forced to sink ships immediately, they covered it by sending a message in a code they knew the Germans had broken, to a spy in Naples, congratulating him of his success. The spy didn't exist, but the Germans intercepted the message and assumed everything was still good with Enigma. \n\nThe best part is, they didn't even reveal Ultra after the war. They saw to it that the Enigma machines were sold to potential enemies in the Third World, who continued to use the broken codes for years. Ultra wasn't revealed in its full extent until 1974, 29 years after the war. Never has a secret of such massive importance been so well kept for so long.

There he understood that the Jedi had lost their way. \n\nWhen Yoda taught Luke to use the force, he taught him to use emotion, something the old Jedi order would never consider.\n\nThen Vader kills Obi-wan. Obi-wan knew what would happen and he told Vader. Anakin or Vader may not have known what Obi-wan meant exactly, but he knew he wasn't telling a lie when he said he would become more powerful. So Anakin did what he had been doing and allowed Lord Vader to take over, the man who wanted revenge for the death of his wife. \n\nIn the killing of Obi-wan, he sealed the fate of the deathstar and promised his son a mentor to watch over him, even if he had no idea he had done so. At the very least, Anakin knew deep down that he was helping the Jedi when he killed Obi-wan.\n\nThen he confronts Luke at the finish. He is the dark side of the force genuinely and flawlessly. He is the villain of villains, more so than Sidious.\n\nHe is defeated. Vader cannot stand up to Luke. The light side is gone and that is what Vader had come to prey on. He ended it with Obi-wan (partially) and facing Luke was a new enemy he had never known. It was one Vader could not hate.\n\nAnakin could no longer hide behind Vader. He could no longer be the villain without a foe, plus, Luke was his kid. So he made his return. \n\nAnakin killed Vader when he killed Sidious. He brought balance to the light with his downfall via Yoda, Obi-wan, and Luke. He brought balance to the dark with Vader. He pushed both sides of the force to their extremes with his actions.\n\n\"Killing\"/himself was the final act. He made sure that both Vader and Anakin were dead. One was dark and one was light, but bringing balance to the force does not mean being in balance with the force. \n\nAnakin/Vader is the tragic hero of the two trilogies. Period.\n\nEDIT: alot of people are saying I'm giving Lucas too much credit. I'm going to disagree (unpopular, I know).\n\nLucas was really good at story telling in that he created a really good story. I just think he failed horribly at the \" telling\" part.

What made Anakin unqiue (among other things) was that he had walked both sides of the force but never turned his back entirely on either side.
