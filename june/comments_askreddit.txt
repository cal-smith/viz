There was a YouTube comedy series, I think it was called "Networked" that had these two guys named Michael. I remember it being out right around 2006-2008, and it was really funny, similar humor to the Office. But searching through YouTube and Google comes up with nothing because the only thing I remember are Networked and Michael... I know I've seen the guys in other stuff but they're "that guys" and their IMDB pages don't have anything close to what I'm looking for. 

**Edit: mystery solved! It was Net_Work, not Networked. I was so close this whole time!** Net_Work, starring Michael Torpey?

It used to play on Cracked.com back in the day. Fuck yes! That's it I was waaaay off ~~Networked~~ Net_Work! Thanks man, you've finally itched something that's been scratching my brain for a while. I owe you some G.O.R.P. Good old retarded porn?!  This painting of a tiny guy walking through a valley made of huge menacing statues/beings?

Could this be it? The other replies have some info on the artist.  HOLY SHIT THANK YOU Zdzislaw Beksinski I believe is the artist. Wow I have like a 5% chance of saying that correctly  COLESLAW BARTSHMOSBY

EDIT: I'm thrilled my comment has sparked so many people's interest in watching/re-watching this movie! It is my personal favorite Disney movie and, I think, one of the most vastly underappreciated movies of all time. Here's [a review of it](http://antagonie.blogspot.com/2009/12/disney-animation-whatever-their-pitch.html?m=1) by my absolutely favorite film critic on the Internet. Beksinski is the name of the artist. A comedy sketch video where Clark Kent is an idiot and everyone just pretends that they don't know he's Superman because they feel bad for him. Oh man I've totally seen this hold on

Edit: [Found it] (http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/clark-kent/2861360)  When I press play there's a woman's voice saying THIS CONTENT IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE That's the one! Thanks! Also [this](http://redbloodedamerica.tumblr.com/post/31475272836/it-all-makes-sense-now) An animated short of Pinocchio, where he never turns to a real boy but spends his life as a wooden toy, but people around him treat his as real. He eventually becomes a great psychologist but it's replaced by a robot. 70's style animation. Seen late at night.
Edit: found it!!! Thank you kind stranger! Been 15 years looking for it.
https://www.nfb.ca/film/spinnolio is it [Pinocchio the Series?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD8J5hmx3Z0) Don't know if that's what the other poster was looking for but I've been looking for this myself! A children's horror stories book that is not the Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.   
It is illustrated,  has a short version of Sleepy Hollow, a poem that goes "as I was walking up the stairs I met a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today, oh how I wish he'd go away. "


There Is also a large two page picture of a deal in the fire light v with a dead man's hand and spilled ink and quill. 


It's hard cover and kind of big. 

Edit:

IT'S MOSTLY GHOSTLY BY STEVEN ZORN!!! HOLY FUCK I LOVE YOU ALL SO HARD RIGHT NOW! !! 16 YEARS AND I FINALY FOUND IT !!! Theoretical Gold for everyone! ! &gt; as I was walking up the stairs I met a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today, oh how I wish he'd go away

Wikipedia has a list of literature where that poem is featured! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigonish_%28poem%29 maybe it's on there? Is there a short story in itabout some girl who wears a ribbon on her neck to keep her head attached? Your thinking of [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/In_a_Dark,_Dark_Room_and_Other_Scary_Stories.jpg). Just want to bring to light /r/tipofmytongue. It's a subreddit dedicated to remembering books, shows, videos, songs that you *just* escapes your memory. 

Always nice to see how ecstatic all the OPs are when their mysteries are solved.  Also /r/tipofmypenis. For all your forgotten porn needs.  However /r/tipofmypenis is mostly full of requests with not many answers I find  So tipofmypenis leaves a lot unsatisfied?

Edit: thank you for the gold reddit stranger!  You have a way of always leaving me satisifed :) /r/tipofmyjoystick I thought I recalled a subreddit for that, but I just couldn't remember the name - Thanks! The name of a movie I saw at a sleepover when I was probably 8 or 9. For some reason my friend's mom kept renting this movie for her completely unaware it was full of sex and nudity. 

Basically it was a thriller about this guy who was either English or American, I can't remember which, who was visiting France (I think?) and for whatever reason stopped at this one big house and stayed with these strangers for a bit. One of the people in the house was a hot chick and so he banged her and then a day or two later went on his way. 

However, every road he went on away from the house brought him BACK to the house, and every time he got back to the house the people wouldn't remember him. This happened over and over. It was basically like a dramatic European version of groundhog day. 

I've tried seaching for this movie basically since I started using the internet and I have no idea what it was called. I'm starting to think I dreamed the whole thing.

**EDITED TO ADD A FEW MORE DETAILS:** 

* I would have watched this movie around 1994/1995, it wasn't a new release but I don't remember thinking that it seemed like a really old movie, so I'm guessing it was made in the early 90s or 1980s.

* This movie didn't have any sort of amnesia plot. A lot of people have suggested it. I BELIEVE there was some sort of ghost thing that happened (spoiler alert, but it's looking more and more like I imagined this all anyway).   

*  There weren't any major celebrities in it that I can remember. I think it was a European film though so there may have been some European stars in it that' I'm not familiar with.

* I remember it being really long. It was a cool movie but after the 6th or so time of him ending up at this house we were like, "REALLY?! AGAIN?!" so it wasn't a TV show. 

* I believe it took place in the past, like the 30s. 

**MOVIES PEOPLE HAVE GUESS THAT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT:** 
The Dreamers, The Others, Tales of the Unexpected, Cemetery Man, Somewhere in Time, The Legacy, Killing Zoe, The Tenant, Novo Hope [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_featuring_time_loops) helps. Then again, it could be an [amnesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Films_about_amnesia) thing as compared to a time loop theme.  There's a music video I saw when I lived in Japan back in 2005.  No idea who the artist/band is, nor the song, not even a few lyrics to work with. 

Scene:  boyfriend and girlfriend are shopping during the Christmas season.  Girlfriend likes this wicker snowman.  Boyfriend's face is of despair and disgust.

Later, they are on a hill and it starts to snow.  She is dancing and twirling happily, wanders into the street as she is doing so, and BAM!!!  Hit by a car.

We see boyfriend going to visit her in the hospital carrying aforementioned ugly ass wicker snowman. 

I laughed my ass off and everybody in the room got mad at me.  I need to show this video to likeminded friends. 

Edit:  Thank you SO MUCH to everyone who found it for me.  Now I need to spread some fucked up humor along my circle of cohorts. http://www.jpopasia.com/forums/posts-in/the-one-song-that-always-made-you-cry::19::9040::1 scroll down, it's "" by EXILE!  Here is the youtube link:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upH_YUSm00g Sounds like the fantastic music videos that always accompany karaoke songs, and never match the content of the song. For this one, I imagine the song would be "Bohemian Rhapsody" or something. 

Edit - I love every one of your karaoke video examples, and now I want to go to Maneki Neko.  This claymation movie about this douchebag kid who watches a shopkeeper's store while he's away. Kid steals from the shop, neglects the guys dog for a few days,  then finds out that the shopkeeper killed himself. Kid feels bad,  locks up the store,  takes the guy's dog home,  movie ends. Won some awards,  but could never find it. Was released between 2006 and 2009 iirc

Edit: it was a standalone short in black and white, if that helps

Edit 2: This is it, ["The Wraith of Cobble Hill"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqulkaDKP_s), thanks to /u/babwawawa The most depressing Wallace and Gromit ever made.  Are you thinking "The Wraith of Cobble Hill?"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqulkaDKP_s
 It's literally a whale video.  A group of people rehabbed a seal, and gathered on a beach to tearfully release it back into the wild.  Only for a killer whale to eat it immediately in a truly dramatic fashion.  I have wasted many hours trying to find it.

Edit: incorrectly used the concept of irony There's a pearls before swine comic about this Technically their work wasn't wasted because the point of rehabilitating a wild animal is to reintroduce it into the energy cycle of an ecosystem.  Granted it wasn't able to reproduce, but it gave the orca some energy to maybe do it instead.

Edit: you guys are taking this way to seriously. "Oh man, that seal was delicious. Right bit of viorca that was. Time to give the wife a good pounding, wot wot." Sounds like something that would be said by a hare in the dirty versions of the Redwall books.  
 
 
Edit: Haha I got gilded. Dude that gilded me, those books were my favorite things to spend time with in my younger years also.
  Imagine if Brian Jacques did sex scenes in Redwall books like he did food, you'd get like full page descriptions of the labia folds of a badger. [deleted] Not a pleasant mental image. LOGALOGALOGALOGALOGALOGALOGALOG! &gt; ***EULALIAAAAAAAAA***

These are hares we're talking about, mate. Man, *The Long Patrol* wouldn't even need a new title. "I wouldn't mind a nibble on the ol' gooseberry tart if y'catch me meaning, marm, wot wot!" Help! My childhood is being raped. https://vine.co/v/eqgxB5TpVFw Orcas are way larger and more terrifying than i imagined.  A kid's movie from the 80s that had a little dark haired girl who gets kidnapped by a queen or witch or something. I remember the queen/witch having this glass container of red jewel ball things, kind of like a sand timer. When the balls all fell out, something bad happened.

I've been searching for years for this movie. I've asked reddit. No luck. I will die never remembering what it was :(

*Edit: holy mother of god its the HuggaBunch movie! Thank you /u/Badeerge!!* This is the Hugga Bunch Movie: https://youtu.be/jl3-c5v_-Rc  Oh. My. God. I have been unsuccessfully trying to remember that movie for the longest time. Frankly, I think I subconsciously tried to repress any memory of those creepy little bastards so that I'd be able to sleep at night. Normally, kid programs don't seem as crazy or twisted when you're actually a kid. Not this movie, though. Even at age five, I found it incredibly demented. 

So much of it came back to me from watching a little of the video. Especially the part with the brother explaining what putting grandma "out to pasture" really meant. What an asshole. And the bloated cabbage patch kid faces the Huggins all share. The stuff of nightmares, right there.  "I'm an American citizen, and I don't have to kneel down to anybody! It's written in our Constitution!"

It's got some gems like these. I think you may be thinking of The Hugga Bunch movie. Terribly creepy puppets, girl goes to puppet land and meets the evil queen who keeps crystal berries in a glass or something like that.  Does this ring any bells?

 My best friend from Czech Republic. I lived in melbourne with him 11 years ago.. maybe 12.. we went through a lot together and shortly after our mutual friend died in our room he went back to czech and i have never seen him since.. Tom.. if you see this contact me... Mike.

EDIT: Holy shitballs, Someone has sent me a link to the right person! I found him! Thanks to /U/Findingaria.



 Hi, I'm from Czech Republic, may be I could help you somehow. Do you have his last name? Picture of him, name of the city where he lived... Well His name was Tomashcu?  Is this how it was spelt, he taught me some basics and used to pronounce it like Tom-Mas-ku(coo) if that helps.  I don't know the name of where he lived but he used to say it was close to Amsterdam as he used to drive there on the weekends, but i bet that is a lot of places too. His last name was Cedic i think but unsure of the spelling. and he was around 21 so he is probably around mid thirties i would estimate.. I can't think of much else...

Edit: no pictures surprisingly my mobile didn't take photos and we had no computers. Amsterdam is pretty far from the Czech republic The Math Invaders PC game from the mid-late 90's. We had it at school and it was fucking amazing, it was an FPS on a spaceship where you shot aliens and stuff, and to unlock every door you had to answer a math question. I've searched the internet so many times but hardly anyone seems to even know that it exists, I did find the disc for sale once but it was like $50USD (plus an ungodly amount of shipping to NZ) and it's doubtful whether I could even get a modern computer to play it anyway

I would pay a considerable amount of money for a digital version (legal or otherwise) or a disc that came with a method of playing it on Windows 7

Edit: Apparently there are a lot of similar games out there. It's this one: http://www.worldcat.org/title/math-invaders/oclc/37702110

http://www.tonytrippi.com/images/mathinv100.jpg

Math Invaders by Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive.  Is it Math Blasters: In Search of Spot? If so here's a download link, not sure if it works because I'm on mobile. 

http://www.myabandonware.com/game/math-blaster-episode-one-in-search-of-spot-41t I read this one particular book when I was younger and I can't find it for the life of me. It's about a girl whose mother is dying of cancer or some disease. So the mother and father are gonna take a ship to California from England. Girl is sent to live with her aunt in Yorkshire or some shit. Girl sneaks out and goes to the docks and smuggles herself into the ship. Turns out it is not the ship her parents are on and the crew discovers her. Ship wrecks and she washes up on shore of a jungle. 

That's all I can remember.  Maybe The Secret Journey by Peg Kehret? It was an late 90's pc game set in a house with different anthropomorphic animals, each would play a different board game with you and make a comment about each play (I believe the rabbit would get annoyed and accuse you of cheating at checkers).

Oh, also you could decorate cakes in the kitchen. I think I had this game! Cannot remember the name for the life of me!
Edit: I FOUND IT YAY http://www.old-games.com/download/3228/wild-board-games
 [I already sent you gold, but you need to know this](http://vocaroo.com/i/s1o57TG4nRoV) A cartoon (possibly looney toons) that has a huge amount of buttons that's pressed by the protagonist. That's about all I can remember. Just a shit ton of buttons. If I happen by it, my life will be forever complete; if I never see it again, it will just be a button memory that will continue to slowly dissolve, and that's ok too.  Is it the Looney Tunes where Daffy sells Porky the button operated house of tomorrow and it ends with Porky pressing the red button marked IN CASE OF TIDAL WAVE causing the house to rise into the air on a large telescoping metal beam, then Daffy flies by in a helicopter and offers to install a blue button that would lower the house? 

Gold?  Wow, thank you so much!  My first!  :). I always liked that cartoon which is probably why I remember it so well.   ...wait. 

maybe you're right. 

going to go look now. 

Dude, if this is it, I'm buying you a years worth of gold.  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1793b_elmer-fudd-design-for-leaving_shortfilms

This is so close, but not quite, have some gold anyways because it's closer than I've ever gotten.  Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a Half Century? He goes to space and fights Marvin the Martian. Lots of buttons, levers, triggers, etc. A geocities website I created with waving leprechauns and other horrible animations They purged a lot of the GeoCities data a couple years ago but some people bought the servers or something and are trying to catalouge the stuff they have as a kind of 'web 1.0' museum. I tried to find my site but it wasn't there yet if at all, I was sad. I'll see if I can find the site...

Edit: found it, check [here](http://www.oocities.org) Oh my god, I hope my Sailor Moon fan page is gone forever. I hope your Sailor Moon fan page is the primary topic of discussion at your next job interview. In a good way. "So...who, of all the characters in the *Sailor Moon* series, would you consider your favorite?" 

"Favorite?" 

"YOU'RE HIRED!" The only correct answer to this is "Luna". Guaranteed job offer at reddit HQ. A cartoon/anime from the 70s.  All I remember are fairies chanting BAR-BE-QUE.

EDIT: It is not Wizards.  Thanks for the suggestions.  I will check them out later. I don't know, but I would absolutely love it if someone found it out based just on this information. There was a /r/bestof post that mentioned /r/tipofmytongue where someone was looking for a movie and all they could remember was, "there was a scene with a car in it."

Anyhoo, someone guessed it just on that. The movie was Bullitt. [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/18vfvf/tomt_movie_with_a_car_in_it/) for anyone interested. I have been searching for a special episode of Recess for years. It was some kind of special episode that had a song similiar or that exact song 'One is the loneliest number', and it just hit me like a ton of bricks at like 5 years old. I remember I was completely changed as a human, and I realized it then and there, which has followed me for these 14-15 years.  The school's out movie/special had One is the loneliest number near the beginning. Also included was the school being used as a nightschool for training some sort of bad guy minions, been a while since i've seen it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhCHjaLsO0Y Link This is the movie "Recess: School's Out". It's jsut been added to Netflix in the UK There's a very dark children's book series that I read when I was a kid. I can't remember much except for the illustrations. I think it was all stuffed animals, but there were good ones and very bad ones. The main character was a teddy bear that reminded me of Winney the Pooh, but with loose stitches and some stuffing maybe poking out. The main bad guy I think was a marionette that was very creepy. The illustrations were always very dark and the stories always had a sense of sadness and the futility of good trying to overcome evil. I checked out several of these from my middle school library but I just can't remember anything else about the series, much less the title. Search corduroy bear on Google Yes I'm almost positive it's Corduroy! The books did seem very dark to me as a kid as well. I remember one where Corduroy gets locked in a shopping mall overnight. Everything is dark and depressing and there's some security guard who looks like he's going to kill Corduroy for staying too late in the mall (at least that's how 5-year old ashleysunrise felt).  The illustrations are dark because it is night, but he lived in the mall until a little girl brought him home. Nothing terribly sinister.

The main book "Courderoy" is about the mall when he tries to find a new button. [This stuffed skunk.](http://imgur.com/a/UgTU3)

There's a long story behind this... But basically a friend and I used to make really terrible videos starring this skunk, who we named Sheniqua. They were terrible and probably only funny to us, but they became a big staple of our friendship. (She was even in his wedding, as seen in one of the photos.)

Sheniqua is getting old and starting to fall apart. And my friend and I live very far apart now. I would love to find this exact skunk for sale somewhere and then my friend and I could both have our own shiny new Sheniquas.

Anyone ever seen her before?

EDIT: Here are the videos, for those who were asking:  http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2AB86ABE9B53D44B. But I assure you, they are pretty bad. We've both grown up to have successful video-related jobs, so don't judge us too harshly...

Also, thanks for everyone's suggestions. I'm going to look into all of them that I can.  There are people on Etsy that can make custom stuffed animals. I'm pretty sure a lot of them could make two based off the pictures, though it might get a bit pricey.  Cracker Barrel used to sell skunks like this! And I think I have one? I met a guy online years ago and we'd write letters to each other and everything. Tried name searches, writing to that address etc... However, as I get older and wiser and read the letters it's becoming clear that my beloved 19 year old Sam may infact have been a much older Sam and a Paedophile. 

Would still be cool to find him though, for old times sake.  "Eh, man, remember that time you pretended to be a teenage boy and went around contacting teenage girls?"

"Oh, yeah, totally."

"Yeah, good times." "So... Now that I'm legal... Wanna fuck?" 

"Ew, no." Friendzoned by a pedophile.  "I HAVE A BOYFRIEND" [deleted] [deleted] If it makes you feel better, I had a few penpals when I was 19. I didnt have many friends at University yet and thought it was cool to have letters from around the world waiting at the front desk of the dorms. So, not every guy that writes is a creepy old dude. I had someone like that.  We talked pretty much every day for several years, constant emails, etc.  We lost contact for about 5 years, then all of a sudden he added me on Facebook.  However, he was the age he said he was, but instead of the sexually charged emails of old, he now has a wife and kid. &gt;it's becoming clear that my beloved 19 year old Sam may infact have been a much older Sam and a Paedophile. 

&gt;Would still be cool to find him though, for old times sake.

Wtf The complete episodes of Bananas in Pajamas. Even the intro song is cut off on YouTube  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty3UgyiBSmA

i changed the search to the Australian spelling "pyjamas". Hope this helps!

Edit: i didn't say "I CHANGED THE SPELLING TO THE DEFINITELY INCORRECT &amp; HILARIOUSLY WRONG 'PYJAMAS' LOL". I was just clarifying why OP didn't turn up many search results, because OP is probably American &amp; spelled pajamas the way OP was taught. Yeesh, you guys are sensitive. 100% serious, my long-lost brother. I have no siblings, and he would be quite a bit older than me, but my mom had to give him up for adoption when she was younger, I always thought it would be awesome to find him for her.

And if he's a multi-billionaire, that'd be nice too.

Edit: Thank you to everybody who is willing to help, I am going to save this and see if this is something that I can make a reality soon. Unfortunately, there are a lot of emotional "what-ifs" on my, my mother's, and my potential brother's part to consider, and that has held me back from doing this, don't want to complicate anybody's life.

Edit 2: I am seriously touched by the amount of people that are willing to help for this, and will be hitting some of you up shortly. On the other hand, at the sake of not getting other people's hopes up, I will limit this to say that it was in California in the 70's. Try adoptiondatabase.org. My mom found her entire family using their resources. It's worth a try. HER ENTIRE FAMILY GOT ADOPTED! This dude I know got his whole body chopped off, all that's left is his penis. That's all he was in the end, a dick. If he's a multi-billionaire, he might be my long lost brother too.

Seriously though, good luck! hey it's me ur brother Its me!  Your long lost brother!  I am a billionaire!   Please pm me your bank account info and social security so I can give you some fortune. Seen you soon brother &gt;Seen you soon brotherSeems legit. &gt; my long-lost brother

&gt; I have no siblings

Seriously, though, I'm upvoting for visibility.  You might want to edit and give some more details (roughly when he was born, where he would have been put up for adoption, etc).  You never know who might see it. Being adopted it's always hard not to hope that things like this are about you.  awe :(

hugs

 I used too work for a TV show that helped people with stuff like this. Of course, it's easier in Sweden than in the U.S., but most of the people we found were from other countries, and I found a fair few lost fathers and brothers in America. I could give you some pointers or try to help you out if you are willing to give me more details (I'm home on paternity leave for another four months, so I've got time) &gt; I'm home on paternity leave for another four months

America, take note. Paid paternity leave, because having a kid is sort of important. My neopets password. Those fuckers will be getting mortgages. I'm 26 and about 2 years ago, my gf started playing again for a bit with a friend, and mentioned a new treasure map. 

For nostalgia, I logged back in, spent every penny I had on the map pieces, and pressed the daily button. I immediately won a Negg and sold it for 15 million!

My gf was *pissed* as she'd been grinding for weeks and had nothing. 

She wanted me to give her all my neopoints. I tried trading neopoints for blowjobs. I still have my 15 million neopoints... A few months before Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows book was released my friends girlfriend had an "editors" copy in her laptop, said a relative was part of the publishing team and sent it to her. It was similar to the book version, with minor differences. The one main difference I remember is the destruction of the Ravenclaw horcrux. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were in the scene, and Hermione ended up with a basilisk wound (I don't remember if it was the fang Harry used to destroy Toms diary or Nagini, but she was in bad shape). 

I don't remember any more, but I was dissapointed when I bought the book and it was different. The version I read included editors notes and error corrections, and being that it was similar to the published version I suspect it was an early draft. I would love to be able to read it again or ask Rowling about it! Maybe it was a [Chinese knock off](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_disputes_over_the_Harry_Potter_series#International_publications)? &gt; According to translated excerpts, the book principally consists of the text of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, but with most names changed to those of Harry Potter characters.
 Fool of a Longbottom! When I was a kid my ghetto parents had a painting of an astronaut taking on a piss on the moon overlooking the earth hanging in our living room.  I don't know why the fuck they thought that wasn't tacky but then again it was the 90s.  I've been trying to find a high res close up of it for years.  This is the only photo of said picture I have, it's hanging on the wall and yes that's me and my mom and I look baller as fuck: http://i.imgur.com/N7vaxdW.jpg I can't help you with what you're looking for but dang, the nineties are real strong with your photo Hey /u/OutlawDescendant since you were the only one who may have seen this and cared enough to reply I felt you should know I have an update on this story: http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/38lthr/ive_never_felt_so_fucking_vindicated_in_my_life/ I don't even know if it exists anywhere, but I've been searching for years for a decent quality creditless version of the [Paranoia Agent opening sequence.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-anabfAg06U) I love opening and ending sequences of shows, but there are a few that I just can't find decent versions of. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgxx86WkJ_0&amp;feature=player_embedded

It's 480p, couldn't find a 720p version without the credits. There was a fucking picture that is old as shit that I had like 6 years ago and, through a couple PC changes, have since lost.

It was a shitty ms paint drawing of the whitest looking, blonde-haired blue-eyed Swedish asshole you could have ever seen making the classic troll face and looking off to one side. In text around him it said a couple things, but the one that sticks out to me was something like "look at how perfectly Scandinavian I am"

I have a Swedish friend who can be a bit of an elitist so sometimes I wish I still had the picture so I could knock him down a peg or two.

**EDIT** Thanks to the assistance of /u/FireButt I was able to recreate the image as I remember it. It was simplistic back then, so I kept it simplistic now. [Enjoy, internet.](http://i.imgur.com/ODGlHaJ.png) 

I found this, not the same but best I could do

EDIT: I guess I needed to be clearer. I wasn't even in my teens yet when they turned legal. I thought I had hit the jackpot. This was before I learned about photoshop. All those hours I've spent was a lie.  Literally a conversation that 12 year old me and 14 year old brother had about a photoshopped Britney Spears photo.

"It can't be her, she's a virgin and that dude is going to town on her"

"Nah man, look closer. It's in the pooper, so shes still technically a virgin"

"Solid point bro"

Edit: My top comment is now about how my brother and I lied to ourselves as teenagers about anal sex. I hope you're happy Reddit. Alllrighhtyyy then.... Doctor can you confirm? If it's in the pooper is she still a virgin? That is the poophole loophole.   This isn't my "white whale", but rather  boyfriend's.

Since I met him he's been talking about this cartoon he once saw on TV as a child about these golems that come to life. He says it was some Jewish cartoon about a little kid and a bunch of golems. Can't remember anything else. He's been trying to find it for years.

Sometimes he wonders if he just dreamed it.

-edit: it's not Gargoyles btw! We both loved that show haha.
This one was about Jewish myths  Holy shit, that awakened some half-buried memories. I'm positive I've seen that cartoon when I was 12 or something. So of course I had to find it. I'm 100% sure Aaron's Magic Village is the one I watched, [trailer here](https://youtu.be/5mlLve4nebo). Is it the same one?! He watched some of the movie and realized it was the one!!! Thanks so much guys, this has been bugging him for years!! 
 He's not talking about [Gargoyles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrEVnrg3Ic) is he?

^More ^like ^Gargoyims &gt;Gargoyim

Oy vey This might be a long shot, but could it be "Aaron's Magic Village?". It's a german cartoon movie with the original title "Die Schelme von Schelm". 

Here's a trailer for the english version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mlLve4nebo

And here is the full movie in german: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNNN3qGcu0I

 Some bizarre book I read when I was a kid. I vaguely remember being in a library, perhaps on one of my few visits to see my dad. I remember a weird scene where some girl was in church and had a cross made of blood on her pants and someone said "Jesus done marked it on the seat of her pants" but I haven't ever been able to figure out if it is a real book or some weird dream I had. It was probably 12+ years ago. I've searched when it pops in my head but never found it.  Late to this but...

Probably about 10 years ago now. . When yahoo messenger and yahoo chats were big, i used to hang out in the "teens only" room. It was a haven for social outcasts and shy. .weird teens. We all had hardc0rexx names and stuff. . Cringe.

I got really close to a girl though. We'd talk for hours online and on phone during 'free nights and weekends' time.  We started edating for awhile. 

Eventually she met someone in real life though, and i was happy for her. We stayed friends and talked everyday still. After awhile though i guess her boyfriend got jealous and made her stop talking.  We'd trade occasional secret emails every few months to stay in touch, but eventually he figured that out too. 

It's been years and years now. .

But brittany from Michigan. .with your curly red hair. .super pale skin with freckles upon freckles everywhere. . Who did your makeup in crazy pinks and blues.. If you're out there, I still think of you sometimes, and i hope life is treating you okay.  My best friend from middle school. I've been looking for her for years and have yet to find a hint of her online past a news article we both were in from grade 6. I hold on to hope though. I found a friend from grade 2 after searching for 6 years, so I may yet find her.

EDIT: since this is headed to the front page and this comment happens to be near the top and you never know, the internet is magic...

**KATELYN! Yes, you, the one from Colorado and Alaska. Your old friend from Canada is looking for you. Send me a PM!**

EDIT2: Since people keep asking how you go about finding someone and I have had one success at this:  
1. Start with the name. Get the first and last name. Use your yearbook, photos from events/teams, anything from the time you two knew each other. If your friend has a hyphened last name (eg James Smith-Jones) then you're going to look for the hyphened name AND both individual names (eg James Smith-Jones, James Smith, and James Jones). People change their names.  
2. Next: google. Yes, as simple as that. Google your friend and search to the nth page for anything that might be relevant. Add keywords if your friend had some defining characteristic, a physical disability, an obscure injury, some great skill, anything that might pop up.   
3. Social Media. Go to every site that uses "real names" (Facebook, G+, and linkedin are good starters) and search for your friend there.  
4. Don't give up hope and keep searching, it could take years before you get lucky, but if you don't give up, eventually you will.  
5. Good Luck.

EDIT3: OMG **I found her!** This post made me try googling again for the first time in quite a while and I found her on Linkedin! I also found her wedding site (people tighten your security on stuff like that seriously!) I've sent her a message and am hoping for the best. I've changed my name since we were kids, so she might ignore my message, but I guess we'll see. Thanks everyone for inspiring me to look one more time!

**EDIT4: AAAHH!!** First off, thanks kind stranger for the reddit gold, it's my first gilding! **She responded to my message**, we're connected on linkedin now and conversating nicely! I'm so excited, it's been over a decade since we last talked! Thanks reddit for being supportive. Have a scroll through the comments to see some other inspiring and amazing stories and maybe see your name listed next to someone who's searching. Reddit is amazing! I also have a friend like this. Met him at summer camp, we were best friends and promised to "keep in touch" but never gave each other our email addresses (ah, being 8 years old). 

The problem is, his name is so incredibly common that it's almost impossible to wade through all the people. My other friend, the one from grade 2 that I did manage to reconnect with, has a common name. If you remember anything about your friend, any defining characteristic or interest, cross google the two and it might narrow your search. I wish you the best of luck, I know it can be tough finding someone you've lost. Your search - **James Smith scar on penis from friction** - did not match any documents.  

Shit. Keep up hope!

I had a good friend in kindergarten. We were pretty damn close. She was kind of my girlfriend back in the day. Our parents both worked at the same high school, so after our school let out, we'd head to the high school. We'd hold hands and I'd walk her to her mother's classroom. My mom later told me that we were probably responsible for the spike in student pregnancies just because we were so damn cute.

Anyway, she left during the summer between kindergarten and first grade since her mother got a new job on the other side of the state. I was crushed. 

Fast forward about a decade and I begin to wonder what happened to her. There was no trace of this girl at all.

During the summer between my junior and senior year, I was accepted into a summer program for my state's top students (really competitive since getting into the program essentially gives you free tuition at any public school here.) You get placed in a college campus and stay there for a few weeks. It was essentially nerd camp and it was pretty awesome.

Anyway, I get there and start walking around one day and see this girl. It was her, it had to be! And holy hell did she age incredibly well (we're talking an easy 8 or 9!)

I go up to her and ask "Are you (name)?"

"Yeah, have we met? You look really familiar..."

I told her my name and she was shocked. We talked for a good hour about life and how we were enjoying the camp and all that shit. It was pretty cool.

I also became really good friends with her roommate and a few other girls in her hall. I found out my friend was a massive bitch to everyone. It crushed me.

But I made tons of other new friends. My roommate and I are very close. He's the brother I never had. Unfortunately I'm losing him in a few weeks when he moves to the other side of the country. ITT: Dreams come true There was this incredibly NSFW shock factor music video set to Foreigner's "i wanna know what love is".

Starts out a blonde guy lip syncing as the song plays the video, going about his daily life, buying groceries, picking out veggies, finding the perfect cucumber, gets home, starts undressing, song approaching the chorus.  Then... THEN HE SHOVES THE DAMN CUCUMBER UP HIS ASS AS THE SONG CRESCENDOS.

*I WANNA KNOW WHAT LOVE IIIIIIISSS*

out comes the cucumber

*I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME*

He sucks the shit off the cucumber

*I WANNA FEEL WHAT LOVE IS*

he shits in his hand

*I KNOW YOU CAN SHOW MEEEE*

Aaaand then rubs it all over himself before collapsing in exaustion.


My friend has a habit of sending me disgusting videos.  I can never quite get him back.  This video is my holy grail of gross-out, and I can't find any trace of it.  

Help me reddit.  I need you.


Edit:  the closest I ever got was a dead video link in a foreign automobile forum in a 2 year old thread.  I know it was there.  The conversation surrounding that link was too close to what I had seen. So close.

 I'm happy to say I can't help you at all with this... I think at this point you just need to pay someone to recreate the video.  So there's this one porn video

Edit: So I love how this thread has turned into /r/tipofmypenis. There are tons of niche porn sites/videos from the early 2000s that have completely disappeared.  I made the mistake of not saving any videos back then.  Since then I've learned to save everything I find.  Now I even back up my porn stash on the cloud! Just don't accidentally set your tequila bottle on the "delete" button and erase it all.^I'm^not^bitter I love Silicon Valley but I hate seeing every episode ending with those guys getting fucked in one way or another. I just want them to have one good solid win. Last week was good, they got the bake off... but then they lost it. Except they didn't lose it, they were fine but then they had the "character is an idiot/asshole and ruins everything" trope. Like come on, I understand that the plot needs to continue, but is a constant state of failure really the only way to do it? I don't see why things just have to keep getting worse every single episode. First Peter dies, then Hooli sues them, then they lose all their funding and are forced to work with Russ, an egotistical asshole, that energy drink company tries to scam them, End Frame stole their algorithm, and when they eventually get a glimmer of hope Russ destroys it moments later. It's not as fun watching a show when one bad thing after another happens to the characters. Well the actor for Peter actually did die, that wasn't a writing thing. Tres Commas ,,, "Three commas?"

"Wrong... Three commas" "If they had a tequila bottle stuck on their delete key, they'd have struggled to delete HALF the amount of files we did." Also if you happen to be on the billion dollar porn company end, make sure you have backups of your stuff.^also^not^bitter I couldn't figure out why that one random laptop setup that nobody has ever used in the show was loaded up on that. /r/TipofMyPenis my friend. 

 They couldn't help me :( I recently just found my white whale, and since I've seen no one hint at it I'll leave it here in case it helps someone anyways.

The Pirates Of Darkwater.

Change your life. I just created an account for this.  This may be what I've been waiting for since I began lurking years and years ago.
Here's what I'm looking for. 
Its a stop-motion animation that involves a platform that looks like a chessboard floating in a grey void. 
In the very middle of the chessboard is a treasure chest.  
At each corner of the chessboard and in the middle along each side is an identical figurine.  He looks sort of like Jack Skellington, although his face isn't as featured and he's wearing a nondescript trench coat.  They may have a name tag on the back with a bar code, although my mind might have added that in the years since I've seen it. 

Anyway, the scene starts out with no motion/sound for a very long time.  I remember almost changing the channel.  But then eventually... on of the figures looks left, looks right, then boldly walks towards the chest in the middle.
This upsets the balance on the board and the chest starts sliding.  All the other figures scramble wildly to reestablish equilibrium.  But this one jackass keeps going after the chest.  The chest is sliding around too as the board yaw's and rolls.
Eventually there are casualties as some figures slide off the end of the board and down into the void.  
Some of the other figures begin to start chasing the chest as well (as opposed to simply trying to maintain the balance) and it becomes a sort of battle to get the chest. 
This goes on for a fairly short time (considering how long I waited for something to happen) and in the end, there's one 'victor' who's managed to get all the other figures off the board.  
The problem now is that the board is balanced on a single axis with the 'victor' at one end of the board and the chest at the other.  
If he steps towards the chest, the board will tip and the chest will fall off. 
So he's stuck where he is. 

It's haunted me for a very long time. It seems like I've yet to find a better example of human nature, and why its important for us to work with people rather than against them. 

edit: wording Balance. And yes, it's pretty awesome.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1CTesYaduBA An archive of my Yu-Gi-Oh! fan fiction I wrote at age 13 that I deleted in shame two years later.

Every day I don't find it, I'm both slightly disappointed and greatly relieved. Ah shit you had to bring up YuGiOh fan fiction. 

I wrote some that has disappeared into the mists of time, way back when I was like 13. I wrote it for another person's fan site. 

I was... A bit of a pervy creep when I was younger (puberty hit me young and hit me hard), and I developed a crush on the girl that ran the site... I wrote it as one of those fanfics where both of us were also characters and friends of the main characters...

I ended up saying some things that I realized  later were creepy and she blocked me.

(It would be pretty crazy to run into her again. I'm not as creepy anymore, I swear!) Well, at least you owned up to your creepiness, so that's good.

Something about YGO that turns teens into crazy people, I swear to God. It's probably the crazy hair.  A version of Lego Backlot that actually works The girl I took to prom. She was in Seventeen magazine and one of the most beautiful girls I had ever met. She went with me because I was the only guy that had the balls (aka desperation) to ask her to go. Obviously we went as friends. I saw her one more time after i graduated, randomly at a concert, but never since. I've always been curious what happened to her. 

Her name is unique, but years of searching turned up nothing. 23 years later the only proof I have that she's real is the prom picture.

**Edit 1:** Thanks for all the helpful comments! I've known her name and the correct spelling since high school. Hasn't helped with the search.

**Edit 2:** [Here's the prom picture.](http://i.imgur.com/hIzJttM.jpg)

**Edit 3:** Pretty sure I found her mom on Facebook. Waiting for a reply. Crazy series of searches to find her. Next update if/when she replies. 

**Edit 4:** That's her mom! Still haven't connected with my past prom date, but I'm well on my way. Thanks to /u/NYComrade for finding out my white whale's middle name. That was the break I needed. It still looks like she's not on the internet, but having her full name helped me find her mom. The searches consisted of having to find her mom's maiden name, 2nd marriage name and her nickname. I'll post another edit if I actually connect with her. What are you talking about?  That's just a picture of you...

&lt;*Twilight Zone theme*&gt;


(More seriously, though, hope you find her.  If this was somewhere in North Dallas, PM me the name and I'll check my yearbooks.) Have you tried searching on something like LinkedIn? This'll get buried, but it's a story worth getting off my chest. My white whale is a girl from AUS (I'm Canadian.) We met on a fantasy RP chatroom and were assigned characters in different houses and over the next *year* we fell in love. It was 95% in-game that it happened, but in private messages and on MSN, it seemed like more than that. Everyone else in the channel knew who we were and what was happening and thought it was among the most adorable things they'd ever seen.

I never met her when voice chat was a thing. She only ever sent one picture, too. One day, she disappeared. I spoke with other people on the channel who were close to her who mentioned that she had problems at home. Whatever they were, we never spoke again. This all happened around 13-14 years ago. At least 8 years back, I sent a message out to as many Samantha Andersons as I could find on Facebook in Australia, asking if any had ever gone by "Lily," but it was something of a lost cause.

I know that in all likelihood it could very well have been a 50-year-old dude, but I have a modicum of faith that it wasn't the case.

I haven't been searching of late, but I still wonder. Upvote for hope of making it to top of the thread.  If she was real, and on a Fantasy RPG chatroom I feel confident guessing that she's a redditor.   I'm still searching for the manufacturer of [my favorite rubber duck](https://i.imgur.com/F5knoAj.jpg).  Every few years the ducks show up in stores again (the last time I saw one was around 2008), but I've never been able to learn their origin.  Here's a bit of a back story about this duck (some info I've posted before, some is new):

In 1977, a toy company called Knickerbocker created a new toy called [Ernie's Rubber Duckie](http://i.imgur.com/sFrVREs.jpg).  Designed by famous toy inventor [Henry Orenstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Orenstein) (patent [USD260915](http://www.google.com/patents/USD260915)), this toy would lay the foundation for one of the most iconic rubber ducks in history.  In 1983, Knickerbocker was sold to Hasbro; which produced more of the ducks around 1985 through [Playskool](http://i.imgur.com/I4HZiLq.jpg).  Around that time, a Taiwanese factory got a hold of this toy and started creating [generic knockoffs of it](http://i.imgur.com/F5knoAj.jpg).  By 1992, Playskool discontinued production of their rubber duck, but the Taiwanese factory continued on.  Every few years, this anonymous factory produced replicas which would appear in toy stores across the United States.

Remember [this stock photo](http://i.imgur.com/8CliVBH.jpg)?  It appeared in everything from Photoshop tutorials to the default Windows user account profile picture.  Some were even [used in an experiment to test the pollution caused by different kinds of jet ski engines](http://i.imgur.com/dHJvPYB.jpg).  Those particular ducks are now [mounted on the desk of politician Mark DeSaulnier, D-Calif](http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/rep-mark-desaulnier-d-calif-keeps-a-bottle-of-california-news-photo/465167140).  The last time I ever saw them was in a World Market around 2008 [(video evidence from 2005)](http://vimeo.com/28158).

If you have one of these, feel free to check the bottom and I guarantee you'll find the "Made in Taiwan".  They seem to all come from one source, yet I have never been able to track them down.  My dream is to some day discover where they're made and start my own store for them.

Edit: I want to thank all the people who have tried looking for me!  Unfortunately, the search goes on.  Several people have found very similar ducks, the closest probably being the [Bath and Body Works ducks](https://i.imgur.com/jNU9XUr.jpg) or [this knockoff of the knockoff](http://i.imgur.com/meVvrP1.jpg) which is from China and is significantly lower quality. I'm pretty sure I can find the duck mothership. The store I work in sells them. I can ask the buyer tomorrow.  That would be awesome! Are you sure it's the same duck? A lot of people get the one I'm talking about mixed up with [Bath and Body Works ducks](http://i.imgur.com/utFTFVA.png), [Toysmith ducks](http://i.imgur.com/mEYgLNi.jpg), [Munchkin ducks](http://i.imgur.com/TXCQRvR.jpg), or some other one which is more common today.  They all look very similar, but there are actually slight variations in shape, size, wing design, beak color, eye pattern, etc! Dude, you are really fuckin' hardcore about ducks. Respect. Hmm. I'm fairly sure they're not the other two, but it's possible they're the Toysmith ducks. They don't come with tags, though, so there's hope. I'll investigate tomorrow.  Wow. This entire time, /u/fuckswithducks actually had a passion for ducks.  Have you seen ... The video?

edit: everyone have been asking, [Here](http://www.youporn.com/watch/9892997/rubber-duckie-i-m-awfully-fond-of-you-/) NSFW No. Is it good I haven't? Define "good" Will I lose a part of my soul to the devil? Am I the only one that seems worried that you want to go to the manufacturing plant for the rubber ducks Mr fuckswithducks? I am thinking of that one episode from SpongeBob where squidward find out he likes crabby patties and then ends up in the vault of them. Don't really have one, but great question OP. I don't recall ever seeing this asked here. Back when I was a youngin (about 1998 or so) the Lord of the Flies was on TV and I was watching it. A song came on (apparently during a commercial because that movie doesn't have a damn soundtrack) that was the most beautiful sound, to this day I remember the tune because it was just like instant silken eargasm, but of course it had no lyrics and it was on a commercial and I've never been able to find it ever again.

Even on the whole internet. You're going to have to record you humming/doing the tune. It's the only way. http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/15pl55/tomtsong_do_do_do_doo_doo_song/c7omrc2 If you remember the tune you should record it and see if someone else recognizes where it comes from. Also, many tunes are created for a specific commercial so it might be nearly impossible to find. The program on windows that you could shoot up and bomb your desktop screen as much as you wanted. What was that called and where do I find it again? Ok. So. When I was little, I had this Cinderella book, (not disney) and it came with a cassette so you could listen to the story when you read it. Now, before the actual narration of the story began, there was this song. I LOVE the song. Its SO pretty, and I can't remember much of the lyrics, but I can remember the melody. 

I have googled in every combination of the lyrics I can think of, sung that shit into Soundhound, looked on youtube, tried to find the book itself so I can buy the fucker, but NOTHING will tell me the name of the song, or who sings it. What kills me inside is that a few years ago, I FOUND THE ARTIST, but stupid fucker that I am, I didn't write it down.I have never been able to find it since.

This is as much of the lyrics as I can remember. 

"Once upon a time, when the world was full of magic. Once upon a time when a dream could last forever, (forever). Dragons, lions and dwarfs, witches and wizards too. Beauty's beast and bears ... (Chorus-y bit)... maids to rescue witches to conquer ... Over the rainbow, .... Your dreams will come true."

Its sung by a woman, and I'm sure the book was published by Parragon, early 2000's (I don't have the book with me to check). I've been on their site and they don't sell it anymore. :(



Ugh, I want to find this SO MUCH. Maybe someone will recognise it???

EDIT: Ok Guys, thanks for all the comments! Here's what I know so far:

The book is in the Treasured Tales series by Parragon Publishing, published some times in the early 2000's. Every book in the series has the song playing before the actual narration begins. Here's the title page I found: [Cinderella](http://ca.pbsstatic.com/l/08/0608/9781405440608.jpg)

I still can't find the name of the song, it's just [listed](http://www.45worlds.com/tape/media/nc214310uk) as opening or closing song.

It's performed by Denica Freeman (87% sure).

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXDQzjpilbs) Youtube video is an actual recording of the series! It's the Three Bears, but the opening notes are there and its the right narrator guy and I was having a heart attack from all the nostalgia, and then the video fucking skipped the song. I'm so pissed.

I'm not sure I'll find an actual recording of it anywhere on the internet :( 

But thanks for all the helpful replies!!! Wow, Might actually have an opportunity to get an answer to this. Here goes. A little over two years ago I believe I was drugged by my father with something. On the fourth day I was visiting his house (I'm nearly 30 now) I saw a packet that said "Relaxivit" or "relaxavit" I looked at it briefly and not long after I found out a whole bunch of things he had been doing, drugging was the least of my worries. Its nearly in court again (he sacked his lawyer on day 1 of the last attempt at a trial) and although I have no admissible evidence, I've been trying since 2013 to find out if relaxivit actually exists and whether if it does, it could be strong enough to knock a mother out so well she can't wake up to those she is trained to wake up to. If anyone can work out if it exists, its reddit. could it have been [restavit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxylamine)? i was thinking the same thing. I take restavit to sleep when I'm on a stretch of night shifts and that stuff knocks me out for the whole day. There was an advertisement on Hulu that allowed you to type in your name then a whole bunch of people singing would say your name in the middle of the commercial. For some reason I remember it being associated with Burger King.  You're searching for a commercial on Hulu? Well that shouldn't be hard.  **SOLVED** Thank you /u/ExcitedSauce and others who suggested Future Cop LAPD

Despite multiple reddit threads on the issue, I've never been able to find this game.

I played it when I was a kid, I'm guessing on ps2, between 1998-2000? It was a strategy game, top down, fully 3D, and had tower defense elements. You were basically on a map and you built independent vehicles from your base that would wander around and defend your bases or kill whatever enemy thing it ran into. The idea was to kill the other enemy's base. Sometimes there was a boss and you had to build like anti aircraft vehicles and stuff...

That was one of my first ventures into a lifelong love of tower defense and strategy games and I want to find it so badly!

** EDIT: It's got to be Future Cop LAPD. I didn't think it was it until I saw a video of the "precinct assault mode" and it all came rushing back. Thank you!! A clip of Rodney Dangerfield on The Tonight show with Jay Leno. Where he tells Jay that a threesome for him is jacking off with both hands. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2yH5YcK13s&amp;feature=youtu.be

Right around the 3 minute mark. Local singles in my area That's funny, there are a ton of white whales in my area. Execution level: Captain Ahab &gt;a ton

So 3? A Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial in French featuring a gopher that my sister and I saw on television one time when we were in Montreal.

I check for it once every six months. Filling in... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJgDYdA8dio Wait wat  The "he was murdered and set on fire" part was the headline of a news story. He just forgot to add a pause between "is off tonight." and "he was murdered".

[Here is the full clip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG4UMxP3HsM&amp;ab_channel=Andrewzieg) Okay... who's playing with the teleprompter again? at the show... er.. UUAHAHH

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwrvbjBF7YQ THAT RUN OH MY GOD Looks like a San Andreas pedestrian That's straight outta Straya. I don't know which video it's in, but there's a lot more from the Today Show on [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/dnp52td/videos).

Edit: [Found it.](https://youtu.be/Z0pYJ_9OWKA?t=29s) Did I win? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgrA3xqB4sI Watch this bear escape - https://youtu.be/8xeBGx2bfxc Holy fucking shit that's something I would expect out of South Park No. This isn't real. I do not accept this is real. The Onion?? Oh it's real. There's more comedy in the [full video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOKHlWAp4No).  I died laughing at "This is what the bear probably looked like. Except real." I'm good. I'm uhhh...I'm faster than a bear.  The intonation on "except real" is what makes that so good, but I *really* lost it at the tree climbing. Wait. Does this news station just not give a fuck? Some producer  was cool with a giant squirrel head talking mid-story? It has to be a fuck you for making them cover a non-topic.  When he said "a bear scats in the woods." I lost it! We know that bears scat in the woods.

Good to know. The bear climbing up the tree. I lost it. Narrator: " So we know that a bear scats in the woods, but should we be concerned?" Random Naturalist:"We are not bear food." Narrator: "And neither are pets." Fake rabbit in real news report says: "I'm good, I'm uh faster than a bear."

Worth the watch. You forgot to mention the fact that the bear expert they interviewed has only once come close to seeing an actual bear. lol...what? They actually made a cutout for that? I wonder what the guy getting paid to recreate that was thinking...."Durr hurr hurr, I'm a bear galloping away..."  http://youtu.be/1o_kH5tAggk you can tell theyve been married for ages. I love it because it's so real. Jesus Christ Ron get your shit together. Oh so I'm not allowed to sneeze?  AM I NOT ALLOWED TO ENJOY A SUCCULENT CHINESE MEAL?!

edit: Wow! thanks for the gold! I'd like to thank Paul Dozsa for his elegance and showmanship. 

**THIS IS DEMOCRACY MANIFEST** Wow. That played so close to a Monty python skit. [Italian Prime Minister Saves The Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ0Csdlua9A) That world leader us so fucking proud of himself for catching a chair That sound is my text message tone. I still jump every time I hear it thinking I've been spotted.  [Way to go Paul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzY7S_RGHm4) Hockey parents are insane Yes, they are, but don't think he hulked out and broke that glass normally. That glass is defective. It can normally withstand bodies being thrown into it at 30+ km/h, pucks being shot at it at speeds that can easily top 120 km/h. Dude slapped it with his hand at no more than 15 km/h.

That glass is defective. I would guess that he hit it with a ring or something.  Pucks and bodies spread the force on impact more. I love this because we get so much passion in 6 short seconds from so many different characters. 

There's Hockey Mom 1 (probably named Cheryl) with her classic line, "Get the wheels on the bus!" Haha Cheryl's great. Always volunteering for her kid's field trips and really putting the F U in fun.

Our protagonist, Paul. All his life, all he's done is win, win, win, no matter what. It's just too bad his kid is such a fucking spaz on skates. What's some broken glass? Nah m8, that's not going to keep Paul (ain't afraid of no Brawl) from his vicious diatribe. 

And lastly we have Hockey Mom 2 (probably named Sheryl). Sheryl is actually Paul's ex-wife. They hooked up in the bathroom at Spaz on Skate's birthday party last month. Sheryl fucking hates Paul, but figured they could give it another go because she's single as fuck. But when she posted an article about the aphrodisiac effect of cheese to Paul's wall, the little fucking bitch didn't even like or comment on that shit. Fuck you Paul. So now Sheryl's here today (because she supports Spaz on Skates and also because she has a brand new baller haircut) and is bearing witness to Paul fucking up *once again.* 

Way to go Paul.  This backstory is so perfect haha Thank you for drawing me in to the lives of Cheryl, Sheryl, and of course Paul. Mustn't forget Spaz on Skates! [Penguin falling!

That cat. Hahahaha they could have easily used another clip. but then, this video would not exist
I think that they laughed their asses off while looking at the raw footage, and decided to keep it I think my favorite part of this is imagining the people editing the show seeing that footage and laughing their asses off and then deciding they have to put it in. It's just there in the show, representing itself. No other mention of it is needed. It stands alone. impact [deleted] [this video about a young goat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dhXrzs8pJc) [Green day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m24DPDKZ4zA) Well, that is how the song goes.

I saw this posted once and it was just 8 hours of "Korean people don't know what black people look like" Holy crap I just realized I know this guy! He moved to Korea a while ago and I just found him on Facebook again a little while ago and it's full of photoshoots and stuff in Korea!

I have started to worry that I am becoming emotionally numb to the world. Then I watch this stupid-ass video, and I laughed harder than I have in at least 5 years. I literally laughed until my back, sides, and neck hurt, and tears are gushing from my eyes. Thank you for that. It's dumb, but it meant a lot. It did more than cheer me up. Hey, I make custom game controllers for people with physical disabilities. Let me know that would apply to your life or help.  That's incredibly kind of you. My son has autism. His motor skills are actually quite good. Funny thing, he actually dislikes game controllers because they are an alternative to what he believes the one true input device should be -- touch screens. If it's not a touch screen, don't even bother showing him! He thinks the 3DS is the dumbest thing in the world for being only half touch screen. HEHEHEHEHE Thanks Arthur  http://youtu.be/HRPwMBAtfTY

If she hears me peeing in the bathroom she'll say something like "Daddy peed! Great job Daddy!" I think it's because that's how we praised her when she was potty training, so maybe that's what happened with the girl in this video...

Sorry. That's 3000 years of wisdom ..right there ^^ Just goto Egypt, they worship cats and do writing on the walls. You won't miss a thing. Who do you think started that, a redditor that was sent back in time... Son of a bitch.  The hieroglyphics that vaguely resemble Nick Cage make a lot more sense now. Our /r/onetruegod is pleased. /r/onetrueRa Macklin Invent Reddit Only 2999 more years  browse r/cats....  yes.

i'm sure those 3000 years would fly by 'cause i'd be having so much fun as god-emperor of the earth.  What if someone buries you alive? You could never die.. Just stuck in that box.. In the dark, everyday. Forever. Chew your way out. Your teeth regenerate.

Just watch out in case the burial ground is somewhere guarded by religious types who established "guarding the Devil's Tomb" as a holy duty. You spend 300 years gnawing your way out of a granite-and-brass slab, stumble out into the daylight, and Rookie McAcolyte stabs you with a spear and shoves you into the *other* granite and brass slab they've had waiting all this time. Or you could wait for some megalomaniac idiot to "awaken" you in a foolish attempt at world domination.

Also I hear  evil cults are good for that too.
 McAcolyte, fuck you This is golden. 
I can picture the casual look on McAcolyte's stupid face as he spears you through the gut and just tosses you into the next hole. Everything decays eventually. The box won't outlive you Be careful; immortal god-emperors have, historically, met with ugly fates. I'd hate for you to end-up as a vegetable on some baroque life-support throne while personifications of entropy consume the souls of your subjects for sustenance.

 No thanks, I'll take giant, philosophical sandworm man, please. The spice must flow. Careful, that ends with your consciousness split into billions of tiny non-sentient animals and scattered.  You end up with nothing but an awareness that you are alive. Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne! Milk for the Khorne flakes! It wouldn't have to happen for another 32,000 years. Not counting the 1000 years of crusading, thats plenty of time to fuck lots of women to make a metric ton of immortal demigods like Saint Pius. Hey, maybe itll save him in the future. Guardsmen Pius was not immortal ! He was a regular man who, with a dad bod, his standard issue flashlight, cardboard, and ADAMANTIUM BALLS placed himself between his injured emperor and his ten foot tall heretical son! Who at the moment was brimming with demonic energy had not only FOUGHT THE GOD EMPEROR OF MANKIND TO A STANDSTILL, he also BANE SNAPPED A MOTHER FUCKING ANGELS BACK! After seeing all that and knowing he is outclassed on the level of a bronze league scrub playing STLife in a placement game you know what h this guy does? HE POINTS HIS FLASHLIGHT AT THE DEMONIC SPINE BREAKER AND DAZZLES HIM! (more like he whipped out his glossy nutsasck)Pius was utterly  obliterated but his action gave Emps the opening needed to claim "victory". Just a man, and his faith, and his balls and don't you forget it. Damn retconian. I love you god damn nerds. Horus was right.

3. Prophet Imagine how much of a let-down life will be once you reach the present.

You go back in time 3000 years. The basic knowledge a person has in 2015 makes you a god among men. Not just the basic science and technology, but the knowledge of the future(history), provided you don't change it too much. People will worship you.

And then 2015 hits, and suddenly you no longer know much of anything useful. Your followers catch you trying to make yourself sound smart by reading wikipedia and bullshitting your way through everything. well you have enough time to build your own empire. I mean you basicly know that apple, coca cola, microsoft and google are stuff to invest. You would be super super super super rich.  You would also know when to invest in Roman Empire, when is the time to jump on Africa and far-east trade, when to give loans to Catholic church and when to leave the Knights of Templars.

You only wish that you had paid more attention on the history to actually remember the details. Like the meeting with Vlad the Impaler... Ahem, immortality... Having a stake driven through you and being miraculously still alive would only build your god cred. Didn't Vlad have a habit of leaving people 'hanging around' though? Great. You'd be an immortal wall ornament for him. Sort of like a gorier Talking Bass. *Here's a little song I wrote*

*You might want to sing it note for note*

*Please kill me* I would probably travel to every continent, learn their ways, then I would spend my time reading books, and become a wizard. I believe it's 30 years to get your wizard licence, not 3000. [deleted] Nobody wants that  Same here. If you tried to be a leader or someone too powerful I think there are high chances you draw too much attention and someone will find a way to imprison you forever.

I'd go for more of a travelling mystic, who just happens to pop up and intervene with historical events or solve problems and then be on my way again. Tom Bombadil knew what's what. Just observe quietly, enjoy a simple life, and marry a super hot river goddess. Yes. I'd travel the world and sleep with all the historically significant people.  Then I'd rank them from best to worst. A good test to see if that would really happen if you traveled back in time is to see how many significant people you are having sex with today. Define significant. Living, breathing human being. Oh, in that case nearly all of them have been significant. Oh that's good.

...wait a minute... He could be trying to sleep with them before they got famous. He's a sex hipster. dude, he's a highly paid orgy pro.

LAME EDIT: my top comment is now a username joke. wooooooo Catherine the Great? More like Catherine the So-So. Then put it on buzzfeed. Yes.

You're giving up toilet paper, too. I use three seashells.  I would lay perfectly still at the bottom of a shallow river bed for a million years until I'm fossilized then scare the shit out of some archeologist when I scream in his face as he's digging me up.

It's just a prank bro!

In other words, yes I would accept
 But you only go back 3,000 years, meaning you would be fossilized 997,000 years after you went back.  All for a prank?  I get it though, it is all about timing. The long khan Genghis' nickname among the ladies. "It's for YouTube!" Sounds like a good way to kill a million years.  The look on his face would be so worth it. This is some dumb and dumber level shit right here.  It would really suck if you got an std and had to live with it forever.  If you get an std, cut your knob off, it'll grow back but what if you got syphylis You can actually cure syphilis with mercury. space travel hasn't existed before 20th century /r/shittyaskscience The scary thing is 3000 years is insignificant to eternity. If you were truly immortal you would spend an infinite amount of time on the completely dark frozen rock that was earth. Unless protons decay or something then who knows. After spending a few billion years roasting inside the sun during it's giant phase. Don't forget that. No because by then man will have invented space travel and you can be one of the people populating the universe since time means nothing. You could be the savior of the human race.  Until they have all evolved beyond you and view you as a relic. Have fun being nothing more than a zoo exhibit featuring primitive man. You could just become 90% cyborg. Could you though?

Ride on the Titanic (I'm immortal bitches!) 

invent stuff like velcro and the theory of relativity 

befriend Hitler and try to pull a Schindler 

check out what *really* happened at Roswell with my truck-full-o-cameras 

befriend Bill Gates as a teenager.  Lend him some cash  Of all the things you'd be able to invent and take credit for, velcro? I think velcro is a great choice for this. I don't know enough about the inner workings of computers or other modern marvels to recreate them. But hook things and some fibers? I can make that! to be fair, it's a lot more complicated than that haha. but i do get what you mean; i'm not going to be able to make damn near anything, but some things would be easier than others. 1. Invent patent system
2. Patent the wheel
3. Bill Gates who? First you gotta patent the patent system. I'm patenting patenting. Patent pending. About the Titanic idea: you can still be trapped somewhere for eternity. Imagine being at the bottom of the ocean under a fucking bed or something. Or you know, watching all those people, including the elderly and children die while they beg for help while youre just some asshole time tourist there to watch them all die. Or, you know, knock the fuck out of the captain and don't hit an iceberg.
 OP never said the Grandfather Paradox was an issue Yes. I would train sooooo hard 6 days a week for 3,000 years, and have the sickest body and then hookup with all kinds of super hot babes. This dude right here gets it. Bro-five Step 1: Travel back in time and become immortal.

Step 2: Make massive gainz.

Step 3: ????

Step 4: Profit! primal gainz* I'd just have a list of famous people, man and women I'd want to fuck. Just to say I did. Cleopatra, Cesar, Jesus, Hitler, Stalin, Queen Elisabeth, the list could go on for 3,000 years. Sooo many STD's tho. Just cuz you don't die doesn't mean your dick wouldn't look like a chicken fry by the time Jesus rolled around.

If I'm in 1000 BC and immortal, I'm figuring out a way to parley that shit into a position where I'm only fucking virgins for like 2900 years. Once there are clinics and condoms and shit, then I can branch out to Hitler. But I'm not trynna piss fire for millennia.
 Just cut it off,painful but it will re-grow shiny as a star LIVE DIE AND LIVE AGAIN!  SHINY AND CHROME! The beautiful part of being immortal?  You can literally be cleansed by fire.

Just have a quick lava bath. I see that you like the dominant type. I'd do squats 24/7 for 3,000 years so I could have the sickest ass and hookup with all kinds of super hot machos.

Im not even a girl. Hell yeah... I could experience so much of history without fear of dying.  
  
I would love to compete with the gladiators, or fight in the American revolution.    
  
Edit:  Why does everyone assume I'd lose in the arena??? No faith...smh You're living the futures history right now. That was unexpectedly motivating  Except you ain't immortal. *continues to reddit I would accept it.

And after I have waited 3000 years doing whatever, probably seeing world and many big history events, I would come back the day I accepted this generous gift and take place of my former self and continue on as if nothing happened. There would a butterfly affect WAY too big for yourself ever to be born, and that would also be a paradox so I don't think your plans too solid :p  3000 years and immortal, huh? So back to 1000 BC. 

I'd have a hard time since I don't have a good ear for languages.

Job #1 would be the collection, preservation and dissemination of knowledge.

The Library at Alexandria wouldn't be founded until 300 BC so that gives me 700 years to establish myself, collecting necessary works and making sure they're safe and secure.

Around the time I'd arrive would see the first mass collections of cuniform tablets, storing them would be problematic so mass rubbings and etchings would have to be made.

I'd make sure that I hired staff to keep copies of all the works in multiple secret locations. That way they would be kept safe from disaster, war and the occasional witch hunt. It may be necessary to found some sort of secret society to make this happen.

As time marched on, I'd do my best to recover lost works before it was too late. We all know the story of Newton and his dog Diamond. Preserving works that otherwise would have been lost to time.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_%28dog%29

Carrying forward into the modern era, the same thing would be necessary with television programs and other mass media. Things that would otherwise be lost.

Using the vast wealth acquired over the centuries, I'd make sure to fund various recording devices so as to preserve the early years of BBC recordings, all the episodes of Doctor Who that were lost for example.

Then, the day after I was sent back in time 3000 years, my immortal self would re-emerge and go public with the now digital archive of three millenia of lost knowledge. Free to anyone capable of accessing it.




 Hey, look, its the founder of the Illuminati! One of the best responses that I had never expected to read. A organized preservation of knowledge like this would be an invaluable asset. I cant say that I would do anything much differently than this. All "worst case scenarios" apart, it would be nice for humanity to recognize you as some sort of universal collector of knowledge, and honoring your role by providing for everything you'll need, or coming to you for knowledge/wisdom. Since it's humanity, though, there's always bound to be someone that wants you gone to further advance their own agenda. Two chicks at the same time.  
   I dunno if there's enough time for you to find two chicks that are willing to do you, much less at the same time. ;) Sure why not?

I'd write things down with what I had, meet Jesus Christ, watch the roman empire rise &amp; fall.

As we got closer to what I knew I would invest in all the major corporations. It would be great if you meet Jesus and all he does is cheap card tricks and his story was blown way out of the proportion  Maybe he tried to meet Jesus, but couldn't find him. So he makes like a dozen friends and is telling then how maybe not being massive dicks to each other would be good for society. Until some Romans rock up and crucify him and shove him in some cave. People started flipping their shit though three days later when he's finished healing and was like "good thing they did it me instead of you mortal guys". Wow  yeah i think we just confirmed that jesus is a time traveler. &gt; yeah i think we just confirmed that jesus is a redditor /r/atheism would be mortified. The Man From Earth. I'd only ever accept immortality if I had the power to revoke it any time I wanted.  I'm game for living as long as I like, but not until the heat death of the universe.

Also no, I'd rather stay in my current time with my wife. Tell her it's rude to read over your shoulder.  Don't do it, OP, it's a trick! If some magical being asked me if I wanted this I'd have two questions. Can I bring anyone with me? Can I postpone this offer until a later date? 

I'd want to take at least my wife with me, or go back after she died.  Personally i would go back and create a cave painting of something like the reddit alien just to mess with people. I would set our culture 3000 years ahead on dank memes.  The Dank Ages. What if that just became the inspiration for the reddit logo for that reality, alternate timeline or something.  Finally someone in this thread makes sense. I'd be pretty wary of where I'd go back 3000 years. I'd have to constantly travel every 5-10 years or so to keep people from becoming suspicious about my anti-aging qualities. If they catch on, I'd be called a witch and be burned at the stake. And when that obviously doesn't kill me, they'd resort to hundreds of other horrifying torturous ways to try to kill me. And I imagine they'd eventually give up and just encase me in a very uncomfortable metal tomb and bury me deep deep below the earth for some excavator to (hopefully) find me one day. 

Since I obviously wouldn't want for that to happen, I'd go to someplace like India, where they worship deities (many of whom are female, which would make it easier for me) that take often human(ish) forms and have magical powers and shit. I'd just tell them that I was some immortal goddess, prove it to them by chopping off a hand (and growing it back), and then they'd build me a cushy temple and bring me food and massage my feet and stuff.  This was my thought. would have to be always on the move. I kind of like the semi-deity thing. You could even change hair color/style and accessory sets every 30-40 years or so, so any records kept or pictures painted / sculptures made would look to future anthropologists/historians as if you were actually a series of different people taking up the same 'deity' job, and it was just a facet of the religion that everyone maintained the 'facade' that you were the same person. You could probably get away with it right up until the invention of photography. Yes.    "Discover"  electricity.   Founding father of Atlantis.   Use infrastructure to build Rockets and Colonize Space  You'd first need to understand shit. 3000 years is plenty of time to understand a lot of shit.

We also won't have reddit so productivity will probably go up by a bit. I dont know, depending where you are booze is already a thing, I would find way to kill time with that alone. Plus we all know how long humans procrastinate when they feel like they have all the time in the world. It'll be like finishing highschool, you'll decide to take a year off to fuck around and then next thing you know is 3000 years has passed and you've still managed to do nothing with your life. me_irl What are the conditions of the immortality? Can I be killed? If not, what happens when I'm decapitated? Does my head grow back or do I just have to live carrying around my severed head? What if they burn me at the stake -- does it hurt? Will I heal?

Where do they leave me 3000 years ago? Someplace cool and civilized or in some jungle? Your head will grow back
Yes you will feel pain, but you will recover 
3000 years ago where you are now - so if in rome your sweet, unless you're like me in Australia and there's only more stuff to kill you. Well, I'm in the U.S. Since I'd rather not commit genocide by sneezing, I'll pass.  Well, if you give them all the future diseases, by the time the Europeans arrive the survivors will have bred and they'd all be immune.  Except I don't think any of us can give them immunity to smallpox

Edit: oh right, cowpox Itl happen anyways I like the system from the show "forever" but i'd modify it. I'd just have it that any time you die, you pop back up near the shore in the nearest body of water that could reasonably hold a human being. Though I think leaving a preservation resistant corpse would be better than having your old body pop out of existence.   A lot of people say they would invent things that have already been invented, while they would lack the means or knowledge to invent them.  Instead with 3000 years of time I would amass enough wealth to found a university or school of some sort.  This school would be based on reverse engineering modern day things.  I can't build a engine but I know that you can make a fractional distillation out of copper materials to make almost pure ethanol (a clean, efficient fuel, although somewhat dangerous).  I also understand that fuel is then fed into a closed piston, and by exploding the fuel the piston expands and creates kinetic energy.  The point of the school is that I would supply ideas and students would flock to my school to further develop concepts.  I would be the dumbledore of history, the greatest headmaster ever.  How Mendel is the father of genetics, I would be the father of all science and engineering.  No.

Or at least probably not. OP did not stipulate an opt out clause, so accepting would likely be too risky. It is impossible to predict the end of the universe, and there would be a very high risk that at some point you will be spending eternity alone in darkness. I would rather be dead.

However, it is worth mentioning that the very question implies that time travel is possible. So if you could some how secure a way to do that, that situation would be avoided.   You know how many unanswered questions about history I'd be able to answer, how many events I'd be able to witness?  And since we're talking about time travel here, I could even alter the course of history, not to mention preserve all the important writings of the ancients that have been lost.  In fact, I don't think this is even a "catch," I'd be all for it 100%. Would I still be white? asking the real questions. Seriously, my thought was " IDK... I am a black woman..." I'm a half Japanese and half Chinese woman and I had the same thought. I can't speak either language and I'm sure I'd look odd in either country (or any other country). I'd be screwed.

Have you read *Kindred*? [deleted] Have you ever read the hitchhikers guide series. There's this great line where Dent finds him self on a very primitive planet and he says to himself that despite coming from an advanced planet and traveling the universe he couldn't tell you how a toaster works.

I have a feeling that's what would happen to me in this case. 

There's also a ted talk about a guy that took a year off to make his own toaster. Pretty interesting.   I think that's how most people are nowadays.  I drive a car every day.  I can't fix the dang thing when it breaks unless it's something incredibly obvious.  I have to haul it to the repair shop.  My air conditioner broke a few weeks ago.  My knowledge of HVAC is zippy.  If I had to re-wire the breaker box in my house I would have no clue but electricity is vital to my life.  I work in IT.  I could build a computer from scratch assuming I had all the pre-made parts.  If you expect me to etch my own motherboard and build my own hard drive from nothing, you are screwed.  I think most people today really don't have any idea how the stuff around them works any more.   If you think about it, there's a nil chance that there exists a person that has the full body of knowledge of how to build a decent computer from silicon, solder, etc even given tools. Computers are so incredibly complicated nowadays.  You're probably right.  You could find a guy who could build a mobo, but he probably doesn't have the skills to build a hard drive and the hard drive guy probably doesn't have the skills to build an LCD.  More than that, there's the specialized tools you need.  How many people know how to build a soldering iron?  And how to build the transistors you'd need?  and that's not even getting to the problem of building a cpu by hand. unless they have nm sized fingers I could not tell you why even if my life depended on it, because I am well aware that it cannot and will not happen, but every time I see something I don't understand I say to myself "but, what if I am sent back in time, I should learn how it works so I can replicate it" I like to know how things work, but even that gets very complex.  I understand how an internal combustion engine works, but there's no way I could actually build one from scratch.  I know that a cell phone works by changing my voice into radio waves, broadcasting those waves across the air to a phone on the other end where they converted back to audio.  How would I build a device that actually does this?  I have no freaking clue.  There are so many things in modern society that I understand conceptually, but not on a level where that knowledge is all that practical.  Former radio tech here. Building a shitty radio is actually not that hard. It's building a *good* radio (i.e. one that doesn't take much electricity and doesn't interfere with other frequencies) that takes the bulk of electrical engineering in the field. I'm sure it's not that hard if you know what you're doing.  If you give me a pile of transistors and a soldering iron you might as well have a monkey at a typewriter banging out Shakespeare.  You'll get better results from the monkey.  You'll need some inductors, capacitors, and resistors as well. :)

I'm sure that if someone gave you five years and a huge pile of electrical components, you could figure something out. I love this bit by dara obriain:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVxOb8-d7Ic You wouldn't need to build some modern appliance or something. Just teach people to write centuries ahead of time, as well as whatever mathematics you know and things could probably work themselves out on their own. This perfectly explains the mysteries behind all the civ games. Well done Well, think about it. It makes even more sense

You. The player control what to research. You already know what these mean and they are big milestones that we are likely to remember.

Same with wonders. They are famous buildings that are symbolic to us.

You can't control works of art however, you'd have trouble recreating the mona lisa from memory. That's why you have to wait for great people to be born. The reason you know which people are great artists, musicians etc... is because you remember their names. Then you influence Da Vinci into making the mona lisa. Get sent back to ancient Australia - become king of Koala's - Slowly create Ewok people and rule over Australia as evil overlord  Are you saying you are going to keep fucking koalas until you finally cross breed an ewok? Would you not? Immortality has lead the Greek gods to do stupid things before... that's the truth. Zeus was known for sleeping with pretty much any animal he could; when you're immortal you get bored Send out koala warriors to infect the world with chlamydia, meanwhile you have developed the most effective cure. Become rich.  I was really thinking "huh, this sounds a lot like....yep" &gt; Peacefully unite all civilisations in Britain and Ireland by 600. 

Oh ffs, can't even survive a fantasy history without getting bothered by the cunts across the water! 
 I would live in the Middle East and specialize in history and theology for about the first 1500-1700 years. Then it would be about a thousand year scientific expedition, avoiding the plague, mongols, and such, before settling in Europe just in time to grab up a big plot of destined real estate. 

The stay in Europe would last through the Industrial Revolution, getting more riches along the way, before heading to the US to grab up another fat slice of future fortunate land.

Riches secured, including money flowing from various, highly-detailed texts published under pseudonyms throughout the centuries, it's time to get into the Stock Market. Following that would be gleaning the tech boom.

It's not all about the money.

**TL;DR It's about terraforming Mars.** Funny, somebody asked me this question when i was *much* younger. Yes, but first I'd ask if I got be changed to a man. Being a woman 3,000 years ago (or 2,000, or 500, or 50...) doesn't sound like much fun. Then, if I had the time, I'd also read up on some chemistry/engineering/technology/military strategy before going back so I can invent many things. I'd also get every vaccine in existence. 

But regardless, I'd go back in time. I'd become a shaman/goddess by using basic hygiene to cure people for illnesses. Seriously, just washing my hands before getting to work would make me seem like a genius compared to everyone else.

I'd use my status as healer extraordinaire to gain the favor of the most powerful ruler around and become their advisor. I'd teach them about public health and hygiene (stuff like, don't let everyone throw their shit out the window and flow like a river down main streets). I'd also gain control of military affairs so that I could take over the world with my knowledge of futuristic military strategy and technology. As world ruler, I'd try to be tolerant--give women equal rights, establish sign language and braille to help the deaf and blind achieve normal life far earlier than it normally would have been developed, have freedom of religion and non-religion.

I'd have a baby every ~100 years or so and establish each one as a ruler of different nations I've conquered, and watch my lineage grow.

I guess things would get kind of boring after a while but at least I'd be world ruler. It'd be sad to see the people I love die and leave me but I think it'd be worth it. Being a woman, if you got just one guy to follow you, you could wander out into the wilderness and start your own civilization, like a queen bee. This may or may not be faster than hijacking a pre-existing civilization. It would be slow to start, but have the advantage of not having to overcome pre-existing cultural and institutional roadblocks. For a male to do the same thing, they'd need a larger number of people to be interested in making people with them.
 The question is somewhat meaningless.  infinity/3000 = infinity.  Send me back 1 000 000 years so what, it's the first 30 billion years after the year 10 000 that worry me not having to deal with no internet for a few forgettable moments in my never ending life.  We found the engineer  I'd try to change as little as possible while building a huge knowledge of martial arts. Then  in 1993 with close to 3000 years training I'd beat the ever loving shit out of a 8 year old cunt called Brandon after he stole younger me's (time paradox) pencil.   I'd do it. I'd probably copy Connor McLeod's plan in the beginning of Highlander of laying low, making a fortune off long-term investments and fighting for armies with the knowledge that I'll be fine, and (in more modern times when paperwork is needed) changing my identity every forty years to that of some boy that died very young.

If I had my 2015 knowledge, and were truly immortal, I'd have more advantages. I'd know not to be in certain places: anywhere near Carthage when the Romans were big in the world, Paris as a rich person during the reign of whichever Louis was married to Marie Antoinette or be between France and Belgium in the 1910s, or London in the beginning of WW2 or in Dresden in early 1945.

Make sure you're able to buy things that you know will be worth a lot in future: Ming vases from traders going to and from China, some random painting from people you know will be celebrated after their deaths. If you see a name you know, try to invest in those companies you know will make a name for themselves like Andrew Carnegie's steel business in Pennsylvania or when a 24 year-old John D. Rockefeller set up an oil refinery in Ohio. If you're going to live forever, try to make it as comfortable as possible. Invest heavily in the stock market in the early 1920s but get out slowly during 1928 and 1929. 

Make sure you're in a position to get people's personal details whenever you need to. Social Security / National Insurance numbers, names, birth certificates, stuff like that. You won't need to use this often, but when you do need to it'll be invaluable.

For things that happened in your own lifetime, you'll have an even better advantage to make money... if you paid attention during your life. Buy shares in Apple when people say they're down and out in 1997. Get some Bitcoins early but change the money value for gift cards through Gyft before Mt.Gox goes belly-up and the price of one goes from a grand to just a couple of hundred. Buy shares during the 80s and 90s, [sell them when the news is full of stories of market downturn in 2000](http://money.cnn.com/2000/04/14/markets/markets_newyork/). Buy back when things start moving up again, [sell off when the Great Recession starts to hit in 2007 and (once again) the press is full of stories of the imminent downturn.](http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/27/markets/markets_0630/index.htm?cnn=yes) Wait until people [start blaming Obama for the low stock market](http://mediamatters.org/research/2009/05/04/hannity-faults-obama-during-stock-market-downtu/149812) and then buy in big [right when Obama says to in 2009](http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/09/investing/president-obama-stocks-market-march/) because [he seemed to know his history](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/10/14/opinion/20081014_OPCHART.html?_r=0) (shit, maybe Obama's immortal).

And now it's 2015. You're now over three millennia old. You can assume your original name for the first time in a long time, and you have a fortune hidden away to help safeguard your future. Some eccentric multi-billionaire that looked a lot like you is going to 'mysteriously die in a yachting accident' and leave you his fortune because 'you said something kind and insightful to him once'. 

Now keep looking at the births-deaths-marriages section in the newspapers. Some poor infant died in a car accident, and in a few decades that will be your identity. That's when having access to personal data comes in handy... you need to create a new second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit. Build my house above a limestone cave, then accept the deal. Now, 3000 years in the past, I steal some valuable stuff from that time, and wait in that cave for 3000 years. Now I buy new york and crash the economy. no, but if i had no choice i would:

1. go to egypt

2. show them some magnificent mathematics like %

3. claim i am god

4. prove it by being immune to snakes and spears

5. get money

6. fuck bitches

7. ???

8. Profit!! Fuck no. Why? Not him but I'll answer.  I'm not knowledgeable enough to advance technology to anywhere near we are now.  I'd have to wait 2980 years just to come back to the point where I was born.  On top of that, being immortal doesn't mean I'm capable of overpowering other humans or animals, so what if an animal eats me and realizes that my flesh grows  back?  That's some Prometheus shit right there.  And if I'm buried under an avalanche or something?  Fuck that.  Also, everyone I love will probably never exist due to the butterfly effect, and they won't know me even if I don't alter the world.  But honestly, I would be willing to sacrifice and suffer if it was like 200 years.  3000 is too much.  
  
After having some more time to think about it, it also depends.  How quickly does the body regenerate?  
Do I need sleep?  Ever run out of energy?  Need to breathe?  
How's my memory?  Does it have infinite capacity, or deteriorate?  Does perception of time speed up to a point where it's all just a blur?     
Although I'd still probably go with no because, what if someone decides immortality is too freaky and imprisons me forever?  Or if I decide I'm done with life and want to die a few hundred years in?  I imagine there comes a point when you are completely dehumanized and see everyone differently.  "Humans are disgusting". "They're all the same" etc.  After watching the human race for centuries it must get pretty awful.  
  
That's a lot of text &gt; I imagine there comes a point when you are completely dehumanized and see everyone differently. "Humans are disgusting". "They're all the same" etc. After watching the human race for centuries it must get pretty awful.

This is what I was thinking. I'm already disgusted with people NOW, and its far more civilized than it was 3k years ago. I'd probably go insane. Eh, you'd get over the loss of friends and family after a couple hundred years. Plus 3000 years ago isn't that long ago at all, just keep heading towards the Mediterranean or the middle east and you'll be fine. Yep, then kick myself in the ass for not paying more attention in history class! As long as there aren't loopholes like how I can't die, but I could be horribly disabled, and I would like to choose to be able to die someday so I am not stuck existing long after our sun goes out. Yes.  My plan would be to found and shepherd a school of rational evidence based beliefs but I'd probably just spend 3000 years half heartely jerking off waiting for someone else to invent internet porn. Nope, largely because I don't want immortality. Also I'd have to learn a whole new language because this is well before English, probably Algonquin. Ottawa winters are rough enough with indoor heating and hot water easily accessible. A lot of what I study doesn't exist yet, I would have to go to Athens and wait around for Socrates to get my discipline started, but that would be a hell of an ordeal, just getting across the Atlantic, including waiting 1000 years to maybe get the vikings to give me a lift. Then again I would be dismissed as soon as they found out I was a woman so I'd be better off with the Natives. I could warn them about colonialism.

Also no internet would suck. Who's the messiah now bitches? Marilyn Manson had a rib removed so he could suck his own dick. And he was Paul on The Wonder Years Nobody mentioning how killer bees were supposed to take over the US and kill us all?    Now we are hoping for more bees Cracking knuckles makes you arthritic. Is that still a thing? Some people still believe it, but IIRC, it was debunked several years ago. Didn't some maniac doctor only crack his knuckles on one hand for his entire life just to study this and compare to his other hand.

Edit: everyone telling me that one person isn't a sample size large enough... No shit it's just an interesting notion.  Christ. Donald Unger won a parody Nobel prize in medicine for cracking one hands knuckles for sixty years.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_joints

[edit] parody prize The food pyramid... Because every healthy diet includes four loaves of bread a day!  *Sponsored by the USDA* *Without us people would eat dirt or chairs* I think they'd try to get fiber through wooden doors. That's still taught at the school I went to We replaced history books in my high school that had practice problems beginning with "Imagine you live in the year 2000...".

When did we get rid of them you ask? 2011. Hey in 2011 the question made sense again.

Imagine you live in the year 2000. How will you entertain yourself when your internet comes to you on a 56k modem? How will you make plans with your friends when you don't have a cell phone? Make sure you're getting 6-11 servings of grains a day!  I hardly ate any fruits or vegetables, and focused on carbs for most of my childhood...no wonder I felt like crap. That parents should check all the candy on halloween incase some evil neighbours decide to poison their children.  The only reason we thought this? One guy.  

This dad claimed his kid died because the candy was poisoned. Nope, he killed his own child. Nobody has ever poisoned the candy, just this nutjob, and it was his own kid. So if we're going by that logic, kid should hide their candy from their own parents. I think there was also once a story about an aunt who poisoned her niece on Halloween, or something like that. But your point still stands--it's not a stranger committing those crimes against kids. It's a relative, and the target is planned. 

In the 90s, there actually was a scare with people putting needles in pop cans. There was another time Tylenol bottles were poisoned. But people today aren't afraid of pop cans and Tylenol bottles... but they're still afraid of the candy from the neighbor on Halloween. Christ, now you're not even supposed to let your kids go out on Halloween. Now parents schedule get-togethers in parking lots where the kids trick or treat each other's cars... I noticed we never get trick or treaters anymore. So I'd buy stuff I like (reeses, snickers, etc) so that I have an excuse to eat them. For like five years in a row we didn't get a single kid showing up, though last year, I had a car load of kids in Frozen costumes show up.

That bugs me too... the few kids that do trick or treat are being driven around by mom. Back in my day, we loved getting Huggies every few houses so we could hydrate. [deleted] Little juice things that come in a plastic barrel with a foil lid. http://i.imgur.com/biewG6y.png Luckily it's still 1999 here in Kentucky. We get 20-30 visits each year.

EDIT: Yes, yes.. we are all very excited for Windows XP. Anyways, did any of you catch Friends last night? That starter jackets were worth killing for That's the truth, back in 96 in elementary school I had to grow eyes in the back of my head. They wanted my Dallas Cowboys Starter Jacket BAD! Doesn't it feel weird that Starter is just a line of cheap Walmart shit now?  Mini discs were the way of the future for music They did much better in Asia. Ultimately doomed though. didn't help that Sony made sure that every Minidisc player had its legs tied together and a bag over its head. Copyright y'know. Sega does what nintendont  Pfft, Super Nintendo is what Genesisn't. Cell phones would blow up gas stations! Isn't it the static electricity from getting out of your car that does that?  
  
Or.. Have I been living a lie. Probably the latter. When I was rockin' my JNCO's with 24" pipes I would have been shocked to see the rise of skinny jeans. A pair of JNCO jeans with a bathing suit top. I thought I was THE SHIT.  JNCO Mammoths, bro. Fuck yeah.  Wallet chains were so you could pull your wallet up from down by your shoes ahahahah It's a shame really, that tablets and JNCO jeans missed each other by about 15 years, those pockets would have been perfect. That we had solved the boom-bust cycle and the Internet age was going to lead to economic growth without end.  It was fun to be so deluded. Piercing the right ear meant that you are gay. I got my left ear pierced. 

They said that was gay. 

Are you telling me that all this time I wasn't gay?  It didn't matter what ear you pierced, it would always be the gay ear. A coworker once asked which ear meant you were gay. I told him the one with the dick in it. He stopped asking me stupid questions after that. For the first half of the 90s, that HIV infection meant certain death. Actually most people probably believed it throughout the 90s, but it was true only until ~1995. I still believe this. I don't even have HIV and I'm certain that I'll die.  You will with that attitude! 

 I want to tell everybody a story. 

When I was 25 in the summer of 1996, I had been hanging with this guy who dealt MDMA. Because he liked me, he would give it to me for free. We had a beautiful summer. 

One Sunday afternoon after rolling all night at his house, we were moving slowly. He starts complaining to me about a 'really sore throat'. He went to the Dr. the next day, and the Dr. diagnosed him with candida, basically told him he had a mushroom growing in the back of his throat cause his body had no immune system and couldn't fight off yeasts, or whatever. He diagnosed him with full blown AIDS right on the spot. After they did my friend's blood work, they found that he had 3 T-cells left. 

I thought for certain that my friend would die. Weeks went by, and his Dr. put him on the new protease-inhibitors. A year later his T-Cell count was back up to normal and he had gained weight. It was a complete turnaround. My friend had come-back from the brink of death after a timely medical intervention. If he had been in a worse state a few months earlier, he might not have made it at all. 

So, there really was a cut-off line right in the middle of the 90s, were the viscious-ness of HIV started to subside. Sometimes it blows my mind thinking about it.  There's this great story in the documentary *We Were Here* told by a guy who ran a flower shop on a corner in San Francisco. For years he'd watched guys walk by the shop, and they'd get skinnier and skinnier, and less healthy, and then they'd have a cane, and then they'd be in a wheelchair, and then after a while, he'd just never see them again. 

And then in 1996 there was a guy who used to ride his bike past the shop, but who had gotten sicker and sicker just like guys had for fifteen years. Except suddenly one day... he *wasn't* in the wheelchair anymore. And then he *didn't* have the cane either. And pretty soon, he was back up on his bicycle again!

Yay for science, huh? I really recommend that documentary to anyone who hasn't seen it. &gt;told him he had a mushroom growing in the back of his throat

Well that's fucking nightmarish Probably just a fungal infection, not an actual mushroom. You inhale fungi spores all the time when you're outside, your body is just good at killing them. So it wasn't literally a delicious portobello growing in him?  &gt; they found that he had 3 T-cells left. 

Probably 3 per ml or mmol (or some other unit) of his blood. 3 in his whole body would be impossible to measure. Yeah, because if 3 got measured, they wouldn't be in his body anymore and he'd then have zero. Apple might go bankrupt. Good guy Microsoft bailing them out! "Still facing lawsuits from Apple" Microsoft bailing them out.  Of course, Apple probably would have lost in the end, but Microsoft was under intense anti-trust scrutiny, and I suspect they wanted to just settle it and be done.  Phones would get smaller and smaller. [deleted] And that, kids, is why our phones got a little chubby.

Edit: punctuation Also a other related belief: That Nokia would remain king on the cellphone market or a at least be in the very top for many, many years to come.

Edit: Also a relevant belief: Apple had no real future and only catered to a niche demographic, not to mention that for a time they where believed to have no future at all since they where only 3 months from bankruptcy at its worse. FWIW, Nokia was the #1 phone manufacturer in the world until like 2012 or something. They were kinda right I remember there was a big concern that children's backpacks were getting too heavy and affecting their backs. There was a discussion that perhaps between the papers and books, younger children were being given too much homework. I haven't heard anything about it for many years now. Oh god, the rolling backpacks. Cool for exactly 2 seconds, and then only brought shame and ridicule to whoever carried one.  I felt that shame, you could wear it on your back, but the tubes that the handle collapsed into were so uncomfortable. Fun to play bumper backpacks though. I used to hate getting the pamphlets warning me not to overload my backpack. I didn't *volunteer* to carry twenty pounds of books everyday, goddammit! Give us more than 3 minutes between classes so we actually have time to drop off books we don't need at our lockers and then maybe the problem wouldn't be a problem! They wouldn't let us go to our lockers between classes because of guns and bombs that apparently every student had in their lockers. You didn't have guns and bombs in your locker?   There was a rash of bomb threats at my school one year.  They'd always have to evacuate and call in dogs even though we knew it was always a prank.

One time, all the teachers/administrators started freaking out, they brought in buses and ordered us all to stand behind them.  All these cop cars and fire engines started showing up.  It was incredibly unusual and we thought that maybe this time it was real.  

Turns out some kid left his walkman on rewind in his locker and it kept making a clicking noise.  Those were crazy times. *Walkmans are now banned.* Hell give me a locker. My Mom believed, that if she got on email that "the pedophiles would see her." Why would they even want to? Right. I had to explain to her, first email doesn't work that way. Secondly, pedophiles don't care about 50 year old women.  My great grandma still freaks out any time I tell her she should sell something online she says "I don't want my name to be on the online" Eggs are bad for you.  

No, wait, eggs are good for you!  

Correction, eggs are bad for you again.  

...Or are they?

Edit : I get it, Lewis Black and the Simpsons, thanks I remember this debate. You forgot to include brown eggs.

Edit: [People thought brown eggs were premium organic,]( http://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-white-and-brown-eggs-word-of-mouth-113678 ) brown eggs aren't bad for you. Of course they are better, they are whole wheat. No, no, no. They're just the ones that came out the wrong end. Where are we on that now? I think they're currently both good and bad for you. It's like schrodinger's cat laid an egg. Or it didn't. We aren't sure yet. Bachelors in nutrition here. Eggs are good for you now (always). People demonized them because the yolk is high in cholesterol, and dietary cholesterol was thought to raise body cholesterol levels. We now know that isn't true (except in a small minority of the population: termed "hyper responders"). Eggs are filled with good things and you most likely should be eating them.

I would always choose butter over margarine to avoid trans fats. IIRC there is new research into saturated fat and it may not be as bad for you as we previously thought, but the jury is still out. Trans fats, however, are bad news. Don't forget the great Butter v. Margarine debate. WHICH ONE'S BETTER!? That went back and forth forever. 
 OMG! I finally got it! Totally unrelated but reading your comment made me realize why on South Park when the boys dressed Butters up as a girl to spy on the slumber party they named him "Margerine" but pronounced "Mar-jer-een". I feel like a dumbass! Did you know mantequilla is butter in spanish? This was in the last of the meheecans episode. My parents refused to buy margarine. They said there was no way something artificial could be better than actual butter. We never used a lot of butter anyway, so it's not like we needed a huge tub of it. 

Now I can't stand the taste of margarine and only use butter. I still don't know if my parents did me a favor or if I'm slowly killing myself.  Margarine's full of trans-fatty acids, which are extremely bad for you. It is almost impossible to find actual margarine on the grocery shelves today (the last time I actively looked, I only saw it in sticks for baking) Most of the stuff you will find (Country Crock, Parkay, Promise, etc.) are just vegetable oil spreads. so, what's the difference between a vegetable oil spread, what most people would call margarine, and actual margarine?  
Edit:  What I'm reading is what the stuff they now call margarine is, but nothing about what it is supposed to be.  I thought margarine *was* a vegetable oil spread. Google turned up [this link from land o lakes](http://www.landolakes.com/blog/is-it-a-butter-margarine-or-spread-they-are-not-created-equ) that says margarine has to have 80% fat content just like butter does whereas vegetable oil spread can replace some of that percentage with water. [This betty crocker link](http://www.bettycrocker.com/how-to/tipslibrary/baking-tips/butter-margarine-spreads-oils-in-baking) agreed and described some other products as well.  Margarine is fake butter. Vegetable oil spread is fake margarine.  Well, someone better get working on the fake vegetable oil then.  That's butter! So one of those Egg Council creeps got to you too, huh? Uh...you've got it all wrong, Homer.  

It's not like that! YOU BETTTER RUN EGG! It was thought that eggs were bad for you because of the cholesterol in them. Turns out dietary cholesterol doesn't really affect serum cholesterol levels, or at least not enough to be a concern.

It's pretty simplistic dietary thinking. Being fat is bad, so eating any fat at all will make you fat, so don't eat fat. Cholesterol in your body clogs your arteries, so don't eat anything with cholesterol in it.

I believe there was a very old study where some guy fed rabbits a tremendous amount of cholesterol and they got heart disease. 1) we are not rabbits, 2) nobody consumes cholesterol in those amounts. Body wash is for women. 

This was a weird one, I remember when they started making body wash for men they had to do these weird hyper masculine campaigns to convince you it was okay. My first bottle of Old Spice actually said "won't wash away testosterone" on it.

Edit: fascinating that some people today don't realize the other option is bar soap, when bar soap was the primary mancleaner before. The manly puff-ball sponges.  I fucking love loofahs. as a guy, I'll readily admit I save so much money on body wash and it lathers up real good on a loofah. Try those Japanese body scrub cloths. It's like a loofah material but can be rougher if you want. You can unroll it into a long cloth to scrub your back.  I don't quite understand what you're talking about, but I'm *extremely* interested. Go to your local korean market and buy this:

And pick up one of these for max exfoliation/torture:

and you're ready to bathe like a korean.  Alright! I'm sure there's a Korean market somewhere in my small North Texas town. And don't forget to grab some of [these](http://imgur.com/KQkjptH) while you're there! You mean like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQm1_ff5Pb0 That we could always ask Jeeves. Jeeves and Siri should get married and have useless children In my community here in Norway everyone (at least all kids around my age) thought MacGyver was dead in real life (as in Richard Dean Anderson). I have no idea where that rumor came from, but it was eventually accepted as fact. It was not before the rise of the internet this became debunked.

Its a funny example on how all kinds of rumors and/or jokes could get a hold and become "fact" before we had the ability to instantly check its validity on the internet. Was stargate not a thing in Norway? 512mb is plenty. "Now that zip disks are replacing floppy drives, you will never be able to fill an entire disk in your lifetime" -elementary school teacher Even in 1999 Zip disks were laughable and totally obsolete. Maybe. But in '95, they were how you trucked your data around.  My wife and I were doing contract work at @Home, developer of cable broadband (now with Comcast), and she impressed the blazes out of our customers there by uploading work she'd done at home to an ftp site and then downloading it on our customers' computer, instead of lugging a Zip Disk and risking "the click of death."  I keep telling her she invented "the Cloud." She sneers. What's the click of death?  Zip disks were notorious for failing and when they did, the drive would just keep clicking [like so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v04nBp5u_Zg&amp;noredirect=1). Hell, in 2003 when I was working at Officemax, we were selling 128mb memory cards for over $100.  When I was working at Officemax in 1997, we were selling 16MB EDO memory in pairs for over $100.

Hard drives were barely scratching the 4GB mark.  The drool-worthy video cards of the day were the 3dfx Voodoo Rush, and eventually the Voodoo 2 but more importantly the Voodoo 3.

(Many people would be surprised to know that 3dfx pioneered the SLI capability of video cards, which NVidia reintroduced in 2004 several years after they purchased 3dfx)

I also remember selling the 100MB Zip disks, but more importantly the 1GB and 2GB Jaz cartridges.  I can't tell you how many customers I'd spoken to who said "2GB?  Who needs 2GB?" I remember that Google announced Gmail with 1GB storage on April 1, 2004, and many people were convinced it was an April Fools joke. I had all of those beta invites and for like a week I was cool. Then they opened it up to anyone being able to sign up and that was that :( "i doubt a game would ever take up more than 100mb"

*looks at GTA V. taking up 55gb*

"like i will ever need a gb"

*looks at 1.3tb hardrive, and 256gb SSD* Hell, Fallout 2 had a completely insane install option back in 1998.  http://imgur.com/lVwDW9F

624mb... That's most of my Win 95 hard drive partition! Feathers were for birds, not dinosaurs.

[Edit: I know birds are dinosaurs. Stop telling me. That idea wasn't exactly widespread in the 90s either](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3a75dg/what_did_people_believe_in_the_1990s_that_we_no/cs9z1oe) Now we gotta fix the "shrink wrap dinosaur" issue which Hollywood kinda created. Someone more paleontologist-ey than me pointed this out to me.

Go look at Jurassic Park dinosaurs as a good example. On their heads, it looks like there's a thin layer of skin and flesh over the bone and you can clearly tell the skull structure. Now, that makes them very recognizeable when you're used to starting at bones... but most modern creatures look pretty different with their flesh and muscle on. Go look at a human (or any) skull and note all the divots, inlays and cavities you *don't* see from outside. Dino noggins likely had those extra layers too. This--- actually makes a lot of sense, and makes me irrationally angry at you for pointing it out. Agreed, fuck that guy. But look at modern birds and reptiles. Their skulls look very close to how they look, except birds have feathers covering. Not many extra layers hanging out on lizards and birds heads.

Edit: My most voted comment on Reddit is about dinosaurs! 8 year old me would be proud! This--- actually makes a lot of sense, and makes me irrationally joyous with you for pointing it out. Agreed, lets fuck that guy.

 Supposedly, this is what a baboon would look like if it were drawn the way we draw dinosaurs: http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/2/1/1/250211_v1.jpg

So basically, when you depict an animal that way, they *all* end up looking like our classical image of dinosaurs. Personally, this excites me because it makes it easier for me to imagine these animals as, well.... *animals*, but I imagine this fact destroys a lot of peoples childhoods. Sorry if reality is boring, kids. Whoah bro fucking **warn** me next time before you show me some kinda damn hell baboon christ on a cracker There's a whole gallery of that stuff[ here.](http://imgur.com/a/BEz4r) Sweet dreams. That's blowing my mind. So these terrible looking velociraptors really could just be the bones of giant chickens? Yep, Velociraptors were almost certainly feathered. Giant chickens with mean claws. Yes, but this is a lizard skeleton: https://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/548/flashcards/708430/jpg/lizard-skeleton.jpg

This is a bird skeleton: http://www.biology-resources.com/images/bird-skeleton-big.jpg

They look very similar to their flesh and bone counterparts, so comparing dinosaurs to mammal reconstruction is not the best perspective. To show you how much mammals deviate from the Skelton's by comparison, here's a dog skeleton: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Dog_anatomy_lateral_skeleton_view.jpg/930px-Dog_anatomy_lateral_skeleton_view.jpg

While it is very possible that we are wrong about a lot of things, we have a good idea of general body plan. In addition to these comparisons, we have stuff like this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_(fossil)

While specimens like this are incredibly rare, even one or two can easily form the baseline for reconstruction. Its not exact, but its far more exact than most people on this thread are saying. I'm just trying to imagine a T-Rex with chubby cheeks Jurassic Park had the misfortune of coming out a year before scientists started finding all those insanely well-preserved fossils at that site in NE China.

it seems increasingly likely that the last common ancestor of all dinosaurs had primitive, down-like proto-feathers and that they were secondarily lost in the larger species for whom the bigger concern was with staying cool. They even mention dinosaurs were like birds in the first one... and then 30 minutes later they drop, "so we spliced them with frogs."

YOU JUST FUCKING SAID THEY WERE MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO BIRDS. .. WTF In the book they talk about knowing they had feathers, but that's not the public image so they make them frog-like. Blockbuster Video was forever.  Turns out, it was just a rental. A rental that never paid its overdue fees. I rented Star Wars Episode II from a Blockbuster yesterday (for my four year old son). They have pretty reasonable prices these days and you can choose 1 day or 5 day rentals. 

Edit: Mentioning Blockbuster and a Star Wars prequel in the same post no es bueno. To answer some of your questions: 

Yes, my son has seen Episode IV, V, and VI. He saw Episode I and liked the pod racing and Darth Maul so we might as well finish out the prequels. On weekends we eat smores, camp out in the living room, and watch movies on the projector. I thought this would a good movie in that situation.

Yes, I live a mile away from a Blockbuster and I am sorry  they no longer exist in your area. I live in a poor border city where I imagine a lot of people still don't have debit cards or credit cards, so Blockbusters still thrive here.

Yes, Blockbuster is pretty much the same as you might remember it. I got the five day option and it was 1.49. Also it is kinda nice of having the tactile feel of getting the movie from the shelf and taking it up to the register. I might as well do it while I have the chance since the half dozen Blockbusters we had in my city are also dwindling down. 

Oh boy am I gonna get shit for this, it is a Fullscreen DVD. I KNOW, IKNOW! They didn't have it on Bluray. But my son doesn't mind, let him rough it out. When I was his age I had to watch movies on a black and white TV that had "Motel 6" stamped on the side. Time traveller? John Titor doesn't know about iTunes. Pluto is a planet.  Scroopy Noopers? Pluto is a cruel, cruel celestial dwarf. It's not Jerry. You hear that everyone? Pluto's a fuckin planet!  Dietary Fat is bad, Carbs are good. And everything needed to contain oat bran. They put oat bran in damn near everything.

 That being an IT guy guaranteed you an awesome career for the rest of your life. That we'd never be able to fill up a fifty gig drive. My brother was interning at Bell Labs in about 1996-7, and he told me in awed tones that they had a *nine terabyte* file server.

To be fair, he also told me that in 20 years, I'd be able to fit everything I've ever created on something small enough to lose.  This would be mostly true of a 64GB microSD card, except that I generate frankly silly amounts of data when I create things. Astronomer here! People believed in the early 90s that we knew a far larger fraction of what the universe is made of, and that the universe was perhaps going to someday collapse on itself or maybe stop expanding.

Then in the late 90s the discovery of dark energy happened, and we've been scratching our heads on that one ever since! Did we truly discover dark energy? I thought that and dark matter were theoretical? Well evidence of dark energy was discovered (dark matter has had weird observations supporting it for decades), with this unprecedented and still-unexplained expansion of the universe. Is that better? Many people in the '90s believed in life after love  I really don't think I'm strong enough :(  But I know that you'll get through this.  Bill Gates was evil and Steve Jobs was benevolent Purchasing mass amounts of Beanie Babies would be a wise investment, and virtually guarantee a comfortable, prosperous future.  I had a book that told me the predicted value of my beanie babies out to 30 years in the future. Wow, I thought I was going to be rolling in $$$$$$ The way people used to talk about them, you'd think those things (along with first edition Charizard cards) were supposed to become the new dominant currency and liberate us all from economic instability.  Hey, first edition holo charizard goes for $200+

I'd rather have a black lotus though. i'd settle for cards i could play in legacy. The real winners were the people who made books detailing how much individual Beanie Babies sold for. I bought... several. Also, the companies that made those plastic things you put around their tags so they wouldn't get damaged. No one I knew was actually allowed to play with them if they didn't have those things on. I immediately cut those off my beanie babies because who wants to play with a stuffed animal with a big tag sticking off its foot? How is it 2015 and I still felt a sharp, immediate pang when I read that you cut the tags off of your Beanie Babies? My mom collected, bought, sold and traded beanie babies for about 5 years and man she fucking did it right.  She would use my brother and I (4 and 10, respectively when she started) to her advantage.  We would creep up to the front of the massive crowd of weirdos at the Hallmark store and, thanks to our mother's training, knew exactly which ones to grab once the doors were open.  Seriously, think Black Friday status...these people were not joking around.  If some monster of a woman tried to snatch the Garcia bear or whathaveyou that I tracked down my mom would say really loudly, "ARE YOU STEALING FROM MY CHILD??!!" and they would sheepishly back off not knowing my mom was going to turn around and sell that shit on Ebay. 

Don't even get me started on Teenie Beanies (sold as McDonald's kids meal toys).  I can't even look at a chicken mcnugget without feeling deep regret and shame.  The final straw to her Beanie Baby craze was me hysterically crying while simultaneously choking down a 4 pc chicken mcnugget (because bitch don't waste food) and saying something like, "I never want mcdonalds again."

She ended up making about 75k on the whole thing.  15+ years later and they still give all the cousins beanie babies for birthdays. 

EDIT: Thanks for the gold, I love that my first guilded comment is about my mother's obsession with Beanie Babies.

UPDATE: My mom used to pay me $5 an hour to make 'tag protectors' so the tags stayed in mint condition.  I remember doing this on her waterbed so it was a sublimely 90's moment.   [deleted] You might say she's a veritable TYcoon!

edit; hahaha thanks for the gold!! I feel that warren Buffett wasn't as ruthless as his mom... My mom collected all the Teenie Beanies, sewed on some loops, and has the entire collection as Christmas tree ornaments.

And she doesn't just mix them with all the other ornaments on like, the family tree.  No, she has like 7 trees, and one is exclusively Teenie Beanies.  It's actually quite impressive.

EDIT: I don't have photos of it, I'm sorry.  Yes she has a lot of trees, no we were not/they are not rich, all trees are fake, all are full sized, and my mother is a compulsive shopper/decorator.  I would ask for her to take a photo, but we still have like 3 more months until people start busting out trees. SEVEN trees? Are they all themed? Pic plz! I remember this.

I also remember one of my mom's friends getting pissed at me for cutting the tags off the ones I got as a kid. FFS PEGGY I WAS 4 AND WANTED THEM TO BE MORE REALISTIC! All of my Beanie Babies are sitting next to the Tickle Me Elmo collecting dust. That only nutjobs and wierdos thought the government was listening in on our calls. Somewhere out there, in some landfill, your Tamagotchi is still waiting for you like that dog in futurama. That you won't have a calculator in your pocket.

Fuck you math teacher. At this point, anytime anyone said they wouldn't have some convenient thing in their pocket was wrong.  I remember when debit cards were becoming widely used and we spent multiple days in math class learning how to balance a checkbook. I told my teacher by the time we are adults it's going to be simple as checking your account on the internet.

Ridicule was the response. They even said checks were easier. You need to learn cursive.  When you get to college all of your final drafts will need to be in cursive.  No cursive, no future. Being forced to learn cursive as a kid but needing to use print through college, my handwriting now drifts from print to cursive making it look more like some ancient phonetic encryption. I love my print/cursive mix! 

It's a bit like [oliver jeffers style handwriting](http://www.designofthepicturebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/img_1478.jpg)  5th and 6th grade - cursive, cursive cursive! 

7th grade - what is this, cursive? I can't read this - do it over. 

I was unhappy.  For me it was:

3rd grade - You NEED cursive or you'll never make it through college

4th grade - Keep practicing that cursive!

5th grade - Okay, cursive is a bit hard to read, maybe submit assignments in print but practice cursive at home!

6th grade - Okay stop with the cursive already. It's obnoxious and difficult to read

7th grade - Are you really trying to submit something to me in print? Type it up or 0. Pressing A+B or one or the other would give you a better chance at catching pokemon. That newborns don't need anaesthesia for surgery. That practice ended in the 80's though. Now of course the flip side of that coin is the concern that anesthesia is harming neural development in infants. You just can't win when it comes to cutting open babies.  That after CD's we would use crystals. Silicon memory chips *are* crystals.

^^^mind ^^^blowwwn what do you think a solid state drive is? joke's on the 90's, we went back to vinyl records. the housing market can only go up Early 90s: You need to know how to use a card catalog.

Mid 90s: I NEED A BEEPER!

Late 90s: Yahoo will remain a dominant Internet force. Something a bit specific to my field, which is Error Correcting Codes.

Error Correcting Codes are the systems that encode basically every signal you send or receive via WiFi, ethernet cables, TV cable, satellite, cellular network etc, as well as every piece of data that you store on your flash drive, hard drive, SSD, CD, DVD etc. Their purpose is to transform a given amount of information (say, 1000 bits) into a slightly larger amount of information (say, 1500 bits) in such a way that you can recover the original 1000 bits from the encoded 1500 bits (obviously) *even* if a fair amount of these 1500 bits have suffered errors.

Let's say you have a text that is 1000 bits long. You send it to someone directly, and due to many physical constraints, errors can happen, and they happen at a rate of 1%. Roughly 10 bits will be erroneous when the recipient gets your text. A 1000-bit long text is basically 125 characters long (a tweet). That means that you can have roughly 10 wrong characters out of the 125 you had in the beginning. That's bad. You don't want that. So instead, you encode them into 1500 bits with the property that you can decode with no error as long as less than 50 errors occur. Roughly 15 errors occur every time (because the error rate is 1% and you send 1500 bits). Therefore, you can recover your text with no error. That's what Error Correcting Codes are for.

Anyways, back in the 1990, the scientific community that works on Error Correcting Codes basically considered that they had developed the best codes and that these could not really be beaten. They had graphs that showed the "theoretical" bound to how good these codes could be (in terms of how much more bits you need to send to provide a certain amount of protection to your message), and the performance of many codes, and all the best codes they had seemed to converge to a second "practical" limit, below the theoretical one.

And this guy, with an education in electronics, not really known in the coding community at all, publishes this paper that is a bit too foreign to gauge without doing a lot of simulations. And he claims that he beat every other code by a relatively large margin, and approaches the actual theoretical limit. Many experts didn't even discuss the paper because of how strongly they believed it was impossible. And yet, every single standard in telecommunication since the early 2000s uses either that guy's codes (called Turbo Codes), or LDPC codes that use the same kind of principles in their decoders.

It's probably just me, knowing the guy and the field, but I really like that story. I was taught in college in the 90s that glass was a liquid. Believed it until my kid was in high school a few years ago and told me different. :)  Some argue that in order to be a true solid, a substance has to have a crystalline structure of some sort. Glass does not have a crystalline structure, so by this logic, glass is a supercooled liquid, and flows at a super slow speed. It makes sense to me, but I don't think it should be considered a liquid. If you ask me, crystalline and non-crystalline solids should be their own separate substates. It shouldn't be a huge deal since there are already about [two dozen different known states...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter)

Edit: I should mention that the thing about glass flowing is a myth that has been debunked, to my knowledge, since people keep correcting me on that. And also, why the fuck did I get gold for this...?

Also, I had forgotten that there is a name for the "non-crystalline solids" I was talking about; amorphous solids. Credit to several redditors below. There will always be only 3 Star Wars movies.

Doctor Who was cancelled in 1989, and it's never coming back.

The N64 has ridiculously good effects.

Edit: To be clear, I never said the Nintendo 64 was a bad console. Some of my favorite games of all time (Ocarina of Time, original Smash Bros, Super Mario 64) were on the N64. But you can't deny that games today have better visuals.  There was the 1996 tv movie though. Women can't participate in trench warfare because they will die from a yeast infection if they get too dirty. 

Edit: This blew up overnight and I got a lot of questions as to whether this was a belief in the 1990's.  It was a reference to this [Newt Gingrich chestnut from 1995](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/us/gingrich-s-piggies-poked.html). Lol, *trench* warfare You dig that sort of thing?  Fire in the hole! We used to think that eating foods high in cholesterol (e.g. eggs) would increase the amount of cholesterol in your blood.

Edit to add: my statement was *slightly* too strong, and some people don't like my source.  Should have said "unless you have diabetes or are obese". Here are some other sources,

Ha! Flood the percentage of people getting degrees and voila! Edit: TL;DR: world was supposed to end in 96. It did not

True story coming up.

In 1994, my family regularly attended a church in  Minnesota. One day, they had a guest speaker. He claimed he was a prophet. His name was Dimitri Duduman. I'll never forget that name because it's Dimitri Duduman. Pronounced "Doo-doo-man".

Anyway, Duduman showed us a segment of the New Testament he had decoded. And he was alarmed to learn that the end of the world would commence in the year 1996.

He had proof. Word choice that relate to old Hebrew numbers, and so on.

Here's one specific. The book of revelations (Written by the Apostle John) mentions a vision of a mountain being cast into the sea and giant black locusts with faces of men. According to Duduman, what John was seeing was nuclear war. When you detonate a nuclear warhead underwater, it creates a big mountain-shaped explosion. John saw this and described it the best way he could. And the locusts with man-faces? These were noisy black helicopters,  and the man-faces were simply the faces of the pilots inside the aircraft. Again, John wouldn't know what a helicopter was, so if he saw one in a vision, he would probably describe it as a giant black locust with a man's face. 

These are just two of the things Duduman determined and shared with us. He gave us pamphlets with a map of the USA, and several mushroom clouds lining the coasts, indicating where nuclear missles would blow up as the tribulation commenced, initiating the apocalypse. 

For those who dont know, the tribulation is 7 years of agony and suffering during which you will wish for death and God won't allow you to die because you gotta suffer through it. The good people are magically teleported to Heaven before the tribulation in an event known as the Catching Up of the Ecclesia, more commonly called "The Rapture".

We lived in rural minnesota, living off the land. We raised animals, grew crops and we were home-schooled because President Clinton was gonna to order Martial Law and take children from their parents to be re-educated. So we lived in hiding.

I lived in constant fear.

One day, when I was 10, I woke up late. I went downstairs and my parents were gone. So was my brother. I was all alone in my house. I ran outside, screaming hysterically. I fell to my face and begged God to kill me so I didnt have to suffer through the tribulation. I didn't care if I had to go to Hell,  I just didn't want to experience the tribualtion alone. 

I heard a vehicle coming down our long, rural driveway. I ran inside and ran upstairs and locked my door. It must be government agents. They were here to take me. I'm still begging God to kill me. I consider jumping from my second story bedroom window to run away, but I'm too scared. I wish I had grabbed my shotgun (yes, 10year old me had a 20 gauge).

The front door opens and someone comes in... I'm quietly and frantically begging God for death. I slide my window open, knowing I won't die if I jump, but I'll probably break my legs.

And then...

"Hey, [xxxx](enter my real name here)!!" My mom's voice calls out, "We had to go Mr. Benson's today to buy some beef.  Come help us carry it in!" (We bought beef in half-cows).

It was my mom and family. I almost jumped. I begged for death. I thought I was done for. I would've shot them on accident if I had my gun. And it was just my mom.

After that, I'd wake up all night every hour or so and I'd run into my mom's room to make sure she was still there.

So that's my entry. Thats what we believed in 1994-95 that turned out to be bullshit. 

In 1997, my brother and I left my mom to move in with my drug-addled father. 

I'm still not sure if that was the right choice. I suppose it was. My dad is awesome, even though he likes drugs a lot. At least he loves us more than anything. More than God, more than meth, more than anything. My dad is the best.

And my crazy mom passed away last year. I know she only wanted what she thought was best for us. I just wish she had been a little bit less crazy than she was.

Miss ya, Momm... If they don't have the same favourite interest/hobby, try each other's together. It's really cool to see the other person get super passionate about something they love teaching you, and you get to learn something new. Also gives you a chance to learn more about their past, what motivates them, things like that. My SO and I literally hate most of each others hobbies. We've tried, but we both just get frustrated/bored. Instead, we find new hobbies to have together. Right now, we're trying out knitting.

It's fun because we're able to explain it to each other when one gets confused. If your hobbies are boring for you two, but knitting is fun, I am officially scared for what mindnumbing hobbies you two picked up in life.  I would suggest to them Extreme Watching Paint Dry. My wife and I did a puzzle last week. Kids were asleep, quiet in the house, no talking, just puzzle doing. Was oddly therapeutic.  My boyfriend and I try and do at least one or two every year. We'd do more but right now we just don't have the space in our tiny apartment to sacrifice our only table for 1-2 weeks at a time. Making puzzles is kind of amazing because you don't have to talk but you're working together, and you're concentrating enough that you're not really thinking about every-day stressful things. And at the end you feel really accomplished! Puzzles are a beautiful thing.  I can't do puzzles anymore because I get constantly paranoid that there's a piece missing.

"I've been searching for 5 minutes and can't find this one goddamned piece!  Oh no!  What if it's gone?  Maybe they forgot to package this one piece?  Maybe I already dropped it and the cats batted it away somewhere?  Well I don't want to do this puzzle if its missing pieces.  That would be annoying to finish the whole thing just to find out I'm missing a single piece!"

And then I just end up putting the puzzle away because I'm no longer relaxed while doing it, I'm stressed about pieces that probably aren't even missing. Next time you try to do a puzzle take one piece and throw it away. Finish the puzzle without worrying about it not being completed because it won't be. Tie a noose while you're at it  Go on a road trip. You can learn a ton about someone by how they handle a road trip. I drive and listen to music.

She reads a book, complains about my music tastes (conveniently forgetting 90% of her favourite bands she found through me), and then falls asleep.

My girlfriend is incapable of being in a car for more than 30 minutes without starting to doze off. my guy is the same!!! i swear i'll be driving for less than 10 minutes, i look over and he's sleeping like a baby. it's cute but also makes road trips weirdly lonely It does!  She'll wake up every once in a while and go "I don't really like this song..." and then fall back asleep. haha that sounds like him except he only wakes up to ask how close we are to food You guys should do a double date road trip. lmao i'd rather see both their SO's go on a road trip together.   "Jesus take the wheels"

*both fall asleep as a random Mexican drives them along with a shipment of cocaine across the border* El coyote always knows the way. Trust in coyote She must have carcolepsy A few trips ago, we went from VA to MA to visit his family. He insisted on taking the stick shift, so he had to do all the driving. I stayed up the whole ride, literally looking out the window and making conversation here and there. 

I was raised on road trips as a kid, so I either entertain myself or nap. When we do the straight drive, though, we are both bonkers by the time we hit CT.  A few months ago my boyfriend and I drove from Denver to Roswell, NM.  It's about 9 hours, and it was my longest car ride by far (from MA where in just 2 hours I can be in any number of states).  I was shocked at how well we did.  No fighting at all.  Everything went so smoothly, and I had a ton of fun.  In contrast, I drove just 1.5 hours with my ex-boyfriend and we wanted to kill each other.   Get fit together. Or get fat together. Whatever seems more fun. GET FUCKING SWOLE TOGETHER Swolemates AM I AWAITED IN SWOLHALLA? Got fat together. Now, nineteen years later, getting fit together. It seems to work.  Or get fit together, and I then slowly get fat over an extended period of time.  Cook together and sit down at THE TABLE to eat together.  No phones, no TV, just the two of you enjoying each others' company with no distractions.   My BF and I do this nearly every night unless we eat out. 100% devoted attention always feels good, especially after a long day at work.  Be comfortable in silence with each other  You know you have a true friend when you can both just shut the fuck up It's pretty easy for us, because my girlfriend is deaf. I was friends with a Deaf couple, their arguments were fierce.  Eventually she would just close her eyes, and he would stomp over and over trying to get her to *"listen"*. I had deaf sitters. I was 6-7ish. Basically old enough not to die on my own. Going to the store was odd as I had to point and nod at what I wanted. Their arguments were scary loud. Lots of pot banging and eye closing and stomping. Odd I remember so much. Probably because it was Slightly traumatic. 

SITTERS, not Sisters. Beat you to it, fuckers. I gotta believe your girlfriend isn't actually deaf, because I find that Deaf people are usually loud as fuck since they have little reason to try to quietly do anything. My ASL professor is Deaf and has a tendency to slam cabinets. Oh yeah she may be silent, but she drops devastatingly louder farts than I do. She's ~105lbs but sounds like a football player doing a drill through tires when walking in our 2nd floor apartment.

Previous neighbor complained the day I moved in after she was in the apartment for a few weeks because she walks so heavy.

But this commentors point was more pointed about not talking, as even hearing people might occasionally make noise with their chair or something.

And if you still doubt me somewhere in bowels of my comment history there's more posts of her being deaf. I learned asl because of meeting her. I learnt A/S/L on MSN Messenger. Not too sure if the person teaching me was deaf or not. 18/f/cali kool lol

so wut r u doin nm u?  brb Show affection. Not just little pecks when you leave for work, but full out makeout sessions once in a while.

Hold hands in the car or when walking.

Hug each other when you get home from work. 

Have sex, good sex, where you both care about the other's pleasure instead of just getting your own. 

Flirt with each other. 

Get naked and be interested when your SO walks around naked. 

Compliment each other. Notice the little things! Agree with all points here, just wanna add one on;

General touching, legs on each other, arm around the other, the odd stroke of the arm or face, hand on the others knee, messing with eachothers fingers, running your fingers through the others hair. It's awesome to just be able to reach over and touch them. 

The word touching sounds kinda creepy but I'm not sure what else to call it, an abundance of casual physical contact. Just to add to this;  
If you notice anyone doing any of the above frequently that means they are more than likely into you. So go get them! TIL I'm gay with all my good friends  Shower/bathe At first there's the delicate dance of there not being enough shower head for both of you at the same time.  You learn to compromise.

Then there's the payoff of someone else scrubbing your back.  You'll never feel more clean than after someone else has scrubbed you.  They can reach spots you couldn't scrub on your own. I never loved my wife more than the day she shaved my back, scrubbed it clean, then exfoliated it. I feel like at least one of those is extraneous.  If that's somehow now synonymous with orgasmic, then yeah. It was pretty extraneous.  Onetime, I gave myself an extraneous, orgasmic exfoliation. Only if by "Onetime" you mean "every time the lights go off and 13 times on Saturday".  My SO and I take weekly tub baths with bubbles, wine and all that girly shit. I fuckin' love. It's also super therapeutic. 

Edit : Thanks for the Gold kind stranger, may your baths always be full of warm bodies, bubbles and bubbly. Cook together! My boyfriend and I will spend hours making a nice, home-cooked dinner for the two of us (or sometimes for friends too if we're expecting them). It's always really fun and cooking is a useful life skill. If y'all don't know how to cook, learn together! It's worth it. Spoon. It's the ultimate intimacy when you're not having sex.  And it often leads to sex.  What if she has body heat hot enough to render me infertile while demanding the covers on because she's inexplicably cold? Riddle me that Pull the covers off your back and leave them on her. Then concentrate on using your back like a radiator as you approach the sun.  I'm sure there's a joke about a black hole here, I'm just not seeing it... If your skin is hot, you personally feel cold. That is why people who have fevers say they are cold, and people with hypothermia or who are risking frostbite claim cool or cold air/water feels hot.

She has hot skin, that means the room's air is COLDER to her than to you.

This means that YOU feel cool to her, which may mean another reason to have a blanket from her point of view.

What you can do is work out how you feel 20min after a cool or warm shower.

Then you can shower at a temperature that will leave you comfortable with her body heat, and she can do the same for you.

Edit: It appears that many think I am wrong. I cannot argue because this is me stitching together personal experience and information snips. Below are the two critics who have actual contributions, and so should be given as much credibility as anything I have written.

and

and now another edit for someone else with info

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/396oo1/what_is_one_thing_every_couple_should_do_together/cs1rx0b why are you yelling at me Look in your heart.

You already know why.

Yes you do. If you ever want to test your relationship, just go canoeing. You have to communicate and work together in order to move forward and it is extremely rewarding if you do it right. And when you get into a rough patch of water and flip your canoe by accident, THAT'S when you really learn how crap your communicating skills are...but after cussing and yelling for a second, you work together to formulate a plan on how you're going to get the water out of the canoe and get back on your way. And that's the true test of a relationship if you can do that or not.  Last time my husband and I went canoing we apparently had the canoe backwards the entire time going to the island. But we did make it there and not capsize it. What does this mean about us as a couple?

Edit: To clear up the million questions on how we managed this. 1.) I'm 5'2" so my legs are short enough to easily and comfortably fit in a backwards canoe. 2.) The seats looked [like this](http://www.brighton-canoes.co.uk/productpages/equipment/images/canoe/wooden-webbed-canoe-seat-l.jpg) so there was no countoring nor backs on the seats to clue us in. It means that you're weird as fuck and people will always look at you strangely, but you shouldn't care because you work well together and get where you need to go. Never change. Awesome, I have something to write in my anniversary card. Thank you internet stranger! Print screen this thread and paste the fucker into the card.  How true is that. A group of us went and one couple capsized and they threw a fit at each other...  See, I suggested a threesome for that purpose, but yours works too. yes, also see: 2 person kayaks, preferably in the ocean Portal 2 coop... We still can't get past the first 10 levels.. My boyfriend and I did this! We had a lot of fun, and wish there were more coop games in the same genre. Watch a meteor shower together in the middle of nowhere.  It is great. Tried this.  The meteor just called the cops on us.   Travel.  Anyone can have sex and enjoy it, but not everyone can travel together and enjoy it.  It's a good test.

Then again, if the couple hate each other: sex.   Going through challenging and stressful travel situations is a great way to test the trust you have for each other. But the rewards are huge. Of course, your second line works if all else fails.

Source: went on trips with my SO's, including to developing countries. Developing countries are really the key for me.  90% of couples can handle a trip to London or NYC or Paris without any significant issues.  But throw in a Micronesia or Botswana or Cambodia and suddenly it changes the equation to either a TON of fun or a constant fight.   Road trip. Spending hours upon hours with just them and nothing to do but talk, jam out to the radio together, read to one another etc. It's a really great structure for quality time and it forces you to resolve any conflict succinctly since there's no running away.  My fiance and I are long distance and it's always nice when we make the trips together. Side thread: I've always been curious how hard a long distance relationship actually is. How tough is it? How do you stay close?  Thanks for asking! It sucks and it's the most maddening thing ever, but I wouldn't trade it for the world. We're both busy but we'll text or have quick phone calls during the day, and we Facetime basically every night. It's not the same as being in person but we stay close nevertheless. We got close very quickly because when you're getting to know someone over Facetime you can't exactly hang out with friends or go see a movie together, so it forces you to talk and have really meaningful conversation. Now instead of being 16 hours apart we're three and a half hours apart for the summer, soon to be zero in August! aw yay! It's nice to hear that people with a strong connection really can make it through tough circumstances :) wishing the both of you all the best! Keep talking like you did when you first started dating, and hold hands.

I remember I held my girlfriend, now wife, hands for years and then when we went to university 10 hours apart and then it stopped but I didn't realize it.  Things just felt off for years, and I know it wasn't just the lack of hand holding because we lost some of the intimacy we had being close during all of high school, but holding hands really helped getting us back down the path to being "right" again. I've been married for just about 11 years. We hold hands all the time. In bed. Sitting on the couch watching tv. Standing around chatting with friends. But not when we're out, because our daughter always wants to hold daddy's hand and we're too considerate to try to walk three abreast and get in everyone else's way. It is cute watching him walk along with the skipping singing ball of rainbow-skirted exuberance clinging to him though. God fucking dammit I want to be a dad so bad. This right here. Also cuddle a lot and never stop doing it. So many people think we just started dating when in fact we've been together 10 years now and married almost 2 years. We are always cuddling and holding hands. Telling each other we love them and how cute or beautiful they are.

The biggest thing though that way to many of my friends and family simply do not do with their SO's. TALK! Talk to each other. Tell each other how you're feeling and why. Don't tell it to a friend tell it to your SO. We have yet to get into a massive fight simply because we communicate with each other clearly. We get into small fights here and there but they are so rare.

Communicate with your partner! awwwww AAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW hey now youre an allstar get your game on mom's spaghetti This is the first time this joke has made me laugh in a long time I think its because the song barely got any traction The timing is everything.  Take a long road trip - preferably before you are married.  

This is an excellent way to get to know each other outside the distractions of day to day life, television, work, social media, friends and family.  

Is he impatient?  Does she speed?  Who decides what you listen to on the radio?  Where you eat or sleep?  How do you each react to adversity like a flat tire or break down?

These are seemingly simple things and shouldn't cause any conflict.  That's not what you are looking for though.  You are looking at how you two reach these decisions.  

Does he ask, "Where do you want to stop for lunch?" or does he just keep driving until your stomach is growling and you finally speak up?  If you don't speak up, do you just sit there and fume until he finally notices that you are mad because you are hungry and have to pee?  

Does she volunteer to do her share of the driving?  Does she become frustrated when you don't follow her directions to the letter?  (bonus points if you can map a route and follow it using a map and not your GPS).  Does she like to sight see, or does she try to beat the world record for driving from point A to point B?

Do either of you complain about every. little. thing.  

"It's too hot!"

"Ugh!  This construction is the worst!"

"This hotel sucks!"

You learn a lot about someone by how they drive and when you are alone together, just the two of you for hours in close quarters.   Maybe this is weird, but my husband and I kinda enjoy bitching together. About traffic, or shitty hotels, or whatever. Not AT each other, mind you, but together. I'm a writer and he is a genius, so even if we aren't actually mad about it, the different creative ways we can say "this thing that is happening sucks" is kinda a game for us. We usually end up giggling uncontrollably and then having sex.  My wife and I keep a notebook open in the kitchen, and write almost everyday positive things:

You look so cute today

Thank you for doing the dishes

It's been 10 years! incredible!

etc, etc. Then when we have disagreements, the book comes to mind, to reminds us it's really not that bad.  We do something like this. He wakes up at 5 am everyday. I don't usually have to be to work until mid morning. At night I'll make his lunch and then write him a note on the mirror in the bathroom with dry erase markers. He usually writes back something sweet. We've been married two and a half years, so hopefully we will continue this well into our marriage.  My girlfriend and I are best friends and unfortunately we only get to spend weekends together for now. 

We trade weekends doing things the other likes. Last weekend we got a manicure and pedicure, which as a male I didn't hate it as much as I thought I would. The next day we went to some store and got bath bombs, I picked up some wine, found a tiny chandelier in the house, dimmed the lights, and sat in the bath tub while drinking wine, soaking in that bath bomb water, and just talking.
It was pretty incredible. 

The weekend before we spent almost the entire weekend playing video games and watching movies. We also went to the beach but mostly video games. 

I think taking turns and having an interest in what your SO is interested in is incredibly important.  Spend a few days sick home with the flu - together.  Nothing like sickness to bring out true colors and sympathy or anger. Unplanned day trips. 

My wife loves it when I just tell her to hop in the car and we go some place ridiculous. Just leave out in the morning... maybe 10-11. Stay gone all day, go do something great like hike, or travel to a different state, do something you don't do every day, and then come home late, tired, ready for bed. Have awesome sex and then fall asleep.  My wife and I have been taking day trips like these for the past 12 years. It's great advice. When are you going home? Haha... A day trip out of state

I live in Texas, where you can drive for 10 hours and still be in Texas I live in Juneau Alaska, you can't even leave the city by car.  Didn't Juneau that when you moved there though? Don't Anchorage people to start one of those stupid pun threads I won't, but Alaska friend to start one. You're really getting Inuit now Yeah, but this will Palin comparison. Yeah. Live in Australia. Driving out of the state is not really doable for a day trip.  As an American, my first response to this was "Oh yeah, because Australia is just one big island." Isn't every continent one big island if you think about it?

Edit: To everyone denying me, North America will be an island if we want. [Hate us cause you ain't us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ2np7R-Uwg). I try not to think about it too much or else i feel lonely. 
 My wife would hate this idea. She is a planner. I'm clearly your wife - hi babe!  Jokes aside, I think OP must mean "spontaneous" day trips, not "unplanned" day trips.  My husband texting, "I'm leaving work early, let's go up to the Crest and do some snowshoeing!" - awesome.  Getting in the car with literally no plan and driving around hoping to somehow find a hiking trail, or driving to the state line with no idea of what you will do when you get there - a recipe for a letdown. Grow a garden. The feeling of working together to create things from dirt and seeds and watch them grow over the course of a few months is amazing. Then, you get to say shit like "you see this carrot? we did this. we made this" and then devour it. I was mentally comparing this to raising a child, then I read the last line. choose your own adventure there buddy &gt;Grow a child. The feeling of working together to create things from sperm and egg cells and watch them grow over the course of a few years is amazing. Then, you get to say shit like "you see this human? we did this. we made this" and then devour it.

 Go through rough times. At least once. And not chickening out because it doesn't feel good... Yep, there's more to it than just the good times. Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share.  When my woman left home for a brown eyed man well I still don't seem to care.  Right. Once you are over the bad times, you'll appreciate the good days even more. This.

Went through one (ONE) rough time with my ex-wife.  After 14 good years, she says things are just 'too hard' and bails.  

Not because I was doing anything, but because "Just because i'm not miserable doesn't mean I'm happy" 

"But you were happy a few months ago"

"But I'm not now and this is just too hard."

Fuck her.  My wife literally left me last night. 6 years dating almost 3 more married. Nearly a decade.

She didn't/wouldn't hold a job over the last 10 months, and it fucked us financially, which stressed me to no end. Finally, after months of icy tension she wants to have a talk. Tells me she's no longer in love and wants out. I held on as tight as I could for a year trying to get her on her feet, and now she's just leaving. 

I'm pretty crushed. I've been laying in a dark room on a futon at my best friends house for hours. Him and his wife are working and his grandma is watching their 2 yr old.  

Edit: I've spent the last 24 hours trying my best to respond and thank all the people who have made positive remarks, shown support, sent pms, and just all around cared. Lovely. This post is old so the edit doesn't mean a lot but I wanted to put it down for the record. My work week begins now. I go off into the world anew. Wish me luck.  This is the moment you will remember for the rest of your life. You *will* get up from the futon a new man.  Solid advice. "It's not what happens to us in life, it's how we react to what happens to us" - some dude I can't remember (or the exact quote wording) "I get knocked down, but I get up again. You're never gonna keep me down." -Chumbawumba Wait...she's unemployed, she walked away from your marriage, and *you're* the one staying at a friend's? Probably because he needed to get out of the house or just to see someone. My girlfriend called it a day with me last month and I just had that feeling like I needed to get out. Can't really explain it, I just needed a change of scenery or I'd go crazy. Ended up at a church in town just because they had an evening service on at the right time. Was somewhere to go I guess. Financial planning. I do the financing she does the planning for it!  ... There is alot of stilettos in the closet.  Did you at least let her get some? Fuck no.  If there's gonna be a bitch in this house it's gonna be me. ... wait.  From working in a hardware store: paint a room together. 

It's fun. It's messy. It requires communication and trust. Also pro tip: buy a little more paint than you will need. That way when you start painting each other at 3am you still have enough to finish.  I assume you work in the paint section. Great salesman! I used to. Had couples come in all the time and ask which color was better. Told them that I was staying out of it. They all mix the same for me. They had to live with the color or not.  My boyfriend and I have mastered putting together Ikea furniture. It's fun because if we argue about what goes where, it's not threatening, and we are both good at building things so we know the other won't be a total idiot and break something. It's like doing a puzzle together, but then you have a place to put your socks If you have children, you should grab moments when you can.Shower together as often as possible.  Before you make a huge commitment (i.e., marriage): talk about the day-to-day issues you'll deal with as a couple. See if you have similar views/intentions regarding religion (especially if there may be kids), sex, money, where you'll spend holidays, whether you want pets (and if so, what kind), etc. You don't have to have identical views on everything, but it's crucial to have your thoughts out in the open before these issues start confronting you in your life as a couple. How do these things not come up in a relationship before you're considering marriage? Communicate.  And oral... always oral. Can't understand what she is saying with her mouth full. Don't try and multitask. First communicate then oral or vice versa. oral with teeth, she is angry, oral without teeth she is happy.  Oral with a mix of both means we gotta go to the dentist. Read relationship advice from Reddit and laugh the night away :) Go dancing.

Cook for one another.

Back rubs/foot rubs.

Take a walk while holding hands.

Lay on the couch all day watching Netflix. &gt;lay on the couch watching Netlfix

Got this one down to a point....maybe too much. Be there for each other during the shitty times, and not just during all the good stuff.  Just got divorced. What I wish we really did together was listen to each other. I felt I listened so much and responded appropriately and validated her needs and concerns and tried to genuinely help her have a better life when she approached me with issues. When I said things were getting bad, I was dismissed. When I said I'm struggling to keep it together and I need help and I feel she wasn't giving me that help, I was told I was wrong. Don't just hear what someone is saying, fucking listen. Listening means processing what someone said, and actively responding with something, even if it's just something as small as saying, "I can't help you, but let's find someone/somewhere that can help you." You both don't need to be the solution to each others' problem, and sometimes just listening to a bitch session is all the help someone needs, but when your partner tells you something, don't just ignore them. That's what happened with me, and now both of us don't have anyone to listen to our thoughts. Hopes. Dreams. Fears. Future... fuck, I need a beer.

TL;DR: Listen to each other. It makes someone feel so special and important to just have someone listen and validate them, and their feelings.

Edit: checked at work and saw a lot of replies and well wishing. Thank you all very much for your kind words. To everyone out there who went through this/are going through this, I'm here for you if you want to talk or vent or just say hey. Stand up for each other, especially if it's against against the parents. My wife is from Mexico and my mom is a racist cunt. She called my wife a wetback. I wont repeat what I said to my mother for legal reasons, but I proved to my wife she's more important to me than anyone else, especially my mother.  Blood is thicker than water, but cum is thicker than blood. Bake cookies. And then have sex. with the cookies? Use the heat from the passion to bake the cookies! Are babies passion fruit? Not post their entire lives on social media. Playing video games together is pretty fun. Teamwork and all that. :) GF and I bought the Master Chief Collection for Xbox One a while ago because she likes shooters and never played Halo and we both wanted something co-op we could play together on the couch.

We steamrolled through Halo 1 and 2 and she's been really anxious recently to keep going and play through 3.

We put it on a pretty easy mode and just have fun rolling through blasting things in the face. Another good series is Borderlands. Me and the SO have steamed through 1 and 2 and we're currently starting the pre sequel. They are immensely fun together, no matter the playstyles.. She likes to charge in and attack everything whilst I like to sometimes hang back with a sniper, we get a good few laughs from it My husband and I have two kids together, and really needed some date ideas for at home.  We decided to get Borderlands 2, and vowed to only play it if we were together.  We never played it separately.  We beat Borderlands 2 right when the Pre Sequel came out.  We only got to play the Pre Sequel twice before my husband died this past November.  

I won't finish playing the Pre Sequel now, since we vowed to only play it together, and I sure can't bring myself to get rid of it either.  I break down into an ugly cry every time I see anything Borderlands related.  I'm pretty sure the people that work in the video game section at Walmart think I'm a crazy person now. Came here to say this! We do both co op and vs games together. Portal 2 multiplayer was a good relationship test, haha.  We are still working on Portal 1 (her playing, me next to her). Everything is a struggle because she simply doesn't have a video game background! I've been playing games for like 20 years so I have a bit of an advantage even with simply using a controller to walk and look. 

It has been a bit frustrating, but fun.  We play chess together, may not sound like fun to most, but we love it, it's calm, intimate, and she hasn't been able to beat me yet As cliche as this will sound, laughing together is that one thing. BE NAKED!

My SO and I shower together a lot. We talk, smack each others butts, help scrub each other. I love when he rinses my hair for me. It's so relaxing. 

We sleep together naked. Cuddle naked. Watch tv naked. Do stuff around the house naked. 

When you can just be naked in front of someone without a care in the world, as comfortable as can be. It's an amazing bond that's created.  Get wet in the rain together. It's just so much fun!!  But I live in California  :( Roll around in the dry dirt, or try to put out a small grass fire together.

 My girlfriend and I play a game called "Things We Like" (creative, I know). It's incredibly simple but something I think every couple ought to do.

She will say something she likes (anything; the smell of campfires, rainy days, sour gummy worms, etc, anything) and then I will say something I like, and so on and so forth. You have to play rapid fire, taking your turn as quickly as you can, without thinking too long about your answer.

This is a great thing to do because (1) it puts both people in a good mood by making them think about their favorite things, (2) it's good practice for quick thinking and conversation, (3) it often reveals things that they have in common and provides fodder for future conversation, and finally, (4) it gives both parties plenty of ammunition with which to pleasantly surprise their partner later on.

It's a very easy and fun but also very useful and practical game. Every couple should try it. Cuddle!  Volunteer work.  Brought my wife and I closer together and always gives you a good feeling of teamwork.  Also sex. volunteer sex? Paid positions aren't legal in most places. Hopefully both people are volunteering for sex. The 2 2 2 rule. Every 2 weeks go out on a date. Every 2 months go for a weekend away. Every 2 years go on a holiday. Literally saving this and changing it to 4-4-4 because I know how broke my arse will be in the next five years. Mouth Hugs. I don't like the taste of underarm.  Well you're going to have to get over that for the sake of the relationship. Die. I don't know why I laughed at this one. diablo might have something to do with why Be playful - tickling, naked cuddling.  It doesn't have to lead to sex to be fun and strengthening to your relationship.

...although it often does lead to sexy times... Build a complex lego set. It teaches you to sort of out the litttle problems, find what matters, and in the end you've built something you can be proud of life. Life's kinda like that Always, ALWAYS give a french kiss before sleeping. I make this with my boyfriend since our beginning. If for any reason we are angry with each other, this rule forces us to talk. And there's always the possibility to pretend you don't want to give the kiss and start a pillow war and then...whatever happens! Workout. Couples that lift together stick together! Swolemates. &lt;3 "A couple that lifts together, lives forever."

Oh one thing? I think the argument's the most fun. That's my favourite

edit: [the replies in this thread](http://i.imgur.com/p5RSQmC.jpg) You sound like a fun date.  You guys sound painfully quirky.  I think one of the people in this relationship is Zooey Deschanel  Michael Cera follows them around at all times playing a ukulele.  Direct it by Wes Anderson and I'd watch the shit out of that. Talk. Touch base. Check in with one another regularly, make time to have that 'state of the union' chat. It re-establishes intimacy and gives you both a chance to get on top of any grievances or issues before they get out of hand. The best couples seem to do this almost automatically. Go rock climbing.  You only have to be the slightest bit outdoorsy and it is a ton of fun.  I am in much better shape than my girlfriend and she still kicks my but at the rock gym.   The secret to the rock gym is to start with bulbasaur or squirtle Go on dates, but don't have 'date nights'. Date nights implied that the date is expected and scheduled, and for many people nothing zaps the romance like a scheduled time for it. 

DO go on dates- take day trips and nights out and have an amazing time, but don't say "we have date nights every Tuesday or Friday," because shit happens, plans change, and you don't want the other person feeling like you're not prioritizing your relationship.  This probably depends on the people and their schedules. Five or ten years ago, I couldn't have imagined scheduled romance. Now, if I want something to happen, I have to plan it two weeks ahead of time. It doesn't kill the romance for me. I'm way more likely to be exhausted and/or look like crap if I try to go on a spontaneous date. If I plan for it, I can get ready properly. I'm also generally just grateful to be in a restaurant eating food that someone else made and cleaned up, and not furiously working /studying /running errands /doing laundry /picking up dog poop / taking my car to the shop..... Be without the internet, including phones, for a day or two then see  how you like each other.  Have sex.  My wife stopped showing up. player 2: dropped out. Player 2 has joined another server.  Player 2 new high score. Player 3 has joined the game. I will get her home earlier tonight. I'll let the others know to do the same. Assemble Ikea furniture together. It is the greatest test of all.  My now husband and I once showed up early to a house party only to have the hostess go "Oh thank god you two showed up, we got a table from Ikea we can't put together and it's the only table for pizza". Took us maybe 10 min to get it together. She and the guy she attempted to assemble it with are no longer together I don't get it.... Ikea furniture is completely intuitive to install. Never had an issue with it. 

The Ikea sewing machine, though. I sat for 45 minutes swearing at a goddamned **BOBBIN** because it *WOULD'T FUCKING GRAB THE THREAD CORRECTLY* with my housemate making snide comments about my masculinity and aptitude for mechanical things. Fuck sewing machines. They're black goddamned magic.  And then people talk about not giving you enough pieces.

I always have extras of the small bits, and one item actually gave me instructions to throw away one piece. Insert tab A into trash C. Try installing IKEA furniture with someone else "helping" the pieces you need away and losing the goddamn Allen key and getting all defensive about it JUST LIKE WHEN WE WENT TO YOUR SISTERS PLACE AND ALL I SAID WAS THAT SHE HAD A NICE DRESS, KAREN! GOD! Me and my fianc just discovered this test over the weekend. We bought a daybed that expands out into a king sized bed to put into a room that is like 8x12. The room already had a desk and a dresser and a huge TV in it,  and the bed itself it 6'8x3'10 when closed. We spent 4 fucking hours putting the goddamn thing together because we had to keep laying down a piece, scooting around everything in the room, I kept knocking stuff over because I'm clumsy and I hadn't slept the night before, and the room was like 80. And then we got halfway through it and at midnight discovered it had a fucking broken piece and we couldn't finish that night, couldn't sleep in the room, had to sleep in the basement of his parent's place and then drive 45 minutes each way back to IKEA to exchange the piece. Got back home, room was just as hot and crowded and I was just as clumsy so it took another 3ish hours to finish the assembly. 

We both spent like 24 hours straight fuming mad at inanimate objects and on the verge of tossing pieces of the bed out the window, extremely demoralized, etc but you know what? We didn't fight. Not even a little bit, neither of us directed our anger at the other for even one second even though it was extremely trying. Even when we are sleep deprived, sweating our asses off, overworked, and angry as hell neither of us snapped and I think that speaks volumes about the health of our relationship. :) Ride a tandem bike to the Ikea furniture set-up location.  The ultimate test of a relationship. Learn new hobbies together. Of course it's super fun to have your partner teach you about their personal interests, but learning a new one together levels the playing field and forces you to work together to improve on something!

Plus, if you end up really loving the new hobbies, you have a go-to activity for when you're looking for something to do. Government and academic websites which only work in IE. =/ For that matter, having to pay exorbitant amounts of money to access academic papers funded with your own tax dollars. And government websites that have "Hours of Operation" I can get 5 bars of LTE in the middle of the Tanzanian bush, but I can't get enough signal to make a phone call from inside my apartment. I shit you not, I had full bars on a mountain in rural Colombia but I have zero in my downtown office. I wasn't kidding. It was easier to get ahold of me on a 2 week safari than I am at home. I feel your pain. When a robot lady gives you a minute and a half long lesson on how to leave a voice mail. I have been doing this for about 20 years, I got this.


EDIT: to clarify, I work a job where I HAVE to leave a voice mail if the customer does not answer the phone, and I do this about 100 times a day.

EDIT 2: yes, you can press 1 to skip it. Sometimes. But every so often you will get one that says "I'm sorry, this option is unavailable. Please leave a message after the tone...", which ends up taking twice as long. that's to give you enough time to second guess what you're gonna say and then completely fuck it up Describes every voicemail ive ever left Recently lost my job. My online unemployment website is only available from 6am-9pm.....its a fucking website.  Can't politely remove myself from Reply All email threads. Come on. Or from multimedia messages on mobile. I get group texts from my brother and parents all the time, but since I have an Android phone and they have iPhones, I have to download every message instead of it being a regular text. You can't unselect a floor on an elevator Here in Hong Kong there a few elevators that allow you to unselect the floor if you double tap the floor button  People in a rush love to mash the floor button, unknowingly unselecting their floor. Then they realise this as they see their floor go past. That's all button mashers deserve. But.. It makes the elevator go faster.  Sadly though someone who believes themselves to be important is going to use that to cancel your actual floor in an attempt to get to theirs faster. I can imagine that's a good way to get one's ass kicked Service charges on concert tickets. Excuse me, but it doesn't cost you $9 to sell me a ticket that I PRINT OUT AT HOME. Wish they'd just call it a "because we can" charge.  Graphing calculators.  $100+,  outdated technology. Now in color!  The buttons are literally the only advantage, along with maybe the specialized apps and very good battery life that results from having a CPU that would've been put to shame by a Pentium II.

I haven't actually found any phone graphing apps that are quite as good as my Casio Prizm, which is sort of odd, it must be too niche a market. That and some calculators are SAT/AP/etc certified, and my phone certainly isn't suitable for use on an exam.

And for fucks sake how hard is it to write a fucking C compiler for your $100 calculator so that I'm not transported back into 1975 by using your rectum-widening version of BASIC. Motherfucking bus timetables being different at the bus stops, the bus station on the board, and the bus companies website. Not it that matters much... I think they send the buses out using a lottery ball machine anyway  My town has GPS tracking on all the buses that links with a free smartphone app. So when you show up 1 minute late to your stop, you don't have to stand around worrying for 20 minutes whether this is the one day the bus didn't show up late. It's awesome. Why businesses don't put their hours on their websites/Facebook pages. and when a restaurant doesn't put their menu on their website. WHY? There's a local place in Baltimore that changes its menu almost every week and the menu section of their website is a photo of whatever the menu is that day.  It's great.

edit* To the people asking which restaurant: It's Bottega in Station North.  On Maryland Avenue. yeah, even if your menu changes everyday, it only takes a minute to maybe snap a picture of it and upload it to your restaurant's Facebook. Which should exist!

But I've seen plenty of restaurants whose menus never change that still have nooooothing online. Restaurant managers are some of the most stubborn and busy people.

I made an app for this craft beer bar to show what they had on tap. They didn't want to print out menus because it changed too often. I even pitched how it would let them keep track of their most popular items. All the manager had to do was drag and drop a logo of the beer, but that was too much work. Next week on Bar Rescue, THIS fucking guy "Hmm, customers will want to go to our website to find out more about our restaurant. What should we put?"

"I think our name is pretty important. They might not know the name of the restaurant yet. Make that pretty big."

"Oh, and pictures of our chefs cooking in the kitchen! It'll be useful to show them that we have real chefs making real food."

"They might also want to learn about the type of cuisine we cook, we should have a few paragraphs explaining what French cuisine is. That way, they'll know what kind of food they can get at our restaurant."

"I bet most of our customers want to learn more about the history of the restaurant, too. You know when you're on the road, and you just need to quickly find out when the restaurant was established? It makes me so angry when restaurants don't display that information!"

"Yeah, that's the worst! And we should list all the awards we won, too. Every time I want to check out a new restaurant, the first thing I want to know is what awards it has won."

"Alright, looks good to me! Let's call it a night, it's already 7:00 PM so we gotta start cleaning the kitchen." They might also want to see the menu, but lets make it a pdf or maybe flash;  that way it can look super pretty.   And for fucks sake don't put prices in.   Only plebians would want to know that. It's so irritating when they don't include prices. Yes, I know your restaurant is *fancy* and *prestigious*, but I need to know if I can pay with the small change under the seats in my car or if I need to take out a loan first.

Edit: Okay, fine, if I have to ask, I can't afford it. That doesn't stop me from being annoyed. To me,  no prices makes me assume it's a above my normal budget so I just move on  That's why they do it, I think. To drive away clientele who aren't confident enough in their bank account to risk the unknown price. It's silly, though. I'm by no means poor, and neither is my family, but what if we just don't want to spend $80 per person? There is a segment of the population for whom dollar amounts for certain things just do not matter. $5 for a meal? $500? Might as well be the same price.



"It's a banana, Michael. What could it cost, $10?" But a lot of the restaurants that do that are not stupidly pricey. I have seen restaurants where people easily eat for under $20 not have their prices on the site.  Pdf isn't that bad. A pdf is easier to read on my phone than some website that doesn't resize for mobile. Especially the holiday hours (or closures) [deleted] Google Profile as well.  This feeds to the map section and man I wish more business had it updated. Or ones that are wrong. By the time you've gotten there you find it's already closed. Google maps actually does this and theyre pretty good about it. Theyll put the hours and whether its closed or not. Also has a phone number with a button to call straight from the app But that information has to come from somewhere.  Isn't Google just mining the information they are showing from a company's website/facebook/twitter/etc.? Its also croudsourced. I've supplied info for a few places around town.

Edit: I don't even know what a "croud" is... Why did I do that? Croudsowrced Why I can't find any stuff locally without actually phoning/walking into the store, surely it'd be in their best interest to advertise stock availability to actually bring customers into brick and mortar stores.I constantly wonder how many of those dvi to vga adapters are actually in stock x miles away, I've just got no easy way of knowing. My community college online class registration portal closes between the hours of 2200 and 0600.  I asked my advisor about this and he said it was to prevent stressed to the max and/or drunk students from dropping all their classes at 2 am That actually makes a lot of sense. They could just require a confirmation the next day or something though Staying at a nice hotel and having to pay for internet access.   And it's usually something obscene like $14.99/day for poor speed.   It's 2015, wifi is expected and free when paying more than $60/night.  It's because the majority of hotel wifi users are people on business trips that will expense the charge anyway. It's a really easy way to make money. Can confirm: wife travels on business a lot, spends obscene amounts of company money on internet access. Occasionally, I'll go with her and feel like royalty checking my email with those super-premium Hilton megabytes. We only use the best bits and bytes crafted by artisan data makers in the hills of Tuscany.  Ooh, this internet is so much more rustic than back home! Weird that the nice hotels make you pay, but the cheap hotels usually have it for free. It's beacuse at a nice 5 star hotel, the majority of the people staying are businessmen that have the company card. Not their money = don't care about the price. Also expense account limits usually based on room rate.  Charging extra for wifi is fine as long as the room stays under $400.  

400 + $15 for wifi and $35 for breakfast = cool 

401 including free breakfast, lunch, dinner, wifi and Use of the business center printer = note from accounting that my charge has been denied  I have had this happen on a trip where a bunch of us went to the same place, I was invited late so had to stay across the street and pay above government rate, but did get free wifi.  Everyone turned in an expense report with more on it than me, but I got the fucking third degree from accounting about how I need to check the hotel's rate and what the government rate is.  They let it go through after CCing my bosses boss on the email as long as I never do it agian. I get insanity like that with my employer too. 

I have to travel to the US office once in a while. There are 3 airports to chose from... 50km, 180km, and 210km away. Most of us fly from the closest airport. Travel to the airport is by a special taxi service. The farther away the airport, the more we pay. 

I did the usual due diligence in booking a recent flight (we are supposed to save expenses wherever possible). Checked all three airports, compared prices. I picked a flight from the furthest airport because the combined price of flight plus taxi was $400USD cheaper. The finance guy freaked on me because I expensed the most expensive taxi journey. He completely missed the point that the flight was so much cheaper and my expense report was $400USD than it would have been. Thankfully I did the whole screen shot thing while booking. It got escalated to Director level before it was finally approved. I still can't pick what channels I want and pay for those  la carte. Cereal not coming in a resealable bag Noisy vacuum cleaners and fax machines. I've heard that quiet vacuums just don't sell. It's counter-intuitive, but if it's quiet, people don't think it's working.  That's just so fucking dumb. It's like when mcdos third pound burgers didn't sell well because people saw the four in quarter pound and think it's more meat.  That's just because vacuums have been noisy in the past though, right? Surely one day quiet vacuums can be the norm, and this won't be a problem anymore. Not if nobody ever buys them because they think they don't work. I read an article once that said quieter vacuums that were tested with focus groups were not well received. The testers reported that they though the quieter vacuums didnt work as well as the louder vacuums, even if it wasnt true Seems like they should try that again with a more tech savvy generation. It's like those focus groups that said they did not like the flying wing boeing airplane that would be much more fuel efficient while carrying more passengers because only like 10% of the passengers got a window seat. Is it really THAT important?! I fly fairly often and most of the people on the plane are sleeping, reading a book, or playing some game with their window shade shut. I don't give a shit about a window with the window seat, I just like being able to lean against something because the seats are so god damn small.  If the seats were the right size they could sit me in a dark capsule for all I care. When a traffic light turns red even though there's zero cross traffic.  The real problem here is that we need better sensors. I drive a motorcycle and the sensors don't detect me, that's why the light needs to cycle every so often right now. We need a sensor that will detect vehicles that don't weigh much. 


Edit: Need sensors that will detect vehicles that aren't large enough. Guess it does not go by weight. 

Edit 2: where I live does have the policy that states you can wait a reasonable amount of time and then run the red light. I've had to do this sometimes. My biggest problem is one light on my way to work where I need to turn left on to a busy road, but the road I come off of doesn't get a ton of cars. I can't run a red if there is consistent traffic. 

Thanks to everyone who mentioned getting the magnet for my bike. I didn't know those existed, I think I'll need to pick one up.  http://www.revzilla.com/product/amanet-red-light-changer

I recommend buying just the magnet cheaper elsewhere, though. I had no idea these existed. Thanks for the tip! Yes, here's my cover letter and my carefully crafted resume, tailored to this exact position with literally ALL THE INFORMATION YOU'RE ASKING ME TO FILL OUT SEPARATELY ON THE FUCKING WEBSITE APPLICATION!!! ARGH, STUPID HATE I hate this so incredibly much. It's the mind numbing repetition on each site I go to that gets to me. I agree, I have resume and cover letter in hand, I thought that was so I didn't have to fill in all this info over and over and over again?

There's got to be a better way of applying for jobs.  The worst is when they say "Oh, you can upload your text resume and we'll fill out all the fields using that!" and then they fuck it up so badly that it ends up being more work to fix it than it would have been if I'd just been able to do it manually in the first place. You mean you didn't go to school at HIGHLY MOTIVATED WITH AN EYE FOR DET, graduating in the year AILS? Job description: Scraping shit off the floor of the bathrooms at the county park. Seasonal Position.

Please submit a resume, cover letter, 3 professional refferences

WTF?? Casual position, expect between 1 and 40 hours per week, applicant must be available 24/7, 365. Declining a shift is grounds for immediate dismissal. As a college grad, this infuriates me more than having to pay for college. The positions that solely require a resume submission are absolute godsends.   As a recruiter, I'll take a plain 2 page resume over any newfangled application/job candidate software any day. Sad part is, the entire concept of resumes, cover letters, job interviews is totally outdated in general. This entire procedure needs a major overhaul and some new ways of thinking about how to get a job. Slow internet Canada. Or pay out your ass for "not quite as slow" internet Price stickers not peeling easily off of everything. They don't want people switching them. There's a reason they're scored to rip instead of coming off in one clean piece.  I get the price sticker, but on something like a glass, there shouldn't be a massive sticker with a logo and a barcode, that gets all sticky when you pull it off.  Water bottles and thermoses are really bad at this.

Use those plastic stickers that peel right off in one piece! Losing the TV remote. Is it to hard to have a button on the TV I can press and the remote with alarm me to where it is?!  Dish Network has a button on their receiver box that will let you page the remote. When your bag of chips gets stuck coming out of the vending machine. C'mon man, by now there's got to be some kind of sensor or something that can tell that nothing fell.  And the next guy gets a free bag of chips on his purchase. The nerve of that fucking dick... Don't tell me that if you wanted a Snickers, but noticed you could get two packs of Reese's for the price of one, that you are still gonna get that Snickers.  Fat Man's Gambit Don't hate the player, hate the game. There are some that can tell that nothing was dispensed and it refunds your money, only you can't choose that option again as it thinks it's out of order. The trick is to buy the item on the top row above it so that when it falls it knocks the stuck item loose. We got a machine at work that knows if something falls out. If it doesn't, it twirls that spring a little more. If that still doesn't work you get your money back. Also works with "wireless" payments. Just put your card against its sensor and the payment is done. You get a refund to your bank account if it didn't deliver the snack of choice.  See, *this* is the future. There's something primal about shaking the thing and getting food. Sweet endorphins. Its like you hunted those sweet and spicy Doritos in the wild.  Toll booths that don't take cards. I'm sorry I don't have 85 cents, okay?!  Printers. They are just so aggravating. I'm not sure what I'd expect them to be like in 2015, but something should be different. For one thing, why can't there be a printer that will print in black and white if one of the 50 color cartridges has ran out of ink? It's just frustrating. I finally gave in and just bought a decent black and white laser printer for about $100, and it's been awesome. It works consistently, no hassles, and documents look great. On those rare occasions I actually need something in color, I have it printed at Costco. That's the thing about printers - The cheapest model isn't worth it because the headaches make up the difference. B+W lasers tend to be the best value and your approach is probably the best choice for the average person. Right? We can print in fucking three dimensions, but printing in two is still such a pain in the ass. Yeah...thanks to Reddit I finally found out what PC LOAD LETTER means. (It means add paper). Why can't the damn thing just say on the screen YOU ARE OUT OF PAPER? Stop making it complicated.  Specifically, "Load letter-sized paper into the Paper Cassette".

Because some printers support different sizes, and some printers let you load paper into different places.

It may not be out of paper. It's just that it was told to print a letter-sized document *from the paper cassette*. Except nobody in the history of the world outside of printer manufacturers has ever called it the "Paper Cassette", that's the real fuckup. If it said "Tray 1 Load A4" people would know *exactly* what it meant. &gt;Tray 1 Load A4

Sorry, the best I can do is 8 1/2" x 11"

"HEY IT GUY,  THIS PRINTER IS *FUCKED.*"

 Eh, 3d printing is a bigger pain in the ass.  It's like having a project car that spends most of its time broken but occasionally works long enough to spit out a plastic ducky. I've worked with 3D printers before, they are way easier to troubleshoot. They do break a lot, but the mechanisms they use are pretty simple. 3 motors for x,y,z, 1 motor for extrusion and a heater, make sure each is running as is should and you're fine. Troubleshooting a paper printer, on the other hand, is an exercise in pointlessness. *Not mine. Found it somewhere on the intertubes.*

Edit: Thanks for the Gold, stranger!

Edit 2: For all the people angry about me not mentioning the source. I did not know where it came from. I came across it in text form and saved it some years ago. Still don't know who to credit for the transcript....

Thanks for the source, /u/anthonyjr2. 

I have to say, like some other people on the thread, I found my inner voices funnier. In my head, the computer sounded like Captain Kirk. This is from an old collegehumor video:

http://youtu.be/pQGtucrJ8hM I can't remember where that came from, but I'm fairly certain it's *old*. Just like printer technology!  Manually firing off resume's and/or filling in job applications to 100's of postings a week to have an automated system turn them down. I feel like I'm in an infomercial, "there's got to be a better way!" Starbucks' application system can fuck right off. Fill out pages and pages and pages (quickly though, because it will time out and you have to start over) and then... at the end.... *attach your resume*. 

And I never got even an interview, despite having barista experience. The whole thing was so annoying. When you get a missed call from a number that you don't have saved in your contacts. Where is the 'google this number' button?  Google caller id service is a thing on Android, true caller is much better though,  and works on pretty much every platform. Google caller ID stopped me from declining a call. Got an unknown number. Usually don't answer those. After a second, just as I was about to decline, it came up with the name of a company I just applied for a job with. They were calling to schedule an interview. Very, very glad I didn't decline the call. 

Edit: yes, I know I should answer calls when I'm looking for a job. Thank you to the 40 replies telling me that. I don't need any more.  Fax. So many places still do either fax or mail. Insurance claims in particular. What's the reason for not being able to scan and email? Essentially, that's the same thing as fax, minus the old I've dealt with one vendor that still faxes invoices and updates. It' ridiculous:

-Vendor faxes accounting.

-Accounting scans it onto the network, converts it into a pdf.

-Pdf gets emailed to me.

-I open the pdf scan through it manually, since I can't do a word search on a scanned picture of text.

-I email the vendor directly to confirm/ask questions.

-Process repeats itself.

Maddening.

Edit: okay okay, I'll check out the text converter programs. I've got one for you

*Document is faxed in 

*Fax is automatically converted to PDF and delivered by email 

*PDF is printed out 

*Printed document is mailed to data imaging company

*Data imaging company scans printed document into PDF

*New PDF is uploaded to data management server


These are the steps for adding a document to an account at my company. 


Supposedly there are plans to streamline this process. 
 The foil on the yogurt not tearing off completely in one piece.  

**THIS IS 2015, FOOD PACKAGING DESIGNERS!** Finding money for the bus. I use card for literally everything else.  
  
Edit: I now feel like I'm fully versed in the public transport payment systems of every big city. Other end of the problem in London - the buses don't accept cash. You *have* to use an Oyster card (or a contactless credit card). "Unexpected item in bagging area"

[Edit] Thank you kind person for my first Reddit Gold! As a thank you today I will find one of these machines and put something really unexpected in the bagging area. [deleted] Please wait for assistance. "An attendant will be with you shortly." It's situations like these that make people steal things out of spite. I did that with a parking garage once. I tried to pay any the machine wouldn't accept my card and it told me "please pay lot attendant" It was 2am and nobody was to be found plus the building upstairs was closed. So I broke the fucking arm and drove away. Aha! We finally found you! I may have used to steal $0.12 of jalapeno every week because the scale couldn't register something that small and I had better things to  do Or "Please place item." After you did. this makes me irrationally angry. Also, "Please place item in the bagging area" when you try to clear some space on the tiny 1.5 square-foot bagging area. And they only give you like 10 seconds to get your shit organized. Don't harass me, lady, I don't want to crush my bread for fucks sake.  Then you start getting all nervous and you need a new bag because the other one is full. The machine is urging you again to place item in bagging area. Your hands begin to sweat and you can't grip the plastic to open the bag. The machine senses weakness. It has called for it's masters and you have failed. You are to be exterminated at next light. Knees weak

Arms heavy

UNEXPECTED ITEM

PLEASE REMOVE SPAGHETTI Oh god I heard it in my head.  On a similar note. I shop at Stop &amp; Shop weekly, or I used to, and I loved the scan and bag as you go feature. You then just scan your card and a bar code and pay at the self check lane. 

That was until I began getting selected for a "random" audit every fucking week! I have shopped there for a year using that thing and was audited every week for 17 weeks! Seriously S&amp;S, I am not a criminal. 

Emailed the manager and was said it was random and not up to them. So mad.  For me, wonky thuddy shopping cart wheels. baldness. 

They can transplant a human hand but they can't cure baldness? Come on...

 Just get a head transplant and make sure your donor head has hair. Bam, problem solved. You can transplant hair too, it's just fairly expensive for a vanity issue. DMV renewals in person. I know California has them but I dunno if other states do. Why can't we do them online? Vision test more than likely. #E

#A T
#S H I T That insane plastic clamshell packaging that has to be cut with huge scissors. And then after you cut them open you still have to cut your fingers open trying to rip apart the packaging. They're usually for padlocks, thumb drives, etc. When the YouTube iPhone app won't play music in the background, forcing me to play the song on youtube.com in Safari :/ Wait, I hadn't thought of that.  The app backgrounding is annoying but I never thought about using Safari as a workaround. Why the minimum phone contract I can get is 2 years now.  I don't want to be locked in for 2 years and I will pay you more per month. 


ISP's throttling bandwidth.  Don't you dare say you're 'truly unlimited' then fuck me during peak hours.  Voicemail. It seriously sucks

Edit for clarification: I actually use a smartphone (LG G3s) so its the voicemail that sucks, not my phone. Faucets that are so short my hands rub against the back of the sink when I'm trying to wash my hands. I want my hands cleaner not dirtier motherfucker! Tracking calories: Google needs to incorporate their menu data and buy my fitness pal.  Then I can "OK, Google: how many calories in a bacon, egg, cheese sandwich?" "OK, Google: where can I eat lunch for 600 calories or less?". "OK, Google: how many calories left in my diet today?"

Edit: thanks for all the folks that pointed out Under Armor just bought My Fitness Pal.  This is actually a REALLY good idea.  My wifi doesn't reach the toilet :( Read this as "my wife doesn't reach the toilet." Was very confused at the mental image of your 2' 10" wife pissing all over the bathroom floor. "HONEY, THIS IS THE 3RD TIME TODAY! USE YOUR DAMN PISSING TUBE!"

Edit: Forgot to write "the." Box plugs. Seriously, people? Why the fuck must we have a big ass box that takes up to three spaces on my outlet splitter? These things have existed for as long as plugs existed, so by now why isn't it common knowledge to people that these take up too much space? Stickers that leave a mess behind them. Seriously wtf. Slow WiFi, it's 2015, I shouldn't have to deal with this shit! Don't move to Canada Having to print, fill out, scan and return email a form. Make the forms electronic!  Crappy drive thrus. You know, the ones with the speakers so bad that you can't understand the person taking your order. Then they don't have the screen that shows you what your ordered, so you have to keep repeating yourself to make sure they get the order right. Then you finally get your food and they still got the order wrong. 

Also, why can't every restaurant let me order online? Why must I have to actually talk to a human? What makes me crazy is when they have a screen but it doesn't display your order, just ads. There are McDonalds that are having their drive-thru menu be a giant screen that shows everything. The problem? The formatting sucks and it changes every 3 seconds so you have absolutely no time to actually identify something you want and how much it costs before it changes to a slide about breakfast stuff when it is 10pm. Train tickets.

I booked this online on my phone, and you need me to print four pieces of paper? Get with the times

EDIT: UK. Our train services largely suck.
EDIT2: By print, I include ticket machines. Not being able to lock my phone when listening to a song on YouTube. Really? You can't get this shit to play in the background? Fuck you every youtube app ever. Charging your phone 1-2 times a day Cash-only businesses.  Bonus points if they have an ATM set up so *you* can eat the transaction fee. &gt;Cash-only businesses.  Bonus points if they have an ATM set up so *you* can eat the transaction fee.

My local bagel place is cash only.   I always wondered why so I asked the owner once.  Apparently $0.29 plus 3% of a $1.05 bagel is pretty brutal on profit margins.  
 This is why many smaller businesses have a credit card limit, like $5 or $10. Place I went for lunch today had a sign posted saying they charged extra for using a credit card. There's a bar here that charges you an extra $5 if your bill doesn't come to $20 when you use a card. And it always seems that the meal comes to $17.86 or some shit just shy of $20!  Call visa. They'll threaten the business with ripping out their CC machine if they don't stop charging that fee.  Damn. I just imagine visa dispatching a huge mobster type man-beast whose only job is forcefully ripping the machines out of non-compliant businesses.

Pretty badass. VISA doesn't fuck around. Especially when the vast majority of their time is dealing with fraud. Merchant based fraud eats right into them.  Unfortunately, the laws and rules have changed and merchants are now allowed to charge the customer a surcharge per MasterCard and Visa policies. Although, $5 on a $20 check would be way above the max allowed.

 Adding a picture to a Word document. We should make clippy come back to help with this. Oh, you'd like me to add a picture? Lemme just fuck everything up while I'm at it. Oh you'd like to format your pictures?  Can only do one at a time. And that cropping tool in Microsoft Word. Jesus it's terrible!  It's like I have to re-learn how it works by trial and error every single time I use it. You can change the default text wrapping to tight, amongst other options, to prevent unwanted rearrangements.  Right click. Change format. Behind text. You are set. 

Edit: Since people keep saying this, doing it in front of text may be better because it still allows you to move the picture no matter what. 

Edit 2: There are many options to choose from. Just know that there are solutions you can take to fix it.  This is the answer.  Trying to put anything near the top margin is impossible otherwise as well Cables. Cables everywhere. As a gamer with like a dozen consoles, its like trying to manage one of Google's server rooms.  People pay for me to travel hundres of miles to install and manage dataclosets and I've even done work in a Facebook datacenter.  Behind my TV is a personal and professional embarassment. Cable Management:

1) get some cable ties and other useful separators.

2) give up and grab a cold drink.

-/r/pcgaming Cavities, and dentistry in general.  After all this time, for all the advances in every _other_ area of healthcare, dentistry remains in the dark ages.  As technology goes, it's closer to shoeing horses than modern healthcare, yet we've been promised (And promised, AND PROMISED!!!) no more cavities and the ability to re-grow teeth for decades! Fucking public bathroom doors should ALWAYS PUSH TO OPEN FROM THE INSIDE. Then you can use your foot. What's the fucking point of everyone washing their hands for the one retard to smear shit or something all over the handles.

Edit: Yes I get it, firecodes. Well in that case just have no doors except on the cubicles and position the room so you can't see anything by looking in from the entrance. I think this is because the door might get blocked from the outside. I don't know why they can't install two-way hinges, though. Better, bathroom doors that are doorless and have a U-bend, making them impossible to peek in on, but possible to walk through without touching anything.  Think gym showers. Commercials! I mean, if you're going to show the same commercial 15 times in a half hour at least make the shit so funny that I'll actually laugh every time I see it. When I have to reset my WiFi router. Printers. What in the fuck is so hard? I should be able to plug the USB into my computer, wait two seconds, then press print. But noooooooo Window blinds.

I can never pull the stupid cord at the right angle, and they get wonky. Every. Single. Time. The fact that I have non-automated bills still pisses me the fuck off.  Like, FFS.  I can have my phone straight up order me a pizza for tomorrow evening just by touching a couple of buttons, and pay for it, and I still have to write checks for my rent.  WTF? I work for a phone/broadband company that makes it extremely difficult for customers to contact them. Like, no widely or easily available phone number on bills or their website, no real central email address. The phone numbers when you do get through are a maze of buttons on an IVR. It's ridiculous. Even staff get confused about where to send customers when they call us. Have one phone number, easy directions through the IVR to get where you want to go, and have it easily visible on your website!! It's a massive international company ffs.  The cataract test where they shoot a puff of air into your open eye.  Medieval!!! This is actually a test for glaucoma. Which is the leading cause of blindness, by the way. Glaucoma is a build up of pressure on the eye and the alternative to the air puff is probably a doctor touching your eye with his finger to make sure it's squishy enough.. I can't believe nobody has said this yet but in the US, doing taxes. The government already knows everything they need to to give me an accurate assessment of what I owe, the only reason we still need to hire people to do our taxes for us is because those people are [lobbying to keep it complicated](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/business/24digi.html?_r=0). Many European countries simply send their citizens a report each year informing them of what they owe or refunds they're receiving, they complete the transaction and that's all that needs to happen. Really the onus shouldn't even be on us to prepare this stuff. When job searching, why the fuck do I have to upload my resume, then manually fill out all of my work information afterward? Living out in the middle of nowhere and having to get my internet connection off of a five gig mobile hotspot that has to be set in just the right place to pick up a signal.  Slow internet. With fibre optic and all that jazz I shouldn't have to wait 2 and a half hours to download a 1gb game on Steam or have to put up with constant buffering watching a 4-5 minute video on YouTube. radio ads with car crashing sounds and siren sounds.

that should void a radio license. force them to reapply and promise not to do that again. Buying a vehicle! 

New or used. Having to go in armed with haggling techniques, mechanical knowledge and anti finance-salesman powers.. what a fucking joke. 

Let me just click some buttons online, go into the dealership without meeting fucking Jerry and taking his card and answering his stupid prying questions, get the keys and test drive it privately without his annoying ass trying to tell me shit I don't care about while I'm just trying to concentrate on the vehicle. (did you know Jerry actually owned this particular vehicle model before and it runs great and usually outperforms any statistic that you can bring up?) Let me buy a vehicle that doesn't have some douche's name stickered on the trunk to remind me how much I despise the business that tried to sell me a vehicle for $2,000 more than it was worth before I argued, inspected and returned 3 fucking times before writing a check to their sleazy establishment. 
FUCK! 

Why hasn't their been some major legislative intervention!? What the hell is this, an Indian marketplace run by Bank of America? Please, for the love of Tesla and my sanity, by the time I buy my next car, this shit better be like buying an iPhone: Order online/fondle in store, avoid the respectful and knowledgable salespeople, walk out with product, spend the exact amount of money as planned.  Refilling a prescription online... But they only accept and process your request during business hours. Motherfucker, queue it up for tomorrow! Don't make me submit this shit again!  The fact that I have to pay 80 bucks a month for 400 channels when I only fucking watch 20, tops. What kind of bullshit caveman type of world am I living in. Goddamn  I got so fed up with my printer the other day, I threw it in the fireplace.  I spent 15 minutes trying to get the damn thing to work.  Ultimately I decided it did not deserve to continue existing.

Meanwhile, my 3D printer has printed dozens of objects for over a hundred hours of total print time.  Not all came out fine, but it's track record is better than the goddamn paper printer.

What. The. Fuck. Sounds like it's time for you to print out a bunch of blocks with letters on them, and 3d print yourself a printing press. The fucking Post Office. Ain't nobody got time for that.  The squeak an ironing board makes when you open it. I think being one of the middle guys on a bobsled team wouldn't be that bad. You wouldn't win any races, but nobody could blame it on just you I reckon they'd know when you can't even keep up the pace during the push. *fall on your face and kick over the others as you flop to the ground. If your teammates are in on it (trying to help keep your lie a secret) then you might be okay for a long time.

If you are trying to fool your teammates I think they'll catch you right away. I think we have the plot to Cool Runnings 2. FEEL THE RHYTHM, FEEL THE RHYME GET ON UP, IT'S BOBSLED TIME CCCCCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLL RRRRUUUUNNNNNNIIIIINNNNNNGGGGGGSSSSS ... Sanka, ya dead? Ya, mon. A Brazilian footballer, who was a striker, managed a 20 year career without scoring a single goal purely through conning the team's he signed for, it's a fantastic story. http://www.4dfoot.com/2013/06/18/carlos-henrique-kaiser-footballs-greatest-liar/ As a Sunderland fan it seems to me we sign this guy every few years At least you're not Southampton.

&gt;In 1996 Graeme Souness immortalised himself in football folklore by falling for an amazing scam that resulted in him signing a player, so bad, that it made Harry Redknapps decision to buy Marco Boogers look inspirational. It all started when Ali Dia, a desperate 30 year-old wannabe, convinced his agent to phone the Southampton boss pretending to be World Footballer of the Year George Weah recommending his cousin (Ali Dia) as the next big thing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyI-OfT7zYM Fucking Ali Dia.... What an embarrassment that was Link is broken... http://www.sportskeeda.com/football/carlos-henrique-kaiser-the-story-of-footballs-greatest-conman

A strange story...

 "As his appetite for success grew, he decided to take his skills (or the lack of it) to French shores, and joined Ajaccio, a team from the island of Corsica.

Brazilian football was in vogue at the time, and the arrival of a new foreign import had the locals waiting with bated breath. Expectedly then, the clubs fans flocked to their home stadium to catch a glimpse of Kaiser during his first training session.
Realising that his ruse would have been uncovered had he faked another of his injuries at that moment, Kaiser picked up every single ball that was available on the pitch and kicked them into the stands as souvenirs to the adulating fans, while kissing the clubs badge to get the fans on his side.


His surprised teammates didnt have a ball to practice with thereafter, resulting in the side doing only physical drills, which Kaiser didnt have any qualms towards."

Haha. This guy ^ You have to give the man credit:  He knew how to think on the fly.  The man is a legend at his trade. A real life George Costanza. Jorge Costanza "That's it, Jerry! The balls! They can't play without any balls!" 

Edit: [Gold!] (http://gfycat.com/OrganicTintedGuineapig#)  fake it till you make it  This might apply if he was actually practicing in secret with a private trainer and then came out one day as a decent player. That actually would make the story much more satisfying and the guy a pseudo-hero rather than a conman. There is an artistic beauty to how he pulled this off. Shit 20 years ? Not even mad that is Amazing. There's also a footballer named Ali Dia, who convinced the world he was a cousin of legendary footballer George Weah. The rumour led to Southampton *(a premier league club in england, so top of the bill)* offering him a contract. It was a contract for one month. He played one game and was released from the contract. It lasted 14 days. 

[His wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Dia)

[Also, a video on the whole thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyI-OfT7zYM) He even came on as a substitute in a Premier League match against Leeds, but was substituted back off after about 50 minutes once they realise how bad he was. Any of the sports Air Bud was able to go pro in, I suppose. Whenever you're having a bad day, just be thankful you've never been kicked off a basketball team to make room for a golden retriever. Ain't no rule says a dog can't play baseball. Now play ball! There's nothing in the rulebook that says a giraffe can't play footbaaaaaall. The coach would have felt really dumb if they had lost Let me introduce you to [Carlos Henrique Kaiser](http://www.sportskeeda.com/football/carlos-henrique-kaiser-the-story-of-footballs-greatest-conman).  Kaiser, though lacking the skill required to be a professional soccer player, had a twenty year career as a striker, playing for a number of professional teams.  When his famous footballing friends, including Romario, Renato Gaucho and Edmundo, signed a contract, they would insist that Carlos receive a three month trial contract.  Almost immediately, Carlos would fake an injury, and then spend his time "recuperating" ingratiating himself with his teammates, including by hiring women to keep the players company in their hotels.  Once, when it appeared Carlos would actually be put on the field, he intentionally insulted the fans, earning a red card which kept him out of the game.  In his twenty year career, Carlos never scored a goal.   That guy is a genius. There is a long [segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-023oDop7tM) of the late sunday show here in Brazil about him, with an interview with the guy. 

He claimed, while being interviewed that he was part of CA Independiente (Argentina) squad at 1984 Libertadores championship run. Globo, the network responsible for the interview, called Independiente and asked information on the player and received the proof that Kaiser is still a liar. The Carlos Henrique on CA Independiente's squad was another person. LOL I looked up Carlos Henrique on Wikipedia.  Six guys came up, and they're all Brazillian footballers.  None of them were this guy. luge.  You could do that one against your will.  Edit.  OK OK I know it's Seinfeld. If your from an small country and want to go to the Olympic luge is a good way to do it. You won't win but you'll go to the games.  I'd rather do something that would kill me a little less.  Like biathlon.
 Cross country skiing is a better choice. Less costly. You have more low level nations in cross country than biathlon. In fact, at Sochi in 2014, there was no extremely illogical participant in biathlon while you could find Greek or India participants in cross country.

Biathlon is quite good at being elitist. Cross country skiing is exhausting, though. Give me the luge. Biathlon is meant to be *the* most physiologically demanding sports out there. You have to go from pushing everything in your body hard (while skiiing) to slowing down, relaxing, and focussing (while shooting) in a few seconds. Isn't he point to be not good and get away with it? Luge sounds like the best bet  Hunting. "Nope hunny, deer must be out somewhere else." I was talking with a guy at an archery range about bow hunting. He was shooting a recurve bow at the time and I asked if that's what he hunts with. 

He said "no I hunt with my compound. If I hunted with my recurve my wife would think I'm cheating on her since I'd never come home with anything" 

Made me laugh  Backup goalie on the Florida Panthers. Luongo played 61 games last year. I'd probably get like 1/3rd of the way into the season before they realize I can't actually play. Except that whole practice thing.  talkin' bout practice! Luongo's 61 games are amateur hour compared to Mikka Kiprusoff's run with the Flames.  Seven straight 70+ game seasons. Or the Devils. Schneider played almost every game. Holtby started 73 this season. League leader. Professional poker. Just don't draw attention to myself. Bet low. I could probably last a few hours.  Also, Fold Fold Fold Fold Fold.


Check a couple times.


Fold Fold. Make a comment about ~~having shit hands~~ how you hated to fold that one hand, but Tom D has got you beat.


Check. Raise. Fold. Fold Fold


"he's playing it safe ken." Folding pocket aces preflop? Discipline.  this is true. In competitions you can survive for a very long time and watch a lot of people drop out, just by folding your cards every turn and living of your big blinds. This needs crossposted in r/poker - I can just imagine the feels this will cause. As a poker player I have no special ability to speak for the whole community.. but I'm pretty sure they'd be fine with it. There is the [famous case of a guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nwCOOnA4vk) who folded two Aces because he was an amateur who had reached his goal which would help him pay off a huge debt or something and he got respect for having the balls to fold Aces. And it turned out to be the right play, even though its never the right play (in poker theory).

Honestly the poker community is pretty friendly. Sit down at a table in a casino and you might be surprised how much rude behavior is discouraged or just not practiced. eh, i've gone to many a casino where the big shot poker player who knows all the strategy is bad mouthing under his breath the fish at the table for making "stupid" plays.  sometimes he'll even turn to the person next to them in disbelief if he gets so fed up.  there are definitely assholes at the poker tables. As someone who pokers for a living, I can assure you we hate these people as much as you do. In fact, we probably hate them more because they drive away recreational players who just want to have fun without being told 'such a retard, how does he call there he's practically drawing dead vs my river checkraise range blah blah blah'. 

If someone really does make a bad play against you and wins, you should smile and say, 'Great call, dude' because you want to encourage him to keep doing it, not try and teach him to play better. This also has a side effect of making you seem like a nice person.  exactly! why would you berate and alienate your prey, when in reality you want to keep them around so you can milk them for all their money.  if they make bad plays you're supposed to take advantage of it, not point out the mistakes...

its not like a pack of wolves yells out which elk/moose they're going to go for first, that wouldn't really help them out. I reckon the World Rally Championship. Even the pros can fire off the start line, and wrap it round a tree on the first bend.

Next rally in two months, repeat. " Damn I can't drive stick shift" So just stall on the line and blame the engine. "This thing is fucked!"

Or just do what Tom Cruise did in days of thunder and redline the fuck out of it until you throw a piston. LIttle bitch most of the modern cars use sequential shifters, don't even need to learn stick anymore Well you could just be a navigator and get a driver that doesn't understand you. Me - "Six left minus over crest tightens five one hundred crest hairpin right"

Driver - "This is fucking MacDonald's drive through, you tit." Easy fries maybe.  [Bog Snorkelling](http://i.imgur.com/GNf7XZS.jpg) This sounds like something you have to pay extra for. Hey baby, there's an extra fifty in it for you if you snorkel my bog. So what's the goal here?  Swim a certain distance and hope you don't get covered in leeches and contract malaria? That sounds like a swear word.

"You bog snorkeling son of a bitch" [deleted] Cricket. Just stand at fine leg while fielding and the ball will never come to you. What happens when it's your turn to bat?  Even the best players get out for a duck sometimes. You could go 5 days of play and not get found out. Example match, you bat 5, top 4 all hit hundreds, you declare before getting in, bowl them out and win by an innings. Laziest few days ever! You might even get picked for the next test in that case. Almost sounds like Rob Quiney for Australia. He managed 9 on debut, didn't bat in the 2nd inns, then got a pair in his second test. Hasn't been picked since. None of these words mean anything to me What happens when your batch flops and you don't have enough tallies to fleen? ^^I ^^know ^^absolutely ^^nothing ^^about ^^cricket. Just leave anything outside off stump, block any yorkers and cut the bouncers. I like to play off the back foot though, so I pull the bouncers. Prepare for one in the eat then. Nice. I just tweezle to the legthrum, then try to gromp a bit. When your vorpal blade goes snicker-snack, just leave it dead and go galumphing back. Scrabble, it'd be at least a few turns before your opponent would be able to determine that you probably could have played "quartzy" or "syzygy" when instead you played "yum" and "gut". I'm not a native english speaker, but I understand quite a few words. I recently watched some of the games in the Scrabble World Cup (or something like that). I may have recognize one out of ten words they were using. I play Scrabble. I do not like it, but my family does.

There is an official Scrabble dictionary and the game is not about words, but about knowing what is in the dictionary.

In fact, literacy gets in the way of being good at Scrabble. 

 [Scottish 2nd Place National Champion here]

As you say, professional scrabble is about the strategy of calling bluffs and making bluffs on what is in the dictionary - not so much about being able to construct words (which any amateur player should already be able to do).

It would be very easy to spot an amateur, as they simply would not call your tricks correctly and would be sticking to words they know are real - not obscure misspellings etc. from the scrabble dictionary.

I wrote a post on this when it came up before:
http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/328ua8/one_of_my_favorite_scenes_in_this_show/cq90dpk?context=3 I'll be playing my cousin in Words, and I'll spend 20 minutes looking for a sophisticated sounding word before playing "dog" I'm a 6'5" white guy.  I could warm the bench in the NBA for YEARS as long as they didn't do anything stupid like try to sub me into the game.

EDIT: Yes, I know that I would be an average sized (at best) guard in the NBA and that NBA players are REALLY, REALLY good.  I've played against DI college players who haven't even made the league and gotten absolutely torched. I've seen the Scalabrine videos. Just making a joke about being a chronic benchwarmer here. All during high school and undergrad, I got asked if me, 6'4" white guy played basketball. Get me on the court and I look like a newborn giraffe trying to walk for the first time. That's before you pass me the ball.... I'm a 6' 6" white guy and in college hung out with the basketball team from time to time, at parties we would all just pretend I was on the team and was the "best sixth man in the A10". Nobody ever questioned it.  Hell, if you can box out, grab an occasional rebound, and just pass the ball to Melo whenever you get it the Knicks will probably give you a 7 figure salary.  Anybody got Phil Jackson's number? &gt;dellett

Delevedova? Too late dude they subbed you in lol Curling. I've practiced one particular motion all my life.. The NBA. I could be the white guy on the bench who never plays and constantly high fives the actual people who play.  I don't know, all that towel waiving must take years of training to perfect. The White Mamba will never be surpassed What's the sport in which women run and dance with a ribbon? 

That..  But for men Rhythmic gymnastics.   You know what I'd pay to watch? Rhythmic Gymnastics, but half way through the routine they release a ~~heard~~ herd of cats onto the floor.  &gt;half way through ... they release a heard of cats onto the floor. 

That's cheating. *Every* sport would be made interesting that way.  The gymnast wears a white jumpsuit and flies a white ribbon, and the cats are all lightly sprayed with brightly colored (and non toxic of course) paints.  The score is based on what percentage of your suit and ribbon remains unpainted.  The cats are given different colors so that fans can additionally cheer for a particular cat.

This actually happened in football.

Ali Dia faked a phone call pretending to be FIFA World Player of the Year, George Weah, to the manager of Southampton, Graeme Souness.
He claimed to have a cousin, Ali Dia, who had played for Paris Saint Germain, represented his country 13 times and was the next big thing.
He was offered a 1 month contract and played 1 game before being released 15 days later.

Edit: Here is footage of him playing for Southampton against Leeds ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBORkZC-CQI ). 

He started from the bench and when footballing great Matt Le Tissier was injured, Souness decided to unveil his great signing. He played for 30 minutes, roaming around the pitch occupying different positions and not understanding any of the English his coach was shouting at him, before he was subbed. Quote from Le Tissier:

&gt; He ran around the pitch like Bambi on ice; it was very embarrassing to watch Ha, Ali Dia Southampton: 8:17 to 9:25 I heard tiger shot an 80 yesterday. So I'd say golf Well you're definitely a great golfer if not pro.  I'm STOKED if I break 100.   I'm stoked if I'm below 80 on the front 9 Th-there's... there's someone who plays as bad as I do?!

I'm sorry, brother.  Yea because shooting an 80 at that course is so easy...

Luckily everyone in /r/golf is basically a pro that can consistently drive 320+ yards so they would have no problem with it.  &gt;320 yards

Pffft with my 7 iron  Amateur.  I'll use just my Sand wedge and my putter to tear it apart.   Plebes. I can drive it 300 yards with nothing but my flaccid penis. I can drive 300 yards with my car.  I had to unsub from /r/golf because I just don't care whose dad bought them new clubs this month.  I think my best bet would be baseball, specifically right fielder.  I developed a bit of a technique in little league that I believe would serve me well here.

#IT LOOKS LIKE THE PHILLIES BATTER IS HAVING A HEART ATTACK

#AND WE CAN SEE WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE RIGHT FIELDER TWIRLING IN CIRCLES?

#WELL THAT SEEMS TO BE QUITE A STRANGE ACT GOING ON THERE **NOT PROPER BASEBALL AT ALL. HERE'S THE GHOST OF HARRY CARAY TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING OR ANOTHER.** HEY! IF YOU WERE A GHOST DO YOU THINK YOU'D SCARE YOURSELF? Way to kick it in, Pele. When the ball does get hit to you, "slip" on the field to make it seem like the field is bad condition.  You could probably go like 0 for 20 before they realize that you're not a professional...0 for 30 if you play for the Phillies. After every phillies game the manager lets the team run the bases! So exciting for the players This made me want to laugh and cry at the same time It's actually kind of sad how far they've declined after winning two straight pennants from 08-09 and making the playoffs every year from 07-11, and now they're not even competent anymore. Otherwise, it's great for me because I'm a Nationals fan. Sigh. I miss the days when the Phillies would sell out Nationals Park.  I remember the first Nationals game I ever went to in 2008, there were more Phillies fans than Nationals fans there. It was a blowout too, 8-2 in the 2nd. You knew things were bad when the Nationals, a few years ago, had to hold a promotion to try and take back the park from Phillies fans. But times have changed, and Amaro's ineptitude caught up with the team. Pretty sure there was an Onion article making fun of the Brewers with a joke like that lol For the lazy.

http://www.theonion.com/article/brewers-stay-after-game-run-bases-50433 I don't know, not only would most people strikeout every time up, but they wouldn't even be close. An MLB player can swing and miss, but still be relatively close to making contact. Most of us would be so far off that it would be noticeable in one at bat (unless we never swung, which might get you to the second at bat before people asked serious questions). Until you've seen a 95mph fastball from the home plate perspective you really don't understand how fucking fast that ball flies by you. It's unbelievable. Then on top of that there's pitches that are close to that speed AND they hook. I've never been able to hit a curveball in my life. I don't even understand how they do it.  It makes no sense.  I remember facing 80 mph at the batting cages and thinking that was insane, lik
e I could barely even see the ball and it was past me.  How the hell can anyone ever hit an Aroldis Chapman fastball?

Look at what he does to an MVP, perennial all star and top 5 player in the game. Unreal!
 What about when you have to bat? You bunt and yell at the coach for 'giving you the wrong signs.' All you have to do is scratch your balls and spit occasionally.  Throw your hat on the ground when the other team does something that makes the crowd cheer.

Also, if you act like a petulant child and get yourself ejected from enough games, you'll quickly become a fan favorite. Oh man, getting thrown out of every game is genius! Also, you'll get more cred if you grow a beard or handlebar mustache. Just get called out on strikes once and argue with the ump - you know kick some dirt on the plate and puff up your chest and throw the water cooler out onto the field. Then you will get banned for a bunch of games and everyone will think you are a professional that got banned. First game back, repeat That will get you kicked out of the game. If you're suspended at all, it would probably only be a game or two Touch the umpire just enough to get a multi game suspension But don't touch him where you would get a prison sentence.  The NFL.

You get drafted, then you've got months before people realize you're a worthless sack of lard. **Example: JaMarus Russell**

Edit: Fuck it, I'm leaving it as JaMarus. If he can't spell it, why should I worry? Just pretend to tear your ACL in that time and no one will ever know. Genius. Would you like to be my agent? I would but I tore my ACL. The Agent Conman Ligament  As an LSU fan, I'd trade his antics for the QBs we've had over the last few years any day. Hold out negotiating your contract.  It could be months before you even make it to a practice. Quidditch, as long as you're not the Seeker, you basically don't matter. Still when you couldn't even get off the ground, they might realize you are neither a professional nor a wizard. That's what tippy-toes are for. "He seems to be going for a skimmer play, Seamus. Keeping it low to the pitch. It's a bold strategy."  "It is a little odd, for a Keeper. But who knows, it may just pay-- he stepped on the snitch. We're gonna have to break out the rulebooks for this one." There is a rule for that actually: the [snitchnip](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Snitchnip) and the penalty is quite severe. The team of that player immediately loses. Okay, I know a *ton* of really obscure information, but this is now by *far* the most obscure thing that I know. I always thought that it was the broomsticks that were enchanted, so that anyone who had access to them could ride them whether they were a wizard or not. In the first book,  several of the students can't get the broom into their hands by saying "up",  which I think implies that it takes magic to control a  broom.  I took it as, the broom straight didn't respect them. Seems like everything has a personality in that world. Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain That's why I replaced my horse's skull cap with plexiglass. Yea,  but I assume it would still take some form of skill to be able to control/ride it Been handling a stick twixt my nethers since puberty, so it can't be too difficult. Tell that to the Irish Victor Krum was an asshole for catching the snitch in the WC final. His team were only down by 160 and they'd scored once before in the game, it wasn't that crazy to think they get a lucky score. It's clear he only cares about padding his stats and his reputation as the greatest seeker in the world instead of his country winning. He's a fucking asshole. Nah, they were 170-10 down, by the time they got a lucky score they'd be much further down. I'd have been pissed if I'd spent money on the tickets for him to catch the snitch that early. At least give them a game.   The chances are slim they get a lucky score. But you fucking take that chance. It'd be like taking a knee because the odds of someone actually catching a Hail Mary pass are slim. You have to rely on your teammates' slim chance of pulling something off. Krum probably hates his teammates or his country. He was an asshole Prima Donna. Oh my god, it's real  http://blog.solneelman.com/wp-content/uploads/quidditch01(pp_w914_h609).jpg Oh it is so real and incredibly fun. And a snitch is worth 30 points so everybody matters. 

Edit: I don't think anybody will see this but this video explains it perfectly in only two minutes. 

http://youtu.be/RG3fmTdnvHg I'd do it if I didn't have to use a broomstick  And they have world cups, here is a trailer

And here is a snitch

Give me some ecstasy and put some good music on and I'll bring home the gold no problem. Performance enhancing drugs are banned man! You didn't specify a role in the sport. If I could manage to become a referee in the NBA or a chair umpire in Tennis, I bet I could make it a few games before being called out.  The professionals who have been doing it for 20 years are usually "called out" within 20 minutes.  YOU CAN NOT BE SERIOUS!!! ARE YOU BLIND REF? OR ARE YOU HERE FROM THAT REDDIT THREAD?!? Poker The trick is to look the part. Yes you're inside, but it's imperative that you wear sunglasses. The darker the better. If you think, "Man, I can hardly see what my cards are with these on..." then you're off to a great start. 

Next you'll need some headphones. You may be thinking, "I'm going to need to hear the game and listen to the dealer and other players, though." That's exactly why you need headphones. You need the biggest ones you can find. Beats By Dre are perfect. Wear them around your neck and play your favorite music (of course it's Linkin Park) just loud enough so the two guys beside you can hear it and think, "Wow, this guy's really cool. Shit! That's Linkin Park, I better keep my eye on this shark." 

This last step is VERY important. It really brings the rest of the ensemble together, and I've been told by a close personal friend who talks about how awesome it'd be to play poker in Vegas all the time. You need a hat. Then a beanie. And then you throw on the biggest winter coat you can find. It has to have a hood too. But what gives? You already have on a hat and a beanie, why the hood? Isn't poker played inside in a climate-controlled area? It's all about intimidation. It's about the feelings you instill in your opponents. And this ensemble will instill the proper feelings in your opponents.

You want them to look at you and think one of two things:

1. Why is this Eskimo welder playing poker?

2. Is that a human being or a 2004 Honda Civic?

Once you can look at yourself in the mirror and think, "What on earth have I done?" then you're ready to play poker.  &gt;Is that a human being or a 2004 Honda Civic?

10/10 *furiously takes notes* [This guy is getting there]( http://cardplayerlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/anonymous_poker_player.png) he clearly hasn't been unlocked yet "Is that a human being or a 2004 Honda Civic?"

They'll never suspect me... *turns up pocket aces* OH **HONK** &gt; Eskimo welder With my body type, only a professional Magic player.

http://i.imgur.com/JowQAhW.jpg Bartolo Colon is that size and he plays major league baseball. Bartolo Colon sounds like one of Bart Simpson's joke names.  I love seeing pictures of that guy. Cracks me up every time! He looks like he is about to give a very serious PSA about the grim epidemic of exposed butt-cracks at Magic The Gathering conventions That's exactly what he was doing I can't remember the story, was he banned from PTQs after that or what happened? Fisherman.  I see no difference between pro anglers and weekend hacks.  You cast, you reel, maybe you catch something. Probably BMX cross or Snowboard cross. Just try to collide with one of your fellow competitors at the start and throw your board or bike in frustration. Then make your way to the finish really slowly, still showing your frustration on the other guy. Chess. I'd take a really long time to make my first move, and give a confident and knowing smile each time my opponent touched one of his pieces. I'd also learn a few Russian swear words. Only great Chess players can swear in Russian. &gt;Chess. I'd take a really long time to make my first move

it took until this point for me to notice that you're not a professional This. Games are timed, people! Also if that first move is like 1.f3, busted immediately.  This. Really good chess players tend to blaze through their favorite openings for the first couple moves. Cyka blyat -Every Russian on CSGO  and Dota 2 What you do is challenge two grand masters to a match.  To make it tougher, you tell them you will face off against them at the same time and you'll win against at least one of them.    
       
You don't want them conspiring so you put them in separate rooms.  One grandmaster will play as white and the other black.      
       
You play both games and do surprisingly well in both and even win one.  What you really did was take note of the opening move the white grandmaster started with and repeat it against the black grandmaster.  Then take note of the back grandmaster's move and repeat it back to the other.        
         
You're just acting as an intermediary between the two pros.  They'll probably know what you're doing but everyone else will be super impressed
       
 There's a very good chance that both games would end in a draw. Most well-matched high level games do.  I'd be ecstatic to get two draws against two grandmasters  I to have seen Derren Brown I'm not sure who he is, but I'm pretty sure he wasn't the one who came up with the trick.  I read it at least 20 years ago in a riddle/mind game book.  In that book they talked about a child performing the trick on two grand masters. Derren Brown did it to 9 Grand Masters/World Champions Well one of them was a high school chess champion, that's the only one he actually played &gt; Only great Chess players can swear in Russian.  

As a Dota 2 player I must disagree. Go play CS:GO, you'll learn some there. Rush B, no stop silver noob cyka blyat Not the biggest, but one of the more interesting. In Poland, during WWII, two doctors accidentally discovered a way to create a false positive in the test for Typhus. The Nazis were terrified of Typhus (there had been massive outbreaks in camps that had started spreading to German soldiers) BUT, the doctors knew it was rare for Nazis to kill Poles with Typhus. And, once a Pole was confirmed with Typhus, they could never be taken to a concentration camp, regardless of whether they recovered. 

So, the doctors injected thousands of people in their town with this experimental solution that created the false positive for Typhus. Over the course of about a year and a half, they successfully tricked the Nazis into thinking the town was undergoing a deadly, sustained Typhus epidemic, to the point where all Nazi forces were removed from the town. 

They're credited with saving over 8,000 lives. Aside from the two doctors, not one person from the town nor a single Nazi knew the outbreak was fake and in fact not one person had actually died of Typhus, or had it at all. The plan worked so well that the Rozwadow Typhus epidemic stayed on the record books for nearly 20 years before the doctors finally revealed the evidence proving it was fake.

 That is an amazing story. I have always been fascinated by the individual stories from WW2. It was so huge and impacted so many peoples lives that there is a never ending series of stories from it.  In Britain, unlike in the US, the Manhattan project had almost no security. Instead they called the project 'tube alloys' - it was deemed that sounded so boring that nobody would investigate it. Nobody did.  In the Manhattan project, when they needed Plutonium, they referred to it as Copper, to keep things boring.  If they needed actual Cu, they referred to it as 'honest-to-god copper'.  My grandfather worked at Los Alamos, so I got lots of odd stories like this. Nowadays, people would try break in to steal the "copper" and be very disappointed.   "Damn it, they don't have any copper here, just radiation poisoning"

On a side note,  they'd still like what they find. Copper was in short supply due to the war, so they used silver wiring in the calutrons they refined uranium with.  The same story for tanks. The project was named ship water tanks, seeing that the subject was bland and held no intrest, it served to keep armored tracked development a secret. In the end these tracked vehicals kept the name "tank" after the ruse name. As of waking up this morning, I had never in my life put any thought into why tanks are called that. Now I know. Tank you, stranger.

EDIT: A letter Are we sure this is correct though?  Any etymologists want to weigh in? &gt;In military use, "armored, gun-mounted vehicle moving on continuous articulated tracks," the word originated late 1915. In "Tanks in the Great War" [1920], Brevet Col. J.F.C. Fuller quotes a memorandum of the Committee of Imperial Defence dated Dec. 24, 1915, recommending the proposed "caterpillar machine-gun destroyer" machines be entrusted to an organization "which, for secrecy, shall be called the 'Tank Supply Committee,' ..." In a footnote, Fuller writes, "This is the first appearance of the word 'tank' in the history of the machine." He writes that "cistern" and "reservoir" also were put forth as possible cover names, "all of which were applicable to the steel-like structure of the machines in the early stages of manufacture. Because it was less clumsy and monosyllabic, the name 'tank' was decided on." They were first used in action at Pozieres ridge, on the Western Front, Sept. 15, 1916, and the name was quickly picked up by the soldiers. Tank-trap attested from 1920.

If I were General of the Tanks in the Army, I would change the name back to this.  To be fair, boring is the way to go. The biggest diamond ever mined was the Cullinan diamond, mined in South Africa. Getting it back to England was seen as a bitch of a security issue. They had a fake steamer with armed guards and a safe with a fake diamond inside it - if someone wanted to steal it, why not hit the steamer.

Instead they sent it recorded delivery in a box. Antoine-Augustin Parmentier was an advocate for potatoes in Europe. People in Europe weren't too keen on potatoes so he did this.

&gt; Parmentier therefore began a series of publicity stunts for which he remains notable today, hosting dinners at which potato dishes featured prominently and guests included luminaries such as Benjamin Franklin and Antoine Lavoisier, giving bouquets of potato blossoms to the King and Queen, and **surrounding his potato patch at Sablons with armed guards to suggest valuable goods  then instructing them to accept any and all bribes from civilians and withdrawing them at night so the greedy crowd could "steal" the potatoes**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine-Augustin_Parmentier That's some serious commitment to taters. A new root vegetable which is actually rather nutritious and grows essentially *anywhere* and *everywhere* with little specialized care required? Big money on them taters. And you dont have to worry about flocks of birds eating you crops because the food is underground. 

And its harder to for thieves to steal a bunch of potatoes. 

And even if some army rolls it they cant just torch and chop down the crop since the potatoes will grow back if you destroy the plant. Things you do need to worry about

1 over reliance on said potatoes

2 genetically homogeneous potato cultures

3 Storing all your potatoes in one place Things you could do:

1. Boil em

2. Mash em

3. Stick em in a stew Pft, right, like this has ever bitten anybody in the ass before. Shit, I'm going to plant some potatoes. The people wouldn't have anything to do with them when they were introduced. Seeing how the people reacted, they decided to treat potatoes as a delicacy, reserved for the rich and privileged. Once the common people saw that, they would want in on the action. It worked as planned. Pretty ninja actually. When Bush went to visit Iraq a few Thanksgivings ago they sent the full convoy in loops around DC and stuffed Bush in the back of a single Suburban with a few agents and drove him to Andrews. No one knew until he was in Iraq.  Imagine being stuck in traffic and turning your head only to see George Bush looking back at you. Imagine waking up at night, panting, drenched in sweat, turning your head to see George Bush looking back at you.  "ehehehe" Columbus and the 1504 eclipse. On his fourth voyage Columbus found himself stranded in Jamaica.  The locals were initially cooperative, but after a year or so got sick of Columbus' crews douchbaggery, and basically wanted them gone. Columbus had a a star almanac with him and noticed a lunar eclipse coming up, so he called the natives together and told them that his god was mad they had started to become so inhospitable, and was going to take the moon out of the sky. Sure enough, when night came the moon slowly turned red and everyone begged Chris to make it stop. He said he had to go pray about the whole thing, and locked himself in his cabin with an hourglass waiting until he knew the moon would be coming out of the shadow, came out and basically said okay, God says he'll bring the moon back if your start supplying us again. (Which they did.)
 I wonder how different things would have been today if the natives didn't buy it.

"My god made the moon disappear!"

"Listen, we may be natives but we know about fucking lunar eclipses." "Check this idiot! He thinks *God* causes the Earth's rotation to move between the sun and the moon!" "Where does this idiot think he is? India?" Ouch a Columbus burn. Too soon I say. I think the Mayans would be wise to Colombus's shenanigans.  The benefit of a strong written language cannot be overstated.  He totally MacGyver'd their asses That reminds me of the Tintin book "Prisoners of the Sun" ... I wonder if that's where Herg got the idea?

https://ubikcan.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/tintin.jpg Darkwing Duck did that as well, but he got the day off so he had to chant for a whole day until the sun eclipsed. [You know how you survive?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrPU5_lBWX4)

In 1980 IBM needed an operating system, and Gates in a desperate bid for survival told IBM he had what they needed. 

Here was the catch though - Gates and his team [had nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-exH8_3mfI).

There was another two-bit company in Seattle, called Seattle Computer Products and they would sell their system (86-DOS) to Microsoft for nearly nothing - $50-75K.

Microsoft would tinker with it to make it ready for IBM, call is MS-DOS and the rest is history.  Interestingly, 86-DOS was originally called QDOS, Quick and Dirty Operating System. ...which would make MS-DOS, Microsoft Dirty Operating System. Wow. Microsoft switched out the word Dirty for Disk though. Micro Soft Disk.


Oh Shit. Ever heard a man who took the city all by himself? His name was Leo Major.


Major started his overseas tour in 1941, serving in Le Regiment de la Chaudiere. On D-Day, he was wounded by a grenade, resulting in the partial loss of vision in his left eye. Major refused to be sent home, arguing that he only needed one good eye to sight a rifle. He was placed in the scout platoon and became handy with his rifle, earning himself a reputation as an excellent sniper.

In April 1945, Majors regiment was approaching the city of Zwolle.  His commanding officers asked for two volunteers to do a reconnaissance run and report on the  number of German troops patrolling the city. If possible, the volunteers were also asked to get in contact with the Dutch resistance as the Chaudiere regiment was to start firing on the city the next day. At the time, Zwolle had a population of around 50,000 people and it was likely that innocent civilians would number among the casualties.

Along with his friend Willy Arseneault, Major started to creep toward the city. Willy was killed by German soldiers around midnight after the pair ran across a roadblock. Reportedly, Willy was able to kill his attacker before dying himself. Understandably angry, Major picked up his friends machine gun and ran at the enemy, killing two of the remaining German soldiers; the rest fled in a vehicle.

Major continued on and soon ambushed a staff vehicle and captured the German driver who he had lead him to an officer drinking in a nearby tavern. He informed the officer that Canadian forces would begin firing heavy artillery on the city, resulting in the deaths of many German soldiers and Zwolle civilians alike. He didnt mention that he was alone.

Afterwards, Major gave the man his gun back and, with that seed of knowledge soon to be spread throughout the German troops, he immediately began running up and down the streets shooting a machine gun and tossing grenades. The grenades made a lot of noise, but he made sure to place them where they wouldnt cause much damage to the town or its citizens.

In the early hours of the morning, he stumbled upon a group of eight soldiers. Though they pulled a gun on him, he killed four and caused the rest to flee. Major himself escaped the confrontation without injury and only one regret: he later stated he felt he should have killed all of them.

As he continued his campaign of terror throughout the night, the German soldiers began to panic, thinking a large body of Canadian forces were attacking them.  By 4 a.m., the Germans had vanished. An entire garrisonestimated to have been made up of several hundred soldiershad been made so afraid of nothing more than a single, one-eyed man that they fled the town. The city of Zwolle had been liberated without the need for the death of civilians or many of the soldiers on both sides of the lines that would have taken part in the messy battle.

Rather than fall asleep after running around the city in the wee hours of morning avoiding German gunfire and causing all kinds of mayhem, Major enlisted the help of several Dutch civilians to retrieve the body of his friend Willy. Only after his friends body had been recovered did Major report to his commanding officer that there was no enemy in the city. The Canadian army marched in to the sound of cheers rather than gun shots. For his actions at Zwolle, Major received a Distinguished Conduct Medal.

That's only one of his heroics. Google him.
 Bias of Priene was quite the smartypants. 

He came up with the classic "feed your last animals your last wheat to show the besieger that you're totally not running out of food",  during king Alayettes siege of Priene in the 6th Century BC.

**Edit for clarity.**

Basically to paraphrase the legend of Lady Caracas (One I haven't seen in the replies yet!) 

After five years, we were running low on resources. So what I did was, I grabbed the last pig we had, stuffed it with the last dots of ~~corn~~ wheat (sorry /u/ankensam) we had left, and threw it over the barricades, to show our besiegers that we were far and away from starvation. They thought that if we had pigs left, and the pigs even ate ~~corn~~ wheat,  that we surely had plenty left for years to come. 

As such our besiegers realized that there was little point in continuing their costly siege, and they gave up and went home. 

(What makes this a fun explanation is that the falling back was also a bluff, they actually turned around and took the city a bit later as it was celebrating that the attackers had pulled back, and killed everybody. Don't you love it when history takes a dark turn?) This is also a Croatian folk tale, the story goes that the Turks were surprised by the resistance when they tried to conquer the fort of Djurdjevac, and their leader, Ulama-beg opted for a long-term sieging tactic to starve out the defenders. After a while, food really did run out in the fort, except for a single chicken that was hidden by an old lady. When it was discovered, the defenders obviously wanted to eat it, but the old lady convinced their leader to instead put it in a cannon and fire it at the surrounding Turks. Dismayed that the Croats had enough food to fuck around like that, they left, cursing the Croats for "chickens". Ah, firing livestock, the same strategy used in Monty Python. Sorry, I don't mean to argue here, but what is this supposed to achieve? Are they banking on the besieger thinking "whoaps, they still have food. Lets go home?"

Edit: thanks for the answers, people. I forgot that the attrition goes both ways, and the besiegers are running on scarcity as much as the town/castle residents are. I believe so. Remember,a sieging army also needs a lot of food and water. If the army is close to running out, and they see the people they're sieging aren't, they might just leave. Plus besieging armies often were not any better off than the defenders on the dying-of-disease-in-the-mud front. Shit is expensive to maintain in money and lives both. Pretty much, yeah. If the beseiged territory can outlast the beseigers's ability to scavenge the surrounding area and the beseigers don't set up supply lines, the beseigers will probably go home. if the besieged have enough supplies to outlast the besiegers, then it's not at all worth trying to siege the place.  I don't remember the name of the guy, but he made a whole city dissappear. 


During WWII the Brittish Army hired a magician, who formed a team of con artists. They were the inventors of desert camouflage (using BBQ sauce and camel poo) and built fake palm trees with radio stations.

But their most impressive operation was saving a city from German air raids. Every night, the city, close to a bay with a high strategic value, would switch off every light. Then, in the next bay over, indistinguisable at night from the real one, a fake city would switch theirs own. The Germans would bomb the fake one, and leave the real deal alone. Every morning, the Brittish team would start controlled fires and then put them out as German observation planes flew over them and turned back, before getting to the fake city. The German air command, running out of ammunition, decided the city was not worth it.


EDIT: Ok, guys, you all want to see the documentary. It's History Channel, not Discovery. [Here it is!](https://vimeo.com/78663001) Also, since Britain had made Germany's spy network their bitch, when the V2 starting falling on Britain (with no way to stop it), Britain simply started sending back false bomb-damage assessments about the accuracy. 

The actual V2's were on target, at first. Britain simply told Germany that they'd overshot, and the Germans adjusted their aim.

V2's started falling in less populated areas after that. I always loved how the Brittish bluffed their way out of everything during WWII. In the documentary I saw they said that the guy in charge of making the city disappear used to radio HQ when the planes showed up saying things like "Here they come again, let's see if they hit anything today", without encrypting it, just to piss them off cheeky bastards Man, I love how the British handled WWII before the Americans showed up. I don't mean to sound like one of those "Americans saved the day, fuck yeah" type of people, I just think it's awesome how the British knew it would be a while before they'd actually be able to launch a counteroffensive of any sort against the Germans. So instead of giving up they kind of just sat there on their island and fucked with the Germans until they could rebuild. My grandpa received a medal for making another city disappear: they had to protect it as they were building Spitfires there, so they basically lit huge smokestacks to hide the whole city. Chemical engineering ftw. My grandfather too received a medal for making a city disappear. Its name was Tokyo.       

Edit: Holy shit, I was unaware of how many people did not know Tokyo was firebombed to hell, incurring more economic damage and human death than either of the atom bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. A lot of people don't know about the firebombings that took place in Japan.  Most of them were as lethal as the atomic bombs.  Same thing happened in Germany with bombings like Dresden.   Many of the firebombings that preceded the atom bombs were more deadly. The only reason they were not is because we literally destroyed all the other targets and these were just next in line. Yep, everything in Tokyo was made of wood and paper, so once the fires started it spread like crazy "10,000,000 dead in a couple of months of firebombing!" "Meh"

"200,000 dead in a day" "Holy shit, this is pure evil, we're fucked"

... actually, that kinda makes sense if they thought these bombs could be dropped every day... yup one bomber, one bomb, and an entire city fucked. Now just imagine every b29 loaded with an atom bomb that's every single Japanese city gone.  Holy shit your grandfather was Godzilla? That's badass  Roughly 88% destroyed via firebombs. The main reason se didnt nuke it...it was already destroyed [Juan Pujol Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Pujol_Garcia) Was refused entry into MI5 because he did not have any semblance of experience in the spy business. He then decided to become a freelance double-spy from his home in Spain, feeding false information to the Nazis using a tourist's map of Britain. He invented himself a network of spies that fed him information, the network later grew to become 27 persons, so many spies that Germany stopped sending spies to Britain, because *holy shit we've already got 28 spies over there*. He eventually was recruited by MI5 which helped him grow his spy network, and helped him score a few needless hits so the Nazis would not understand what is going on. He eventually was put on operation overlord, feeding false information about the landing being in pas-de-calais. When the landing eventually happened at not pas-de-calais, he sent a pre-dated letter explaining in details the actual landing, the Nazis were amazed at the exactitude of the (late) information and he landed an Iron cross.

He also faked the death of one of his fake guy, who became ill and could not see a very real battleship leaving Scotland, he put a fake obituary in a real journal, and convinced the Nazis to pay a real pension to his fake widow. The Capture of Fort Detroit in the War of 1812. British general Brock took the fort (582 Regulars and 1600 militiamen) with a minimal force (50 regulars, 250 volunteers, and 200 natives) by shelling the walls, screaming, and continuously marched their men around to make it appear as though they had a force of several thousand regulars and natives. The British continued to support this by sending a letter they knew would be intercepted by the Americans that asked for no more natives be allowed into the area as there were already 5000 there. All of these mind games made American General Hull believe he was facing a superior force and he surrendered the fort to them without a fight. Letter Brock wrote to the American commander, General William Hull. "Sir; it is far from my inclination to join a war of extermination, but you must be aware that the numerous body of Indians who have attached themselves to my troops will be beyond my control the moment the contest commences." Only a Brit could make such an eloquently phrased threat. Polite,firm and with a dash of casual racism? That's the empire I know and love.  Operation Mincemeat was pretty neat.

UK intelligence dropped a dead supposed 'pilot' off the Spanish coast with false information that the allies were going to invade Greece, not Sicily. So convinced were the Nazis that, when the allies actually invaded Sicily, it was quickly overcome and served as a launching pad...for the liberation of Greece! And apparently Ian Fleming had a hand in getting the plan put into action.

 And a member of an elite commando force in World War II - as was  his cousin, Sir Christopher Lee.

*edit - Sir Christopher I believe they had too very different roles. Lee was actually in the field as a commando. By the time the war broke up, Fleming was too senior in age and position to be considered to be out there in "thick of it." I've even hear some (I know them be weasel words) say James Bond is a sort of wish fulfillment for Fleming who didn't actually do much field work. 

My favorite story of Fleming during the war was he planned to steal a German Navy enigma codebook, which would essentially mean you wouldn't need to decrypt messages since you already have the keys. His plan was have a commando like Lee, parachute onto on the continent, steal a German plane, purposefully crash the plane into the sea (no guarantee of survival on that step either), and when a submarine comes to rescue the down "German" pilot, kill everyone on board and steal the book. I just love it, because it just sounds like the intro to a Bond story, and for such a bat-shit crazy plane nobody went, "Are you insane?" instead the operation was cancelled due to weather.  Fleming was M and Lee was Bond.  Francisco Scaramanga Francisco Sarumanga.

EDIT: Wow, thanks for the Golden Gun, kind stranger! They made a movie about this. You can watch "The Man Who Never Was" on Netflix streaming.  God I love the subterfuge and ingenuity of World War II. Today they would just track invasion forces with satellites and hit them with cruise missiles.  

Edit: I should clarify before I get more flak. I'm not saying that war isn't horrible, or that war was somehow 'better' back then. I'm just saying that the ingenuity of people back then in the face of the horrors of war should be commended. They outwitted their enemies with non-digital information networks.

A bunch of creative types. Artists, novelists, philosophers, Ian Fleming, the 1940s British equivalents of white guys with dreadlocks...

He considered the Germans - surprise! - to be ultra-rigid, ultra-linear, boring thinkers, who couldn't never counter such crazy schemes simply because they couldn't conceive of them. Inflatable false armies? Lying corpses? Litres of wine? NEIN!

Britain was *running* the damn Abwehr's intelligence network almost wholesale. They'd completely filled it with double agents and misinformation. The Germans hadn't a clue until it was too late. &gt; Britain was running the damn Abwehr's intelligence network almost wholesale. They'd completely filled it with double agents and misinformation.

For the German agents in Britain that was true.

For the German agents elsewhere, [their boss hated Hitler's guts and had been working with MI6 since 1938.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Canaris) That is fascinating. I'd never even heard of him Because the entire idea was to catch the enemy where they don't expect you to be. That's how you get things like dam busting bombs.

Edit V: The Edits are leaking Yes! What an amazing book. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Psalmanazar

He pretty much conned most of Europe and wrote a book, a completely fictitious account of Formosa (Taiwan). He even concocted a fake language to seem legit.

The book contained many gems like how Formosans would suck the warm blood of a viper every morning, and how during a festival, the hearts of 100 virgin boys would be burnt daily at an altar for 7 straight days. The Mig-25. In addition to what the USSR claimed, the US and allies saw the Mig-25 doing some amazing feats for the time such as going above Mach 3 and making quick maneuvers.

This didn't sit well with the US, as the Mig-25 was far and away better than anything the US had. After lots of complaining about what the new plane should do and be, they decided on requirements that would eventually lead to the F-15.

In 1976, the same year the F-15 entered service, a pilot defected and took his Mig-25 with him to Japan. After testing the plane on the ground and looking over service manuals, they discovered a lot they knew about the Mig-25 was wrong. It was heavier than they thought, slower than they thought, less maneuverable than they thought, and had less range than they thought. The Mig-25's that were tracked or show doing amazing feats were damaged beyond repair by said amazing feats, or had "unneeded" equipment removed.

In the end it never really mattered, as it wasn't until 1991 that F-15s and Mig-25s engaged in Iraq. Most of the Iraqi air force never left the ground, and the engagements were so limited we'll never know exactly how well the planes stacked up against each other. During the Peninsula Campaign in the Civil War the Confederate army successfully stalled McClellan's advance on Richmond by marching some soldiers in circles all day so it'd look like a constant stream of reinforcements were arriving. This gave them time for actual reinforcements to arrive and possibly save Richmond.  
   
&gt;On April 5, the IV Corps of Brig. Gen. Erasmus D. Keyes made initial contact with Confederate defensive works at Lee's Mill, an area McClellan expected to move through without resistance. Magruder, a fan of theatrics, set up a successful deception campaign. By moving one company in circles through a glen, he gained the appearance of an endless line of reinforcements marching to relieve him. He also spread his artillery very far apart and had it fire sporadically at the Union lines. Federals were convinced that his works were strongly held, reporting that an army of 100,000 was in their path. As the two armies fought an artillery duel, reconnaissance indicated to Keyes the strength and breadth of the Confederate fortifications, and he advised McClellan against assaulting them. McClellan ordered the construction of siege fortifications and brought his heavy siege guns to the front. In the meantime, Gen. Johnston brought reinforcements for Magruder.[19]

[- Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsula_Campaign#Movement_to_the_Peninsula_and_the_Siege_of_Yorktown)   My favorite quote about McClellan and his lack of action:

If he had a million men he would swear the enemy has two millions, and then he would sit down in the mud and yell for three.
Edwin M. Stanton, the United States secretary of war  During the opening years of the Japanese Sengoku Jidai, a small clan, the Matsudaira, offer themselves as vassals to the more powerful Imagawa Clan for protection.  The deal requires the Matsudaira heir to live as a hostage of the Imagawa, but their mutual enemy, the Oda, kidnap him and threaten to kill the boy unless the two clans end their alliance.

The lord of the Matsudaira's response was, "Do it."

He said that if the Oda killed his son, he would still remain allied to the Imagawa.  Losing his only heir would prove to his new allies how committed he was toward them.  

The Oda believed him and sit on the boy for a few years until he is finally rescued and ends up living a long and prosperous life under his more well known name, Tokugawa Ieyasu. Tokugawa Ieyasu ( ?, January 31, 1543  June 1, 1616) was the founder and first shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan, which virtually ruled Japan from the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 until the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Ieyasu seized power in 1600, received appointment as shogun in 1603, abdicated from office in 1605, but remained in power until his death in 1616. His given name is sometimes spelled Iyeyasu,[1][2] according to the historical pronunciation of he. Ieyasu was posthumously enshrined at Nikk Tsh-g with the name Tsh Daigongen (?). the more I read about Sengoku Jidai, the more it sounds like the family feuds in Ireland or the American South but with more decapitations per mile Basically, yeah.  

Throw in some extreme feudal chivalry, a triumvirate that would make Pompey blush, a faith militant, ninjas and guns and it's like all of history's coolest periods rolled into one. Ah yes, Tokugawa Ieyasu, of course I remember that guy..... The bloke that started a dynasty that ruled Japan from 1600 to 1868. Quite a big way to come, from 'nearly died as the heir to a small tribe' to 'father of a dynasty that ruled for 200+ years', I think.  And that Tokugawa's name? Oda Nobunaga. 

Wait, no, I did this wrong. Honestly, what you said cannot be *over*stated.

The Tokugawa period, or Edo period, signifying the switch of the nation's capitol from Kyoto to Edo(modern day Tokyo), is one of my favourite periods of any society in history. 

It saw the isolation of Japan and unprecedented national unification, economic development, and most importantly (imho) cultural development. If Japanese folklore was strong before the Tokugawa shogunate, then the 200+ years that followed acted as a fermenting chamber.

It certainly wasn't perfect, especially if you weren't part of the samurai caste; the warriors of generations old became more of a symbolic power, and in many cases they became bureaucrats and lawmakers, with only the younger samurai becoming retainers to their feudal lords. Your quality of life was basically dictated by what profession you were born into (which still applies to a degree in modern society everywhere, but back then it was a lot more absolute). 

There was still a lot of violence and honor killings, but compared with the long, tumultuous period of civil war before, things were a lot more peaceful, and cultural ceremonies and celebrations flourished, along with the creation of dozens of art forms, from bushido(the way of the warrior/samurai code), to ukiyo-e woodblock printing, to kabuki.

In many ways it was tantamount to the taming of the American frontier and the Old West, just with added sophistication inherent in a civilization with a few thousand years of development behind it. 

And all that, from pretty much a bluff.

It makes for great film settings too, which is why even if you're not all that big on Japanese history, I recommend samurai films by the likes of Akira Kurosawa([Yojimbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_1iT_GmHTE)), and Takashi Miike([13 Assassins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLtlahx8zek)). 

If you're not opposed to anime, [Samurai Champloo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F87LlJxgZTk) is a really good series that uses the setting of Edo Japan really well. It plays it a bit fast and loose with anachronism(it's got a lot of hip hop infused humor and modern-styled dialogue), but trust me it's worth a look on Netflix.

**TL;DR** Tokugawa/Edo era Japan be hella dope, yo. I seriously can't shut up about it. As a result I am waylaid with crippling loneliness.

Edit: originally said 'cannot be understated' fixed now. I remember the name Tokugawa from the CIV games, could be a different one tough. Tokugawa is the family name, Ieyasu was his personal name. 

The Tokugawa were a pretty long dynasty, I think Maybe I missed it, but I'm partial to GEN H. Norman Schwarzkopf deception of the Iraqi military during Operation Desert Storm. Essentially, the U.S. Intelligence Community had reason to believe top Iraqi leadership watched CNN and took it as gospel. The U.S. Set up a large amphibious landing demonstration which they let he press attend.  Iraqi leadership saw this as CNN presented. They understood this as a rehearsal for the the Coalition's plan. To cement the thought process, the U.S. dropped leaflets depicting death from the sea. Saddam then reorganized his troops along the coast for the "inevitable" attack. This allowed for the "left hook," from Saudi Arabia, causing the destruction of the third biggest military in the world in a matter of days.
 Also, Iraqi Freedom played off of Desert Storm in that people thought they would do the same kind of attack in 2003. Instead, the US opted for a blitzkrieg-like plan. Hitler was pretty much bluffing when he took Poland. He was banking on the allies continued appeasement. Germany had fewer tanks and soldiers than France and the blitz being so successful was never seen a forgone conclusion.  Yeah and French soldiers fought damn well against the German invasion and could have won. Alas they were completely let down by some really stupid generals and politicians. So, basically Hitler was banking on the Allies fucking up one way or another. It's still surprising to me that it took until November 1942 before the tide really started turning (Operation Uranus during the battle of Stalingrad, also known as 'that moment Hitler pulled a Napoleon by fighting the Russians in the winter'). Hitler was, if you read the literature, a rather incompetent tactician who did not listen to his advisors at crucial moments. 

EDIT: As I am aware, Hitler did not BEGIN the Battle for Stalingrad during this period. He merely CONTINUED doing so. To the person that PM'ed me something unfriendly about the poor wording: if I said what I think of you I'd probably break a couple of subreddit rules.  Which is why time travelers don't kill him, the Reich would've simply ended up with a less charismatic but wholly more effective leader who would've actually taken over the world. Twist, who was the guy the time travelers actually killed who was replaced by Hitler? Before the time travelers got to it WWI was a small border squabble in the Balkans. It got a bit out of hand. 1775, just outside Boston.

Washington takes high ground known and Dorchester Heights and fortifies it. Benedict Arnold had just captured the Fort Ticonderoga and its large supply of cannons. Over horrible terrain, the continental army was able to get these cannons to Washington.

Unfortunately, Washington had neither the powder nor the shot to actually do much with his cannons. It didn't matter; the British commander of Boston didn't want to risk losing his ships to the cannons, and didn't want a repeat of Bunker Hill. So he retreated. Evacuation Day. State holiday so all state employees in Suffolk County get the day off. It also happens to be St. Patrick's Day. Evacuation day was really just made a holiday by Irish politicians in Boston so that everyone can get sloshed and celebrate St. Patty's Day. Not even joking. It was signed in green ink. They weren't even trying to hide it.

My favorite lie is Ultra. 

It's not really just one lie. It's a campaign of lies, probably more widespread and deep-routed than any in history, all leading to one collossal lie: Hiding the fact that the Allies broke the Enigma cipher. And, later, the Japanese "Purple" cipher, and the German Lorenz cipher, and the Italian C-38 cypher. 

Basically, the Allies had blown every code the Axis used out of the water, thanks to the work of the Polish Cipher Bureau, and the Bletchley Park mathematicians including Alan Turing, and the American Signal Intelligence Service. 

The collective intelligence from all these broken codes was called Ultra.

But what do you do when your code gets broken? You make a new, harder one. The allies couldn't let that happen, they couldn't let the axis know that their codes were broken. So how do you use data from a broken code without revealing that the code is broken? You lie. 

If they wanted to take out an Axis supply ship after finding it through Ultra, they didn't just do that. They had a spy plane fly over where they *knew* the ship would be, *then* they sunk it. So the crew are all like "oh shit we got spotted." They also had to hide the broken codes from their own soldiers, lest they be revealed under careless talk. So they sent out other spy planes knowing nothing would be found, so crews wouldn't wonder how mission found an enemy every time. 

They would *never* attack until they had a "cover story". Men undoubtedly died, by attacks the government knew were coming, because they would not compromise Ultra. 

One of the few times they were forced to sink ships immediately, they covered it by sending a message in a code they knew the Germans had broken, to a spy in Naples, congratulating him of his success. The spy didn't exist, but the Germans intercepted the message and assumed everything was still good with Enigma. 

The best part is, they didn't even reveal Ultra after the war. They saw to it that the Enigma machines were sold to potential enemies in the Third World, who continued to use the broken codes for years. Ultra wasn't revealed in its full extent until 1974, 29 years after the war. Never has a secret of such massive importance been so well kept for so long.

You could also point out the Strategic Defense Initiative. It was a supposed plan to design lasers that could shoot down nuclear missiles from space. It was a very preposterous plan, but that was the point. 

The US intended it as a bluff to make the Soviets want to accomplish the technology before the US did. In effect, the Soviet Union wasted a lot of time and resources which only quickened their collapse. The ghost army used by the Us army in WWII.


Basically they used inflatable tanks, sound trucks and fake radio transmissions to stage more than 20 battlefield deceptions, often operating very close to the front lines.


They used "inflatable tanks, cannons, jeeps, trucks, and airplanes that the men would inflate with air compressors, and then camouflage imperfectly so that enemy air reconnaissance could see them. They could create dummy airfields, troop bivouacs (complete with fake laundry hanging out on clotheslines), motor pools, artillery batteries, and tank formations in a few hours. Many of the men in this unit were artists, recruited from New York and Philadelphia art schools." Bullshit artists of the greatest calibre. The Avant Guard There was also an elaborate network of double agents that really enabled the entire ruse.

One double agent, Joan Pujol Garcia, was so effective he won both the German Iron Cross and Order of the British Empire.  Garcia, or GARBO, managed his fake operation so effectively that the Germans stopped trying to send new agents to Britain. And he was very helpful in finding and turning the few genuine German agents in Britain, so that by the end of the war it was discovered that every single German agent in Britain had been turned or committed suicide.

One of his reports warned of a convoy setting out to support the Operation Torch landings, timed to arrive too late to be a useful warning but postmarked some time before the landings. The Germans replied "we are sorry they arrived too late but your last reports were magnificent".

Another time he reported that his fake Liverpool agent had fallen ill so that he would a good reason to not report a major fleet movement from that port. He later arranged an obituary in the papers for him and persuaded the Germans to pay a pension to his fictional widow!

He and his handlers developed, prior to the Normandy landings, a fictitious order of battle showing most of the real elements of the British and US Armies in Britain, but also a wholly false First US Army Group of about 150,000 men.

He was to radio some details of the landing at Normandy on the night, but too late for them to be useful. At 3 am he was given the go ahead to transmit, and couldn't reach a German operator until 8 am.

So he added even more (now useless) details to his message and berated his contacts "I cannot accept excuses or negligence. Were it not for my ideals I would abandon the work".

The Germans were so convinced by his reports (backed up by the aerial reconnaissance of dummy tanks and radio traffic etc) about FUSAG that they kept *two* armoured divisions and *nineteen* infantry divisions in reserve at Pas de Calais, waiting for the second invasion, for *two months*.

And by the end of the war they'd paid him $340,000. That's almost $5m today.

Joan Pujul Garcia was, by far, the greatest and most noble bullshitter who has ever lived. Amazing. He played it so well he would be okay no matter who won. Was he the chicken farmer from Portugal or somewhere that created a German spy network to convince the allies to hire him as a spy? He wanted to spy for the Allies but they weren't interested so he pretended he was a German spy who fed the Germans a lot of bullshit information. This made the Allies interested and he worked for the UK in creating an entirely fictional spy network and fed the Germans wrong information the entire war. They never suspected he was a fake so he received the Iron Cross.

[Here's the wiki.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Pujol_Garcia) My grandfather was a part of this. Not one of the artists, but one of the soldiers protecting them. They were required to keep it secret until fairly recently, and they all did... He's super proud about that part. My grandfather too! He said they had sticks to keep the tank barrels from drooping, and a few popped during a German flyover. It happens to everyone and its not a big deal -Andre.

-Oh god, I'm down to 60, 40, get the stick. Came here looking for this. Some podcast (I think 99% Invisible?) did a piece on them recently. 

"Whatever you do, don't let anyone see you carrying a tank across the road." Then again, watching a soldier carry a tank across the road could be pretty intimidating. A super-soldier bluff would be fantastic.  "Sir, ve have located Captain America!" That guy just flipped a tank!

Great podcast about all types of design. I seem to recall hearing about the Germans trying something similar, but the Allies were wise to it. They let the whole thing get set up, then dropped a wooden bomb on it. and Patton. don't forget Patton. he was put in command of this inexistent army corps with much pomp and ceremony and went to Britain and did fuck-all for months while a few people were tasked with producing fake paperwork, phone calls and radio messages supposed to originate from his HQ The British supposedly chose Patton over any other general because the Germans idolized Patton and *of course* the only person capable of commanding such a large army *had to be* Patton! One particular time in the Great Siege of Malta around 4000 Ottomans were going to charge our old poorly fortified city of Mdina. All the people living in Mdina at the time around 200 went up on the walls with around 40 knights and other mercenaries and formed a line. They got with them a statue if St Mary and started praying. The Ottomans got scared when they saw a file of people on the walls as they thought the city was heavily fortified. They could not see that half of those people were peasents, children and women because of the sun shining on the wall from the back, so they retreated.
Maltese people considered the event a miracle by St Mary because if the Ottomans didnt retreat they would all have been killed.

Its an unknowning bluff. But was one vital turning points amongst many other ones in the victory against the Ottomans and the halting of their invasion across the Mediterranean in 1560s Dan Bilzerian telling everyone he's a pro poker player. Ali Dia, a modestly talented African soccer player, somehow convinced a Premier League club, Southampton, into believing he was one of the continent's best players. They signed him and he got to play in one match before it became clear they'd been hoaxed. (Though he did almost score a goal!) The way he convinced Southampton was simple, he pretended to be George Weah's (Ballon d'Or winner and MORE) Cousin. IIRC he pretended to be Weah over the phone and Southampton signed him after the supposed Weah had told them his cousin was as good as him I'd like to know more about him actually. I just don't buy it that he has such a seemingly spontaneously crazy life. I find it far more believable that he is making a career out of just 'appearing' that way.   He has really really rich parents, amd made about 50 million playing against rich guys, not poker pros. His dad was involved in a massive Wall Street fraud. After he was put away Dan, his son, inherited his illegitimate fortune and it's widely believed he is distributing his fathers money through his poker games internationally to transfer large amounts of money under the table. Apparently the international laws on high stakes poker are very lax and large sums of money can be transferred between individuals relatively hassle free. Anyone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, I took a minimal glance into the bit of history posted online and I would be lying if that white AMG 6x6 didn't have me a little jealous. Oh he's a pro player. He don't have any other job. He's just a really, really, really bad pro poker player. Victor Lustig. He bluffed his way into selling the Eiffel Tower....*twice*.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Lustig What a funny guy.  The best part is that when the mark looked like they weren't going to go for it, he asked the guy for a bribe to ensure that he'd get it.  He got a guy to bribe him for the right to buy the Eiffel Tower from him. I remember hearing a story once in history class, about a medieval ruler whose castle was under siege. The siege had been going on for a long time, and they were just about out of food and would have had to surrender. They had one cow left alive, and they decided to do the one thing that may break the siege.

They catapulted the cow over the wall.

Then, they stood on the top of the wall yelling, "We have so much food, we can throw cows over the walls!". The enemy was so demoralized that they left, and that's how that castle survived the siege. "Fetchez la vache..." Basically Monty Python. Did anyone mention Vlad Dracula? Despite only having a relatively small army, by using psychological warfare, he was able to fend off or avoid war with the ottoman empire. 

Edit: I say psychological warfare because even though he did defeat some enemies, he bluffed the ottoman empire by lining a field with spiked enemies, making it appear that vlad was more dangerous then he actually was, when in fact he was greatly outnumbered and if the ottomans weren't so thrown off by the display, they probably would have wiped vlad and his people off.  "Spearing people from the anus to the mouth and hanging them like grisly yard ornaments" is *pretty good* psychological warfare.

"I'm gonna murder some people" isn't really a bluff when you've got dead guys all over the place. I think this needs to be exlpained to anyone that does not know about Vlad in the impaler Exactly, the Impaler. So imagine the morale of Ottoman troops when they enter a burnt down city with streets full of their brethren impaled on a stake on the streets every few steps.
But that doesn't count as a bluff I think. He probably made them think that he was more powerful than he actually was, which is a bluff. do you mean to tell me he didn't strike a deal with a demon and made himself an invincible vampire? 

Why would Hollywood lie to me like that? There's a story about the ancient chinese strategist Zhuge Liang who found himself in a castle with only a token force, surrounded on all sides by an overwhelmingly larger force being led by his rival, Sima Yi.


Both Sima Yi and Zhuge Liang were god-tier level tacticians, and had been pretty much making each other's lives misery for some time. Zhuge Liang was just a little bit *more* god-tier though, and Sima Yi was terrified of him. So terrified that he went into every encounter with Zhuge Liang expecting to stumble into traps within traps and Admiral Akbar wasn't around yet to warn him about them.


He was so terrified of Zhuge Liang that, when Zhuge Liang actually *died* in the middle of a battle, causing his forces to withdraw, Sima Yi called off a pursuit (that would have been a massacre) because he was worried that Zhuge Liang wasn't really dead, and he was being drawn into yet *another* trap.


Anyway, back to this fortress...


So Zhuge Liang knows that, if Sima Yi attacks, it's probably all over. So when Sima Yi arrives, he found the castle gates wide open and not a soul in sight; nobody except Zhuge Liang himself, sitting on the castle walls and playing an ancient Chinese string instrument (the name of which escapes me) in full sight of the approaching army.


Sima Yi was so taken aback by this bizarre arrangement that he reasoned this must be an attempt to distract him. And after staring at Zhuge Liang in this seemingly empty fortress, the gates wide open to invite him in, and no sign of *anything* resembling an ambush in the surrounding wilderness....



Sima Yi noped right of there and went home because he just couldn't believe it would be *that* simple.



Now **that** is a pretty badass bluff. It was a town not a castle I believe..

Zhuge Liang ordered all the gates to be opened and instructed soldiers disguised as civilians to sweep the roads while he sat on the viewing platform above the gates with two boys flanking him. He put on a calm and composed image by playing his guqin. When the Wei army led by Sima Yi arrived, Sima was surprised by the scene before him and he ordered a retreat after suspecting that there was an ambush inside the city. Zhuge Liang later explained that his strategy was a risky one. It worked because Zhuge Liang had a reputation for being a careful military tactician who hardly took risks, so Sima Yi came to the conclusion that there was an ambush upon seeing Zhuge's relaxed composure. He had a tight table image, and three bet all in before the flop.  &gt;Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.

EDIT: To be specific, the end of the song "The art of war" For those interested, look up the book "Romance of Three Kingdoms" it is epic.

Edit: [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms) is the Wikipedia article about it. And [this TV series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms_\(TV_series\)) is pretty good (Now time to find the subtitle). 

Edit2: If someone knows which English translation is better please let people know! or you can play any of the dozens of Dynasty Warrior games. Yeah zhuge liang has some bad-ass triangle moves big fan. ...where the strategy is tossed out in favor of one man army style shenanigans! they *talk* about the crazy strategies. and if you're bored, you can even enact them. or you can just go assassinate the entire army by yourself. your choice. And then you meet Lu Bu and the game becomes hard mode. Fuck that guy. I forget what DW i was playing but would not accept not killing him. I played that level hundreds of times (Hard difficulty). Eventually I killed him! (and I think that was when I unlocked him if I am not mistaken)

Edit: Fuck you Howard for stealing that game! DW4 - The Battle for Hu Lou Gate...kill him and you get the Red Hare Harness - the fastest horse in the game.

https://youtu.be/tSIQvswk4sU If bluffing will result in victory, then you must bluff! Zhuge Liang said that, and I think he knows a little more about deception than you do, pal, *BECAUSE HE INVENTED IT!* SUN TZU SAID THAT All I got when I read Art of War was that using prostitutes to deceive the enemy is extremely effective I learned that from Assassin's Creed. Wasn't that the plot of *Mulan*? No, the plot of Mulan was the general being confused about having sexual feelings for a male soldier, and then being like oh that makes sense when she revealed her true sex

And then they went and had sex crouching tiger hidden dragon style in the Great Wall while mulan was like "fuck me like a dirty Hun!"

IIRC of course And then he perfected it, so no living man could best him at the poker table! ELton John being married and pretending he was straight. I often wonder how many people are in their 40's, 50's and 60's married with kids but have been gay all along and are planning on taking the secret to the grave with them  My Dad, I guess he's not taking it to the grave with him because I know. But I know I'm not the one looking at gay porn on the home computer, and the fact my parents haven't slept in the same bed since I was 8 also leads me to connect the dots and him being gay. So as much as it sucks with all the shit he's been through, I'm happy he did so I can be alive. Thanks Dad, love you. EDIT: Words What if it's your mom watching the gay porn? Certainly not the biggest in history, or the biggest in anything, for that matter, but an interesting bit of trivia and history that most people don't know... 

Newburgh, Indiana, a little town right on the Ohio River in southwestern Indiana, was the ~~only~~ first town north of the Mason-Dixon line to be captured by the Confederates during the Civil War. The small group of raiding Confederate soldiers crossed the river from Kentucky and carried stove pipes to look like cannons...and it worked. They occupied the town for a couple hours. If I remember correctly (it's been years since I read the details), no shots were fired, no loss of life, but I believe they did take some supplies. Someone sold the Eiffel Tower once I think he sold it *twice*, incredibly.
 [Source](http://uselessinformation.org/lustig/index.html) Genghis Khan did a good bluff. 

Under the siege of a Chinese fortress he announced that he would end his siege in exchange for a gift of one thousand cats and ten thousand swallows. The fortress commander gratefully complied. After the animals arrived in the Mongol camp, Genghis Khan ordered his men to tie a small cotton-wool tuft to the tail of each creature then set the tuft afire. When the panicked and frightened animals were turned loose, they made directly for their nests and lairs and igniting hundreds of small fires. While the defenders were preoccupied with putting out fires, Genghis Khan's warriors stormed the city in conquest. During his invasion of Manchuria, he once had every member of his horde leave a siege and leave half of their crap behind. When the Manchurians left the city to loot the supplies, the entire horde returned and murdered them all. The US built [bat bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_bomb) during WWII with the same idea:

Drop a bomb that has thousands of bats in it right at dawn over a city.  The bats will seek refuge from the growing light by climbing into little nooks and crannies in the rafters of buildings.  Then, a timed incendiary charge taped to their chest goes off, starting a fire.

IIRC, they never used it in battle, but in one test, they ended up inadvertently burning down an entire airfield when the bats went off-course (not in the linked article, but in another book I read). Greek economy. They took all of their debt, and they hid it inside a big wooden horse. I would've put in a giant wooden rabbit. Valve's guy is taking care of the economy. Volvo Plz "The plan to fix the economy is simple: Step one, restructure the debt, step two, work with Germany, step three is rumored to be under development..." User Turborg referred to the photoreconnaissance dummy armies of WW2 - one of two things I came here to mention.

The other is the Pas-de-Calais invasion. Allied forces took advantage of the temporary disgrace of General George S.Patton after an incident in his camp, to send him on observation missions and tours that were deliberately not secret enough

German intelligence believed - as was intended - that a genuinely talented General would not be excluded from the invasion plans, and as such the Normandy landings were a distraction.  

They concentrated their forces way north of the invasion that was in progress, awaiting a 2nd landing, by a ghost army that would never come.

This probably saved tens of thousands of lives on both sides, and equal numbers of French civilians, by reducing the scale of the initial conflicts My grandma used to work for IBM as a programmer. She told me this story once:

There was a project comissioned to them by the core of engineers to write a program that would check the water levels, flow rate, and similar pieces of information from all of the damns on the Columbia river. The best programmer my grandma knew was the lead on the project and when it was finished the core of engineers said it was no good, that the program ran too fast and there was no way the data could be accurate. So my grandma said that this programmer just put a bunch of for loops in the code to make it run quite a bit slower. Then gave it back and the core of engineers said it was perfect. Every few years they would be asked to revise the code to see if they could make it faster and this guy would just reduce the number of iterations on each loop.  Both instances of "Come and Take It."

The first happened during the American Revolutionary War, as the British Colonel Fuser laid siege to Fort Morris outside the abandoned town of Sunbury in Georgia. The American forces were outnumbered at least four to one, and Col. Fuser demanded that the Americans surrender the fort. Despite the fort being in bad repair, and their forces being grossly outnumbered, the American Colonel John McIntosh refused, saying: "As to surrendering the fort, receive this laconic reply: COME AND TAKE IT!" The British, believing that Col. McIntosh *had* to have reinforcements nearby to reply in such a manner, retreated.

The second happened during the Texas Revolutionary War. The small colony of Gonzalez in Bexar (present day San Antonio, roughly) had been granted a cannon by the Mexican government in order to defend the colony. When revolutionary sentiment began to rise, the Mexican government sent Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea to seize the cannon. The Texans flew a [flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Texas_Flag_Come_and_Take_It.svg/900px-Texas_Flag_Come_and_Take_It.svg.png) above the cannon's location which referenced the now-famous revolutionary phrase "COME AND TAKE IT." Col. Ugartecha's efforts to take the cannon by force were unsuccessful, and the Battle of Gonzalez (more of a skirmish) was counted as the first real conflict of the Texas Revolution. I don't know if anyone has mentioned it yet. During the War of 1812 at the Seige of Detroit.
To deceive the Americans into believing there were more British troops than there actually were, Brock's force carried out several bluffs. At the suggestion of Major Thomas Evans, the Brigade Major at Fort George, Brock gave his militia the cast-off uniforms of the 41st Regiment to make Hull believe most of the British force were regulars. The troops were told to light individual fires instead of one fire per unit, thereby creating the illusion of a much larger army. They marched to take up positions in plain sight of the Americans then quickly ducked behind entrenchments, and marched back out of sight to repeat the manoeuvre. The same trick was carried out during meals, where the line would dump their beans into a hidden pot, then return out of view to rejoin the end of the queue.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Detroit  While certainly not the BIGGEST bluff in history the Glomar explorer and it supposed search for manganese has to be in the top ten.  Mostly from a planning and execution perspective.

[glomar explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSF_Explorer) Putting the iocane powder into *both* glasses. Never bet against a Sicilian when death is on the line!!! Nathan Mayer Rothschild pretty much taking control of London after the battle of Waterloo. There is speculation as to whether or not it's true, but I believe it is. He had the knowledge of the outcome of the battle a full day before government messengers. He began to dump stocks signaling that the French had won the battle, and in a panic other traders began to do the same. Actually, the British won the battle. The resulting Stock Market crash let Rothschild and his accomplices buy up the London Stock Market essentially for nothing and take over the Bank of England through doing so. 
Edit: He also lent money to both armies. Goes to show why some people want war. War = profit.  Ever heard the old saying that carrots improve your vision?

Well, you can thank the con-artists known as the Brits for that one too. During World War II, the British Air Force managed to develop radar before the Luftwaffe did. As a result, during the Battle of Britain, the British fighters always seemed to know where the Germans were coming from, especially during the night. And, being the cheeky cunts that the are, in an effort to turn the Luftwaffe's attention away from the technology at work, the British Air Force started a propaganda campaign, saying they fed their pilots loads of carrots to improve their vision. They effectively attributed the pilots' prowess in intercepting raids to carrots, not radar.

Well, needless to say, the saying stuck, and became a part of every grandmother's intuition. D-Day.

The allies had Hitler so convinced that it wasn't going to happen that he apparently thought he was getting false information when told, and proceeded to go back to sleep. Not entirely true. Hitler knew a invasion was coming (it was impossible to hide the massive invasion force gathering in Britain), but they tricked the Germans to believing the invasion would land a other place than it did. And thus the Germans focused their defensive resources other places than Normandy.

The whole thing was a massive counter-intelligence operations, with lots of double spies and fake spies, fake armies made up by inflatable tanks, planes etc, and they even had Patton placed in charge on one of these fake armies to give it more credibility.

And when the invasion started Hitler was still sleeping, but no one dared to wake him up and tell him since they where so scared of him and he hated being woken up.

Edit: While we are on the subject I will recommend a good documentary called the [Ghost Army](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g1H3GJqBkc). Its a rather unknown story about a small group of artist, hi-fi guys etc who was deployed after D-day that very successfully created fake armies to fool the Germans. They used inflatable tanks, artillery etc and large sound systems to make it seem like they where a big army near the German lines when in fact they where just a small group of guys. By doing so they was able to distract the Germans and/or trick them to move their forces around making it easier for the real allied army to attack the them.  I saw on QI that they actually had a dead soldier dressed in a higher ranked uniform with a briefcase full of false plans handcuffed to his wrist. Then they dropped him off to be found by the German army.  This was Operation Mincemeat and pertains to the invasion of Sicily as opposed to france still an amazing deception I recommend the book By Ben Macintyre or the doc based on the book. 

Lots of deceptions leading up to D-Day though such as the Double cross system  British counter-intelligence was extremely convincing, though. They had inflatable fake tanks, dummies etc. That fooled recon aerial photography. If it weren't for the Brits, the war would have turned out much differently. British counter-intelligence was near perfect - they identified, turned and controlled every single German spy in England, and Ultra was able to read "secure" German communications to confirm that their operations were having the desired effect.

The inflatable fake tanks was part of Operation Fortitude in which they create two fake armies to make it look like Normandy wasn't the objective, but really Norway and Pas de Calais. It was effective in that D-Day was seen as a diversionary attack and the German response was limited as they waiting for an attack that never came to Norway and Pas de Calais.

More so than this was the fact that British counter-intelligence controlled every single German agent - even without the physical deception they could have created the deception just by controlling what information the agents sent back to Germany.

There was so many incredible false plans and units created in WWII that worked incredibly well, often working less because of fake bases and equipment, and more by just telling the enemy what they feared most. The [First United States Army Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_United_States_Army_Group) was a fictional Allied Army Group which the Germans believed existed mostly due to it having Patton as a leader.

&gt;The deception worked so well that significant German forces remained in the Pas de Calais region for seven weeks after the real invasion at Normandy to defend against what they thought would be the true invasion force.

&gt;to preserve the credibility of the Double Cross network's agents in spite of the totally false information they had persuaded the Germans to believe, the Germans were persuaded that FUSAG had been real, but had been disbanded and attached to the forces at Normandy because the Normandy "diversion" had been so successful that the Calais landing had become unnecessary.

Hilarious.

Edit: This was kept secret for over 40 years - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Army

What these guys did was incredible - they would hide entire factory complexes to prevent against possible bombing attacks. [Imre Nagy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imre_Nagy)

He was a Hungarian communist who held several high offices, including the highest in Hungary, from 1946-1955, during which many political "undesirables" were arrested, tortured, and executed or sent to Gulags. But when the people demanded change in 1956 they chose him as their leader. When they did he promised elections, an end to the one party system, and democracy. He freed thousands of political prisoners and declared Hungary's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, asking that the U.N. assist them against Soviet aggression.

Days later Russian tanks rolled into Budapest, and Nagy was arrested, tried in secret, and executed. Alfred Nobel. He invented dynamite, and when newspaper mistook his brother's death for his own, they had a headline saying "The Merchant of Death is Dead." He was horrified at what his legacy would be, so he took all of his money and used it to create awards celebrating achievements in science and peace. Another example of bullshit media, even back then. Dynamite is far from just a tool of death. 

He was a great guy.  He was a great guy. It was just that many people then considered him a merchant of death because dynamite was used as a weapon. He is more or less falsely attributed to the creation of certain weapons. He had good intentions.

Edit: My top comment so far thanks guys! Someone has to stick up for the Grinch! [Relevant.]( https://youtu.be/BGpCr5pi3nE) Paarthurnax Paarthurnax was a villain? His big quote is something along the lines of "is it better to be born good, or to overcome evil through great effort?". Also he used to be Alduins General.

Edit: The actual quote is "What is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?" Paarthurnax He basically tells you dragons are naturally evil, doesn't he? I guess it's subjective. 

What we do to herds of animals is pretty similar to what the dragons tried to do. Take rabbits as an example. They're a pest so we shoot them, poison them, destroy their homes, let our dogs kill them and other stuff. If anything/anyone did that to us we'd consider them evil. To a canary a cat is a monster. Shut up Dr Wu.  Paarthurnax was there during they heyday of dragons, man. He did some pretty evil stuff during that time, at least from the perspective of men. It wasn't until Alduin claimed godhood that he turned on him, and taught humans how to use the Thu'um.

Pretty much the villain-to-good guy trope in a nutshell. One small change. Iirc Paarthurnax didn't switch sides because Alduin had gone crazy, he switched sides because Akatosh ordered him to train humans how to use the Thu'um. The Nords record that it was Kyne who ordered it, but I suppose the legend is basically the same. All I know is he switched sides. When we have to agree to disagree because a legend in Skyrim is so convoluted and has been retold countless times *in the game*.
How far we have come... Yeah, that's why the Blades want you to kill him. Fuck the Blades imo. They dont really do shit for you besides show up and try to hijack your destiny. 

I forgave Paarthurnax every time. Same. Probably have 5 different characters I've played through to some extent or another and I've never once killed him. Seriously

Fucking Delphine said The Blades was there to serve/help Dragonborn. And then they told you to kill Paarthurnax because hurr dragunz. Fuck off, he's way more helpful than you and you ended up ordering the Dragonborn, whom you supposed to serve

This pisses the fuck out of me everytime The Blades were a lot cooler in Oblivion Those weren't Blades asking you to kill Paathurnax, they were something else entirely. Warriors, yes, but Blades only in name. They were nothing like the Blades of old. My one regret in all my play throughs was the one time I decided to kill him.  I felt so guilty afterwards. Download the Paarthurnax Dilemma from the Workshop or Nexus, it adjusts the quest by a hair so you can convince the Blades to leave him be. Wreck-it-ralph!

It's beautiful.

Funny little story: "Music Man" was just going to have a normal singing voice, but Brad Pitt was like "No, it has to be terrible!" He kept wanting to to re-do the little song he sings because he didn't think it was bad enough yet. "Granted you have talent!" That movie is worth watching just for the "presentation" scene. That scene had me in tears

"Oh yeah, then what makes a supervillain?!"

" PRESENTATION"

And boom, he is right https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQJJjcrwXQE

"Oh you're a villain alright, just not a SUPER one"

"Oh yeah? What's the difference?"

"***PRESENTATION!!!***" "... And you need to wake up!"

And then the guitar comes in, and my ears orgasm Music in that scene was absolutely perfect.  I loved that. The whole movie was pretty good IMO. Definitely one of the better Dreamworks movies.  Dreamworks has been kicking ass lately. How To Train Your Dragon, Kung Fu Panda, and Megamind are all pretty great. HTTYD is, IMO, fucking top notch, especially the second one (the first was great, the second was *amazing*). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQJJjcrwXQE Agreed. Seriously, one of the best 'villain' lines ever said. It's a shame it came out at the same time as Despicable Me because IMO I thought it was much better. The T-Rex from Jurassic Park.

* Jessie and James attempt (albeit in futility) to free Zapdos from captivity using Arbok and Weezing.


* The trio construct a MacGyver-style fanboat from the wreckage of a helicopter and help Ash retrieve the Ice Crystal, risking their lives in the process.


* On the return trip from Articunos island, they throw themselves from Lugias wings, possibly sacrificing their lives to allow Ash to return the crystals.

"Came right out of his closet"

Hahaha First time I've ever seen an adult joke in pokemon Pokemon The Movie: 2000 has a multiple jokes similar to the one in that video. That movies is insanely watchable if only for Team Rocket. Also they are literally the best employees you could ask for. They are constantly thinking of ways of pleasing their boss, and are willing to be blown up countless times for him. Except no amount of loyalty and eagerness can overcome constant, utter failure. They have good intentions and want to please the boss, but they almost never, ever succeed and cost Giovanni tens of millions. Darth Vader Anakin/Vader is the hero indeed.

His fall to the dark side taught Yoda a lesson, one he would only fully understand in exile. There he understood that the Jedi had lost their way. 

When Yoda taught Luke to use the force, he taught him to use emotion, something the old Jedi order would never consider.

Then Vader kills Obi-wan. Obi-wan knew what would happen and he told Vader. Anakin or Vader may not have known what Obi-wan meant exactly, but he knew he wasn't telling a lie when he said he would become more powerful. So Anakin did what he had been doing and allowed Lord Vader to take over, the man who wanted revenge for the death of his wife. 

In the killing of Obi-wan, he sealed the fate of the deathstar and promised his son a mentor to watch over him, even if he had no idea he had done so. At the very least, Anakin knew deep down that he was helping the Jedi when he killed Obi-wan.

Then he confronts Luke at the finish. He is the dark side of the force genuinely and flawlessly. He is the villain of villains, more so than Sidious.

He is defeated. Vader cannot stand up to Luke. The light side is gone and that is what Vader had come to prey on. He ended it with Obi-wan (partially) and facing Luke was a new enemy he had never known. It was one Vader could not hate.

Anakin could no longer hide behind Vader. He could no longer be the villain without a foe, plus, Luke was his kid. So he made his return. 

Anakin killed Vader when he killed Sidious. He brought balance to the light with his downfall via Yoda, Obi-wan, and Luke. He brought balance to the dark with Vader. He pushed both sides of the force to their extremes with his actions.

"Killing"/himself was the final act. He made sure that both Vader and Anakin were dead. One was dark and one was light, but bringing balance to the force does not mean being in balance with the force. 

Anakin/Vader is the tragic hero of the two trilogies. Period.

EDIT: alot of people are saying I'm giving Lucas too much credit. I'm going to disagree (unpopular, I know).

Lucas was really good at story telling in that he created a really good story. I just think he failed horribly at the " telling" part. Maybe this is a classic example of over thinking something (see South Park episode regarding book analysis), but I think George just struggled to convey what he pictured in his mind.


 Something that struck me this last time I watched ROTJ, at the end when Luke is with the Emperor and Vader, the Emperor is tempting Luke. He tells Luke that he can feel the anger in him and tells him to grab his saber and strike him down. Finally Luke is overcome and attempts it, only to be stopped by Vader.

I'd always thought Vader was protecting the emperor. Instead, I think Vader was protecting Luke from falling to the dark side. Like Anakin when he killed the Tuskin Raiders, Vader knew where Luke was emotionally at that moment watching his friends under attack. Vader had already decided which side he was on (maybe) or was having quite the internal struggle. Although Vader battles Luke after this moment, I think Vader was still obviously struggling.

tl;dr Vader protecting the emperor was really Vader protecting Luke.

 I agree. It was the very moment where anakin begins his return from Vader and not a moment too soon, else I can only imagine what kind of a sith Lord Luke would have been.

It's definitely about balance and that's not an easy thing to maintain. Luke was only able to do it with support, but I think that's the point.  What made Anakin unqiue (among other things) was that he had walked both sides of the force but never turned his back entirely on either side. That's why he was the one who was able learn from both sides and make the choices required. 

In a way, he's a bit like Mace Windu, ironically. That scene where Anakin strikes down Windu represents everything that was wrong with the Jedi.

Windu was famous in the order for using emotion while in combat. His doom was using it outside of combat, a manipulation of Sidious' doing during their fight. It clouded him and he was exactly right that Sidious was too dangerous to live, so much so that in that very moment Sidious had already beaten Windu and blinded him to the emotions of Anakin. Windu became narrow sighted and tried to do what only Luke would later do. 

The difference here was the hesitation Windu showed. It was the very thing Anakin hated about the Jedi and it was Windu's demise. Damn now I really want to see an alternate storyline where Vader didn't stop him and Luke became a Sith Lord. Read Dark Empire. I'm still holding a little bit of a grudge over the younglings and Genocide though... I mean... A little genocide never hurt anybody Best answer IMO, had such a huge development arc but without a doubt was a her eventually Well...there is a typo that changes everything.  Maybe if we wait long enough even that will be true... and then he becomes "she" and says "hey babe. take a walk on the dark side. " And all the Ewok girls go "yubnub" Yub yubnub yubnub yubnubnub
Yub yubnub yubnub yubnubnub Ani came from a galaxy far far away, hitchhiked his way across the galaxayy. Plucked his eyebrows on the way, burned his face then he was a she. She says "hey son, take a walk on the dark side. Hey lukey, take a walk on the dark side"  I missed the part when vader came out. Caitlyn Vader? Annika Skywalker I mean, they already called him Annie half the time. Annie are you ok? 

Edit: ok people, we all know what the next line to the song is. Stahp.  Luke, I am your mother! And that kids, is how I met my mother  Right until you see his ghost, then he becomes the victim.  Nooooooooooooooooooo! Michael Scott. Now hear me out, he wasn't the villain per se, but he was a sort of antagonist. In the first season he was just kind of a jerk. It was hilarious yes, but all of his workers (except Dwight) hated him. By the time he left everybody loves him, and he matured into a pretty nice guy. I think the same could be said for Dwight. Sure, like Michael he was never the villain per say, but he was generally disliked. But by the final episodes he's grown a lot and finally accepts that Jim is his friend (and vice versa). The truest real life answer is Oskar Schindler. He began WW2 viewing the Jews as free labour to aid his war profiteering. Years later he saved too many lives to count. He did later cheat on his wife, but his good deeds far outweigh that. Artemis Fowl, if you can call him a hero. He saves lots of people at great personal risk, I'd say that's heroic. I LOVE Artemis Fowl. Such a cunning little shyte.
 Pfft, you can hardly call him a villain!

Even as a kid i remember reading those books and wondering how he could every be considered anything other than full on hero.

Its weird, because in the first one he blows up a ship trying to kill Root (and its admittedly pretty badass), but that is exactly the only slightly villainy thing he ever does, ever. His kidnapping is the politest, nicest kidnapping ever. He never kills anyone else, or has Butler kill anyone, he never really inconveniences anyone and all his crimes happen to accidentally benefit the world.

Evil? As long as it has no animal products, sure! Im the vegan of the criminal underworld you see. Ah yes, assassination! I've replaced the kale in his salad with ordinary lettuce and i've given him full fat dressing!

Its this weird situation where a boy who has been raised by a ruthless Irish mob boss who apparently treated Arty like a young business partner rather than a son, also raised him to be this ridiculously environmentally friendly, completely politically correct toothless figure who never harms anyone. When realistically his family's financial outlook, his own personality and his criminal upbringing should have him as the kind of person who'd set fire to Captain Planet for a couple grand.

I was like twelve and a few books in when people were still referring to him as some kind of villain. And i just wanted him to ask these people where he kept hiding the bodies and why no one was mentioning it. 

Its not really a thrilling story about a boy criminal becoming 'good' if his 'evil' lasted only about two paragraphs at the beginning of book one. He is certainly a Hero, his villainous beginnings where just what you get when you scare a little child and take their parents away from them and don't account for the scared little boy being a God-level Genius capable of being more than an unfortunate victim.

He did what he had to do to try and restore the family fortune to fund searches for his father. The guy from Equilibrium, John Preston, he was a cleric and then became the head of the rebellion. That puppy scene still cracks me up when I think about it.

Gets done killing a dozen guys, looks down, bends down out of frame, comes back up with the puppy in his arm and calmly walks away. Spike

Edit: From Buffy. I wouldn't consider CB Spike to count. He was a villain previous to the events of the series. I really like Spike. He is honest when everyone else around him isn't.  You can say the same for Cordelia and Anya. "Tact is just not saying true things."
-Anya That was a Cordy quote.  I think from the episode 'killed by death" The scene in The Body when he brings flowers because Joyce was the only one who was always nice to him.

The feels.

EDIT: I remembered the episode wrong.  This took place in the following episode, "Forever".  The feels are the same though. My favorite scene from the last season. Spike: "You listen to me. [Kneels in front of her] I've been alive a bit longer than you, and dead a lot longer than that. I've seen things you couldn't imagine, and done things I prefer you didn't. I don't exactly have a reputation for being a thinker. I follow my blood, which doesn't exactly rush in the direction of my brain. So I make a lot of mistakes, a lot of wrong bloody calls. A hundred plus years, and there's only one thing I've ever been sure of: you. Hey, look at me. I'm not asking you for anything. When I say, "I love you," it's not because I want you or because I can't have you. It has nothing to do with me. I love what you are, what you do, how you try. I've seen your kindness and your strength. I've seen the best and the worst of you. And I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are. You're a hell of a woman. You're the one, Buffy." Yes!  I love Spike. So much better than Angel because he actually chooses to be a good guy despite being soulless and kicked down at every opportunity. Prince Zuko. "Hello, Zuko here" Telling them I sent an assassin after them! What is wrong with me. I should have tokd them it was Azula, that is so something Azula would do!

(paraphrasing) ***"WHY AM I SO BAD AT BEING GOOOOOOOD!?"*** "Ironically I hired a guy with a similar ability to kill the Avatar myself once. Didn't work..." I loved old Zuko in Korra. Only thing that could have made him better, was if he was voiced by Kevin Conroy (Batman)

Edit: Because his father was Mark Hamill (The Joker) "But I guess you already know me... sort of..." "You know, when I was attacking you...yeah, I guess I should apologize for that..." 10 years down, I'm still having a really hard time believing that part actually happened. It was amazing.  The other side of zuko's personality was truly a sight to behold.  One of the great messages of Avatar is that the the most powerful way to turn a man from evil to good is to love and forgive the man while fighting against his evil. 

Any couldn't fix Zuko by himself, Uncle Iroh did far more. 

Maybe there is something in that for us.  Magneto Robert Downey Jr.  Not RDJ as Iron Man but literally just RDJ Piccolo  I watched the original dragonball before dbz when I got into the franchise earlier this year and I must say it was one of the most gradual yet awesome transitions ever. The process of him training Gohan gained my respect for him more and more every episode.  He is my favorite character easily. Followed by Vegeta and Future Trunks. Good relationship with Gohan is honestly one of the best written relationships in any series. It's very unspoken and dramatic. 

Piccolo constantly saved his life and rushed his own. Gohan preferred Piccolo's attire to his own father's when fighting Cell. It's the little things. 

In GT when Piccolo said his final goodbye to Gohan I nearly cried my fucking eyes out for what is supposed to be a manly show. It's true. Most musicians hate the damn piccolo at first. It's not until one has spent a lot of time playing the flute that they begin to appreciate how underrated the piccolo is. Please melisandre, please melisandre, please melisandre. I never thought all my hopes in that show would ride on that hateful witch, but dammit if I'm not right there with you. I'd rather just ride that hateful witch... Why not both? [deleted] Once ze rockets are up, who cares where zey come down? That's not my department, says Wernher von Braun I aim for the stars...but sometimes I hit London. In German and English he knows how to count down. "Unt I'm learning Chinese", says Werner von Braun.  You too can be a big hero, once you've learn to count backwards to zero. "In German oder English I know how to count down... Und I'm learning Chinese," says Wernher von Braun. "The rocket worked perfectly except for landing on the wrong planet." For the uninformed, Wernher von Braun was a German rocket scientist during WW2 who helped the Nazis develop the V2 and other deadly missiles. He was part of the SS and basically responsible for thousands of deaths during the war. 

In 1945, von Braun was brought to America and later joined NASA, where he and his team not only developed the wildly impressive Saturn rocket series (including the Saturn V that took Apollo missions to the moon), but also was heavily involved in the PR campaign that made space exploration popular enough to merit federal tax dollars to fund the missions. 

His story is fascinating and worth a look in more depth:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun

Edit: a typo Ben Linus He was the first villain I truly liked and hated severely. That daughter scene though... Man, you just reminded my how much I fucking hated Keamy. You were a great number 2 I think you mean Henry Gale FROM MINNIESOTA! Gru from Despicable Me. Magus from Chrono Trigger? Steam. Man was it a pain in the ass back in the day. Vegeta

*edit: I don't even watch DBZ lol Buu too for what it's worth. DBZ had a lot of these.  Vegeta, Piccolo, Android 18, Tien, Yamcha, Buu...

Come to think of it, pretty much every one of the main characters except Krillin and kids of other characters started out as a villain.

EDIT:  Also Mr. Satan was never really a villain. Hell, Goku almost counts as one; he was sent to earth to destroy it by transforming into Oozaru, since even a baby Saiyan transformed could wipe out the planet, and he wouldn't have much choice in the matter in his transformed state. He'd have the mind of an infant, combined with the lack of self-control that comes with the transformation (unless you're trained to use it and not lose control). But he hit his head after falling down a cliff (nice one Grandpa Gohan) and then became incredibly docile. Goku eventually got back at him though...  Too soon... Buu is like a grown up kirby Definitely. The most notable turning point in his character is when he blew himself up in an attempt to kill Buu. What about [his death at the hands of Freiza when he told Goku his life's story?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCD4PDz4JNQ) Or when [he charged to face Cell when Trunks was struck down?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKYCi6SoOsM)

EDIT: It is really hard to beat his [Final Atonement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNSNkNxQuwE) in terms of significance though. "When I was a little boy, he-HE DIDN'T INVITE ME TO HIS BIRTHDAY PARTY!!!" "The cake was delicious!" "You monster, frisbee!" "A true Saiyan... Sprinkles when he tinkles." Piccolo did it first. Magneto - he was right, after all. This to me is one of the greatest strengths of the movies.  The difference is really this though:  Magneto knows the way the world *is*.  Professor X knows what the world *can be*.  That is really the central tension between them.  They both acknowledge that people will do terrible things out of fear.  Professor X knows that people can do great things out of hope. Very well said.  Neither of them will ever give up that core of their beliefs.  However, in the end of DOFP, they both acknowledged that they fought eachother for too long...

"Oh Charles...all those years fighting..." And the interesting thing is, Xavier can see into people's minds; he *knows* how those people want to act. Magneto doesn't have that luxury; he can only see what they are actually doing.

"We judge ourselves by our intentions; we judge others by their behaviors." 

Xavier has the ability to genuinely judge others the way they would judge themselves. jesse pinkman Yeah, character development bitch! Nux from Mad Max: Fury Road  *Witness.* Merle on The Walking Dead (TV Show). "I ain't gonna beg" I'm not sure Merle was so much of a hero as an anti-hero. I would say that he died a hero and his final act was his redemption. Other than that, nothing too heroic about him. Daryl kinda fits that role too. Merle kinda just gives up being the villain  Daryl was always protective of whoever he was with. At first when he was with his brother the only evil thing we ever heard his him supposedly joining Merle on robbing the group before ditching them The Helix King from Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagaan. What about  viral? He became  one of my favorite  characters. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e2CiFbmQEg) was always a favorite of mine from the series.  LordGenome definitely has the most interesting character arc and development among the cast... Jaime Lannister Crowley Shia LeBeouf Running for your life from Shia LaBeouf!  JUST DO IT! He's gone from hero to villain so many times it's like he's on a roller coaster. Sylar from Heroes.

He goes from murdering people and stealing to their abilities to being a good guy after him and Peter Petrelli get trapped in that mental dream for like the equivalent of 5+ years or something. 

Personally though, when that happened I knew that was the death of the show. Sylar was like... the perfect villain.  Right, because up until then the show evidenced no signs of deterioration. Hey, Heroes was the best single season show since Firefly. I feel like he was constantly underutilised. I just wanted him to go full supervillian and *really* let loose. His powers were Magneto levels of crazy, so (like magneto) he never got to you them to his full potential.  Him and Peter both. They showed the future scene where they were fighting and couldn't wait until the show got to that level. Then first season finale "battle" was weak as hell and then they nerfed Peter.   
  
I kept watching, hoping Peter would get back to full strength and we'd finally get the big showdown with Sylar we'd been promised.   Damn, that show had so much wasted potential.
  
 That was my favorite show until that fucking Carnival came around.  Bill Gates

EDIT: 
Thanks to the awesome person that gave me gold! Also, thanks /u/thisisbillgates I couldn't have done it without you! it was just within a span of the last 8 years or so I saw this comment on reddit that went;

"These days Bill Gates is a hero, and now Steve Jobs is an asshole. What a world we live in."

I thought it was pretty funny. 

Bill Gates - when I was growing up - was seen as this selfish computer nerd who was money hungry and a cutthroat business man stifling out competition. 

Basically how the public saw Bill Gates was summed up perfectly on that Simpsons character who was  the tech billionaire  who tries to seduce  Marge. Can't remember his name. When homer gets his CPAP machine for sleep apnea. Idfk.  How has nobody said Zuko yet? It's impossible to not turn a hero when Iroh gives you advice your whole life. Drink some tea nephew. Wow, Uncle, that was some life-changing tea. Try one of these silver sandwiches  *U-Uncle... you just pulled a strip of metal off the ship...* STFU, Zuko, and eat the damn sandwich. On that point, Iroh makes a great contender too.  Started as a fire nation general, attacked and captured Ba Sing Se, later he helps the Avatars group restore balance to the world. wait

there was a siege against ba sing se, but it was never captured until azula took it over from the inside. 

in fact, in the penultimate episode, iroh says that he knew his destiny was to take ba sing se, but he never knew he would be taking it (back?) from the fire nation.  Right. But he pretty much *did* conquer Ba Sing Se way back when. It was only the death of Lu Ten that made him abandon the siege, and in turn start his transformation into the man he was at the start of the series.  He was already a dragon by then so he had already refused to kill one of the dragons maybe that was the start of his transformation Now you reminded me of the saddest scene of all time :(
  
"Leaves from the vine..." ...falling so slow

Like fragile, tiny shells, drifting in the foam Little soldier boy, come marching home. Brave soldier boy, come marching home... 

RIP Mako Zuko turning face is one of my favourite moments in all of TV. "Hey. Zuko here" "Instead of lightning, it keeps blowing up in my face... Like everything always does."
-Zuko That show was so damn good.  This is stupid late, but **Pushing Daisies**.  I really miss that show. the pilot immediately just sucked me into that whole world. I love that show so much! As /u/fuelvolts sat and contemplated the tardiness of his initial reply, he knew what was on his mind needed to be said.  Because the facts were these: Reddit doesn't care, and *Pushing Daisies* was an amazing show regardless of what anyone else thought. I ate so much pie while I was watching that show. After every episode I just craved pie. Yes, okay! I just posted about Pushing Daises. Guess I didn't scroll down far enough. I've seen it twice in its entirety. Lee Pace, Kristin Chenoweth, Jim Dale... So underrated!!!!  Fargo. Brilliant pilot! Billy Bob Thornton is a fucking boss Martin Freeman's fake Minnesotan accent was on point. Ahh jeez So good. I love Malvo's quote ~~a few episodes later~~, ["Because some roads you shouldnt go down. Because maps used to say, There be dragons here." Now they dont. But that dont mean the dragons arent there."] (/spoiler) Not only that quote, but that whole scene is just so good.  I don't know another show where so much shit goes down in the just the first episode. Definitely the best I've ever seen. Dead like me. I was so bummed when it got cancelled. Easily one of my favorite shows. Mason and Rube are probably some of my favorite tv characters.

I wouldn't even mind a follow up like a movie or something. Shame they never made one.

edit: Was sarcasm, I know there was the terrible Life After Death movie. They could only do it if EVERYONE agreed to come back. Especially Mandy Patinkin, he's critically important.

If they tried to do it without him or something...the fans would revile the resulting product so much that they'd likely pretend it didn't even exist. There is no movie in Ba Sing...

Wait, wrong series. Sorry. I need more Rube. I love that guy. The episode where he works as the cook? Priceless. Black Mirror The X Files !

EDIT:  X Files GOLD!  Thank You Kind Stranger! :-) Spooky Mulder! My husband and I are working our way through the series.  Orphan Black

Edit:
[Here's a video of the opening scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrOYfbdOEbUF)

Looks like quite a few people discovered Orphan Black as a result of this comment. There's also an Orphan Black subreddit you can check out - /r/orphanblack.

Be careful though, it contains a lot of spoilers. If you do want to access it, I recommend making a beeline straight to the sidebar, and locating the list of all the old episode discussions, so you can find out what other redditors were thinking at the same point in the series you are at.

I wouldn't touch the main subreddit at all until you are completely caught up with the show.
