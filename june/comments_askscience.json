[{"body": "**Short answer:** You, and everyone around you, will die.\n\n**Long answer:** Different things will happen if you mean the black hole has the *mass* of a coin, or if it has the *radius.* The equation of a black hole is really simple: \n\n    Radius = 2 (Gravitational Constant) (Mass) / (Speed of light)^2\n\nSuppose a nickel in your pocket magically collapsed into a black hole. A US nickel has a mass of 5 grams. This black hole would have a radius of 10^-30 meters. For comparison, an atom is about 10^-10 meters. If atoms were made of atoms, this black hole would be the size of the micro-atom that makes up the milli-atoms that makes up real atoms. Basically, it's unimaginably small.\n\nSuch a small black hole would have a similarly unimaginably short lifetime to decay by Hawking radiation- it would radiate away what little mass it has in 10^-23 seconds. This 5 grams of mass will be converted to 450 teraJoules of energy, which is comparable to the detonation of about 100,000 tonnes of TNT, and will produce an explosion three times bigger than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki *combined.* In this case, you die.\n\nOf course, if the black hole has the radius of a common coin, then it will be considerably more massive. A nickel, again, has a radius of about 10 mm. This black hole has a mass of 10^24 kilograms - slightly bigger than the mass of the earth. Its surface gravity is a billion billion times greater than earth's. If it is in your pocket, you will find yourself being drawn towards the black hole at breakneck speeds. Literally *breakneck*. The difference between your chin and your teeth is about ten trillion g's of acceleration. You'll cross the event horizon before you even realize what's happening. The black hole is now a dominant gravitational piece of the earth-moon-black hole of death system. If you watch sci-fi movies a lot, you might think that the black hole sinks towards the center of the planet and will consume it from the inside out. In actuality, the *earth* will also move up onto the black hole, and begin to bob around as [if it was orbiting the black hole](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Orbit5.gif), all while having swaths of mass eaten with each pass. The bulk of the planet earth is consumed after some time, leaving a scattered disk of hot dust and rock in a tight orbit where the earth once was. The black hole grows slowly during this time, eventually doubling its mass by the time it's done feeding. \n\nThe effects on the solar system are awesome, but moreso in the Biblical sense of \"awesome\", which more closely means terrifying. The moon's orbit is now highly elliptical. Tidal forces from the black hole could disrupt the asteroid belt, sending rocks careening through the solar system - bombardment and impacts may become commonplace for the next few million years. The planets are slightly perturbed, but they stay approximately on the same orbit. The black hole we used to call earth will now continue on orbiting the sun, in the earth's place. \n\nIn this case, you also die. \n\nedit: I got some math wrong and rewrote most of this.

[Source](http://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/black-bear/hibernation/18-bears-mysterious-fecal-plug.html). There would be no nutrients that remain in the fecal plug and coprophagia would be a fairly useless food source. \n\nFurther, the fecal plug is often found in or immediately around the den. It seems like, if a bear has eaten their fecal plug, it's a fairly uncommon occurrence. [Source](http://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/denning.htm).

You say:\n\n&gt; So, I was thinking.. optimally as a specie to survive, wouldn't it make more sense to have X females per male?\n\nBut in truth natural selection favors things that help individuals, not species.

Instead, it favors things that help individuals, even if those traits are less than optimum for the species as a whole.\n\nSo, why have equal numbers of males and females?  Well, basically, imagine a situation where 100 females were born for every male.  Now imagine some individual has a mutation that causes them to produce more male offspring, instead of just having 1 in 100.  All their male offspring will do _very_ well.  They'll go on to impregnate dozens of females and produce lots of offspring.  The gene for having more males will spread.  The gene for having more females will not keep up, because individuals with that gene will only produce females, and those will only produce a few offspring.  Eventually, though, there will be lots of males.  At that point, it will be the _males_ who have trouble finding mates, while all females are guaranteed a chance to get lucky.  And so production to produce more females will be favored.  This all evens out to favor a nearly 50-50 sex ratio at birth.

What even constitutes a single organism when you think of super organisms such as ant colonies or slime molds or humans in a city? When does that live or die?Active/inactive proteins?? Proteins are chains of pieces of sticky chewing gum that fold in intricate ways to form vibrating blobs of atoms that jiggle through uncountable microstates and internal conformations with unbelievably complicated dynamics that utilize quantum-mechanical effects including quantum tunneling to catalyze all the reactions in the insane web of reactions we call life. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_catalysis). We like to subdivide some of these internal microstates into ensembles that we call \"on\" or \"off\"....or inactivated...or pre-active or voltage dependent active, or use dependent active.... \n\nThat all being said, discussing the upper limit of temperature by string theory is a serious mindfuck.

It just mixes some old and rather confusing definitions of mass which aren't necessary. It is acceptable mathematically to say that mass increases as you approach the speed of light, but the physical interpretation is wonky. What we're dealing with is momentum, which in Newtonian physics is:\n\np = mv\n\nIn relativistic physics, we can use the force and energy relationships and stuff to find\n\np = \u03b3mv\n\nWhere \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, which scales with velocity (ie \u03b3 is a function of v, I could write it as \u03b3(v) but it's implied). The Lorentz factor also shows up in the equations for time dilation and length contraction, it's the \"conversion factor\" between reference frames in special relativity.\n\nThe Newtonian and relativistic expressions are different, obviously. One alternative is to say that the correct expression for mass is:\n\nm = \u03b3m*_0_*\n\nwhere m*_0_* is the object's rest mass. This says that mass increases as speed increases, like what you said, and the momentum formula is p=mv just like in Newtonian physics, we just have to use the correct mass.\n\nWhat I did there was collect the \u03b3 into the m, and that's fine mathematically, but it doesn't mean anything *physical.* There was no reason why I should collapse \u03b3 into m instead of collapsing \u03b3 into v, ie:\n\nv = \u03b3*_0_*v*_0_*\n\nAnd then I have p = mv, which is the same as the Newtonian expression^(1). I just have to make sure I use the correct definition of v, just like I had to use the correct definition of m before.\n\nThese are two equally viable approaches which say drastically different things. The first option says that mass increases with speed, the second says that speed increases non-linearly with itself, and the third unmentioned option is that momentum increases non-linearly with speed.\n\nOption 1 is what you're describing, option 2 is... extremely confusing but correct, and option 3 is just a modified definition of momentum which disagrees with p=mv entirely. All produce valid results, so it's a purely interpretive matter.\n\nThe currently preferred option is #3. Modern physicists thus generally do *not* say that mass increases with speed. The reason for this is that on a more fundamental level, the momentum terms do not necessarily depend on mass (massless particles have momentum, after all), so it gets really clunky to try to artificially insert a scaling mass term into your momentum expressions. You literally have to cram a mass term into an equation which had none, it's a bit silly.\n\nSo, rather than saying that mass increases to make a 400 year-old definition of momentum fit, we just chuck out p=mv entirely and say that p=\u03b3mv is the correct one. p=mv is just an approximation and we shouldn't screw around with the terms in p=\u03b3mv in clunky ways just to force it to fit p=mv.\n\n^(1.

In non-relativistic physics they are equal, but in relativistic physics they aren't.\n\nStart with a cubic box containing an ideal gas. We know that:\n\npV = nRT\n\nbut let's break it down more. Pressure is force over area, so what we're saying is:\n\np = F*_x_*/s*_x_*+F*_y_*/s*_y_*+F*_z_*/s*_z_*\n\nF*_k_* is the force(s) acting on the box's walls in the k direction, and s*_k_* is the area of the side(s) of the box which F*_k_* acts on. F*_x_*, for example, acts on the sides of the box which are in the yz-plane, so the shape whose area is s*_x_* lies in yz.\n\nWe can further say that the box has side lengths L*_x_*, L*_y_*, L*_z_*, so s*_x_* = L*_y_*L*_z_*, s*_y_* = L*_x_*L*_z_*, and s*_z_* = L*_z_*L*_y_*.\n\nSince we're dealing with a cube (or, in a moment, a rectangular prism), the volume is, naturally, V=L*_x_*L*_y_*L*_z_*.\n\nLet's boost our box to a new reference frame moving at constant speed v in the x-direction. We know that\n\nF*_x_*' = \u03b3F*_x_*\n\nL*_x_*' = L*_x_*/\u03b3\n\nWhere \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. F*_x_*' and L*_x_*' are the force/length we observe in the boosted reference frame, F*_x_* and L*_x_* are the force/length in the rest frame. All terms involving y and z are unaffected since the motion is purely in x.\n\nOur new pressure is:\n\np' = \u03b3F*_x_*/s*_x_* + \u03b3F*_y_*/s*_y_*+\u03b3F*_z_*/s*_z_*\n\nEvery F*_x_* term picks up a \u03b3, and every L*_x_* term picks up 1/\u03b3, so s*_y_* and s*_z_* pick up 1/\u03b3.

Boosting to a new reference frame increased the pressure (p' = \u03b3p), but it decreased the volume (V' = V/\u03b3) by the same amount, so T stayed the same. Temperature thus does not change with reference frame, it's the same to all observers (we call this a \"Lorentz invariant quantity\").\n\nWell... sort of. The problem here is that what I found is a quantity - T - which characterizes a class of systems which are in thermal equilibrium. Every glass of water at 40 C is different in tiny ways (like snowflakes), but they all fit into a an \"equivalence class\" where the temperature equates all of them. It's what you get when you put a certain amount of energy into a certain amount of water under the same conditions: you get two different systems (in terms of random molecular motion), but the overall statistical properties are the same. This quantity - which I'll call \"empirical temperature\" - is Lorentz invariant, ie it's always the same no matter who observes it at what speed.\n\nThere is a second definition of temperature, though, which I'll call \"absolute temperature.\" This definition relates the exchange of energy and entropy within the system. We write\n\nt = dE/dS\n\nwhere E is energy and S is entropy. A change in entropy or S (dS) incurs a change in energy E (dE), proportional to the system's current temperature t (t is absolute temperature, T is empirical). The same relation works backwards, naturally.\n\nSo, in two systems with different temperatures, if we add some fixed amount of energy to both, the one with higher temperature experiences a larger change in entropy.\n\nEntropy itself is Lorentz-invariant. I can justify that using the informational definition of entropy (Shannon entropy), which is equivalent to Boltzmann entropy. The energy term, however, is not: we have:\n\nE' = \u03b3mc^(2) = \u03b3E\n\nwhere E=mc^(2) is the rest energy. Since t = dE/dS, we thus have\n\nt' = dE'/dS = \u03b3dE/dS = \u03b3t\n\nWhich says that absolute temperature scales with speed. This is an *absurd* reduction of the actual math, but it works in the end and I think the point carries through - it's done with rigor [here](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.5701.pdf).\n\nIn the classical limit we take c-&gt;inf and thus \u03b3=1, so t=T. In the relativistic sense, though, absolute and empirical temperatures are different things which only correlate at low speeds.\n\nIt's not clear which definition of temperature you would prefer to use, so we can't really say whether or not temperature scales with speed.

Temperature is a *derivative* of energy with respect to entropy of a system.  It can be positive (the usual case), infinite (rare), or even negative (hotter than hot!).\n\nFor everyone who's not already a physicist: \n\n*Entropy* is the *logarithm* of the *state function* of a system.  The state function is the number of ways you can rearrange the elementary particles in a system, and end up with the same macroscopic description.  Take the logarithm, and you get a measure of how many bits of information are contained in that micro-description (or, alternatively, how many bits of information you're missing even if you have the full macroscopic description of the system).  So a low-entropy system can't be rearranged much without changing your description of it (you know a lot about the system), but a high-entropy system can be rearranged a lot (you don't know much about it).\n\nThe lower the energy of a system, the more all the systems in it settle down to their ground state until, at absolute zero, there's generally only one state the system can be in (OK, a very small number of them...).  To get more entropy in the system, you have to add some energy to give the components of the system \"room\" to jiggle around.\n\nIn some systems, the state function is invariant with respect to energy: as you add more energy, you don't change the number of ways to rearrange the system.  Such systems have *infinite* temperature and are \"absolute hot\" -- regardless of how much energy they contain.\n\nSome even weirder systems can go the other way:  if you overexcite the system, the entropy *decreases* as you add more energy to the system, so the temperature is *negative*.  The obvious example of a system like that is a laser medium.  Such systems are \"hotter than hot\" and will leak energy into any surrounding normal medium.\n\nSo in the best understanding of what temperature actually is, there's no absolute maximum temperature of any kind.\n\n/u/fishify's answer about the Hagedorn temperature relies on a model of flat, empty space and free particles in it: individual free particles in empty space happen to have a linear relationship between their kinetic energy and their entropy, so it's tempting for people to treat temperature as a sort of fancy term for energy density.

It's deeply tied to the idea of quantum collapse, and it can do slippery and weird things like change from observer to observer based on the observers' states of knowledge.  I remember seeing an awesome example in the Russian dusty-plasma experiment on ISS:  they diffused some black and some white dust into opposite sides of the experiment, then imposed a strong magnetic field -- mixing up the black and white particles so the container appeared fully mixed.  At that point, an fresh observer would have assigned the experiment a high entropy (since the particles were mixed up).  But a knowledgeable obesrver would assign it a low entropy since the particles were still highly organized -- even though the organization was not directly visible.

The original that I answered was \"Why don't we use really long snorkels? \"\n\nThe average forced vital capacity (assuming you are breathing as hard as you can with every breath) is roughly 4200 mL. For a 2 cm wide snorkel you'd need about 13.5 meters of snorkel tube to waste 50% of that as dead space. However! Dead space is decidedly *not* the issue if you are heading underwater. Besides, you can inhale through the tube and exhale into the water, as someone cleverly mentioned. \n\nThe average healthy male can generate about -120 cmH2O (-80 to -100 for females) of what's called **negative inspiratory force**, or \"ability to suck\" if you like. However, you need a *difference* of about 40-60 cmH2O to breathe effectively which translating to about 50 cm of depth under water, is the number at which other people in this thread have suggested is when it gets really hard to pull air down. \n\nBasically, the pressure difference between you and the surface would be significant when you push past about a half meter. That's a lot of extra work for lungs that are used to about 0 atmospheres of difference, so you probably aren't strong enough to take the entire forced vital capacity because inhaling will be *so hard*.\n\nIf you were just hanging out at ground level and attempting to breathe only through a long snorkel (or just a giant straw at this point) then dead space in the snorkel will be what makes you pass out. \n\nEdit: Frequently asked questions (too many to reply to individually)\n\n* What is dead space?\n\nIt's air that's being pushed back and forth without any significant oxygen/CO2 exchange happening with your lungs. Basically, air that's not doing any work.\n\n* What about SCUBA gear?\n\nAs someone answered already, diving cylinders are hooked up to apparatuses that allow you to breathe in a gas mixture at the same pressure as the surrounding ambient pressure, so there's no large pressure gradient to overcome.\n\n* What if there's a pump?\n\nWell, then you'd no longer be breathing on your own to overcome the pressure gradient. That's what [surface-supplied diving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-supplied_diving) is, and they seem to historically have been used in the 1800's.\n\n* What if I have a large lung capacity? Does a higher FVC affect how far I'd be able to go down?\n\nNo. The limiting factor is the amount of negative inspiratory force you're able to generate, which is dependent on how powerful your diaphragm is. Even if you had exceptionally powerful respiratory muscles, you'd get maybe a few more centimeters or tens of centimeters down the water.\n\n* Air compresses and you need to breathe in more air to get the same oxygenation\n\nSomeone had this misconception but this is actually *not* a significant factor because in our scenario the air is still openly connected to the atmosphere. If you are breathing in air through a rigid pipe it will not compress significantly.

Unfortunately there's no \"decompression\" for oxygen toxicity, only time (simplifying here).\n\nOxygen exposure must be limited by time and concentration.  For any given tank of breathing gas (or real time mix) oxygen exposure must be tracked cumulatively using the concentration of oxygen present, which varies with tank mix and depth (the more oxygen is in the tank the faster the clock runs, the deeper you go the faster it runs also, because it's the number of oxygen molecules in your lungs that matter). \n\nAs well, there is a depth beyond which the concentration of oxygen in ordinary air exceeds the limit humans can safely breathe, and beyond that point divers risk convulsions due to excess oxygen.  that point is equal to approximately 1.6-1.8 times the concentration of pure oxygen at sea level (remember, it's the number of oxygen molecules that matter).  \n\nSo, any tank of breathing gas has a limit to the depth at which it can be used, because that is the depth at which the oxygen concentrations become too high to be safe.

They weighted it until it would sink to the bottom of the pool while full of air.  They then took turns diving to the bottom, sticking their heads in the bucket and breathing, thus staying underwater for several minutes at a time.\n\nThe problem with this is that sinking the bucket to the bottom of the pool caused the air in the bucket to compress (physics, the ideal gas law) according to the depth of the pool.  This decreased the volume of air and also increased oxygen concentration, so it wasn't a problem to get enough oxygen for the kids.\n\nEverything was fine until one of them held his breath while coming up.  Divers know never to do this, because SCUBA tanks and regulators produce air at ambient underwater pressure, meaning at 33 feet underwater you will have twice the number of molecules of air in your lungs as you would at the surface.\n\nIf a diver holds their breath while ascending even a short distance, the reduced water pressure causes the air to expand with no where to go, which results in a pulmonary air embolism (popped lung) which can be fatal.\n\nThis is what happened to one of the kids, unfortunately.  He held his breath coming up after filling his lungs from the bucket.  The bucket air was naturally compressed by being at the bottom of the pool and as he ascended it expanded in his lungs and caused a fatal embolism.\n\nIncidentally, divers are told to always breathe normally underwater, and never hold their breath.

Let's make that and even troy ounce of 100% silver. One troy ounce is 31.1 grams. Divided by the molar mass of silver (107 g/mole) and multiplied by Avogadro's number (units of atoms/mole), we have 1.736*10^23 silver atoms. Now consider the atomic radius of metallic silver, 130 pm (picometers, or 10^-12 meters). One atom would occupy an area of pi*(130 pm)^2, therefore giving us a total area of 9217 m^2. But wait there's more. Pure metals tend to crystalize in a hexagonal close packed structure when considered in 2D. The packing efficiency of such a structure is 0.9069 (see Wikipedia's entry on Circle Packing). Thus and therefore, the actual area occupied by a 1 troy ounce silver good ole fashioned American dollar would be 10163 m^2.

In gripping the blade like this you are able to use the sword more like a mace or hammer and strike your opponent. The strike would be focused onto the pommel (end nub) or guard (the piece that protects the hand(s) holding the sword) and would essentially allow a fighter to deliver a more advantageous blow to an enemy wearing armor. Since cutting heavy armor would not get much done, a concussive blow from the pommel or guard may stun or even kill your opponent and as such was a common tactic taught to swordfighters. \n\nTL;DR- the murderstroke/strike is when you hold the blade of the sword and use the pommel or guard to beat the ever loving shit out of your opponent...or at least that's what the guy in the video says.", "gilded": 0, "score": 98, "created": 1434780372.0},{"body": "In the medieval sources (the majority is german), it\u00b4s called [\"Mordsschlag\"](http://www.hammaborg.de/bilder/transkriptionen/phm_dresden_2/08_harnisch/07.jpg).", "gilded": 0, "score": 25, "created": 1434800957.0},{"body": "Or if the cross guard is pointy enough, it turns your sword into a pickaxe ", "gilded": 0, "score": 7, "created": 1434791469.0},{"body": "Skallagrim is fantastic.

A sword could already cut an arm badly on light hit.  Ceramic or whatever is no more likely to get through steel plate or chainmail.\n\nIn fact, swords were NOT the primary weapon in most of history.  Polearms were, and bows.  Polearms could pack together and make a deep barrier you just couldn't get through.  Swords need space to swing.\n\nSwords were generally ineffective against plate or chain.  In fact, most armor was padded cloth/canvas that did a lot to stop a sword.  Swords with a sharp edge would more likely have the edge damaged on a plate impact rather than penetrating the plate. \n\nA polearm, with shaft, was relatively massive.  It could separate chainmail links or break your bones through unbroken chainmail.  On a thrust, it could travel up one steel plate until it got to a joint and pushed under the next overlapping plate.  What's underneath could be a padded gambeson or a gambeson over chainmail, which it could injure through.\n\nOne thing that WOULD be improved would be arrowheads.  Most weren't hardened steel and probably not effective at penetrating plate.  Also most weren't broadheads, broadheads cost too much to mass-mfg and were ineffective on chainmail, probably heavy cloth/canvas too.  And it was hard to carry a LOT of the shafts due to head width.    Instead they were narrow steel \"bodkin points\" which handily penetrated chain and cloth but, like I say, not super-effective on plate and also didn't cause really serious injury for immediate stopping power.  About like getting stabbed with a pencil.   Hardened steel points could penetrate plate better, and might be made wider to cause more dire injury.\n\nThe more interesting question- could modern materials and engineering make SUPERARMOR??\n\nYes, actually.  I think so.  Many plastics are more effective than steel at stopping these impacts.  Ballistic nylon is radically better at stopping blades from cutting, as would stainless mesh chainmail.\n\nOne primary limitation was what would be practical to both make and wear and still fight.  Modern 3D CAD design would go a long way to making effective, form-fitting, practical designs- especially covering the joints.  Making the armor bulky enough to absorb huge impacts without having the impact carry far enough to break bones.\n\nHelmets... that was sort of a limiting factor.  Wearing steel plates all over was NOT as heavy as you probably think.  But an effective steel helm was hot, bulky, very restrictive for vision/breathing, and slowed you down overall.  Also a concussion through those things would take you down easier than trying to strike through plate or chain.\n\nIf you don't have an effective helm, going with super-effective plate over, say, chainmail isn't all that beneficial.  In the thick of things they'll just strike for your head regardless of how much armor you have elsewhere.\n\nModern football helmet would probably be super-effective in medieval combat.  Generally speaking you can't knife through the plastic shell, a sword won't do much better.

It flew past Jupiter in 1979, giving us great close-up views of [swirling clouds, storms, and bands](http://i.imgur.com/BX4iYlF.gif). Awesome!\n\nNext up was Saturn in 1981. Things were definitely hazier at Saturn - presumably because it's a good 30 degrees colder - but with a little CSI-style image enhancement, there were still plenty of [swirling clouds, storms and bands](http://i.imgur.com/QmoHwHx.jpg) to be seen. Good stuff!\n\nUranus was up next in 1986, and folks were very excited to see the planet through Voyager since it's only a tiny turquoise disc as seen from Earth - these would be our first good views ever! We got there and....[yeah](http://i.imgur.com/Ra54BVV.jpg). A bit of a bummer, really. Even with our [CSI-style enhance](http://i.imgur.com/UdTj7Tr.jpg), there's really just not much to be seen there. Maybe a cloud in the upper right.\n\nFinally, Voyager 2 flew past Neptune in 1989, and what did we see? [This](http://i.imgur.com/nDABtu2.jpg). That's more like it! Swirling clouds, storms, bands...that's what a giant planet is supposed to look like.\n\nSo what's the deal with Uranus? Well, scientists realized that unlike the other 3 giant planets, Uranus seems to have no internal source of heat. Jupiter is warmer than you'd expect if it were only heated from the Sun, mostly due to gravitational compression from its formation; as it squeezes down, heat is released. Saturn is much the same, warmer than it should be due to compression, though also probably because of the separation of helium from hydrogen providing a source of heat. Neptune is also warmer than it should be because...well, actually *we don't know* why Neptune is warmer, and that's a great unsolved problem in planetary science, but a topic for another question.\n\nUranus, though, is exactly the temperature you'd expect it to be if only heated by the Sun. \"A ha!\" say the scientists, \"Without any excess internal heating, there's no energy for all those exciting storm dynamics that we see on other giant planets! We are very smart!\" And that's where the subject stopped for 20 years.\n\nUranus, however, had another trick up its sleeve. Unlike the other giant planets, Uranus has this crazy 82 degree axial tilt - it's essentially rotating on its side. When Voyager flew past, the planet was at solstice - in that Voyager picture, the North Pole is actually just about at the center while the rest of the planet spins around that point. All the areas in sunlight essentially stay in sunlight at solstice, and all the areas in darkness stay in darkness.\n\nNow, fast forward 21 years - [1/4 of a Uranus orbit](http://i.imgur.com/1P7bzQi.jpg) - to 2007 when the planet was at equinox. For the first time in 42 years, the entire planet is getting regular day-night cycles. We point the Hubble Space Telescope at it...and [this is what we see](http://i.imgur.com/5LWnC98.jpg). Look at that, swirling clouds, storms, and bands! (That's also pretty close to the visible wavelengths seen in the Voyager image, so a comparison is fair here.)\n\nUranus woke up, and there's been a concerted effort by us giant planet folks to rebrand the planet with its newer, hipper image. This is a planet that clearly goes through quiet and active times...but why?\n\nThis is still up for debate, but the working theory here is that without any internal heat, changing sunlight patterns are the only thing that controls the climate of the planet. Based on what Uranus is made of and the thickness of the atmosphere, there seem to be a full season lag between sunlight and temperature - so the temperature is most equal between hemispheres right around solstice, meaning boring times. At equinox, meanwhile, the temperature difference is maximized, and it can form all kinds of interesting weather patterns by tapping into that difference in energy between hemispheres.\n\n**TL;DR** Uranus is only boring *sometimes*.", "gilded": 7, "score": 4950, "created": 1434001146.0},{"body": "Just wanted to say, you explained this so beautifully and it was actually easy to understand a topic (that is obviously way more complicated seeing as how you wrote your thesis on it) so thanks for taking the time to answer.

So you don't even have to know the planet's mass very precisely to get in an orbit - in fact, you could be off by a few hundred percent and still orbit, although maybe not the orbit you want.\n\nLet's use a geosynchronous orbit around Earth as an example. Say you're 42,000 km from the center of a planet, and a velocity of 3 km/s pointed exactly perpendicular to the line to the center of the planet. If that planet has a mass equal to Earth, you'll be in a circular orbit (with a period of 24 hours, but that's not important here).\n\nIf that planet has a mass greater than Earth's, now you're at the apoapsis (farthest point from the planet) of an orbit (by virtue of having a velocity that is still exactly perpendicular to the line to the planet), and you might ask, how big can the mass get before you hit the planet? If the planet's mass is less than Earth, now you're at the periapsis (closest approach, again because your velocity is pointed perpendicular to the line to the center of the planet). So, the question becomes, how much can the mass of the planet decrease before you no longer have a closed orbit?\n\nWe have the Vis Viva equation, which relates the kinetic and potential energy in an orbit (which are conserved assuming no forces are acting other than gravity, and so this relationship holds at every point in the orbit,\n\n* v^2 = GM\\*(2/r - 1/a)\n\nwhere v is velocity (well, speed, because it doesnt have direction here), G is the universal gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, r is the distance from the center of the planet, and a is the semimajor axis of the orbit. If the orbit is closed, a is equal to the average of the apoapsis and periapsis,\n\n* a = (A+P)/2\n\nSo, \n\n* v^2 = 2GM\\*(1/r - 1/(A+P))\n* M = v^2 / (2G\\*(1/r - 1/(A+P)))\n\nWe know that with M = Me (the mass of the Earth), r = 42000 km, and v = 3 km/s, we're in a circular orbit, and P = A = 42000 km, so\n\n* v^2 = 2GMe\\*(1/r - 1/2r)\n* Me =rv^2 / G\n\nThen\n\n* M/Me = 1 / (2r\\*(1/r - 1/(A+P)))\n\nAnd, since we're at apoapsis in our orbit around the new planet,\n\n* M/Me = 1 / (2r\\*(1/r - 1/(r+P)))\n* M/Me = 1 / (2 - 2r/(r+P))\n\nIf we assume that we don't want to get closer to the center of the planet than 7000 km (which is about where the International Space Station orbits; remember that this is radius, not altitude), then how big can the mass get? Just plug in.\n\n* M/Me = 1 / (2 - 2*42000/(42000+7000))\n* M/Me = 3.5\n\nSo, your planet could be 3.5 times as massive as Earth before you'd get within 7000 km of the center, starting at 42000 km and 3 km/s tangent to the planet. (Of course, the radius of the planet and its atmosphere might grow as it gets more massive, but that's the basic calculation.)\n\nOn the other hand, how small could the planet get, and still have a closed orbit? Well, that's where the semimajor axis goes to infinity, so 1/a = 0 - a parabolic orbit. Back to Vis Viva, if 1/a is 0, then\n\n* v^2 = GM * 2/r\n* M = rv^2 / 2G\n\nfor a parabolic orbit. We use\n\n* Me =rv^2 / G\n\nagain to find\n\n* M/Me = 0.5\n\nThat is, a circular orbit (any circular orbit, in fact) around the Earth will become a parabolic orbit around a planet with half the Earth's mass.\n\nSo, the conclusion is, if we can get to a point in space 42000 km from a planet with a velocity of 3 km/s in the right direction, the mass of the planet can vary 700% between the low and high bounds before we wouldn't enter a closed orbit around it.", "gilded": 0, "score": 5, "created": 1434044693.0},{"body": "I think I see.

I'm going to try to the candle temperature challenge myself.  Anyways I hope this adds something to the discussion.\n\nFor me it helps to clarify what a flame is and what its temperature is.\n\nFlames are the visible signs of plasma turning into the combustion products.  (If I am wrong about this bit please let me know - flames are a pretty common thing where I work!).  The little clear area at the base of a calm flame is the plasma and unstable intermediates, and as it moves away from the reaction center and cools and condenses into the stable products (H2O, CO2, CO and C usually) it gives off radiation.  Some amount of that is visible light, and there is likely some amount of other wavelengths UV and IR, and some heat is also transferred as the products cool by colliding with surrounding molecules in the air.\n\nSo if each tiny bit of heat has to come from one of these reaction steps, then the temperature of the flame (or \u201cflamons\u201d if I\u2019m allowed to coin a word for discrete \u201cparticles\u201d of an apparently continuous flame) is dependent on the chemical reaction and can\u2019t really be changed.  Also, it would more correctly be called \u201cenergy content\u201d than \u201ctemperature.\u201d\n\nWhat makes a flame \u201chot\u201d and dangerous is that this happens in a bulk manner and there\u2019s more heat being put into your hand than can be radiated out or conducted away by your blood.  If you had one molecule of methane burning it would be a very short-lived flame that would seem cool - if you could even detect it - because you could \u201chandle\u201d the heat.\n\nOr think of iron rusting, its a very slow oxidation but isn\u2019t usually considered combustion because its so slow its not usually a worry.  It gets noticeably warmer if there\u2019s a lot of it (like in an iron powder hot pack) and dangerous if it\u2019s dispersed like in a grain elevator.  But while its rusting, its sort of a very very very cool flame.  (Also not considered combustion because the common \u201cschool\u201d definition of combustion is \u201ca hydrocarbon plus oxygen combining to form carbon dioxide and water\u201d which is pretty limiting).  (I see after typing this that the oxidizing of iron has been mentioned elsewhere - I apologize for any overlap and I hope I have managed to add to the discussion!).\n\nYour question reminds me of that apparent paradox that you can freeze to death in the thermosphere (a region of the upper atmosphere 80-500ish km up) even though the temperature can reach 2700 F.  This is because the hot molecules are so far apart that you  lose more heat by radiation than you gain from them by conduction.\n\nBTW I\u2019m a chemistry teacher and if you can\u2019t tell I love getting asked questions like that; it shows you\u2019re really thinking &amp; I bet you would be really fun to have in class. \n", "gilded": 0, "score": 7, "created": 1433298288.0},{"body": "One of those hand warmer packets produces heat by oxidizing iron.

The most common answer had to do with [cool flame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_flame).\n\nQuotes from the article:\n\n&gt;Cool flame is a flame having maximal temperature below about 400 \u00b0C (752 \u00b0F).[1] It is usually produced in a chemical reaction of a certain fuel-air mixture. Contrary to conventional flame, the reaction is not vigorous and releases very little heat, light and carbon dioxide. Cool flames are difficult to observe and are uncommon in everyday life, but they are responsible for engine knock \u2013 the undesirable, erratic, and noisy combustion of low-octane fuels in internal combustion engines.[2][3][4]\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt; Cool flame can occur in hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, oils, acids, waxes[9] and even methane. The lowest temperature of a cool flame is poorly defined and is conventionally set as temperature at which the flame can be detected by eye in a dark room (cool flames are hardly visible in daylight). This temperature slightly depends on the fuel to oxygen ratio and strongly depends on gas pressure \u2013 there is a threshold below which cool flame is not formed. A specific example is 50% n-butane\u201350% oxygen (in volume percent) which has a cool flame temperature (CFT) of about 300 \u00b0C at 165 mmHg (22.0 kPa). **One of the lowest CFTs (80 \u00b0C) was reported for a C2H5OC2H5 + O2 + N2 mixture at 300 mmHg (40 kPa).**[10] The CFT is significantly lower than the auto-ignition temperature (AIT) of conventional flame (see table[8]).[2]\n\nSo there is no hard set temperature below which flame can't exist. Rather the lowest temperature of a given flame depends on the specific concentrations and pressures of the materials involved.

So really you are asking about what is the lowest possible temperature of said chemical reaction.  \n\nNow think about that chemical reaction.  All reactions require a certain amount of activation energy, so there is a minimum temperature for a flame to start.  Flames indicate exothermic reactions, meaning energy is released.  Thus the temperature of the flame will be higher than the temperature needed to begin the reaction.  Exactly how much higher depends on the rate at which the released energy is dispersed, essentially how concentrated the energy is.\n\nSome reactions can have a very small amount of energy being released every second.  If such a reaction were in an environment where the energy could be dissipated quickly, I could imagine the temperature of the flame to be only slightly above the temperature at which the reaction began.\n\nAll of the factors i have mentioned depend on what the reactants are (what are you burning) as well as the environment in which the reaction takes place.  So unfortunately, I do not think there is a single answer to your question, as there are too many conditions to consider.\n\nEDIT: Also, I apologize if i am grossly wrong on any point in this.

The carbon will boil the O2 immediately around it and react so aggressively that \n\nIn fact most all \"fire\" you're familiar with requires preheating to an ignition temp.  Gasoline vapor and air do not react at 25C, it requires some tiny part of the mixture to be above an ignition temp of 280\u00b0C.  Then it generates so much heat iuts neighboring molecules and soon all of it is above 280\u00b0C and thus reacting.\n\nHowever, if your air/fuel mass is below a certain temp, combustion may not generate enough specific heat to raise more fuel into a gaseous state past the ignition temp.\n\nIn an ideal lab condition, the specific heat of combustion of 1 gram of fuel/air mix just has to be higher than the total energy required to vaporize and heat up 1g of fuel to the ignition temp, and fire continues.\n\nIn reality it's much less efficient.

This reaction releases *energy* and temperature is the byproduct.\n\nThink of it like this: the fuel is just a battery.  It stores energy.  Batteries store electrical energy, fuel stores chemical energy.  When I burn a specific amount of fuel (with the appropriate amount of oxygen), I release a certain amount of energy (typically the lower/higher heating value).  For the same mass, this certain amount of energy causes a specific and unchanging rise in temperature.\n\nThe temperature of the flame produced is the combination of the temperature of the air, temperature of the fuel, and the amount of energy added to the air.\n\nIf you want to have some fun with this, burn a candle in a room temperature room and measure the \"flame\" temperature with an infrared thermometer.

Possibly you can even say sponges sleep.\n\nTo give a more complex answer: Sleep in humans consists of many different processes that in concert help to improve our bodily and cognitive performance during wake. To date, we know many such processes.

It's most likely that sleep/wake cycles evolved out of circadian rhythms. Even the most basic lifeforms have circadian clocks that generate daily rhythms in their cellular biochemistry.

They are not uniformly in a single state (be that \"wake\" or \"sleep\").\n\nOnce you have temporally segregated cellular processes, you are not far from sleep/wake cycles, since sleep/wake cycles are essentially a division of our day into two states:\n\n1. A state where we conduct processes that involve directly interacting with our environment (wake).\n\n2. A state where we conduct processes that improve the nature of our interactions with our environment during wake, either through selective timing of those interactions or improved biological functioning during those interactions (sleep).\n\nViewed this way, sleep isn't a single biological process involving any specific organ (e.g., the brain).
