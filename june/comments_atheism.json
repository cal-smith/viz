Abstinence doesn't work because people tend to want to have sex.  Giving teenagers the education so that they understand their bodies and have the tools to make more informed decisions doesn't mean we encourage them to have sex.  We just know the science, and plenty of them will have sex regardless of what we tell them to do so we may as well give them the tools to minimize the risk of pregnancy and STIs.\n\nThere are also reasons for women to take hormonal birth control aside from not getting pregnant by the way.  It can help regulate and lower heavy menstrual flow and cramping that might otherwise leave a woman out of commission for a few days every month.  Plus even if it doesn't drastically help, you can still use it to have only four periods a year.  You could go even less but it's typically recommended to have a period every so often just to see if there are any health issues.", "gilded": 0, "score": 40, "created": 1435295996.0},{"body": "Poster above you was being completely sardonic, BTW.

That kind of government oversight of running a church was, at best, invasive and messy. At worst, it was a clear violation of the first amendment because it necessarily made law respecting the establishment of religion.\n* These activities were often entwined with political activities, adding another layer of complexity and and pain in teasing out the details.\n\nSo the current system was a compromise of sorts. We evolved a system of non-taxation and then layered on top of it a definition of a religious (and therefore tax-exempt) organization that precluded direct involvement in politics. It's essentially a total separation of church and state, and to say that the two should be separated, but we should get our piece of the action would seem... more than a little disingenuous.\n\nBut here's the rub: **we've abandoned enforcement of the second half of that deal**! We've essentially given a free tax break to a political lobby, and that was absolutely not the goal!
