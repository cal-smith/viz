Valve will, upon request via help.steampowered.com, issue a refund for any reason, if the request is made within fourteen days of purchase, and the title has been played for less than two hours. There are more details below, but even if you fall outside of the refund rules we\u2019ve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and we\u2019ll take a look.\n\nYou will be issued a full refund of your purchase within a week of approval. You will receive the refund in Steam Wallet funds or through the same payment method you used to make the purchase. If, for any reason, Steam is unable to issue a refund via your initial payment method, your Steam Wallet will be credited the full amount. (Some payment methods available through Steam in your country may not support refunding a purchase back to the original payment method. Click here for a full list.)\n\n**Where Refunds Apply**\n\nThe Steam refund offer, within two weeks of purchase and with less than two hours of playtime, applies to games and software applications on the Steam store. Here is an overview of how refunds work with other types of purchases.\n\n**Refunds on Downloadable Content**\n\n(Steam store content usable within another game or software application, \"DLC\")\nDLC purchased from the Steam store is refundable within fourteen days of purchase, and if the underlying title has been played for less than two hours since the DLC was purchased, so long as the DLC has not been consumed, modified or transferred. Please note that in some cases, Steam will be unable to give refunds for some third party DLC (for example, if the DLC irreversibly levels up a game character). These exceptions will be clearly marked as nonrefundable on the Store page prior to purchase.\n\n**Refunds on In-game Purchases**\n\nSteam will offer refund for in-game purchases within any Valve-developed games within forty-eight hours of purchase, so long as the in-game item has not been consumed, modified or transferred. Third-party developers will have the option to enable refunds for in-game items on these terms. Steam will tell you at the time of purchase if the game developer has opted to offer refunds on the in-game item you are buying. Otherwise, in-game purchases in non-Valve games are not refundable through Steam.\n\n**Refunds on Pre-Purchased Titles**\n\nWhen you pre-purchase a title on Steam (and have paid for the title in advance), you can request a refund at any time prior to release of that title. The standard 14-day/two-hour refund period also applies, starting on the game\u2019s release date.\n\n**Steam Wallet Refunds**\n\nYou may request a refund for Steam Wallet funds within fourteen days of purchase if they were purchased on Steam and if you have not used any of those funds.\n\n**Refunds on Bundles**\n\nYou can receive a full refund for any bundle purchased on the Steam Store, so long as none of the items in the bundle have been transferred, and if the combined usage time for all items in the bundle is less than two hours. If a bundle includes an in-game item or DLC that is not refundable, Steam will tell you if the whole bundle is refundable during check-out.\n\n**Purchases Made Outside of Steam**\n\nValve cannot provide refunds for purchases made outside of Steam (for example, CD keys or Steam wallet cards purchased from third parties).\n\n**VAC Bans**\n\nIf you have been banned by VAC (the Valve Anti-Cheat system) on a game, you lose the right to refund that game.\n\n**Movies**\n\nWe are unable to offer refunds for movies on Steam.\n\n**Refunds on Gifts**\n\nWe are unable to offer refunds for gifts after they have been redeemed by the recipient.\n\n**Abuse**\n\nRefunds are designed to remove the risk from purchasing titles on Steam\u2014not as a way to get free games. If it appears to us that you are abusing refunds, we may stop offering them to you. We do not consider it abuse to request a refund on a title that was purchased just before a sale and then immediately rebuying that title for the sale price.\n\n**How to Request a Refund**\n\nYou can request a refund or get other assistance with your Steam purchases at help.steampowered.com.", "gilded": 0, "score": 76, "created": 1433267450.0},{"body": "&gt;**Abuse**\n\n&gt;Refunds are designed to remove the risk from purchasing titles on Steam\u2014not as a way to get free games.

A *LOT* of money.  One of the bigger ones was Rock Band.  I knew that one was able to have some backwards compatibility (primarily the DLC i believe), but Rock Band alone was not enough to make me want to buy an XBone, even when I have literally hundreds of dollars spent just on those games and their DLC alone.  Even with all the DLC, it's still one game, and I can just hook the 360 up for parties and whatnot if I want to whip that one out.\n\nWith backwards compatibility, I can play *other* games I already have on a console that (hopefully) does not sound like a jet engine next to my television.  Also, I may be able to play good 360 games that I missed the first time around (Dragon Age 3, for example, which I still have not picked up).  \n\nI am also not the only person with access to my console.  I keep my 360 games because I love them, and I want to have other people I know share the experience.  If I can share Dragon Age or Mass Effect 2 &amp; 3 or Red Dead Redemption or any of the others with people in my house and they get a better experience out of it than they would have from the old 360, that's a win for me. \n\nIf the XBone can handle my old library, it is a direct upgrade for me and a huge value.  Instead of worrying about buying a new 360 for when my Elite craps out again, I can just get an XBone and upgrade.  \n\nOf course, that's the caveat: if it can handle my old library.
