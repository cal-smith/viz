+1 on this. In Ireland it's also a illegal practise to raise prices before a sale. Valve should punish the publishers who do this.  it's illegal in Canada as well. http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/00522.html

It's a *civil provision*. Every company on the planet is going to ignore the law since someone has to bring them to court over it for it to be enforced. These laws are a joke. it's funny because i used to design LCBO magazines and they used to do the same thing when wine went on sale. Even a crown corporation is ignoring that law? Definitely a useless law then. LCBO is kind of weird since it is a crown corporation of ontario so it is not owned by Canada it is owned by Ontario, there is however a large amount of contraversy involving the fact that for the most part there is a monopoly involving liquor in Ontario with I belive 24 packs being only able to be purchased at the Beer Store and certain brands only at one of the two companies. I can never decide which is crazier - that you can buy liquor in Wisconsin gas stations or that a gubmint monopoly sells you your liquor in many Canadian provinces. *flips coin* what about the fact that you can produce your own alcohol at home with no legal problems but it is impossible for a normal grocery store to sell alcohol themselves. They're gonna ignore it because they can *only* be sued (potentially for millions), not fined or sanctioned by the government?

EDIT: they *can* be fined for millions, per the Competition Act Because some individual has to bring the case. The government would bring it and they have unlimited resources, for an individual to do it is a lot harder. If you bring a suit that is potentially worth millions, your attorney can defer billing you until after the case is finished.  In Canada, the winner is usually awarded costs, so you end up paying nothing.

The point is, companies aren't going to ignore these laws given what's at stake.

EDIT: doesn't actually apply here, see below. And yet GTA has been reduced by 25% and now costs 70$... Wait $70?  Try $80.  Or $85?...  http://imgur.com/ALjVXmq It's actually $95 in Canada, which is the same mark up. lol yea.. [Favorite part of how stupid that sale is.](http://i.imgur.com/nUXjdJY.png) They took away GTA5 by itself, and replaced it with packages of GTA5+Cards. So it's the game + $20 in currency. Comes to be about normal price + a card as a bonus. I wouldn't buy GTA 5 at $60.  Upon actually looking at it, simply a loophole of adding in a "special item" that gives in game cash bringing the total back to base before sale.

As such, you're basically getting the game with "free" in game money. You're basically pre-ordering the game post release. :P is the U.S. the only country that allows businesses to trick people into buying products? Probably not, in Brazil we started to have "black friday" too, and the stores just raised the products one day before and gave "huge discounts". We call it now "black fraud". I worked in the backroom of target for two black Fridays and I can say with confidence that the electronics have different barcodes than the models they sell year round. I don't know for sure but I'd guess they have worse quality parts. Many consumers don't realize this, but with electronics, many of the products on sale specifically on Black Friday are designed specifically *for* Black Friday. Especially things like doorbusters and those other huge deals, you will never find those models on sale at any other time of the year. They are typically some budget version of an existing model. I found this out with a TV I bought. I actually had no issues except the hardware was non existent. When the TV broke I attempted to call the manufacturer and found out there wasn't one. Essentially, he product was a joint venture between two Chinese companies and the product doesn't "exist" save for only a picture on their website, which was hard to find.  It probably makes a lot of sense as a business tactic to sell crappy stuff on black Friday in the hopes that it's broken by next year. They are targeting the people who really like black Friday shopping by making them rebuy their crap every year.  It's not really about hoping it will break before the next year, it's just sacrificing quality in order to cut costs so you can have bigger black Friday sales. That could mean it doesn't last as long, or it could have a higher rate of defects, or it could perform slightly worse. This is also true for electronics sold at Walmart in general.   That or they are products from a batch that was found to have some defective ones. The one you're getting may or may not be defective itself, but the likelihood is much higher than normal. That also lets them avoid price matching since it's not the exact same UPC as another store. Wouldn't let them avoid price matching.

But it would sure as shit let them justify the increased price.

---

A:"You can't up the price of the product the day before the sale and then discount it."

B"We didn't as you can see this UPC has been listed at $400 all year, and is now discounted to $300"

A"But this product was $300 last week"

B"No the product you were refering to is a different UPC with a different price point. Unfortunately we currently have no stock of that product, and are unable to discount that merchandise line"

A"But it's the same product"

B"Not according to the system it's not, otherwise it would have the same barcode" The UPC has nothing to do with price matching as far as I know. I worked retail for a big US chain and to price match, all a customer had to **say** that there was another advertised price. You didn't even have to show the ad.  Yep. And they match model numbers not upcs So which big chain will let me walk out for a big screen tv I swore I saw at a competitors for a $1? In my experience with retail a lot of it is to the discretion of the cashier/manager. Of course if corporate notices a trend of just giving shit away then someone's getting fired. The only thing as a customer to know is the age-old saying: "The squeaky wheel gets the grease."





When I worked as cashier we had this guy who came it with stolen merchandise trying to get a refund for them (we knew it was stolen because another branch down the street called us to let us know that they were stolen). He just wouldn't let up. So eventually the manager just gave it to him to get him to shut up and outta the store.  Why didn't you call the cops on him?  [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] In Argentina (mostly Mercadolibre) they did the same. :/ Yup, not only ML though. I knew a guy who coded for Garbarino. They did the same the week before. That is supposed to be illegal, though, iirc It's illegal in the US too.

When the "rebajas" (sales) start you only get the same price it was a week before. 

And somehow you get [people like this](http://i.imgur.com/SGYOdTI.jpg) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/8j1LX1n.jpg) lining up and fighting for stuff you can really buy a week before for the same price.  This is pretty much black Friday in the US too. Lots of cheap (as in poor quality) crap and left overs from the warehouse discounted to the same price they were at 2 months ago before they started raising the price.  It's not legal in the U.S. either. It's illegal here too.  No. It's a federal crime i believe. &gt; Valve should punish the publishers who do this.

Like, don't put their games on sale. [deleted] Technically they could still make it work. Just raise the price in February when the post-Christmas rush should be completely over and everyone's hurting in the wallet. At least people will notice that their game is jacked up in price in advance, and it will hurt their sales for 3 months prior to the 1 month sale. &gt; people will notice that their game is jacked up in price in advance

Let's be honest, here... no they won't.

&gt; hurt their sales for 3 months

But that part's a good step forward!

...and I also don't see Steam doing this, because they might lose publishers.  That would hurt them a hell of a lot more than the 500 people who don't buy GTA V during the summer sale. Hurting sales numbers during the already slow time is something many companies wouldn't be willing to do. At some point, they may as well just sell their games for more always and only expect income during sales. In Ireland specifically you have to have the price at the regular price for a month before you can put it on sale and claim the price. It's not just false advertising its fraud. I think there's similar rulings in the Netherlands. Valve should punish them by NOT putting their games on sale. Nobody buys a thing if it isn't discounted during a steam sale, by NOT discounting those particular games who raised prices, you'd basically be fucking them over, which is exactly what they deserve. Valve gets money from it so i doubt they'd do a thing. It took them like 10 years plus some of the worst publicity that Steam has had since forever to offer us basic refunds on things that we buy. Wait? You can get a refund from Steam now? Yup with a few limitations, but they just added this revolutionary feature! Steam won't do a damned thing. It's took them 12 years to offer refunds that you didn't have go through an act of congress to get. And that refund policy still doesn't hit EU standards (although its close enough that the courts probably won't push them on it for a while yet) [deleted] Illegal in France too.  I would guess it's illegal E.U. wide. It would be interesting to have a couple (hundreds) of mail arrive in the inbox of those company siting the legal article relevant to this, as well as a couple of legal cases.

Unfortunately E.U. law isn't the easiest to navigate so only someone with some knowledge of it could do that (and post here the text so the masterrace can reuse it). simple solution really, any products that have received a price hike in the past 2 months are unsubmittable for sale status. They must instead be sold at full price for a period of 2 months and 15 days at which point they may be submitted for sale status at the publishers discretion.  

Fiddle around with the time limits but the rule itself would prevent this, it'd be raise your price in the sale or raise it 2 and 1/2 months before and see reduced sales during that time  We need more eyes on this.  In some countries there is an exception when the companies increase the base price permanently instead of only doing that during the sale. At least that was the logic used by the DayZ publishers since the game would be cheaper while on early stages of development compared to the final version. **/r/WarThunder mod here.**

Note that the items have not gone on sale yet (but they did after a price hike last year) so there's no real reason to complain yet.

edit: fun fact, folks. Gaijin just unlisted the Ace Pack that had been price-hiked, right after reddit made a fuss about it. https://steamdb.info/app/244390/history/
 Yeah...I love War Thunder, and the actual developers are really cool but the premium currency and marketing team should be fucking fired.  It's ridiculously cash-grab at times to the point where I don't WANT to give them money.  In fact, I'm at this point now, where I love the game itself and the developers but I just CANNOT justify giving them money when they pull shit like this.   Man I love this game, I just hate the way they have been continually making it more paybased.  The grind has become unreal and RP gain has slogged to a near halt depending what you are using.   I tried picking it up right before the switch to tier-based and that reaaaaaaalllllyyy put me off.

Then I played in the Ground Forces beta and it was fucking awesome. The Beta grind-rates were almost perfect(I could understand a 10-15% increase in grind-time) but then they heavily reduced RP income when it came out of beta to bring it inline with their current economy.

I don't have the time to grind it out so hard, and it just makes me want to play it less and less. Grinding is why I stopped playing WoT, in hopes Warthunder would be better. Guess we can't trust Russian devs at all. I feel the same way about Planetside 2. While recently it seems that patches having been coming through better and quicker (with a smaller team, dunno how), in general for the past 2 years there hasn't really been much content that merits paying money. Especially when they do psuedo-scummy cashgrab stuff.

It does have some gameplay ([roadkills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-BR-jALJ5o), [tactical rams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NBk7Qt_qko)) you can't find anywhere else, though. Is there any way, as a mod, that you can make this post at the top? Not in this subreddit, no. [You could pull this at me now](http://i.imgur.com/oGtKK2f.gif).

Luckily the information is spreading. My friend /u/justupvotethankyou posted about it in /r/gaming and the thread is at the top of /r/warthunder, so people are getting it. I'm not American, but it's also illegal in the US (not to mention many parts of the world):

&gt;(1) Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful.

&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/45

&amp;

&gt;Where the former price is genuine, the bargain being advertised is a true one. If, on the other hand, the former price being advertised is not bona fide but fictitiousfor example, where an artificial, inflated price was established for the purpose of enabling the subsequent offer of a large reductionthe bargain being advertised is a false one

&gt;http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;SID=e2e932122f3b2b73d1cd65963ae1a0a6&amp;ty=HTML&amp;h=L&amp;mc=true&amp;r=PART&amp;n=pt16.1.233#se16.1.233_11

&amp; JC Penny getting sued over this exact issue:

&gt;A federal judge certified a class-action lawsuit that accuses J.C. Penney Company Inc (JCP.N) of marking up retail prices on apparel and accessories to trick shoppers into believing they were getting big discounts when the items were advertised on sale.

&gt;http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0O421M20150519

TL;DR: Raising the price right before a sale makes the advertised discount false, which is deceptive pricing that essentially dupes your customers and is not just unethnical but **actually illegal** You have to wonder if these companies even attempted to get any legal advice prior to pulling off this shit.  In all probability, yes. And the legal advice was "it's illegal but no one's gonna sue you, so do it anyway." Yup.  Remember that laws are only "the law" when they are enforced.

Edit: Lawwwwww, Law Laaaaw, fuckin' [semantic satiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation) I peed on Delicate Arch, but it was legal because nobody saw. Either that or "you'll make more money then what the fine would be anyway". This is it right here. Companies don't go to jail, they just pay fines. Lawsuits and fines are just another part of the budget to them. That's why recalls only happen if they estimate a class action lawsuit would cost more to the company. 

I can't remember the specific car manufacturer off the top of my head, but I know I once read a news article about a company who knowingly sold cars with a defective part that ended up causing hundreds of people to die because they knew by the time a lawsuit would happen it would cost less than changing the manufacturing lineup.  The corvair, as famously targeted by Ralph Nader.  Even if they do get sued, it will be for damages.  Meaning, at worst, they'll have to refund the difference between their false price claim and the actual price paid.  If it's a class action, that means sending out tons of $8 checks most people won't cash. I think it's actually kind of murky. According to your second link

&gt;If the former price is the actual, bona fide price at which the article was offered to the public on a regular basis for a reasonably substantial period of time, it provides a legitimate basis for the advertising of a price comparison.

So if the companies are actually selling the product for the increased price (and they are, via steam), as long as they remain at that price for a "reasonably substantial period of time" then they're in the clear. You have to be able to *prove* that their intent is to deceive which is difficult. 

If the prices are raised only for a short time before the sale (which appears to be what's happening) *and then* fall back to their previously listed price shortly after the sale you'd probably have a case. Problem is, we still have to wait and see. It's possible that the price increases will be permanent following the sale, or at least will remain in place for a "reasonably substantial period of time".

It seems pretty obvious what's going on, it's just difficult to prove and relies on a somewhat subjective bit of language. It doesn't matter what they do after the sale period is complete. Raising your price immediately before a sale, and then advertising the new prices as a discount of the raised price is illegal in the US.

here is an example used by the FTC in their guide against Deceptive Pricing:

&gt;(c) The following is an example of a price comparison based on a fictitious former price. John Doe is a retailer of Brand X fountain pens, which cost him $5 each. His usual markup is 50 percent over cost; that is, his regular retail price is $7.50. In order subsequently to offer an unusual "bargain'', Doe begins offering Brand X at $10 per pen. He realizes that he will be able to sell no, or very few, pens at this inflated price. But he doesn't care, for he maintains that price for only a few days. Then he "cuts'' the price to its usual level -- $7.50 -- and advertises: "Terrific Bargain: X Pens, Were $10, Now Only $7.50!'' This is obviously a false claim. The advertised "bargain'' is not genuine. My question is if Valve would legally be considered at fault. In FTC's example, John Doe sets the prices. But AFAIK, Valve mostly leaves the pricing up to the publishers. So does Valve have the responsibility to police the publishers? I suspect that's a very complex legal question that wouldn't be solved quickly in a court of law.  Steam would probably have to be fairly complicit in allowing this behavior to the point of negligence.  If there's some smoking gun email that says "Hey, we noticed so-and-so is raising prices, but we're not going to do anything about it as a matter of policy," well, that makes the case much stronger. The lawyer answer is "sue them both, let the court figure out that answer" Look at that, a cogent, well-supported reply. Thank you. I'm a lawyer and I was thinking along these lines, but I didn't know the answer off the top of my head. Glad to have something reliable to read on this.
I will note this isn't a black-and-white issue. If the pre-sale price is an actual price the seller does use, it may be acceptable even if the product was on sale, then off sale shortly before the summer sale. Whereas, if the product was always one price, and then the price was raised just before the sale and then put back to the normal price for the "sale," that would fit the conduct described above. GTA V is only being sold with other stuff bundled in with it now, so that they can maintain the same price they had before. But now bundled with non existent multiplayer fundollars! 

EDIT: Looks like they added back the option to purchase GTA V alone, with no discount about an hour ago. Yea, really scummy. See here http://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/.

Valve needs to curb this kind of behavior. It's not 30% off when Rockstar can set the value of its in-game currency at any arbitrary number.

EDIT: It gets worse. As /u/icefall5 pointed out to me, this may interfere with Steam's refund system. If the cash card is redeemed, the bundle can't be refunded(and this action may be automatic, does anyone know?). With all the hackers in game currency is worth 0$ They really need to clean their shit up. I would actually rather have hackers dropping me bags of cash instead of spending 50 bucks to get the same amount of virtual money. So uh...where do these hackers dropping money bags exist?

^Asking ^^For ^^^A ^^^^Friend

-----

In all seriousness Rockstar's bullshit microtransaction shit just pisses me off. Why the hell do I have to grind out cash so hard? Makes no sense other than just a cash grab. It was worse when it came out for Xbox 360. Race would cost you $1,500 and you'd lose the money if it got ducked up. Those damn ducks dude get a trainer there is no reason not to anymore.

people who grinded money have had their cash wiped because of bs rockstar support and everyone is getting free money anyway.

Refusing to just accept the free money at this point isnt even noble its just hurting yourself for no reason Oh my god! That's disgusting! Hackers dropping bags of cash. Where! Where do they drop this cash? That's a 5 star reference Also possibly makes refunding the game through Steam impossible, since games/packs purchased that include consumable in-game items/currency are not refundable. Pretty scummy all around.

**EDIT:** Just to clarify, they're only nonrefundable if the consumable item/currency is consumed. Wow didn't know that. That is fucking horrible :| Fuck Rockstar. I saw that it was on sale so was immediately interested, this makes me not want to buy the game at all. If you don't want to discount your game, that's fine, it's worth $60, but to put it on "sale" like this is shady and I want nothing to do with it. They should have just listed it as "free stuff with purchase!"  Wouldn't have looked as shady and people probably wouldn't have gotten upset.
 Yeah I wouldn't have cared if it just wasn't on sale, and I was planning to get it even if it was just a token 5-10 bucks off, but this bait and switch crap is infuriating. They lost a sale here. I don't get it. Why don't they just... Not put it on sale? Because now it gets a "sale" spot on the front page. Free advertising (not that they even need it) without actually having to change the price at all. It'd be one thing if the game was still $60 and the cards were marketed as a free add in now, but showing the game itself on sale now is really misleading. Actually, 3 sale spots in the top 20, with 2 in the top 5.   
But I don't think their point was this one, the game is in the top 3 since release day without that, they just wanted to give a "significant" discount to show that they are participating in the Steam Summer Sale, but without reducing their income so much... and it's a success, in the front page you see -25% while it's just a -5%. They are selling each copy for just 5 less bucks, but they are also selling twice (or more ?) the amount of copies they sell on a regular day. I have to admit, it's beautiful how they can manipulate the market so easily, and with Valve's agreement apparently (as they allow that). [Seems to be working out for them. ](http://i.imgur.com/IwG8WzC.jpg?1)

Same game. In the top 10 sellers 3 times. 

What the fuck.  Removed from wish list. I hope that was the result they were looking for.  I moved mine to the bottom, being a 'patient gamer' instead of buying @ a true 30% off now I'll wait till it's a true 75% off.

Why? because fuck it, if I'm honest I've got dozens of games on back log and they are being shady so I won't reward that shit Same, fuck it. I'll just wait for Just Cause 3 instead. I'd like to chime in here and say that they do this shit on Xbox just about every other week. The "Deals With Gold" get updated weekly, and when nothing else is available, Microsoft defaults to "Let's put GTA 5 bundled with a Shark Card on sale!" That way it seems like you're getting a good deal (because it's still technically "on sale"), but you're really just paying normal price and getting some non-existent money. This was a pitiful move on Rockstar's behalf. I checked the Steam Sale and saw GTA for 22.50 and I actually thought they were the best company in the world, God I was so naive. Illegal in the US as well, [as JCPenny discovered.](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=06ed983e-ffbd-43ea-85a5-46977dad345e)

Relevant excerpt:

Under guidance provided by the Federal Trade Commission, when advertising a discount, the former price that is used as the basis for the discount must be the actual, bona fide price at which the product was offered to the public for a reasonably substantial period of time. In addition to FTC guidance, certain state consumer protection laws, including those in California, limit and define what may be advertised as the regular retail price. The JC Penny suit doesn't prove it's illegal until there is a ruling on it. They only recently certified the class meaning only that a class action suit can be brought, not that JC Penny lost. Whats funny everyone does this. Kohls does it and no one gives a shit. JC Penny didnt do so well when they tried to move to more transparent pricing either - the market punished them for it. Because the CEO told everyone it would take a while for things to adjust (I think he had a 5 year plan). The coupon clipping stay at home moms would stop spending as much (because they couldn't use "it's on sale!" as an excuse); the younger, hipper, internet-connected younger generation would latch on to the transparency and become a key market segment for JC Penny.

...well, the decline happens a lot faster than the growth -- shareholders freaked out after profits were low for a few quarters (exactly as the CEO said they would be), so they kicked him out before his plan could come to fruition and went back to the old "sales everyday!" model. It's sad because I was the target he was aiming for. What JCP sells is fine, the "sale" nonsense isn't. There are brands of clothes that literally always ring up the same price, every single time, but they're always "on sale" for X% so I have to double check the math to be sure they didn't up the real price. When they switched to proper listed prices I spent more there, then they went back and I stopped going there. Now I just go across the mall to H&amp;M where the price on the tag is the same at the register and a sale is a sale. There is literally no rack or shelf without a #% sign on it. That place SCREAMS scam. "Oh, 90% off and still $300 for this T-shirt? LOL"

FYI: Nobody in their right mind would believe the $300 price for a T-shirt. I was exaggerating. I didn't think it'd be so hard to catch, my bad.  300 dollars for a t shirt at khols? Did they open one in Dubai?  Khols mght always be "on sale" but the still have cheep stuff all over. Are you think of Bloomingdales, maybe?  Kohl's is a discount store, that's why everything is discounted.  I doubt you'll find anything there for $300 that isn't a leather jacket or
 jewelry.  In France they do worse things now, they make it sound like you're getting the usual products at a lower price but the clothes are just some low-quality junk manufactured only for the sales period.

It's forbidden too (if it has never been sold by your store before then it's not on sale so the "original price" is a lie and it misleads consumers who were waiting for some discounts to buy the original products) but eh, who cares, as long as you're not getting sued, it makes them much more profit. As suggested on the xpost in [/r/Steam](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/39ckjx/some_companies_are_raising_prices_on_their_steam/) by [/u/cunningmunki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/39ckjx/some_companies_are_raising_prices_on_their_steam/cs2swk9) the **UK Advertising Standards Authority** has sufficient remit to investigate in the case of rising prices prior to a sale.  
  
I called the ASA to confirm and was told this was the case. When the sale starts one could use isthereanydeal or similar to identify any developers using this practice and you would be within your rights to make a complaint using this [form.](https://www.asa.org.uk/Consumers/How-to-complain.aspx)  
 [deleted] GTA V http://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/

They've forced the game into bundles with cash cards of their in-game currency. It's "30% off" at $60.

EDIT: It gets worse. As /u/icefall5 pointed out to me, this may interfere with Steam's refund system. If the cash card is redeemed, the bundle can't be refunded(and this action may be automatic, does anyone know?). WTF, it looks like you can't even buy the base game without the shitty cards too? Yes exactly. They've shoehorned the cash cards for "extra value", probably to stay legal with the whole false advertising issue being discussed here. Looks like they changed it now. The base game is available at $60 I just saw that. Are you fucking kidding me, Rockstar? Greedy fucks. GTA V was the first game I checked. Ruined my day. I was legitimately thinking about buying it if it went on sale but...  It's not really a sale if it's the same damn price is it?... Same. Will not buy unless you can buy just the base game.

Play fair or go fuck yourselves, rockstar. This is extremely disappointing coming from a company like Rockstar. I always regarded them as among the best in the industry but it's clear that I was wrong. Time to add them to the "only buy used" list along with EA and Ubisoft. They also do this on Xbox One, when the game goes on sale. The solution is to use sites like http://isthereanydeal.com/ for a price history (including other stores) or http://enhancedsteam.com to get that information while browsing the steam store. Nah it needs to be a shame campaign. People need to be told to be pissed off. The good news is that people can do both of these things. I use http://steamsales.rhekua.com/ , only works for Steam games but it's got a nice price and % off history for everything on there. I think we broke one... Domain expired for http://isthereanydeal.com Just in time the the sale, the horror.
 isthereanydeal doesn't seem to be working. http://isthereanydeal.com seems to have (temporary, hopefully) problems, you can use http://salenauts.com as an alternative, although I prefer the more straightforward design of itad. Also it looks like salenauts price history is much more limited than itad, you can only see current lowest price and historically lowest, nothing else, kinda bad in comparision to be honest. [deleted] GTA5 jacked up its price by adding "shark card" microtransactions bundled with the game.

Interestingly, for a minute after the sale launched, it was displayed at having 60% off. Couldn't grab it in time due to store page lagging. If you use the card in-game it becomes nonrefundable under the new Steam policy as well; in-game consumables render the whole package nonrefundable if they're consumed. I wish there was a way to blacklist publishers/developers on Steam, so that their games never appear for me anywhere. GTA V went from 40 to 51.98 just before the sale that's just scummy [Source] (https://steamdb.info/app/271590/)

Edit: yep, it's now '25%' off (38.98) this is fucking disgusting that they are allowed to do this, Rockstar can suck my cunting dick, fuck me! I'm a fucking student with little disposable income and I rely on this shitting Steam sale for games I can afford, what a load of bloody bullshit people are saying you can't even buy GTA V by itself on steam now. it's just bundled with cash cards and old games.  Its true. The game itself was $30 last time I saw it BUT you have to buy other stuff making it $60. which is worse in my opinion. rockstar knew they couldn't raise the price of the game so the just removed it and bundled it with some bullshit that costs them nothing and kept the price up.

edit: meant "couldn't raise" And then they complain about piracy... Seriously, I wanna pirate it now just so they can eat a dick. I doubt my computer can even play it.  And the cash cards mean you can't refund the game if you use them.  60 to 75 in tier 1 euro zone Yeah, in the US they bumped it to $85 so they can sell it "on sale" at $60.  They removed the game from the store, and replaced it with a bundle costing much more, and 30% off brings it down to the original price.

Fuck rockstar. I usually end up buying games I pirate, but I guess not GTA.  Which companies aside from the one example listed have raised prices prior to the Summer Sale?

I checked the linked thread in /r/Steam and there doesn't seem to be any other examples aside from one isolated case. Wolfenstein: The New Order definitely did it.  I took screenshots of price differences.  They jacked the price back up to $60 so they could drop it with a "50%" discount. Wolfenstein: The New Order did this as well. Was 40,99 for a long time, now it's gone back to 59,99 and has a 50% discount. I'm a little surprised Steam even allows them to do that stuff.  At the end of the day they have full control and can basically say like "you can't raise your base price X number of days before a sale or you can't sell your game on Steam."  But Valve is always behind the times on keeping up with these things.  All it would take is some legal action I suspect.  

Regardless, it is Gaijin, and from all accounts they seem to actively be trying to destroy any potential credibility they had as a developer in a systematic fashion.   AFAIK DayZ has had plans to incrementally raise the price until final release and the new price has been in place ever since the increase at the start of Winter Sale. Bohemia used a similar pricing model during ARMA 3's early access. The sale period was the last opportunity to get the game at the initially offered price.

Please don't confuse this statement as support for this practice, I'm just passing along information. It can't be support for this practice if it isn't the same practice. DayZ raised its price permanently, if any game does that now, it's still a sale.

The problem comes when people raise the price of their products right before a sale so the price stays the same, and then lower it again when the sale ends. By this tactic, the price never changes, but people are misleaded into buying an item "for sale" which in reality is the same price as ever. Well in many countries that's not accurate. The price needs to be at the raised price for a certain time period before a reduction can be legally called a sale or a discount. I think in the UK it's 28 days. Rockstar games is doing it for GTA V. It was $59.99 earlier. Now they have raised the price to $89.99 and showing a 30% off lol As many people have pointed out, this is illegal in many locales. I highly doubt any action will be taken against these companies on Steam. I guess Valve can feign ignorance as they are just a storefront, and the companies raising prices can just claim they are changing prices based on currency fluctuations or some other crap.  
  
Plus, is anyone even looking forward to buying anything in the Steam Summer Sale? I'm only tempted by GTA V, although it'll have to have a 50% or higher discount. Last sale I don't think I bought a single thing. Personally, I'm keeping my eyes on Pillars of Eternity. The game looks awesome, but $40 is quite a bit these days when I already have a backlog of hundreds of games waiting for me.  Just so you know, it is really, really good. And that's coming from someone who doesn't usually enjoy similar games (Baldurs Gate, etc etc.)

If you haven't played Wasteland 2 you'd probably dig that too. Its like one of these games but with X-com-esque tactical combat. The last year has been absolutely amazing for RPGs, so I'm looking at Divinity: Original Sin, Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland 2, and The Witcher 3.  Plus a handful of indie games that look interesting but not interesting enough for me to put more than $7 into, like Stranded Deep.

There's plenty of games to buy, really,  if the discounts are deep enough. https://www.steamprices.com/eu/app/271590/grand-theft-auto-v
They jacked up the EU price by 23% and are now claiming a 25% sale. The original price just hours ago was 59,99 and after the "sale" its at 55,48. Fuck them for being part of the problem. The sale started 4 min ago.  
GTAV $30

Edit: It was for a minute but now the price is ~85 w 30% off so its back to 59...  
Expect 30% off 60.
 It says 30% off NA steam but the starting price is $80~ because every way I can buy it is bundled with something I don't want. 

Seems like they are technically fallowing the law by making it a bundle no one trying to buy GTA V is trying to get Max Payne or San Andres and the shark cards is the kind of stuff for free to play games not brand new $60 games. Yeah, I was going to buy GTAV with a real discount. And looks like Rockstar doesn't want my money. Why is this post labeled False Info? Of course every large reddit thread will have some false information posted by different people. But the developers did raise prices before the sale.   


The label makes it look like the statement in the thread title is untrue. Why are the mods of /r/games supporting deceitful practices with their labeling of this thread? [deleted] why the fuck is this labelled as false info? this isnt false info. Firaxis and Beserk games (tabletop sim) are both innocent. The OP of that topic just puts whatever someone says in the comments without fact checking. All of these prices are tracked by different websites right? These developers must know they can't sneak it in, and they must know that it will be bad PR and possibly lose sales. They must think that the trade will turn up positive for them in the end. Well-informed consumers won't be taken in by this. But there are thousands, if not millions, of impulse buyers that will see a massive sales percentage on a game, figure out how expensive it would be normally, and grab it for that reason. Yes, and this is the point behind the regulations. Well informed shoppers may not fall for the deceptive sale tactic, but not everyone is or can be an informed shopper on all products. We need to just report them. I'm not sure where is best but I'm going to look into contacting the BBB here in the US. Report Steam and report the individual publishers/developers. These crooks will only get away with it if we let them. Im curious when does the sale start? In the UK its perfectly legal to do this providing its 30 days prior to the start of the sale as far as I am aware ( My bosses could have been lying to me )  Today, I believe. In that case fuck them. I wonder what the recourse is for raising this as an issue? Does it count as a UK marketplace?  [It seems the UK store has mostly unaffected](https://www.steamprices.com/uk/s/H4twLl?p=1). Only one of the packs has increased and by 1 Fuck Gaijin, they basically ruined both War Thunder and Star Conflict. I loved War Thunder 2 years ago and it could be an amazing game but I refuse to play it because of the monetization, the grind is horrible and the game has a lot of inexcusable problems. 

I hope Gaijin goes bankrupt and someone at least a bit smarter buys them. Hell even Wargaming looks like a bunch of philanthropists when compared to Gaijin, they could probably manage the game better.  We have threads dedicated to summer sales, right?

Let's find alternatives like GOG or Amazon if the price is lower. It's up to us.  Dude I was waiting for GTAV to go on sale and they raised their price 25% so they can put it on sale for 25% off .

seriously if they don't want to put their games on sale, then they shouldn't put it on sale and not be complete dicks about it Typical Rockstar...They're trying to milk the popularity of GTA V as much as they can. I don't expect a price drop on GTA V for a quite a while.

$60+ for a game that came out in 2013. GTA:V has tacked on a shark card with the game purchase making the 30% off "deal"  $59.99 USD. It also appears that you cannot purchase just the game. You have to buy the shark card too. I'm sorry you seem to be getting downvoted, this is a completely legitimate reason to worry and avoid those companies :/

e: well, it bounced back but at the time of me writing that it was at -x and posts on /r/Games rarely tend to bounce back. Glad this one did.

I was around for Gaijin's price gouging and it's what made me stop playing War Thunder, they have no idea how to run a proper business and feel the need to run it like some kind of shady scam. They're free to run their business however they want, but I'll take my money elsewhere. &gt; but I'll take my money elsewhere

Yep. There are MANY games out there that I want to play. If I find that a company is involved in this tactic, I simply won't buy the game. My time is already eaten up with The Witcher 3, and Batman will be coming out in a couple of weeks, so I'm not desperate to find games to fill the time.

I've got choices and I won't choose companies that use shady sales tactics.  [deleted] For me it was when they decided to reset all the stats long after the game had launched and I had spent a lot of money updating my crew skills. Pissed me right the fuck off. 

 the post on r/steam was deleted? Why not pressure Steam to designate the prices as "% off of release price"? That way, any subsequent price hikes will be designated as **+20%** or whatever, and that *really* won't look good. These companies are probably trying to compensate the fact that the majority of their sales happen during these promotional sales. But still, it's an unloyal practice, at best, that should be heavily frowned upon by the gaming community.

Most people now won't by a game unless it's on sale, and the gaming industry brougth this situation it upon theirselves by overusing these promotional sales and bundles and effectively reducing the perceived value of their products. Instead of resorting to shady practices like this to make money, they should instead work to change this whole situation. DayZ didn't do it for the Winter Sale - they changed their price permanently, but decided to put it on sale so that people could get the original price for a little while after the change. This is a big issue, don't go watering it down by not being sincere about what's happened. Just wanted to point out that if you check isthereanydeal.com, you can find GTA V for $45. On GMG there is a 20% off voucher which you can use for GTA V as well.  EDIT: thealienamongus is right. I'm an idiot.


[Duck game](http://store.steampowered.com/app/312530/) was $9.99 before the sale.

I still got it. But it's worth noting. Hahaha and it would appear sneaky Gaijin removed the offending item from its steam summer "sale" pack just before going live (5 hours ago). 

I suspect this kuffufle might have spurred that decision.

ETA: Link to SteamDB showing pack edits - https://steamdb.info/app/244390/history/ For anyone in Australia, if you have evidence of this in the form of screenshots for before/after, send it to the ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission) because this kind of thing is ACTUALLY ILLEGAL IN AUSRTRALIA, so send of some emails with evidence and get companies fined, because this shit is not ok. did Rockstar do this as well? I just noticed the original price for GTAV is 84.97 bucks which makes the 30 percent off down to just 59.98, thus making it just as expensive as buying it new.

I don't know the original price of what it was before, nor can I check the game out (Steam is on the fritz for me atm) but I highly doubt it was that expensive.  I noticed Grand Theft Auto V did this. They raised their price to $79.97 and then discounted it to, get this, $59.89, ten cents lower than the original price listed. I was planning on purchasing it sometime during the sale, but fuck them!

Edit: Apparently it is bundled with some bullshit Tiger Shark Cash Card? Who cares, Rockstar, you just lost a sale because of your gimmicky shit, I just want to play the game. Oh wow, go to hell rockstar. GTAV is now inseparable from "white shark cash card" so that conviently their "Sale" price is still 60$.  Congratulations marketers, now all of your hardcore fans are going to pirate all of your fucking games and you aren't going to get any money at all! :) and fuck you! :) Just uninstalled War Thunder. Didn't spend any money on it anyway. I have no interest in playing a game developed by a company who take advantage of the consumer. Grand Theft Auto V's price has jumped to $84.97.  After the -30% discount, it would be back to $59.89.  Screw you, Rockstar. [deleted] It is no different than ROCKSTAR saying 25% off GTAV only to make it the same price and add virtual cash. they then remove the ability to buy the single game,.  Maybe Steam could include a price history in their store pages. Hovering over the current price would show the last 12 months of price points. 

Would diminish developer's capacity to fool consumers in this way. In a world where legions of gamers reserve purchases of their games until The Next Steam Sale, I can't say I find it surprising that developers go for such tactics.  It's definitely a dishonest/disloyal sales tactic, but it produces results.  Certain department store retailers in the US (e.g. Kohl's) do this with their entire pricing structure, and it works like an absolute charm on most people.

Be vigilant, fellow sale-goers.  Don't be blinded by flashy sales percentages, and make sure you actually like the price tag before picking something up.   Steam just updated the page for GTAV, and it seems that you can now buy the game by itself, but it isn't discounted at all. Any game caught doing this should at the very least not be included in the sale, perhaps with a statement from valve as to why they're not in the sale. I can't understand how this does not breach the fair trading act http://www.comcom.govt.nz/fair-trading/fair-trading-act-fact-sheets/pricing/

GTAV for example has been out for what less than 2 months - and it was $89 for the longest time. Now its 87, down from $115. GTA did an even sneakier tactic by making the game unpurchaseable unless you buy various bundles that essentially make you buy the game at full price. [Final Fantasy VII Remake Trailer] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kznek1uNVsg) Play it first on playstation 4? Do you guys think this is coming to pc?  I guess they don't pick words randomly. I'd say I'm pretty sure it will! Let's hope! Haven't played this ever so this should be the chanve When the music came in, it gave me chills. I'm a 30 year old man and I feel like a nerdy kid again. It's awesome. Casey Loe, author of the Versus Books guide for FF7, [said it best](https://twitter.com/snowjew/status/610631393849151489) I think:

&gt;We 30-something nerds desperately trying to relive our formative years are GODS NOW. Tremble before us, game developers! I know Casey has done a bunch of stuff over his career, but I can only think of him as "That guy who appears on that annual podcast I listen to". 41 and  I feel like a nerdy recent college grad.  This game deserves the nostalgia, and the remake.   Not gonna lie, I got a little teary eyed. The whole thing was really overwhelming. First time in a long time I found myself sitting there in actual disbelief at what I was seeing. 30 year-olds checking in....

FF7 was my first RPG omg that music brings me back. An uncontrollable smile spread across my lips when the music came on. Just... wow. [deleted] The music in the video was from the Final Fantasy: Advent Children OST. Highly recommend it.

Give it a listen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IVFWFjc51U&amp;list=PL433478E1E6209DA7) That's just a rearrangement of the theme from [the intro to Final Fantasy 7, where you see Aeris and Midgar.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JujtlsiqZ-E&amp;t=50s) Track 3, Beyond the Wasteland, if anyone's wondering. I knew as soon as I saw the slide exactly what it was. If you've watched Advent Children you would've realised almost instantly. It looks identical, I can't wait. That music made me recognize it instantly. I knew what it was from the get go, but when I heard the first few notes of the opening I got chills like never before. I am so, so fucking pumped right now. It's in the game, too. I didn't realize it was in Advent Children at all, actually.

It's a weird little slide.

There's also a crashed F-14-ish jet in that junkyard town, that always weirded me out. Cid has to go through all that trouble to make an elaborate airship, but they clearly had 4th generation fighter technology at some point. I saw that shot of the road with Seventh Gate on it, and something clicked, and my brain went "That looks kind of like...No... that isn't-" and then saw the slide and was like "SECTOR FUCKING SIX!?"  Nothing says FF7 like giant metal pipes everywhere. And green Yep same here.  When I saw that slide I was fucken done. First the train, then the slide... The rest of Midgar looks pretty different though. Not a complaint, I was just expecting some kind of continuation and not a remake with the way the narrator was talking.

I guess it was like a Meta-Trailer. The narrator's talking about the Reunion. The star in the sky isn't the Meteor, he's referring to JENOVA coming to Earth. Reunion was a pretty major plot point in the back story of FF7 that wasn't explored super in depth, so I'm guessing they're planning on fleshing it out more in this remake I am pretty sure that the narrator was referring to the first game when he was talking about the star in the sky and that all of the narration was a sort of meta-trailer for the fact that they have been teasing releasing a remake for Final Fantasy 7 for so long and now they finally are I think that's what they intend for the audience to get from it, but I think in-game the monologue refers to what I said. Kind of a double entendre. I saw it but I've been hurt so many times by Square-Enix that I couldn't believe until the very last shot.... That narrators voice...sound way too familiar, who is that? Sounds like Jiraiya from Naruto yeah it sounds like David Lodge (Kenpachi, Jiraiya) Yah just figured it out, David Lodge. On his IMDB he played that character voice too. You nailed it. This is interesting. For a long time, Yoichi Wada insisted Well make a Final Fantasy VII remake once weve made a Final Fantasy game that exceeds the quality of FFVII.

I wonder if Square-Enix feels they've accomplished that goal with FFXV, or if they've given up on that goal. They gave up on that goal To be more precise, they've discovered a new more noble goal to strive for: Giant piles of cold, hard, cash. The Squenix 2016 financial goals meeting will just be a whiteboard with "Giant Scrooge McDuckian Vault" written on it. I don't think they gave up on that goal at all. Final Fantasy XV has shown them that people are FINALLY interested in another Final Fantasy game (this is coming from someone who actually adores the XIII series). Final Fantasy VII is to show how much progress the series has made over the years. 

Final Fantasy XV is the experiment - it's why they're so keen on listening to fans about how the game works. It's not just XV that's changing to what the fans want. I'd definitely say that the feedback they're getting for XV is changing how VII Remake and KH3 are being developed.

A bit off topic in terms of VII, but I'd like to think they're considering doing the same with Final Fantasy X. I know not as many people love it, but they really seem to be behind the lore of X. There was always a crazy fan theory (which was sorta confirmed by Square, I think) that VII and X were connected, so maybe they'll explore that?  If I may, I don't think you can give FFXV full credit for revitalizing interest in Final Fantasy.

I think that honor goes to Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. It *cannot* be overstated how much SE took a former steaming pile of shit, and remade it into something that wasn't just good, but blew it out of the fucking park. I originally played on good word of mouth and had low expectations, but after just a few hours I was pretty much playing with my jaw hanging wide-open. XV has a lot of hype, no doubt, but A Realm Reborn did a ton in restoring faith in the franchise. 

Hm, I wonder if they consider ARR to be the game that 'exceeds the quality of FFVII.' Its subjective of course, but ARR could easily be considered a candidate for such. A fucking FF7 remake is the Halflife3-sized white whale of the JRPG genre and its blowing my fucking mind that it is actually being done. Those goddamn japanese trolls have been repeatedly, *repeatedly* saying that they *WILL* not be remaking the game. Too much work they said. 


Then they go and drop this shit. Hell hath frozen and Square is doing pirouettes on the lake. With their new design philosophies and then this, it is so refreshing to see a japanese dev actually LISTEN to what fans have been begging from them.

Now FF15 just needs to deliver, and Square will have officially got their groove back.  Imagine a Chrono Trigger remake with this kind of graphics. The Xenogears sequel would be awesome!  But that is very much unlikely...Tetsuya Takahashi probably wouldn't even be interested anymore. I just want them to flesh out the last disc of the first one. Yes.  That and FF6 next please. Please let them do 6 and finish out the storylines they didn't complete. 

I would love to see Chrono Trigger, they had so much in that game they could make look gorgeous in today's graphics.  I'm sure there is, but they did such a phenomenal job with the sprite work in that game, I almost feel like it would be a shame to revisit it and not keep the original graphics. At least with FF7 you can argue that they actually were being constrained by the console limitations of the time and forced to use incredibly low poly meshes, low res textures, etc. but with Chrono they fucking *owned* the fact that it was a 16-bit sprite-based game instead of chafing against its limitations. Agreed. I think Chrono Trigger's graphics holds up better than FF7's. It looks better because, as you said, it worked within the limitations rather than trying to force something that just couldn't happen, as it seems they did with FF7 (though 3D JRPGs were still a relatively new thing, so). 

FF9 and Chrono Cross even still look semi-decent because Square figured out how to work with the graphical confines of the PS1, but they were still getting their bearings when developing FF7. That is why it probably needs a graphical remake more than pretty much any other game in the main series.  ...That said, FF9/Chrono Cross Remakes would be absolutely glorious to see at some point. Chrono Trigger doesn't need a remake. It's the culmination of a 2d RPG.

Final Fantasy VII needs a remake. It's a good game hampered by first-generation 3d and a garbage localization. A visually updated 6 would be amazing, I still play through it about every two years.  [deleted] I'd rather they remake some the other ps1 ones. Chrono Trigger has aged very well, the sprites still look beautiful. FF8, when I played a little while ago, was... uh, not so beautiful. Chrono Cross remake is what we really need. It's a fantastic game but I hasn't aged nearly as well as Chrono Trigger. Plus nowhere near as many people have played it.  C'mon gimme Xenogears remake. I recognized the playground the kids were playing on and then the music started kicking in, oh my god. So fucking hyped for this Is that Marlene?? MARLENE...:( Can you imagine fighting Emerald and Ruby weapon now!!!#??!?! Man the highway sign read "To Sector 7" and I lost it It says Seventh Gate. The squiggles before the trailer were greenish blue and I knew.  Well between this and The Last Guardian I gotta say Hell has officially frozen over. I need to go change my pants.  Horizon out of fucking nowhere. Yeah. Robo-turok looks fucking awesome.  I hope Robo-Turok sticks as it's fan name. Yes, yes it did.  That was the most interesting reveal of the entire conference. Looks very interesting. I'm just waiting for the Half Life 3 announcement now. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Call of Duty is now favoriting Playstation instead of Xbox now.


So you are totally right. Hell looks colder than a whitewalkers heart right now Not that surprised. Activision doesn't seem to have much a stake in either console, the consoles have a stake in Activision. Sony probably paid out the ass for that contract, plus they have more consoles sold. Activision had no reason to stay with Xbox.  Well, Playstation did handle Destiny pretty well. The Last Guardian, Horizon, and now this...? I'm so fucking excited. SHENMUE 3333333 And now Shenmue. Sony seemed to have figured out how to resurrect the dead. Just had to kill us all. Has anybody seen my shit? I seem to have lost all of my shit. FF7 remade in FF15 graphics. I could cry right now. My childhood dreams completely re-imagined in SE's beautiful new engine. No gameplay shown yet. Might be some at SE's conference later. Well fingers crossed. Though I bet the trailer is all we get for a while. It was enough to raise the roof. Seriously when they showed that thing, the crowd went *wild*. It's trending nationally on twitter. Sony's rocking this conference.

I'd be surprised if it used the FF15 engine and not the FF13 one, but FF15 *has* been in development forever. I'd be surprised if the opposite was true. Why wouldn't they use the FFXV engine?

Plus, development of this FF7 remake either hasn't started yet or hasn't been going on for very long. There's no way they're not using the FFXV engine. It really depends on when they started development. You can never tell with announcements like this. I really hope it is a "remake" and not a "reimagining", gameplay-wise. There are certainly a lot of gameplay improvements which can be made.  As long as they leave it turn based combat I think it can pretty much only improve. don fucking touch materias too... i love materias ): Already getting a piece of paper to keep track of who has what. Because fuck Yuffie. I'm open to them improving the Materia system. I hope they don't change the gameplay, personally.  I loved the materia/turn based gameplay of FFVII. I can't wait for the Honeybee Inn sequence in glorious HD. I'll laugh if they do a graphical update, but nothing else. Everything else is exactly the same: the game menus, the hand cursor, the MIDI soundtrack.

Double points if they stick to chibi models in the world map and full size models in battle. so is this why tetsuya nomura dropped out of directing ff15? Isn't he also the KH3 director? I worry that he's being spread too thin on the ground. I'm pretty sure KH3 is an elaborate ruse for corporate funded vacations.

*Sob* Wait until tomorrow at least. After Square's conference. Work on XV started something like 10 years ago, when it was VS XIII. He didn't drop out, he was forced out. They want him on a project where he can move forward and make money, not just flounder around. He stopped working on XV so that he could focus on Kingdom Hearts III. WHAT?! Put this at the top of my "never expected" list I likes the voice over, the promise has been kept. They knew! They promised to never remake it? HOLY SHIT! Square Enix actually did something their fans wanted! Anything can happen at this point! Mother 3! Portal 3! HALF LIFE 3!!! Cats and dogs, living together!

MASS HYSTERIA!!!! It's happening? Holy shit. Everyone to the happening bunker! WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING WITH THIS YEARS E3???? I HAVE NO MORE CLEAN PANTS IN THE HOUSE AND THE DOG IS STARTING TO LOOK AT ME FUNNY New consoles are finally getting their groove. Competition is fierce. There's still room for HL3 The world would implode... Do you want that before we get to play these games? If this happens I am blaming you...  Only ''Play it first'' on PS4

There's hope for PC! It might be for everything. But seeing as they didn't say "console exclusive" like they did with the other FF, it'll likely be Xbox. They do seem to pick their words very carefully when it comes to these things - I suspect if they could have said console exclusive they would have, so I'm quite optimistic for a Xbox one version.  I just hope for a PC version. Even if it's something like a year late. Better late than never. 

Also glad to see PC games are popping up everywhere, and this years E3 seems to be a lot less "Exclusive Console wars" and a lot more about the games and the developers. It's definitely coming to Xbox, but PC is almost a certainty as well. Type-0 HD on PC is confirmed, Squeenix has been giving PC a lot of love in the last few years, and they've been selling a lot as well, so there is no doubt in my mind that it's coming to PC. Especially with the success of FF7 on steam. I can't wait to see some gameplay  If the leak is true, you'll be waiting a while. Leak that called it a few hours ago said that they only started working on it a few months back.  SE has been releasing everything on PC recently. It's been a very good platform to them on a financial level ever since they received a nice financial turnaround from FFXIV on pc a few years back. They really haven't looked twice at doing it since. 
 I sure hope they get Nobuo Uematsu involved in the soundtrack; it wouldn't be the same game without his touch. This was my white whale. My joke of a game request.  When I sleep tonigt, it is super fucked up to me that my dreams wont be as surprising and as whimsical as what happened here today.  Like seriously. I am losing mind.  I made a bet with a friend that this was gonna be announced and the terms were loser buyers the winner MGSV. I wasn't expecting to win, I just thought I'd get him a gift. This is so great. Shocked, absolutely shocked. Didn't think anything would be as big of news as Fallout 4, but this may be up there. Like wow. I thought they valued the asset of ffvii enough where they wouldn't risk it's value in a remake (its potential value being more than what it may make). Insane. This is a great E3 this year so far.

I just hope they keep to some sort of schedule, how long ffxv has been in the making is a bit concerning. &gt;Did't think anything would be as big of news as Fallout 4

I know right? After I saw Fallout 4, NOTHING came close to it, I was done at that point. Then the trailer happened... Fallout 4 isn't even registering on my radar right now. Seriously. If they announce a new Red Dead game, my brain is going to stop functioning from this e3. Everyone's just hitting all the right notes.

 I only watched this year for Fallout 4, wasn't expecting much else,  man am I surprised. The happiest I've ever been to be so wrong.  Here's hoping they don't butcher the plot and characters.  Rememeber folks, Cloud was never emo in FF7, he was a puckish rogue with anger issues.   And an indentity crisis. that's an understatement This is what I'm most afraid of, especially with Nomura (director of the terrible Advent Children movie) directing the game.

At least the original director is acting as producer, so hopefully he'll keep the angst levels low. I really don't think I can stand an FF7 remake with Cloud being remade to fit his AC personality. People misremember Cloud as being as bad as Squall, but Cloud had actual leadership qualities. He gave speeches to improve morale, he said goofy things like "Let's mosey." and he wasn't afraid to dress up like a lady to infiltrate an old pervert's lair.

I also hope they don't lose the little bits of character and personality that are littered throughout 7, I can't imagine the game without the goofy crossdressing sequence, or Red XIII dressed as a Sailor. That kind of nonsense kept the game lighthearted and enjoyable, for me at least.  Yeah, hopefully the game doesn't take itself too seriously. There's plenty of room for drama with moments of levity sprinkled throughout.  Even Squall [isn't actually as bad as the Squall in the localisation we got](http://fyeahffviii.tumblr.com/post/72672083380/squall-whatever-leonhart).

But yeah, my stance on the remake has always been that fans better be prepared, because it probably will be nothing like the FF7 they remember. Is it weird that I'm nearly in tears? Cry with me, brother. It's glorious.  Me too pal, me too. FF7 is still my #1 absolute favorite game of all time, I was making dinner and a buddy sent me a bunch of Steam spam, so I was like what, he says "FF7 remake is real, just had a trailer", I said "That's not fuckin funny". Then bam.

I'm speechless. I forgive whatever dumb shit you've done for the past decade, Squeenix. Just make it the same game, but prettier. That's all I want, I'll buy a fucking PS4 for it if it's exclusive, don't care. &gt; I'll buy a fucking PS4 for it if it's exclusive, don't care.

they know.  I literally was just telling myself that this might be the only reason I buy a PS4. I'm just going back to when they dropped that ps3 tech demo with ff7 and REMAKE has been a running joke for the past years, and it's actually happening wtf When that music hit my eyes definitely watered &amp; I got goosebumps all over. The seemingly impossible was presented to us.  Not going to lie, i teared up a little.  Grown man in tears of excitement. I lost an octave in my voice. FUUCCCKKK ME.  Good luck to you all in snagging a FF 7 themed PS4 - cause I know I will stand in any line for weeks to land one. Cause you know it is coming Half - Life 3 has to come now surely?? At PC show tomorrow? It would be the pants-creamiest E3 in history. Valve isn't listed as an exhibitor, though, so....

I guess that doesn't really mean anything, though!
 that just makes it a bigger surprise. They're not listed as a presenter on the PC gaming area, either. 

But the facts point towards SOMETHING regarding Source 2...

On the "Dota Reborn" page, they go "New Interface, New Engine, New Ways to Play", in that order, multiple times. The first page was "new interface", so it stands to reason that the next thing would be "New Engine." Plus, there's 3 pages.

Yet, on the website, it says that the next thing is custom gamemodes coming next week? Where's "New Engine"?
 I have to wonder if Valve employees are encouraged to reference the number 3 and / or make vague HL3 jokes everywhere. That, or a Pokmon MMO I don't think my child like 40 year old heart could take that today There's a chance. Anyone else thinks it played out like they were announcing some sort of sequel? all that talk about the calm after the star nearly destroyed them and then talking about a reunion and seeing Barrett (probably the narrator)_ and Cloud in midgar?  I'm almost wondering if that was meant to be a meta narration,  referring not to people in the game world remembering, but to the players. It seemed to fit pretty well with that, I thought. I thought it fit so well to the players that I assumed it was about us by default, not the characters. The reunion is us getting to play FF7 again, while also talking about the actual story.  The "star" is *meteor* (the one jenova came in on), the "reunion" is, well, the reunion. The star referenced in the narration isn't the same Meteor that is summoned by Sephiroth, but rather the first meteor that Jenova arrived to the world on when the Ancients first encountered her. Others below have already noted that the discussion of Reunion specifically refers to Hojo's Reunion Theory--which we saw happen when everyone reaches the Great North Crater where Sephiroth is. yeah I got the sequel-y vibe as well. but it said remake at the end? Coming first to PS4? Think it's possible for a multiplatform release? I sure hope so. They wouldn't phrase it that way if it wasn't multiplatform. That and FF7's a guaranteed money-printer, Sony would have to pay out the nose to get it as an exclusive. &gt; FF7's a guaranteed money-printer

It really is, but you got to admit it would be hilarious if the remake didn't even break even. (Since that was the reason Squeenix was always quoting on why they wouldn't make it. Gamers always INSISTED it would be popular enough. Better not drop the ball on this one people.) If they had said it was PS4 exclusive, it would have been the one thing that would have gotten me to buy a PS4. Everything past that would be gravy. I think they'll be fine. Seems to be a timed exclusive from how they worded it.  [deleted] [deleted] I said it in some other thread but ff7 was a game where a lot of silly things happened, if they go with the advent children art style then most of that (if not all of it) will have to be thrown out because it simply wont work with a realistic style. I hope it isn't just advent children 'the game', but that's what I expect. [deleted] Anyone remember that FFVII announcement last year? Change of Heart maybe? or maybe an elaborate plan? Gauging public interest probably... Incoming internet explosion.

I'll be buying a PS4 this winter. [deleted] Remake the game, but don't use any of today's strange ass Final Fantasy combat systems.  Give me that old school turn based game play, and stay away from the story, and I will be a very happy man. I want turn based, for sure, but a slightly updated and improved combat and materia system would be welcome. Don't go too overboard on the grindiness and make the materia system strategic and fun to customise and I'll be happy. The transcript for whoever wants it:

"Long ago, we looked upon a foreboding sky.  The memory of the star that threatened all, burns eternal in our hearts.  In its wake, came an age of silence.  Yet with each fond remembrance, we knew: those encountered were not forgotten.  That someday, we would see them again.  Perhaps it was no more than wishful thinking.  But after the long calm, there are now the beginnings of a stir.  The reunion at hand may bring joy, it may bring fear.  But let us embrace, whatever it brings.  For they are coming back.  At last, the promise has been made." YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSS! 

My skype chat is going so ham right now. "First to playstation 4" , so they arent ruling out PC?

 I don't know about others, but... I can now die a happy man. FF7 was my first FF and I beat it 5 times. I can't wait for this... especially with a non-fucked up translation lol Completely, utterly shocked. FF7 being my second favorite FF (and top 10 favorite games EVER made) I'm so hyped for this. I'm more hyped for this than actual new games coming out. PLS BE WELL DONE!! I've waiting for this for a long time!!!! =') so happy!! Maybe I'm wrong, it is just a trailer yet, but I can't imagine that Red XIII dressed as a Soldier/Sailor will be a thing in this remake. Or the Honey Bee Inn scenes, nor Cloud doing knee bends (squats?) against Big Bro (and there are a lot more of scenes like this in FF7). Will they cut those scenes out or replace them? That would kill a lot of the original charm for me. Also for me Square wasn't doing a good job when it comes to RPGs (especially the Final Fantasy games) these days. I'm actually not that happy about the announcement. But when it's bad, I will just ignore its existence, like I did before...  I totally agree.  There is a lot of cheese in the game, simply due to the era it was made in, and there's no way it will translate well to the realistic Advent Children portrayal of the characters.  How about the play in the Gold Saucer?  Can you imagine reticent SOLDIER Cloud twirling like a ballerina with the other actors at the end?

A friend of mine said it well.  If you're going to do a remake of the game, you have to honor the things that made it great in the first place.  The anime style was a core part of the game and contributed hugely to the feel of the original. Noticed he only said "first" on Playstation 4. Multi-platform release confirmed? Likely a PC release in the works as well seeing as most of the FF games are being released on it as well. I'm excited for Final Fantasy fans, but keep in mind that Square Enix has been extremely slow at releasing FF games lately. Final Fantasy Versus 13 (aka Final Fantasy 15) still isn't out, and we still don't have any info on Kingdom Hearts 3 since it was announced last year.

My prediction: Final Fantasy 7 Remake will come out five years from now. Possibly more. So I'm not very familiar with Final Fantasy, what do they do when they remake a title? are they going to revamp the combat system? Or only change and upgrade the visuals? They've never really remade a game like this before, which is why it's so unexpected. It looks like it's being done from the ground up. No remake has been like this but previously just better graphics and VO Well, people loved FFVII. It was pretty revolutionary for the time, but came out early in the Playstation's life and it hasn't aged too gracefully. 

Before the Playstation 3 came out, Square Enix put together a tech demo showing off what they believed Final Fantasy VII would look like running on the new hardware. 

While they denied it, everyone assumed they were working on a remake... but they weren't. 

After that, people wouldn't shut up about it.

And here we are.  Well this is what it looks like now:

http://store.steampowered.com/app/39140/

Now compare it to that trailer As excited as I am, I can understand why they've been so hesitant to make this game for so long. There is simply no way, no possible way, it can live up to the unbelievable levels of hype around it. No matter how good of a job they do, all they'll ever hear is how shit this game is once it does come out. I dearly hope I'm wrong, but damn do they have their work cut out for them "Listen guys, I know Jesus was great and everything but let me just have a shot at Jesus pt II, I swear I can do better"

-God I thought it was going to be a bullshit live action trailer after the first few seconds, but then I realized that it was actually CG. They didn't really use much of the iconic imagery, but it still looked like Midgar. It was perfect.

Based on the teaser I expect a very different game from the original, but a game that will be equally as powerful and timeless. Midgar's upgrade made me confident this game will be treated with all of the love it deserves.

I don't know what else to say. I couldn't be more excited. I have been waiting for this since Advent Children was announced. I'm surprised Playstation didn't make square keep this secret until the live event.

10/10 can't wait. I will pay $120 for this game if I have to. This is the first time I've ever been genuinely excited about a remake. They're often just unnecessary nostalgia driven cash grabs, but this is the one game that totally deserves one.  I can't say anything... literally. I never knew a a real RPG till this game. This game showed me a FF game for the first time. I literally owe FFVII my gaming  past super nintindo. It was to me the greatest game of all time. Without FFVII I would not be the gamer I am today. I will be buying a ps4 this weekend just for this game.  I am 32 years old now but thank you sooo much for revisiting this game. This was the game that made me a gamer. Anyone think the remake should be Rated M?
I can not imagine an HD remake of The Wall Market, Shinra HQ, Barret's $@#*%, etc etc to have the same effect with acting and voice acting, and still be rated Teen. 
I think the only reason FF7 was Teen was because everything looked comically "cartoony". 
What do you guys think? This is a mufti-Platform title. They said play it first on playstation, which means it is also coming to Xbox one and possibly PC? Really hoping for PC. I dumped my money into a gaming rig, I can't justify shelling out another $400 for a PS4. I know that feeling, I finally finished upgrading mine. But I think it will come to PC, otherwise they are leaving easy money on the table. I was like, is this Midgar? Naww nawwwwwwwww.

.. I cant believe it. PS4 just won at life Interestingly, they said coming "first" to PS4. Meaning It may end up on pc as well,which is cool I saw the kid on the slide and I **knew** it was Midgar. Shed a happy tear :')  Its most likely coming out to PC and X1. I have not been this excited for a game since I was 9 years old, when my mom bought me Sonic 3. Seeing that slide and the reflection of the Life Stream in the child's eye. I knew. I knew right then and there that something from my early teenage years was coming back.

Seeing "remake" on the screen...I don't think I have ever squealed in my life. Assuming they've already been working on it for a while, I could see it as an anniversary release in 2 years. However.. others here have made a good point, about how slowly the games have been coming out, lately.

I am beyond excited, though. No shame. I know Final Fantasy 6 was great, and a lot of people want that one to get a remake, but *personally* 7 is the greatest for me. It was my first ever RPG. The first game I played that had any sort of real story, and characters to fall in love with. 

So, I'm stoked. Ecstatic. I will buy a ps4, just for this game (although I definitely won't be getting a limited edition ff7 ps4, because.. well it will take me a few years just to be able to afford a *used* ps4, eesh) I am anxious to see how they actually pull this off. I said it in the rumor thread that popped up a couple hours ago, there's so much of that game that just can't WORK in the full serious HD Final Fantasy tone that Square does nowadays. I'll love to see how they change it, or pull it off. FINALLY. Words can not describe how excited I am right now...

That buster sword... Will I be able to cancel spell animations so I don't have to sit through like, 8 KotR sequences?  

Otherwise, I guess I'll always have my sandwich-protocol. I give it a second trailer at the 2016 E3, some game footage at 2017 E3, then they go quiet for several years while telling us that they're still working on it. Be still, my beating heart.

Literally the first RPG I ever got completely *absorbed* by, all those years ago. It makes me a little nervous though, it's like I'm afraid to see the shining rose-tinted jewel in my mind be tarnished in any way. I, like many others, grew up with this game and hold it very dear to my heart. I don't want to see it done poorly or in a way that is untrue to the original.

That being said though, oh dear am I ever excited. Anybody else hope they tack on some additional content, like Before Crisis, Crisis Core or a playable version of Advent Children? [deleted] HOLY FUCKIN SHIT.

I never thought it would happen.

And there seems to be a lot of new scenes.

I am so fucking excited. How big will this game be? How much new stuff will they add? New content bosses, whats the fighting like? I have so many questions. I know the game is far from perfect but it's what got me into RPGs. I am so unbelievably hype. When the music played from the opening I fucking shouted. SO HYPE. Interesting that we saw what appeared to be much in-game footage, or definitely in-engine, of before the nuclear detonations. Will a sequence be playable in The Before or anything? Would be an interesting prologue -- running to the vaults and surviving the event.

e: I am less interested in the graphics (models, textures, effects etc) as I am in better animations. I have always felt Bethesda games to be incredibly stiff.

e2: The soundtrack on 1:56 goosebumps *Van Buren*, the proto-*Fallout 3*, opened with your character's ancestor evacuating to a Vault before the bombs dropped, and featured your first look at the US Army in power armour. From the looks of things, they're drawing their inspiration from that. 

[There's a LP of *Van Buren*'s intro here for the interested.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqfMfYnILE4) It would also make all these skeletons you find provoke a lot more powerful reaction. Maybe see the town you fled through again as destroyed ruins? The games are supposed to take place 200 years after the bombs dropped, so I would hope you don't... Same world, same player, but playing different character. You'd be not playing the main character in the prologue.

And given that after 20 years there shouldn't even be many unexplored ruins to begin with, well that's a liberty of unrealism all fallout games have taken ever since. Unless Vault 111 is Cryogenic Freezing. Then you can be both! That's... actually a great idea.  [deleted] Can you mark that as a spoiler? &gt; The games are supposed to take place 200 years after the bombs dropped, so I would hope you don't...

Cryo pods. The first game was only 84 years after the war. yeah that would be pretty cool If there is going to be a playable sequence during The Before it won't be from the perspective of the main character . It would have to  pull a vault 101 again (extended lock down in the vault) in order for the formation of the new cities to make sense. 

 Cryogenics was the theory I heard.  that makes a lot of sense. It gives the character a good reason to see the event as well as telling us what the vault experiment was.  And they could very easily pull that off seeing how there are ZERO references to Vault 111 in existing lore! Though Vault 112 is explored in FO3 as the last vault built. Assuming the vaults are chronological in their assignments, and the fact that Vault 112 was a simulator that had cryogenics, Vault 111 could be speculated that it was another cryogenic experiment, but without the simulation. Well holy shit. I'm fucking ready.  There's 122 vaults across America plus more private ones for the rich an powerful.  I remember reading somewhere that the vaults on the west cost were lower numbered, and on the east cost were higher numbered. [deleted] So it's definitely taking place in Boston. You can see Paul Revere statue and the golden dome of the state house.  And I saw what looked like the USS Constitution with rocket boosters or something. Yes, I didn't put it on the list because I guess it can be some other tall ship, but it's must USS Constitution. I read this as the literal Constitution flying around on rocket boosters I did too and had the most radical mental image. Alternate timeline Scollay Square too instead of Government Center (SS was demolished in the 60s)! It's the little details... That's brilliant.

edit: [Holy shit that's kinda cool.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scollay_Square) Does that mean our character will have a voice now? 

Also, all in game footage. Can't wait for more. I loved the trailer, switching between before and after nuclear war Yeah, thats what I am thinking aswell. Why else would they put that part in. It seriously feels like the character will speak now. Or its just to show that there will be dog companion. Or that he is not the main character and is a vault dweller NPC that you probably interact with. Yeah, but that guy is the iconic loan wanderer you start out with. The varmit rifle, and vault suit is so iconic to starting players. The reason they did not show his face either is because that is gonna be your character, and you decide how he looks. They do reveal half of his face, so I am not sure on it. All speculation at this point really. They're probably doing the Saints Row The Third thing where they show the cutscene set up with the default male character as a place holder. Same thing with the Mass Effect 3 trailer. Or all the Mass Effect trailers really. [deleted] They did show his face.  And maybe we aren't the same character anymore.  We could be the person always overshadowed by the vault dweller-hero. Maybe we're just a guard who stands at the door and says "Whaaat?" everytime someone presses E They showed a male tho.

New vegas managed their trailer without showing the sex. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Skyrim advertised heavily with a male Dragonborn, wouldn't be out of the question at all for this to be the PC. I think that's true for all these kind of games. I think the only ones that didn't was Mass Effect 3, with Femshep trailer, and Dragon Age Inquisition, which jumped around different varieties of Inquisitors, but mostly showed a male human warrior for the ads and their final CG trailer. A male nord at that. That's ten times less variety representation  Think of all the diversity points they lost... Technically, you have a voice in skyrim, too. Would you like a chocolate milkshake with your meal, Dragonborn?

Ummm, like, fus roh DUH. I think they wanted to make it obvious that the player character was going to be a vault dweller, which meant showing him/her in a vault suit. &gt; Does that mean our character will have a voice now?

Maybe, or it might be more to the extent that Master Chief had a voice, which I'd be totally okay with.  You don't regularly have conversations with npc's in halo though, let alone ones that give you branching options. If Master Chief speaks, his line is already pre-determined, and you're basically going to have heard all of his voiceovers after playing through the story straight through once.

In fallout, there are entire quest lines that are directly affected by your dialogue choices, which affect your other quest lines. 

I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm just saying that it's easier to have a script for a linear game where the main character doesn't have to talk too much (since things kinda just happen around him anyway), as opposed to a script for a game where the main character is directly in charge of where the story goes but also doesn't talk much, for some reason.  Mad Effect did a pretty good job yeah, or it's just added for trailer. They do that stuff sometimes :P we have no idea how 'late' in development the game is. But judging from the trailer it's pretty far in :D I don't mind voices, as long as it doesn't limit the amount of dialogue available.   It obviously will to some extent. Could pose some challenges when it comes to the player choosing to play a psychopath, or a super low intelligence character. [deleted] Sounds like it's totally Troy Baker too. Love his voice :) Absolutely Troy Baker. The guy is *everywhere* I saw this comment and thought "I wonder what other video games he's in."  Turns out he's in [every video game, ever.](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1684869/) Troy Baker is perfection. I wonder who voices the female protagonist... I hope there is one, at least.  Troy Baker will also be voicing the female protagonist. Probably Jennifer Hale. [deleted] [deleted] I hope not. That could mean you'd have to play a Commander Shepherd equivalent instead of any character you want. Game looks like it is going to have bright colours,  I'm grateful for that. And that Dog is going to bring some emotional moments,  I can tell.  I dunno about the dog. I know Fallout 3 advertised heavily with a dog, heavily referencing the novella 'A Boy and His Dog'. However, it was very easy to never encounter Dogmeat in the entire game.  When I played I didn't even know there was a dog. haha yeah i didn't even find dogmeat or the junkyard until i was 3/4 of the way through the game. kinda strange how easy it was to miss companions. On my first playthrough I didn't even know about companions.  I didn't meet Fawkes until the next to last mission, which was weird because when you first meet him the whole point of his initial usefulness is that you can send him into an irradiated room on your behalf, but then in the last mission (mind you, the very next mission for me), you couldn't do the same. Yup. He gives some bullshit answer like "this is your destiny."

Oh? It's my destiny to die when you could just waltz in there and not feel a thing? Dick. Wait really? I sent Fawkes in there before but the thing that happens is you tell Fawkes the password and he just forgets it causing the reactor to explode. Maybe you needed the broken steel expansion but i remember being like "Oh wow i had no idea i could survive if i just sent Fawkes in" turns out you "die" anyway. I never encountered him naturally playing.  I had to hunt his ass down after i found out he was actually a thing. &gt;referencing the novella 'A Boy and His Dog'

I always thought is was a Mad Max 2 reference. It was a Road Warrior reference, they even had the same shot on the back of the case. Mad Max was heavily inspired by the aforementioned "A Boy and His Dog" so it could be reference to either really.

edit: btw I was talking more about the inclusion of a dog companion in Fallout rather than the specific shot of them walking together Both. Dogmeat's appearance is based on Max's dog, but Dogmeat's name comes from the *A Boy and His Dog* movie. There's a line in which the main character insults his dog by calling him "dog meat". Yeah I played quite a bit of Fallout 3 including finishing a couple of the DLC packs.  Never found the dog. Maybe he runs right up to you as soon as you exit the Vault like the end of the trailer. &gt; Game looks like it is going to have bright colours, I'm grateful for that.

No more annoying green or orange filters that I have to install mods to remove! I get that the world is supposed to be depressing,  but the colours were so bland I couldn't take it.   Fallout was never supposed to be ultra depressing though. They fucked up with 3 heavily on the aesthetics and atmosphere but this seems to be more in line with classic Fallout. I just hope they add a huge healthy dose of humor and weird pulpy shit.  Hopefully they've learnt from what Obsidian did in Old World Blues in that regard. Old World Blues is probably the greatest DLC I've ever played. It's better than most games I've played. Never have I laughed as hard as I did playing a game as I during my first play through of OWB. I wish all RPG studios would learn a thing or two from Obsidian, but as long as their games get reviewed worse than everybody else's I don't think there's a point to following their lead. To be fair, a lot of nitpicks with Obsidian games are the fact that they are ultra buggy.  because they are usually rushed. When they have time, their games are fantastic (south park, PoE) Bethesda has that on lock already. They need to learn from the other stuff next.  Hopefully they've learnt from Obsidian in general.. Agreed. I get that I can't expect every upcoming Fallout game to capture the atmosphere of the original games and that the series is now something different than it was back in the late 90s. But I still feel that Fallout isn't truly Fallout without the off kilter "cheeriness", for lack of a better word. Dark, harsh and violent? Yes please - but I still want blue sky, more or less obscure pop culture references and subtly funny dialogue. 

I liked the trailer a lot and have high hopes for the game itself. It's been a long time since a trailer left me with a dumb smile on my face.    I feel like optimism of some kind has always been a part of Fallout.  Each game is about a world that is in a very bad state, but ends up just a little bit better because of what you did.  I feel like it really pays off in New Vegas--instead of shepherding a rough community toward civilization, you get to choose which actual civilization will continue to grow. The graphics aren't as drab as FO3, but it looks like everything is still a ruined shithole. Looks like we're in for another game of people not cleaning up rubble inside their homes for 300 years. We'll have to see more. I think it's still too early to tell. I heard Bethasda's Fallout 3 was originally going to take place immediately after the bombings (maybe like 20-30 years) which would had made a lot more sense!  That certainly depends. Boston in the Fallout universe is home to The Institute, an organization that can probably best the Brotherhood and Big Empty for technology. I would not be surprised if the higher class areas are a bit more technological than we've seen before. Look, I appreciate what you are saying, but its not like [the originals](http://imgur.com/a/XfQQQ) had a very bright palette. They did not "fuck up" on the aesthetics, they did a great job with what they envisioned felt like a stylized ruined capital dc.

I think it'd be cool if we stopped saying devs fucked up for doing different things to what we expect/desire.

The aesthetics were playable and stylistically consistent its hard to see the need for strong language about it.

 &gt; Fallout was never supposed to be ultra depressing though

I played the first couple when they came out. Maybe I'm I'm remembering it different, but I remember them being dark and gritty, especially the second fallout. Am I the only one that really liked the original filters and feel like the style will be partially lost now?  This felt a little too much like "every other game" for my taste (in terms of palette).  I'm still probably going to enjoy the shit out of it, but I always imagined a post apocalyptic post nuclear winter style world to be kinda faded and skewed towards some sort of nuclear fallout tone that's all over the environment/buildings.   One problem veterans had with Fallout 3 is that it was a little too post-apocalyptic. Fallout is meant to be *post*-post-apocalyptic. Fallout 3 was a little TOO ruined, a little too destitute and miserable, especially for 200 years after the bombs. Fallout is about the societies that rise after an apocalypse, and Fallout 3 lacked that somewhat. Of course New Vegas didn't which is why it was better received by old fans.

Thankfully they seem to have realized this and fixed it judging from the trailer! I think the reason Fallout 3 employed this is because it was set in DC.  To see a once powerful capital in complete ruins is miserable, and I feel as though DC would've bared the brunt of the destruction because of its position on the world stage.  I never got a chance to play 1 and 2 so, maybe some of the setting is lost on players like me, but I have heard from a friend who played the originals that they were much more light hearted and campy which New Vegas definitely took a page from. is there any in universe reason that the east coast is taking so much longer to rebuild than the west?  You can probably partially explain it by the amount of bombings. DC took A LOT, there is radiation everywhere, pure water is rare. In Vegas House managed to detonate a lot of missiles before they hit the ground, so there is a huge dam with pure water and electricity, farming, etc. 

Not the best excuse one can come up with, but still makes it better than "We just never tried to rebuild in that 200 years". That was my take on it.  That there was more lingering radiation because of the importance of the location along with the large number of super mutants.  Not rebuilt because it just wasn't possible to do so until recently.

NV has raiders and some more natural dangerous wildlife, but it's nothing compared to super mutants. Hurrah for mods! Actually what with how amazing skyrim mods were this time around, I actually can't wait to see what kind of mods are going to be coming out for this game. Makes me giddy as fuck just thinking about it. Weird sex things, boobs, succubus races, pretty lipstick, turning all females in game into younger versions of themselves, killable children, high res mods, skimpier clothes, a single inexplicably well-loved dick mod, invincible dog, unlimited companions, better weather, alternate start, better ambient noise, the USS Constitution as an ownable flying vehicle, a tree with a shotgun under it, a homesteading mod that never gets finished, mods that add companions, mods that make those companions sex-able Sign me up for all of those things! Well, those things plus a better textures mod or something of the sort. Instead we will see mods that impose either the green or the orange tint. Not even joking. &gt; And that Dog is going to bring some emotional moments

I really hope so.  The only thing that is missing from every Bethesda game are the emotions and well rounded characters. Also missing: epic moments involving more than 12 people who are not awkwardly standing/gliding around each other.

I love Bethesda games but they really can't pull this stuff off. Seriously.  

* Kvatch/Bruma is under attack by a horde of demons! Let's take the city back with a few guards!
* Let's finish off the Enclave for good with one big robot and a handful of Brothers!
* Whiterun is under attack by a massive army that comes in waves of 6!
* Let's assault the walls Solitude and end the empire with a handful of guys! That can't be helped without writing new engine from scratch I think, and it looks like F4 will use spruced up (lighting looks better) Skyrim's engine, which is basically Gamebryo dating back to Oblivion.

Look at the dogmeat's animation when he's running away from the crib, how canned it looks, a trademark of this engine. Dating back to Morrowind. Bethesda really needs to ditch that engine. Skyrim is from 2011, and that's all they can show four years later? Agreed, I really do feel that at this point Gamebryo needs to be totally replaced, I was hoping that Fallout 4 would finally make this happen. Oh well guess it will have to be TESVI...

(Disclaimer: I (like most in this thread) am actually super hyped about FO4 and will play the shit out of it ) Lets be fair to Bethesda, nobody just ditches their long running game engine. It's evolved HEAVILY since its creation.

The Source engine goes back to the mid nineties, since its just a fork of the quake engine, and that powered Titanfall just last year. Well they do have 8gb of RAM to work with now, instead of the 512mb they used for their 360 games. I'm sure a good part of the RAM will be put in to being able to have more characters on the screen at once. I hope. They're certainly not spending that texture budget on dog fur... The epic civil war of Skyrim, where 10 people decided to attack the capital, looked more like a skirmish than what it was supposed to be.  The capitol, with its huge metropolitan population of, what, 30, 40 citizens? I like to role play that may character is in a Twilight Zone-like situation where he's the only one that realizes how ridiculous it is that there are only like 1000 people in existence and yet they can't get along. Yeah that's my only complaint. I think for skyrim it was a matter of using a revamped version if the oblivion engine and the associated limitations so hopefully if they are using a new engine we can get more scale Fallout 4 compared to 3 is like man of Steel getting colorized. So beautiful.  I'm so glad they have finally focused on an art style that doesn't look copy pasted everywhere. Looking advanced graphics wise is not important to me as long as the art style looks cohesive and feels alive. Yeah when I saw the fucking airship it became obvious that they were really taking the fallout setting into a new direction The fact that Last gen consoles wont be holding it back now makes me excited. Woah! Look at all the bright colors that they're using now! I see reds and blues and yellows, compared to the grays and blacks of FO3! FO3 was more green than gray or black tbh. It had a green filter, it was definitely grey because people modded the filter out. Gray and green. But it was a Lot of gray &gt;War, war never changes 

They said the thing! No release date in the video, but surely with a trailer out they must have some idea of a release time.  They will probably announce it at E3, I have a feeling it will be this year. Am I the only one who thinks that phrase was completely out of place compared to intros to previous titles? I've just watched it back and you're 100% right.  "the soldiers were right ! Warneverchanges" Which doesn't even make logical sense because the only thing they've said about this particular war, by that point, is that it involved nuclear detonations, i.e. it was catastrophically different from all previous wars. Well that's kind of the point though. The quote means that whatever new weapons the war is fought with, the underlying causes will never change - it's just human squabbles. See the narration from F2:

&gt;"War. War never changes.

&gt;The end of the world occurred pretty much as we had predicted. Too many humans, not enough space or resources to go around. The details are trivial and pointless, the reasons, as always, purely human ones."

  
I just don't like the way it's used in this trailer because it seems tacked on at the end and doesn't seem to be justified. Do we know what city/cities this takes place in? It's absolutely Boston.

The USS Constitution, the Bunker Hill Monument and the Paul Revere statue are all present in the trailer. There's also a [heavily fortified Fenway Park](https://i.imgur.com/CbCwsN0.jpg).

As a Masshole I'm so excited for this. I can't wait to see what they do with Boston...but also Cambridge and the surrounding areas. The colleges. The towns and suburbs. I'm stoked! Watch MIT be the only safe haven, with filtered water and air, and prospering agriculture.  Cambridge and the MIT area are bastions of a semi-authoritarian technocracy that makes androids and shit. This game is set on the outskirts (or inside) of a futuristic utopia/dystopia. They produce androids see: http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/The_Institute. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] And the Massachusetts State House. Looks like Boston based on statue and buildings that look rather familiar.
 That statue of the is paul revere [here] (https://www.google.com/search?q=paul+revere+statue&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=799&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=nT1Fz8u3TtJclM%253A%253BpU73ma9Ej4JzEM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fen.wikipedia.org%25252Fwiki%25252FPaul_Revere&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=nT1Fz8u3TtJclM%253A%252CpU73ma9Ej4JzEM%252C_&amp;usg=__FOaeHrcQNPpdPCFlArJ9qVywKNM%3D&amp;ved=0CCkQyjc&amp;ei=nQtvVfi_Hsi0ggTqiIOwDw#tbm=isch&amp;q=paul+revere+statue)  USS Constitution, Fanueil Hall/Quincy Market, the State Capitol dome, and Fenway Park are all featured in the video.

There are mountains featured though, which leads me to believe that some part of it may also take place in New Hampshire or Western Mass (the Berkshires). http://imgur.com/aOEGghz

That looks like the State House in Boston For comparison: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Overview_of_Boston_from_State_House_in_2009.jpg The current thinking is Boston based on the section that appears to be Scollay Square [here](http://i.imgur.com/XyeRHtc.jpg). Why is everyone is talking about the dog? There is a dog companion in most (if not all?) Fallout games. Just because it seemed like a focus of the trailer. Why have the dog be the first living thing shown and focus on it for the first minute of the trailer if it's not going to be important? Because the trailer sets up the Fallout Universe/story. At first the trailer is just before/after the war, and there isn't any indication that any human survived. There isn't a human shown until it shows the player character exiting the vault. The dog may just be emphasized because it is a useful device to set up the trailer. Wasn't the dog involved in some of the first teasers and pictures for Fallout 3? I remember the image of the character walking down the desolate road with the dog by his side one of the major marketing images. I'm sure it'll be an optional companion as it has always been Does anyone else find it interesting that a lot of the talk about this trailer is complaining about the graphics not being all that great (such as being compared to The Witcher 3's graphics). Yet it's clearly all in engine, and not "enhanced", which has been a hot topic around this subreddit for a while.

This trailer looks like an honest representation of what it will look like in game, and I'm grateful of that. It looks like to me they focused more on having a more detailed environment and using an art style that would look good rather than going hyperrealistic. Look at how many more NPCs there were compared to Skyrim. One of the biggest complaints people had about Skyrim is that it didn't really feel alive. I think they wanted to make sure this game did. The main thing is the models for me. We have mods for textures and enbs for lighting Hopefully someone will step in and do a SMIM or STEP style project on the nexus for FO4.  One thing to consider is that if the graphics are this similar to it's predecessors, it's probably the same engine. This particular engine sucks at this point. So does this mean we'll get a voiced main character?  Sounds like Troy Baker. God damn some of the comments in this thread. I've been playing video games for 24 years and I'm glad I have never reached a point where I think the trailer's graphics look bad or are lacking. You have to be extremely disappointed in video games as a whole when a maxed out Witcher 3 is the minimum bar you set for video game graphics. Some people are saying it looks awful. Maybe doesn't look as good as some other AAA games, but AWFUL? Jesus Christ... I mean.... It does look maybe 3 years old at this point, and it isnt even out yet. Thats not awful, but it is a little jarring from what expectations many people had.

Most noticible to me wasnt the actual graphics per se, but rather the animations didnt seem great. The characters and models also seemed carved from one piece of wood, rather than having things (clothes, nuts/bolts, fur) that are seperate entities.

Im excited, but a little perplexed at the same time  Ugh, wish you had pointed out that block of wood thing. I wouldn't have been able to put on my finger on it, but now that I can it's gonna bug me so much. At one point i thought that the success of Minecraft would have made the gameplay &gt; graphics mindset more popular. Minecraft's graphics are a stylistic choice, though. There's a difference between well-executed unrealistic graphics and poorly executed realistic graphics. Granted, that difference probably shouldn't matter as much as it does to many gamers, but it is what it is. [deleted] It's a pragmatic stylistic choice. Many indie devs who aren't artistically skilled will opt for 8- or 16-bit-esque graphics because they can't afford an artist and their attempt at pixelated graphics looks better than their attempt at other art styles. &gt; Minecraft's graphics are a stylistic choice

It's a technical choice, not a stylistic one. It's a game originally made by a single developper with no artistic knowledge, training or talent. He wanted or had to do all by himself, so he made the graphics as simple as he could because that's not his field. That's all. I'm just really disappointed it's still on a customized Gamebyro engine. 

Which means the animations and lighting will be terrible and that makes me sad. I'm super happy and excited but have you been playing Bethesda games for 15 years? Because in that time they have continued to use the same engine wayyyy past its expiration date, choosing to modify it and keep milking it instead of upgrading to something modern. It's not just about the looks but how it performs and let's not pretend like Gamebryo is Cry Engine or UE4! That's my main worry at the moment with this. I feel like Bethesda are too much in their comfort zone and making only very gradual increases in their technology - look at Oblivion vs Fallout 3 and you'll see very, very similar games in the way the world is interacted with, reacts to you, etc. I was hoping they could make a bigger leap with FO4, but this is only the release trailer so let's wait and see. If a game trailer comes out with crazy awesome graphics and then the game ships with worse graphics everyone's all like "fuck you! Just be honest!" Then when they're realistic and honest with the visual quality in a trailer it's "That looks like shit!"  You can't win.  Sounds like you could win by showing great graphics in the trailer that actually exist in the game.

Not that I mind poor graphics, no Fallout game has looked particularly good, it's pretty much what I expected. What hit me when I first watch the trailer is that it looked A LOT better than previous Fallouts and even Skyrim. Then I got on this thread and saw a lot of "graphical hate" so I went back to the trailer to see why it looks better to me.

Now I know why. The game actually has color now.

All Fallout games (and even Skyrim) had this washed-out color pallet that I absolutely hated. But now they've fixed that, and I am eternally grateful. Now I just hope that the rest is good. I'd say the lighting also played a part, prettied many scenes up in my eyes, and was clearly an improvement from their previous games. Whilst this is awesome, I hope BGS takes some lessons from Obsidian, because IMO, New Vegas is a much better game than Fallout 3. People may complain about New Vegas' colour palette, but it fit the idea of a frontier, rather than a wasteland. The story, dialogue, companions, quests, factions were all a major upgrade compared to Fallout 3, which does have some very awesome world building (a staple of Bethesda). 

And for people bitching about the graphics, what level of graphics are you expecting? Skyrim wasn't a graphical powerhouse when it came out; Battlefield 3 came out the same year, as did Crysis 2, both of which looked better. However they didn't have the aesthetic design, nor the freedom of open world which made Skyrim so much more immersive and enjoyable to explore. Same story with Fallout and Oblivion and even Morrowind. All those games weren't the best looking. but it didn't matter, because the Artistic design and the creativity of the world (less so with Oblivion) were much bigger draws than polygon count or lighting/shading.

Hopefully this brings the best of both worlds and we get the best Fallout yet. Oblivion was absolutely a graphical powerhouse for it's time (it just didn't last long, since better looking games came out a bit after) and so was Morrowind. Skyrim wasn't so good looking, though.  Respect for bethesda for using what looks like pretty much unaltered in-engine footage for the announcement trailer. It looks crazy awesome and we can be certain that it'll look the same or better on release. For all interested here is a small leak that a Bethesda "employee" leaked over on r/fallout. So far all of it meets up to the trailer and this was posted back 11 months ago here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/28v2dn/i_played_fallout_4/


 I feel like the stuff about the world  old definitely be true, but he also says it's made in a brand new engine with no reused assets and that just seems blatantly wrong.  Holy crap, those cities look huge. Looks like one of the biggest problems of Fallout 3/NV has been resolved. People said the same of Skyrim when they saw the trailer.  Difference being that Morrowind had massive cities and Oblivion had a variety of colorful mid-sized towns. Fallout 3 had megaton and Rivet, and NV really just had Vegas (which was awesome anyway). In terms of cities, towns and settlements

Morrowind &gt; New Vegas &gt;&gt; Oblivion &gt;&gt;&gt; Skyrim &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fallout 3

What the fuck do people in Megaton eat??? At least New Vegas had farms and shit Haha fair points. I have fond memories of Oblivion since it was my first full play through out of the bunch, so my views are very nostalgia-influenced. Also, fuck navigating Vivec... Once you get the hang of it, it's fine, but as an 8 year old when it came out, I was sooooooo lost. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Nice setting, some areas looked pretty nifty and I felt like I want to explore them. Colorful enough, not just brown all the way - that's great. 

Cautiously optimistic, although the graphics don't look quite up to par with many other modern titles. But that's not really an issue for me, I'm more worried about it being a Bethesda game and we all know how good their quality assurance team is. Might take modders to fix a lot of it once again.  I agree about the graphics. The bright colors were a nice change, but the graphics themselves seemed almost cartoonish and a little outdated.

BUT, I also don't give a shit in the least. Run it on Fallout 3's engine for all I care. I just can't wait to play it. Please don't run it on FO3's engines, I don't give a shit about the graphics really but the actual engine was a piece of shit I know that this is early on, but I think Bethesda should really invest in mocap, because the animations in the trailer looked blech. Fallout New Vegas still remains my favorite game of all time because of how ridiculously fun it was and how it had me hooked. I wanted to explore every location, do every quest.

Witcher 3 just came around and fucking blew me away, but it's unfair to compare it to New Vegas. Now that Fallout 4 is coming, it'll have to compete with Witcher 3 in the 'Open unrealistic world RPG'

So they have tough competition. I just hope they deliver but... I'll buy it even if it's more 3/New Vegas with prettier graphics. I'm a Fallout whore. People need to understand that the past two Fallout games weren't exactly graphical masterpieces. You could argue that Fallout 3 looked great for its time sure, but you'd still be missing the point. These games are more about exploration, choice, and story. I'd rather have a game with dated graphics that has countless places to discover, tons of player choice, and a compelling story.

That being said I think the graphics look pretty good. It's easy to be disappointed when comparing to other titles but those other games don't strive to accomplish the same goals Fallout does. It's only the animations I'm disappointed in. They can do better, everyone else is.  Even though New Vegas was Obsidian, I hope Bethesda learned something from NV's great characters, story-telling and interesting world. It was like a night and day difference from Fallout 3. 

This game doesn't need to be the most technically advanced game for me. Just give me atmosphere and a great world to explore like New Vegas did.
 Re: what people are saying about the engine ...

So the chances of this 'feeling' like Fallout 3/NV are pretty high then, I take it? Disappointing if so -  the clunky movement/gunplay and the stiff animations made the games a complete chore for me to play through. I so desperately wanted to become immersed in the world but practically everything about how the game 'felt' just seemed so unfinished and amateurish.  I totally agree. Movement and gunplay felt awful, and really prevented me from becoming immersed in the game and fully enjoying it. If they're using the same engine without overhauling parts tat REALLY needed it like loading, physics and more, then yeah, this will probably feel like any other Bethesda game... I'd expect it to feel quite similar. It looks nice with the new colour palette and some new lighting, but then I see those ridiculously stiff and canned animations with people walking around towns. It looks so... "videogamey" instead of the much more natural looking animations we've seen in the last decade.


I always thought that the biggest things holding 3/NV and Skyrim back were things like those animations, townspeople walking around in those robotic routes, clunky gunplay/combat (even worse at 20-30 fps)... most open world games in the last five years have done it so much better and now, in 2015 they still look so canned and copypasted. I'd always expect that their next game would alleviate those issues, and *then* it would reach true greatness. You'd think with their success they could improve the animation systems, or some of the other usual technical issues, on games with that engine. Glad it's finally here and I'm excited to see more of it soon. Fallout 3 is one of my favorite games of all time.

Trailer was *decent* I'd say. Certainly does its job of building hype for the game and I'm very glad it all looks like in-engine footage. Notably, the graphics look very vibrant (major change from previous Fallouts) but also a bit dated (unless that's just the art direction looking a bit more cartoony).

Excited to see some gameplay to see what they change and improve upon! People saying the graphics are lacking are the same ones that would complain about a downgrade if they polished up something just for the trailer that wasn't the actual state of the game.

For me the graphics looked pretty solid, and if they improve by the time of release then great and if not then no one was lied to.  Meh I can stand by the graphics looking a bit dated, but even the animations?  The dog running around in the house looked really awkward.  It seems like a superficial polish over NV, improved colors and lighting sources, higher res textures, but its definitely far behind the likes of GTA5 / Witcher 3. i think the stilted animations are the weakest part of the gamebyro engine / games. Everything looks completely unnatural. Its about as videgamey as video games get. Nothing about skyrim or fallout feels visceral or fluid. Reload animations, melee attacks, people talking and using their hands while talking, interacting with the environment. 

I think the visual quality is way less important than the environments and gameplay I'll be honest and say I was a little disappointed by the graphics in this trailer, but I wouldn't care that much if things still looked natural. For me, the animations were always the most jarring thing about Skyrim/Fallout/etc... they just never flowed together and looked natural. Even mediocre graphics can get me immersed, but when I see someone walking around like they are doing the stanky leg it just kills it for me. It's too early to say whether they fixed those bad animations, but I certainly hope they have. I always hated it when a character would turn midstep and the entire character model would rotate/slide in another direction. 

It's like watching Gumby.  It's not that I'm mad that the graphics aren't amazing, it's that this is the Gamebryo/Creation engine. And while it's moddable to hell-and-back, it's a really crappy engine. Graphics? Meh, I have nothing to complain about.

Animations? Guess it won't be this game that will break the awful animations Bethesda had since Morrowind. I mean just because the graphics are unimpressive does not mean that there won't be a downgrade between scripted trailer and release. [deleted] Did anyone take notice that he was typing with 2 buttons?! Just like texting as he says! That's something I've never seen before with a controller. I've had the opportunity to use the dual thumb typing feature recently and honestly its an improvement that I never knew I needed. It seems so strange but it feels so natural. I couldn't see exactly how that was working from the video.  Do you slide each thumb to the letter you want, then click the touchpad in to choose the letter?  That'd be interesting... It looked like he might have been using either the shoulder or underside buttons to choose letters, looks like it'd take a fair bit of dexterity to type efficiently like that. Yeah, that's the one place in the video where I felt like, "Sure, I could do that...  if you gave me a year to practice."   a year? Yeah, or, like, 30 minutes. Whichever comes first. Maybe if you text a lot on your phone, but I still type slowly on it, so I doubt I will be able to type that fast on a controller, which itself will probably take A LOT of getting used to.

Typing with a controller just got twice better, twice better than shitty, that is. But I guess its the best they came up with and it does the job, so kudos to Valve. a year. I'm sure its a skill of its own, and people will probably pick it up faster than you'd think. Remember T9 texting?  Soon as you build some muscle memory, you won't even have to think about the motions. To me it looks like it registers your thumb location as a circle above the letters, allowing you to see where your thumbs would be over the keyboard. When you are hovering over the letter you want, you just press harder to register a keyboard press. You shouldn't think of these as a binary touch device like a smart phone, rather a surface with levels of pressure sensitivity.

The underside buttons are probably caps lock and shift. You can do this on the PS4 touchpad btw. Maybe not two at a time but I do it all the time if I need to type Yeah, it's one of those things where you see it and immediately ask "Why the hell hasn't this been a thing for years already?" I mean, it's already possible on a traditional twin-stick gamepad, just less accurate. The reason typing with a stick sucks is because you're controlling the cursor's speed rather than directly controlling its position, so it requires more concentration to do that speed-&gt;position calculation that it would take if you were, say, using a virtual keyboard with a mouse. Using two sticks simultaneously would make it even harder.

With trackpads it would be better, because you are directly controlling the position, but it still wouldn't be as good as typing on a phone, because on a phone you touch the letters directly, where as on a trackpad you have to translate the position on the trackpad to the position on the screen. If you've ever used a graphics tablet without a screen, you'll know how long it takes to get used to.

The one nice thing this controller could potentially do that phones can't do is it could give you haptic feedback as your thumb slides over each letter. Steam big picture has a great solution for twin stick typing, imo, it works using only the angle of the sticks to choose a letter, no movement of a selection thingy necessary Ah, I was wondering if anybody had ever implemented something like that. That's called chording, and it's how stenographers type in the courtroom, pressing multiple keys at once to type whole syllables very quickly.

On a controller, you could use four directions on the primary stick and 8 directions on the secondary stick for 32 combinations. Enough for all the letters in the alphabet. Use the shoulder buttons to shift for capitals, numbers, and punctuation. I was wrong, it's one stick and four buttons. Even faster since you don't have to confirm the directions when typing a letter

http://images.pcworld.com/images/article/2012/09/steambigpicture002-11404982.jpg Have you tried the typing in Big Picture mode? It's different from the new method that was shown in the video but it was still pretty easy to use to type with a controller. The method they use in Big Picture mode is very similar to the one homebrew developers used years ago on the PSP. I think Killzone (could have been another PS2 game, my memory is fuzzy) also used a similar keyboard. I have no idea why it didn't catch on. I got to try one of the earlier versions of these at PAX last year. It felt pretty good, but definitely needed some getting used to. Haven't tried one since, but it looks like it's definitely been improved. Have you tried playing pc games on other controllers before?

How do they compare? If you're asking if I've played like, Civ V with an Xbox controller: No, I haven't.

Did I try the Steam Controller (like first version of it, mind you) on a game that works well with an XBox controller? Yes. Felt okay... like I said, it definitely takes getting used to and the new version looks far better. Civ 5 shouldn't be hard to control, I use joy2key and a PS3 controller and it plays perfectly. My main question for this is things like fighting games, where I tend to use the d-pad for movement. &gt; Civ 5 shouldn't be hard to control, I use joy2key and a PS3 controller and it plays perfectly.

But.... why!? To play from my bed of course, don't own a wireless keyboard and that is the next best thing. I also use the same config to use windows in general. &gt; To play from my bed of course

That basically sums up the reason why I want the steam controller. Fair enough. It sounds facetious, but when my wife was in hospital for surgery, her laptop plus my Steam Controller prototype kept her sane. Playing from bed is important! This. I have a disability that occasionally glues me to bed for a month or two, and I can't play games with a keyboard + mouse that way, so I often buy games based solely on whether or not they have controller support. It isn't physically possible for it to be worse than 360's d-pad. I actually cannibalized a 3rd party 360 controller that had an awesome d-pad but shit triggers and frankensteined into a 360 wired controller which of course has crap d-pad. Now I have the ultimate gaming controller for my PC! Can we get a picture of this monstrosity?  What about an XBone controller? Seconded.  They eliminated the few glaring flaws with one of my favorite controllers. I think fighting games tend to use the Arcade Stick as a global standard... Not sure if you'd want to use a SteamRoller for something like that tbh The Alienware booth at PAX East had Dyling Light set up with a Steam controller. It was strange, to say the least. It's exactly how you would expect it to be using WASD for movement (even though it's a stick) and having a trackpad for aiming. We've all tried playing a shooter on a laptop without a mouse. It's not far from that.

I think someone could get used to it after some practice, but the thumb is not used to that kind of dexterity out of the gate. The only controller i have ever found that felt like it could replace a keyboard and mouse was this one from Microsoft that hardly anyone even knew about: http://www.museumofplay.org/online-collections/images/Z006/Z00650/Z0065068.jpg

That swivel allowed for some extremely precise control, and felt so natural.  I loved this controller, but it had driver problems, and was abandoned.  I wish someone would revive this concept.  I think its better than a trackpad.  WAY ahead of its time.

I have tried a lot of controllers too, and i am anxious for this one from Steam. It's funny, because the first Steam Controller prototypes used a physical trackball similar to this one. The problem they encountered was they couldn't update and modify a physical element easily, so they changed it to electronic trackpad. I don't think that's a trackball - it looks me like the whole right side is on a 3 plane gyro and you twist it as an input mechanic. The haptic pad feels like a trackball. You can feel the weight and you can even "throw" it. It feels very good for aiming. I fell for that one too, but I remember switching back to the mouse pretty
quickly. For what it's worth, the Steam controller also includes a gyroscope,
so you could probably design a scheme that lets you aim wholly or partially
with that. I've been growing to like that scheme in Splatoon, so it's
something I might experiment with when I get my Steam controller. My buddy has been using something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/hm7CQLR.jpg) for nearly 10 years. We all made fun of him. But now. Now he's ready. That's my mouse. It's amazing.  I had the old Microsoft one but they stopped making it. I actually just saw this in best buy yesterday and I must own it. I used to play counter-strike on a trackball. I will never make fun of anyone for it, it has the same precision as a traditional mouse and even some advantages. I started playing CS with a trackball. You didn't need a huge ass mouse pad and could turn around with the flick of your thumb. But that was 15 years ago. I don't think I could go back to one now. I think the main disadvantage of a trackball, and why I'd never go back, is they get dirty easily. If someone were to fix that issue I'd consider buying one again. Oh right, I totally forgot about cleaning that thing every other hour! I will tell you that games that rely on sensitivity (FPS, etc), will require a large learning curve.  While today it is true that mice/keyboard players have the advantage given how they can alter settings and DPI, it feels unnatural to do it with your thumb on a controller.  I can see the long term benefits if people become practiced, but it has a surprisingly HUGE amount of difference to controllers people are used to.  I have played with these at PAX, but recently at GDC and another event in March.   Anyone know what game is on screen when the narrator starts talking about having friends over to play with? Looks like Android Assault Cactus http://store.steampowered.com/app/250110/ cool looking game, never heard about it, downloading the demo now.  Anyone know of any other games that are local multiplayer and uses 1 screen? Isn't Trine local/single screen multiplayer?  Gangbeasts

Sonic Racing Transformed

Serious Sam 3

Dungeon Defenders the first, don't think the 2nd one has it yet

Towerfall Ascension Cannot recommend Towerfall enough. It has brought a lot of fun and rivalry into our group.  Check out /r/localmultiplayergames  Castle crashers and Trine 2 come to mind. http://www.co-optimus.com/system/4/pc.html Ah, yes that seems to be it. Thanks! [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [Assault Android Cactus](http://store.steampowered.com/app/250110/), it looks like. Damn, that's a really good advertisement. Seeing it actually in action for Cities: Skylines kinda has me tempted to get one, unless I'm blind and the gameplay footage didn't match up with the controller inputs.

I've been looking for a simpler way to play RTS and simulation games from my couch without hunching over to use a wireless mouse or keyboard for ages. The goal of the video was to make the controller look easy to use. I wouldn't judge the capabilities of a product based on advertisement videos.

Wait for reviews to come out, read up if the games you plan to play actually work well with it, etc.

As for playing RTS games, this won't be able to compete with a kb/m. Even if we were to imagine that the accuracy of the controller is comparable to a mouse, you'd still need more buttons than a controller can offer (control groups, hotkeys, etc). I'm a pretty casual RTS player to be honest, the only ones I ever really play online are AoE II and very rarely AoM so I'd probably get by fine just playing the campaigns in most thanks to their comparative ease. But yeah, I fully intend to wait for customer reviews of it to come out before I seriously consider purchasing it. I think there was a guy that reached diamond in Starcraft by playing it with a PS3 controller. Can't provide a source right now, but there's also a dude who also Twitch streams ranked matches with him using a PS3 controller.   There's also a guy who has 4.5k mmr (which is around top 1%) in DOTA2 playing with a PS controller.

There's a guy who finished Dark Souls playing with an arcade board... With his feet.

There are many guys out there.  There's a guy who beat Ornestein and Smaugh solo... with Rock band drums.

And there's the paraplegic League player who controls the mouse with his mouth and ears.

It just keeps going and adding up. I'm pretty sure he's the same guy who beat Dark Souls with the rock ban drums Yeah, but I feel like this tells more about it being more important to be strategic over being technical in SC2, rather than saying that a ps3 controller would be viable for playing RTSes. I couldn't imagine playing C:S with a gamepad, but this guy made it look relatively easy. Though, he did only use straight roads. Read what some of the other people here have mentioned about Splatoon's control system.

Yes, Splatoon.  Yes, *the Nintendo game*. ^^god, ^^don't ^^be ^^such ^^a ^^dick.  It uses a hybrid of motion and thumbstick controls and it's the best shooter experience I've ever had on a console.  Steam's controller has the same motion sensing technology built in and since it's fully programmable, you should be able to have it set up so that all your coarse aiming is done with the pads but allow you you to make pixel-perfect adjustments by tilting the controller a bit.

Seriously, it's pretty damn great in Splatoon, I can't even describe properly in text how well it works once you've acclimated to it.  Takes an hour or two.  I was never great at playing shooters on a gamepad but after playing Splatoon it's just mentally infuriating that I can't do the same *mouse-like precision* (no shit) when I'm playing anything else on a console.

edit: [See here for a video comparing stick vs stick+motion control in Splatoon.  First half is stick-only, second half is stick+motion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB6npz8nrGA)  In stick+motion he keeps running out of ink *because he's firing so frequently and accurately* it can't replenish itself automatically; the limiting factor also goes from being the time it takes to aim, to being the time it takes to charge the shot. Been playing Splatoon. Can confirm, I don't even notice motion controls anymore. Feels so natural. damn thats genius. seriously considering one now Man, I am still not sold on those track pads... Guess you have to try it to get it?  It looks so awkward. It's hard to change an input that's been dominant for 10+ years. Still, this might be better with some practice Yeah, after Splatoon's motion controls convinced me of controllers being able to have mouse-like precision, it isn't difficult to think that Steam could pull off something similar, if not better.  TrackPad precision isn't the problem in my opinion. The problem is that there is a limited range of motion. So if you are playing something like a shooter you either have to set that the entire track-pad is 180 degrees, which eats away at your precision.

We'll see how it works out. If can get precise movement without having to constantly take your thumb off the trackpad to turn all the way around, it may not be too bad after some getting used to. I believe it was mentioned at some point that the "track-balls" have inertia. So "flicking" the controller would set it spinning until you touched it again. That will presumably be one way to do fast motion, while still allowing precision. You can see that in the video when he's playing Witcher 3. He flicks his thumb and suddenly he's looking behind him at the NPC. Really great. So kinda like mouse acceleration? 

edit: I meant it as a question, not implied.  You can think of it  as a 2D version of scrolling on a smart phone. Keeping your thumb on the phone will always have 1:1 movement, but you can flick to scroll to something far away very intuitively. perfect explanation Mouse acceleration refers to something else though. That's more where your mouse cursor moves distance-wise proportional to how fast your mouse/thumb moves, meaning if you move your mouse 3in in one direction slowly, your on-screen cursor will travel less distance than if you were to cover that same 3in more quickly. That's what a lot of mice attempt to avoid; different movements depending on speed of tracking. It's what acceleration is in a nutshell for PC gamers and a majority want nothing to do with it in a competitive environment - and for good reason. ever since quake live introduced accurate and customizable acceleration, [virtually every professional player](http://www.esreality.com/index.php?a=post&amp;id=1907380) has begun using it, because it provides a very real benefit.

being able to comfortably flick any arbitrary distance up to and including 180 degrees combined with jitter free tracking is *amazing*, and from personal experience is more intuitive and comfortable in general.

the issue with mouse acceleration is not the concept, its the implementation. windows enhance precision is a mess, and many games (including all source based games) suffer from [downright broken calculations](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/1126), not to mention lack of features. see [pvh's driver](http://accel.drok-radnik.com/) for a low-level reimplementation of the mouse accel found in quake live. unfortunately it is a bit of a pain to install because the driver isnt signed by microsoft. It's a little different than mouse acceleration because the guy is flicking it, releasing it, and then pressing it again to make it work, instead of having it gain velocity as he continuously looks to the left/right And that there is no dead zone... The trackpad can act as an analog stick. If you were playing a shooter it wouldn't work like a mouse. wouldnt that defeat the entire purpose of having the track pad in place of a stick? The WiiU in general and the 3DS Zelda remakes have really done some great stuff with motion-controlled aiming.  I think the big secret is when there's a screen in your motion controller.  

(I haven't actually played Splatoon yet, but motion aiming works brilliantly in the 3DS Zelda remakes and in Captain Toad) Agreed. As a lifelong mouse and keyboard shooter user, the 1 to 1 motion on the gamepad for Splatoon has been innovation in console shooter controls for me. The touchpad seems to have that concept down well. how does it work? I didn't get splatoon because I hate playing shooters on controllers. Incredibly well.  One thumbstick for WASD, one thumbstick for turning/aiming, and you can turn the controller itself for extra fast or precise aiming, like to nudge the crosshair a short distance in one direction (where the stick input would be too coarse) or to accurately track a moving target.  It's the closest control to a mouse I've experienced on a console.

edit: [Here's a video showing stick-only vs stick+motion in Splatoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB6npz8nrGA).  First half is stick-only, second half is stick+motion.  The limiting factor goes from mainly being the time it takes to line up a shot to being the time it takes to charge the sniper shot or refill ink. The wii remote worked similarly well for me, especially in The Conduit. I miss that game sometimes. With the motion controls on, you still use the right stick to look around broadly left and right, but the gyroscope in the controller also lets you finely aim 1:1 in any direction. You can also press Y at any time to reset the camera position to behind your character looking forward, creating a new pivot point for the gyro sensor. You get used to it pretty quick and it absolutely makes a huge difference over just aiming with the stick. Trust me, I'm the same as you, I thought I hated all shooters until I played any on PC and realized it was the controls that bothered me. But the beta totally sold me on it. I turned off motion controls before I even started my first game.  Should I turn them back on? Yes, they are pretty great and precise. Yes, absolutely. It should be noted that according to the store page the new version of the Steam Controller has a gyroscope, so once games start getting built with the native Steam Controller APIs it should be possible to implement a system similar to Splatoon on PC games as well. 10? First console analog sticks was 1995 when Nights into Dreams came out for the Sega Saturn. You needed the "special analog stick controller" to play it, so just over 20 years now... oh man, feeling old all of a sudden....  I ordered just to see what Valve has been [working so hard](http://i.imgur.com/cEvRmLz.jpg) on for so many years.  They've spent a lot of time on this and seem pretty passionate about getting it right. What in god's holy name is that abomination on the far left? Probably just design prototypes for testing ergonomics. They don't look like they were meant to be functional. Or pretty. "Kill me!" Or the second-from-the-left front-row sex toy. I'm pretty hyped for the controller, but I'll definitely be waiting a month or so after launch for reviews from people who've had time with it. It's definitely something that'll require getting used to, if it's actually good.  I played a session with one at PAX East, and it felt awkward, but in that sort of "Huh, this is super interesting, and I might be able to learn how to use this" sort of way. When I first used a smartphone...

"This way of typing is bullshit!"

20 minutes later...

"This is neat!" I've been using touch typing for years on smart phones and I can still type faster on T9 lol Have you moved to swipe typing though? I hated typing on touch until I discovered that. Meh, *everybody* said the exact same thing when analog sticks were first introduced.  And truthfully, they were awkward as hell at first to most people.  Now they're a universal standard.  

Shit, even the first gamepads were a little weird coming from joysticks.

I'm not necessarily suggesting that this will be the next universal evolution of the game controller, but it could be. The problem with that comparison is analog sticks only really work because developers set up explicit controls/features and even design their games slightly differently when they know analog sticks are in play.

The big pitch of steam controllers, is that the developers *won't* know you're using these touch pads.  It's supposed to just drop in and perform like kbm.  That's an entirely different level of challenge.   Also, when Analog stick came out, we got the transition from 2D to 3D. So, it was hard at fist, but made sense in a 3D space.

Waiting for a reply showing that Sega did this first and was ahead of its time. I HATED analog sticks and only ever learned to use them when the D-Pad stopped being an option.  Early analog sticks were pretty terrible though. Pretty sure I got a blister from an N64 controller. I forgot about that. N64 controllers used to actually make your thumbs ache/sting.  You should have tried using this:
http://computingvoyage.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/commodore-joystick.jpg

 Eh, that wasn't as bad because you never had to play mario party on that. I'm pretty sure the N64 analog sick was specifically designed to destroy hands.  In Mario Party it would leave your hand bloody. Remember when they started including gloves with Mario Party because so many people were hurting their hands? I don't remember if extended use was a problem for me or not (probably was, though I was used to thumb-killing D-pads both before and after, from NES to Playstation, so probably didn't think much of it).

But I remember being amazed over and over how freaking intuitive I found that controller.  Analog stick control was amazing to me and I was instantly comfortable.  When I think back to the N64 controller there's definitely no memory that they were anything but instantly usable and fun.

Dreamcast was a little bit of a step back for me after that.  And the freaking original PS controllers with their freaking thumb-biting D-pads...Man, I hardly played the original Playstation before Dualshock. &gt;when the D-Pad stopped being an option

With the 360 controller? from what it looks like in the video, it's like the analog sticks without the sticks.

i personally am very un-agile with analog sticks, and that's the reason that i'm a PC player over a console player (have a console but it's rarely used).

when I do play on the console, i find my thumbs are always slipping off of the sticks, and this almost seems like a "frictionless stick" (akin to the feeling of an un-mousepadded mouse vs. a quality gaming low-friction mousepadded mouse).

I think that the reduction of the sticks will be a benefit for me, but the learning curve would be something I'm not sure of how it'd end up being.

and there's the whole " i'm was less dexterous with thumbs than my whole arm/forearm" thing that may make *any* gamepad less preferable to me. It is obviously not going to be as accurate as a mouse and keyboard, but you have to consider what situations you would use this in. This would enable couch gaming for games that have usually required you to balance a keyboard and a mouse on your lap. right, it's a KB/mouse emulator as opposed to a controller in the classic sense.  for ease of description, it's called a controller, but it means (to steam games) that you do not need controller support for the game natively.

currently in my library of some 80 games or so in steam, i have 12 that are "controller supported" but if I got the description correct, *any* game can be used with this controller. What controller are you using? The xbone one has pretty good sticks that are rugged for you to have a nice grip. I recently held my old x360 one again and noticed immediately that hte sticks were terrible (the tops were slippery, and bent/misshapen due to use). It does have one joystick. So I'm 1/2 sold now... Steam Link + Steam Controller = $100 + $16 shipping.

I hope they eventually team up with Amazon/Prime. I mean, I threw my money at this right now anyway because I'm a dummy and know it... But still, $16 is too much for shipping. I just pre-purchased the Steam Link only and it was $50 + $8 shipping.  So they seem to be charging $8 per item for shipping. Where can you preorder it? http://store.steampowered.com/hardware

Edit:  as far as I can tell they are only "shipping" to US customers only at this time, they also could be out of stock. It only says "Coming soon" for me, while http://store.steampowered.com/hardware has a price and "Add to cart" button that actually doesn't work. Mine says out of stock... :( They are shipping to Canadian customers through EB Games, i just did my pre-order: https://www.ebgames.ca/views/locale/promoPages/landingPages/Steam/EN/ In the UK the bundle [appears on the store](http://i.imgur.com/6Wzety5.png) at 79.98, but [at checkout it mysteriously rises](http://i.imgur.com/VFWE4fD.png) to 82.44 (+~3% so nothing to do with our 20% "VAT" sales tax, which is included in the first price) plus 12.34 delivery, for 94.78 in total. 

On the other hand you [can order from Game](http://www.game.co.uk/en/hardware/steam/?merchname=hubsteam-_-bundles-_-HardwareBundles) for 79.99 (a whole penny more than the Steam store listing) with free shipping.  The only caveat is that you must also purchase a Steam Wallet card of at least 20 as part of the bundle, taking the total cost up to a minimum of 99.99.

However, with the choice being between dead money on a mysterious extra 3% and delivery versus Steam credit I'll end up using up anyway without making special purchases makes Game the no brainer option for me. 

Indeed, I have voted with my wallet and placed my pre-order with Game and it seems to indicate I'll get it for the early bird October date rather than waiting until November.  Now just need to get a decent set of Ethernet over Mains adapters...

EDIT: Added screenshots and links I wonder if I can order it for in-Valve pickup and just drive across town to get it &gt;.&gt; They probably don't manufacture it at their hq That typing system looks really interesting, was my main takeaway from this. Yeah, I'd assume they would have just used something like the Daisy Wheel keyboard thing they have for Big Picture mode right now, but that looks really slick. from http://store.steampowered.com/hardware

&gt;STEAM CONTROLLER
The Steam Controller is an innovative input device that allows you to play games from all genres, including traditional gamepad-style games as well as games usually reserved for play with a mouse and keyboard. **The Controllers are wireless and completely configurable.**  

Does anyone know if "wireless" means Wifi or Bluetooth? I'd love to pre-order this, but all I really have is my PC, no TV. I have a wireless router at home, but my PC does not have Bluetooth. I don't want to preorder this only to find that I can't even use it on my PC.  "USB wireless pairing dongle". All it says, I'm assuming like a 360 receiver dongle, 2.4GHz. Again, assumption.  It will connect with PC through a USB wireless pairing dongle (source: http://store.steampowered.com/app/353370). You won't need a wifi router or Bluetooth adapter. From a Tested GDC video a year ago - Bluetooth. They use a custom stack to get lower latency. So, you can either use bluetooth and not get the additional reduced latency, or used the provided dongle to get that extra reduced latency. &gt;So, you can either use bluetooth and not get the additional reduced latency, or used the provided dongle to get that extra reduced latency.

I'm hoping Monster Cable will sell a dongle and provide Extra Extra reduced latency. Probably just a usb dongle. Why would you preorder? That's rather impatient. Just see what its like after release. Could be sold out  I'm trying to think of the last time that has been an issue. The original Wii?  Not a console, but Amiibos? "Just" a plastic figure, but those things are always fucking sold out. &gt;Get yours before launch when you pre-order now 
A limited quantity of orders will be shipped October 16th, weeks in advance of our official launch. Pre-order now and be among Steam Hardwares first wave of users.

From the Steam Store Page It's basically their "be an early adopter" bonus. If you pre-order you get it early and have no idea what to expect... or... what? You wait and see what it's like? It's gonna take a couple more weeks to come out while... yes, that's right, you WAIT TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE. That month wait should give everyone all the data that they need. Is that Yuri Lowenthal doing the narration? was thinking that too; sure as hell sounds like him. Is this supposed to work with *all* steam games? I'm particularly interested in older games with no controller support. yes, it has mouse and keyboard emulation for those That demo was pretty impressive , seems with what I'm sure is a little learning curve you can get a pretty nice 1:1 experience. Everything has a learning curve. First time I used analog sticks. First time using a mouse after 5 years on the analog stick. First time using motion controls.  No one will see this at this point.

But anyone who had the patience to get **REALLY good at Kid Icarus Uprising's admittedly awkward controls** should feel REALLY comfortable with this thing. 

Swish the screen, tap it to stop, fine tune aim with the hyper fast speed of stylus aiming. It was more fast and precise than a second stick by miles. 

**"Huh, like spinning a globe."** I loved the controls for that game to be honest. I can't wait to try out the Steam Controller. I hope you can easily make profiles for non steam games. Hades. Pit. Hades. Pit. Hades! Pit! HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADESSSSSSSSSSSS! PIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTT!


Gotta love the game. I can't aim for shit, so I rely a lot on dodging. Looks like its pretty refined and the demonstration was pretty slick, but it all comes down to the ability to emulate the mouse with the trackpad.  Unless there is a demo station at a local retail store (which I hate to use), I think most people are going to be hesitant to buy this without being able to try it.

... And I still preordered one. [deleted] I've tested it since mid 2014 and I'd say that it's alright. Although it's nice to be able to use a mouse it feels very similar to how the touch pad feels on a laptop and we all know how fast we replace that with a proper mouse. I like it in some games but can't stand it in others.

If you suspect that it might be awkward to use I would recommend that you try to find this in a electronic store or whatever before you buy it. Loads of people who have tested mine thinks that it's pure garbage.  Can the controller be used with games outside of Steam? (Can I use it to replace my X360 controller that I use for stuff like Rogue Squadron that I got from GOG.com?) From what I've heard, you can choose between standard HID, DInput and Xinput so in theory it'll play nicely with pretty much anything, even games that don't have official controller support. Do any of those mean we'd be able to use the 1:1 mouse movement with non-Steam games? I'm not really sure what you mean. You mean something like 1cm scroll on the trackpad = 1cm scroll on the screen? If the trackpad can emulate a HID mouse then I don't see why not. Well, I pre purchased a controller. Right now I have my computer attached to a TV, so I'm dying for a control method that's better than a controller but easier to use on the couch than a kb+m. Even if it's not perfect I'm just fascinated to touch it.  I got to try one of these a year or so ago. The right tracking pad is way more accurate than a thumb stick for camera manipulation, but not as slick as a nice mouse. The buttons on the back feel great, and can be used as sort of a "Shift" modifier to change the front inputs to something else, which can be handy for games with lots of inputs.

The version I used didn't have a thumb stick, and the left pad didn't have any guiding ridges. These changes improve on the two biggest gripes that I had about the controller, and I'm very happy to see them.

Edit: I forgot to mention the software support! The whole thing had some really advanced key mapping, and you could do some really cool things with it like the "shift" functionality mentioned above. I believe their plan at the time was to allow developers to set up their own keymapping setups, as well as let users share their own setups with the community. Am I the only person who uses an extra long HDMI cable to plug my PC into the TV so I can play games in the living room when I want? My computer and TV have always been in the same room, right next to eachother.  I do that across the room and I use an x360 controller... Not sure if buying this is a great idea, but I still really want it. If your TV is close enough for this to work sure it makes sense. My Home Theater is downstairs but my PCs are on the main floor. Although I do have the house wired for ethernet I could probably sneak a HDMI cable to the TV with a ~30ft cable. Either way this is a much more elegant solution.
 [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] It's gonna take something serious to dethrone my Xbox One controller for my go-to option for PC games that don't need keyboard. I'm a believer in Valve but I'll be waiting for hands on reviews before I make a decision. 
 I'm still using an old 360 pad for that. Is the Xbone controller that much better to be worth replacing my still functional 360 pad? I like the d-pad, sticks and triggers better and am unsure of the shoulder buttons. A lot of people find them harder to hit as they don't stick out anymore. In my opinion: Yes

I had two 360 game pads that did dual duty on my Xbox and my PC. Both of them were starting to go bad with things like inaccurate dead-zones, faulty buttons and drifting. I debated doing it for a long time but I'm really happy with my Xbone controller. The rumble is significantly better and the D-pad is a massive improvement. For the first time ever I actually got good at a fighting game (Mortal Kombat X on PC) because I had a D-pad that was comfortable and accurate.   I don't think you should rush out to get an XB1 controller if your current one is working fine, but should it break then it wouldn't hurt to upgrade. 

The only thing that took me a while to get used to was the new shoulder buttons, they've made them a little harder to hit so that accidental button pressing doesn't happen, and it did take a while to get used to that. Other than that it's a fantastic controller, they definitely improved everything all around imo. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] No rechargeable batteries? AA batteries are rechargable, unless you won't to use them at the same time. It looks pretty sleek. I could imagine it being a fair bit of work on the right thumb, but I like the ideas a dim keen to see how well it's received.  &gt; I like the ideas a **dim keen**

I honestly can't figure out if that's some local slang or autocorrect I haven't deciphered. Looks like autocorrected "and I'm keen"... I think. I haven't touched a Gamepad in nearly 20 years.  Watching that person handle a Steam Controller looks so complicated, but damn does it produce results.  Aside from the typing, it bridges the gap between KBM and Gamepad pretty much flawlessly. [Valve pretty much nailed the controller keyboard as well.](http://images.pcworld.com/images/article/2012/09/steambigpicture002-11404982.jpg) It's probably the easiest I've used besides a real keyboard.  That is very different than the setup in the video. That's because the one in the image is designed around using a traditional analog stick setup. The extra accuracy from the trackpads enables you to use the dual cursor system like the one in the video. I believe /u/scoff-law is showing the current typing system for controllers with Steam That image is of a controller using analogue sticks. The video uses ghosting of your thumbs from the trackpad to the on screen keyboard I don't think Steam Controllers will use the rosetta keyboard, based on the video we just watched. I believe /u/scoff-law is showing the current typing system for controllers with Steam Really? Am I missing something because I didn't really see anything that bridges the gap between controller and keyboard and mouse. 

It looks slightly better than a regular controller to me but I can't see myself using it for any game that I wouldn't already use a controller for. Off the top of my head, I can think of two genres of pc games that I would love to be able to play while lying down on my couch (so no kb/m)...  old school isometric pc rpgs and turn based strategy games.

I can only play those sitting at my desk currently, but they're exactly the kind of games (slow paced, thoughtful) that I'd rather play while relaxing on my couch.

This controller seems like a pretty good solution for that.

I can't imagine wanting to play quake, dota2, starcraft, or anything like that on my couch with this as opposed to at my desk with kb/m though. I just wish it had a d-pad instead of that analog stick on the left side. The trackpad on the left seems like it should already be able to handle situations where you would normally use an analog stick  so why not have a d-pad for menus, platformers, weapon switching, etc.? The original prototype did have digital buttons there, so I'm sure they tried this. My guess is that the trackpad does worse as an analog stick than an analog stick does as a +-pad.

Also there is an elevated + in the left track pad, so maybe it can be set up to work as a functional digital input. From my recollection the raised "+" shape came as a result of feedback from Tommy Refenes, developer for Super Meat Boy. Valve brought him in to their offices to try out the originally released prototype a few days prior to the Steam controller's public announcement. Once the pad was set up so you had to press down in order for it to register movement, he said it was a very serviceable directional pad, and he was able to play the game about as comfortably as he could on a regular controller. That said, he thought that providing some subtle physical ridges to let you better know what part of the controller you're touching would be beneficial. A couple of revisions later, and they actually showed up (along with an analog stick, making the solution moot for a lot of games). Because people seemed iffy on the whole trackpad thing, Valve began their whole testing thing that they do so well (as evidenced by Portals and such). They found that transitioning people to a trackpad based controller is much easier if they can do it in stages, which is enabled by the analog stick.

So yeah, if this becomes a mainstay in gaming with console manufacturers rushing to copy the design, expect the next version to either have another four button set-up or a D-pad. It'd be great if they could get a PS style D-pad, those are bloody marvellous. Now I can finally play Breakout the way its meant to be played! Its a revolution I tell ya.

Seriously though it'd be great to replay Shatter with this. Thank god! 

I'm about to upgrade to a gaming PC, but I love the comfort of a console. I planned on hooking my PC up to a larger monitor so it can double as my "home entertainment system" (glorified Netflix machine) as well. 

I'd love to play a game on Ultra settings, with a controller, from my couch. That's the dream. how good is it for racing games? As someone running the current firmware on an older controller version. These are pretty crap. Not to nay say. But its like controlling your games with two laptop touch mice. Triggers are amazing. But the haptic analogue pads ruin it completely. Why did they show a single player game when talking about 'stepping up your competitive game?' Because if they showed CS or COD, they'd have pages of snarky comments to read through.

The gunplay is only there to get the point across about the clever triggers. One interesting bullet point to note on the policy is the following:

&gt; We do not consider it abuse to request a refund on a title that was purchased just before a sale and then immediately rebuying that title for the sale price

i.e. If you buy a game and within 2 weeks it goes on sale, you can request a refund and re-buy the game again at the sale price... obviously you have to meet the other requirements for the refund policy, &lt; 2 weeks and &lt; 2 hours play time. Did not expect that.  Great news that they are fine with this. I suspect it's kind of like a mail in rebate.  The majority of people either won't bother to write the correspondence or won't remember to, so it doesn't really affect Steam's bottom line.   I think the bigger answer would be that if you bought a game not on sale, you probably wanted to play it and would go past the 2 hour limit. Well shit, it's not a free games service. If you already started playing the game then you've clearly enjoyed a benefit you wouldn't have had if you'd waited. If you bought it for the non-sale price and didn't even get to play it before the price dropped you'd probably feel extra screwed and grateful you could return it for the difference. I agree.  I appreciate that they've spent the time to try and make the policy very clear, spelling out specific use cases that are likely to occur. It makes a bigger difference during the big Steam sales where a lot of people buy multiple games, and it's not uncommon for games to go on larger sales in short time periods. [deleted] Amazon partial refund policy is the shit.

Amazon lets you ask for a partial refund if a product you bought has gone on sale for up until 1 week after it was delivered to your address.

From experience: I bought 3 8GB memory modules that went on sale while on that window. I technically had already lost the refund window, but USPS screwed up and delayed the product (a lot). The amazon rep said something like "Yeah, you lost the refund period according to the estimate, but since it seems your shipping delayed, it's 1 week after you got hold of the product"

Ended up with a $10 refund on each module.

I'm pretty happy Steam is going down this path. That's one of my complaints about Steam off the list :) (because that "one-time refund and that's it" bullshit was awful as fuck) In my opinion Amazon are amazing with their customer service. For example I bought 3 days at a hotel for my bf and I through the Amazon Local service. It was so bad that police with guns (In the UK) and dogs for drugs arrived at the hotel and that was just one aspect of the stay along with my card being charged illegally. I msged Amazon to warn them of this place and they with no request on my part refunded the entire stay and called the hotel to threaten legal action if they did not stop charging me.

Also I have had no problems with their games, I have about 300 pc games on my system and use Steam as an interface and I used to buy from Steam non stop. Amazon is one of the best in regards to complaints be it pc games, dodgy sellers, etc. I am a big fan of GoG, GreenMan and Amazon now.

Edit: Terrible typos
 That's fucking great. Holy shit I'm happy. I've bought so many games full price to just see them go on sale in a week. If you are eager enough to pay full price for your games then it's likely you will also have played at least two hours of them before a sale hits, making you ineligible for a refund. The page also says they'll look at your case even if you're outside of the eligibility criteria, so I'd imagine they'll allow it for games that go on sale.

&gt;but even if you fall outside of the refund rules weve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and well take a look. However, knowing Valve's customer service, it would not be wise to get your hopes up. They're just as likely to accidently ban your account. My understanding is that valve has poor "on the spot" customer service. As in, calling in doesn't go well. I assumed emails and such get a response with-in some semi-reasonable period of time. 

Please correct me if in wrong, I've never actually had to contact valve for anything more than a password reset. 

Edit: I'm wrong.  Actually I can account that the service isn't as bad as everyone is saying it is. For example, I had purchased a non operational game and I had  emailed them asking for a refund, they got back to me within 3 days and provided the refund out of courtesy. 

Your mileage may vary I guess. They were honestly were polite and helpful for me.

Edit: forgot a word I had a similar experience when I got charged twice for a game due to server issues. Only took about 3 hours to get a response, and that was in the middle of a winter sale. There are plenty of stories of people who have been unfairly banned or had issues with Steam that did not get a proper response.

I have not experienced it firsthand, luckily, but there are a lot more stories about steam having bad customer service than other, similar services such as Origin (which, despite EA's usual problems, actually has good customer service). I haven't even touched most of my games.  But that's generally true because you bought them on sale.  If you are buying them full price and not touching them then you only have yourself to blame.  Nice.  I know pretty much any retail store does this so it's good to see Steam doing that too. Amazon is really good with this too. Every time I bought something and it drops in price in the next few days, all it takes is a quick request on live chat and they refund the difference. It makes business sense as well. First of all, very few customers will bother to do this. Second, the goodwill it buys from the consumer will return way more than the difference in price.

There's a store where I live that has a 30 day full refund return policy (as long as the merchandise is not damaged) and they use it as a sales argument. Meaning if you're unsure, you can "try it out". The salespeople are encouraged to do this from management. They know that most people won't bother to return even if they weren't entirely happy with the purchase, and when they *do* return it, the customer **really** didn't want it, so accepting the return will make the customer appreciate the store more.

I've returned several items and I've never had anyone bat an eye. On the other hand, I've spent sooooo much money there. Has that changed? It's been a while since I've bought games non-digitally but it used to be that the major retailers wouldn't refund anything that had the box opened.  Some stores will do a price adjustment if the product went on sale shortly after you bought it.   I work in an electronics store, and if you'd ask me I'd refund it. Probably depends on the size of the company and policies and if your boss is a dick or whatever, but to me customers returning is far more important than if they start looking for alternatives. 

Edit: also, it doesn't happen very often. I rarely end up in this situation more than once during a sale. [deleted] [deleted] While great, this would likely have to fall in the "we'll talk a look" category. If I buy a game, I'm more than likely going to play it for 2 hours within a day or two.

If they honor this in the "we'll take a look", which I anticipate they will, this is great news for our wallets. Well, in my opinion, if you have played for two hours there is probably little wrong with the game itself.

If there is, it will probably be a major enough issue that it's covered  by media, which means it might have a better chance in the "take a look" refund. A problem with this is "You will be issued a full refund of your purchase **within a week** of approval" which essentially means that a sale on the game in question is likely to have ended by the time the refund is actioned (unless the sale is on a non-Steam site, in which case you can buy and simply wait for your refund for the original Steam purchase before activating). You can buy the game at sale price even if you already have it in your library, just choose to purchase as a gift, and keep it in your inventory until your refund goes through, then claim your own gift.  At least it sounds like this should work. But then... what if your refund request gets rejected? Haha Then you file a request for the copy you bought in the sale. ...excellent point. But it explicitly says that you can't get refunds from gifts. You can't get refunds from gifts sent to YOU.

You can ask refunds for gifts you bought.


 I somehow missed the part that read "once redeemed". Sorry. You can't refund gifts you bought if they were redeemed of course. Just don't redeem the gift until the refund gets approved. They will do the refund immediately, it just can take up a week to be credited to you if you bought it with a credit card or whatever.  You will probably get the funds immediately if you  house to be refunded in steam wallet credit.  Valve keeps this up all the anti Valve/Steam people will have very little to complain about.  They'll find ways to complain. The anti steam people have had a hell of a lot of good reasons to be like that, and this was one of the big ones. You were only really entitled to a refund on your account once before this.

I don't care that much for origin or uplay, and I like GOG, but it's not quite at steam levels, but this is the effect of competition in the digital games market on steam. Especially with origin, they know that if they sit on their hands, EA will kick the hell out of them, since they have been charging ahead with improvements to the client and policies in place at origin. Steam, as far as I am concerned, is still the best client, but the refund policy at origin was better. Now this one is better. Steam improved the service to beat origin, and it's making digital games better for everyone. dont give them too much credit yet, a lot of their "good ideas" have turned into fuckups in the past few years Just done a refund for a game I purchased with only 40 minutes of play time. You select game and it ask where you would like refund, steam wallet of payment method (Card/Paypal etc)

Really easy to use system, loving this from steam!

EDIT: Refund went through like 5 minutes after  So it's automated? That's pretty cool! I believe it's automated if you're in those brackets of: play time less than 2 hours and purchased within 14 days. Fortunately this makes numerous cases nice and simple!

I'm curious however, if you could could somehow abuse offline mode. What if I were to play through a big RPG (or any single player game I guess) in offline mode on my desktop, complete it or get bored of it. Then before reconnecting my desktop to the internet go on different computer and ask for a refund. Hmmm... One would think they might of thought of that? When you reconnect the offline Steam back to the network, then it will upload game time tracking data. And they might undo the refund again (or ban your account).

I'm sure people will find ways to abuse the system, just as they do in retail shops. But overall, increasing users' confidence in buying games they are unsure about should lead to more sales overall. I sure there are ways to avoid the play time being updated (random untested ideas: delete whatever cache Steam uses; play in a virtual machine, snapshot the machine after a few minutes playtime and roll back before going online), but I suspect Valve will look more closely at your requests if you make too many in a certain timeframe. Or just pirate it. You are stealing it either way, why go through the trouble of defrauding Valve. That's a great point.  That also makes me wonder if you could do a clean reinstall of steam afterwards before reconnecting.

But like you say there will always be people who abuse the system, and valve know this. If all goes well this will change the opinion of many people who were on the fence about steam and it's practices.  At some point it's not worth going after the small section of people who will go to these lengths to abuse your system. Make a token effort at detecting and tracking the prevalence of these abuses (e.g. by looking at the top 0.1% of refund requesters) and decide whether to pursue action if it becomes widespread.

Otherwise it's not worth the engineer-hours to implement a technical solution nor the customer support headache of dealing with false negatives and appeals tickets. I'm pretty sure they will end up limiting this to online only games once they notice. You could just pirate it at that point. Well, then this is even better news. Now you can get an actual refund (instead of just Steam Wallet money). Wow this is incredible news. So many times this would have helped me in the past. Seriously. Scared you can't run a game and will be stuck paying $60? 

Not anymore. Sorry for late reply, I refunded Lego Worlds (Not my cup of tea). 

Asked for a refund to my steam wallet (even though I bought with my CC), first e-mail said "We're reviewing your refund request and will get back to you as soon as possible."

Got another e-mail 3 minutes later saying "Your purchase has been refunded by steam. You'll receive the funds within 7 days"

Looks all automated, pretty sweet system. Now to see if I can get a refund on Advanced Warfare... Curious, what didn't you like about lego world? How long did it take for you to get the funds back? [deleted] Absolutely. It also pressures devs to make good PC ports now that we can just say "Nah, it's too buggy, give me my money back." It's finally a lot less risky to buy a PC game. Heck, it's even a lot less risky to pre-order a game! We'll get the pre-order benefits and pre-download without having to worry about how the game will be. This is a major step in the right direction for all gamers. We need these refunds to finally end the problems with pre-ordering and end crappy ports. I doubt the amount of people who request refunds would make a big enough incentive to make better games/ports. Only a small minority would probably even know that they can or should get a refund. I think steam is counting on that, but hey it is still a good move and good for those that do know about it. It sounds like it'll be automated.  They already track game time, the date you purchased the item, and if you been VAC banned.  They aren't limiting the refunds to certain excuses, so there aren't any reasons to manually reject anything that would pass those filters.

People *already* ask for refunds outside these rules, and I'm sure that won't change much.  If anything, the number of manual refund requests should go down, not up. [deleted] I can't even see a way to request a refund if you're out of the rules, it just tells me 'This purchase is outside of the product return window and can not be refunded.' with no way for me to ask for one anyway.

Edit: it seems that refunds can only be requested if you purchased the game this year. Probably a stream support ticket would be needed. &gt; If they get lots of requests by people who have played over 2 hours it could take a lot of time away from their already strained support team.
&gt; 

One would hope that if they put in a system like this, that they also increase the support team.  &gt; One would hope that if they put in a system like this, that they also increase the support team.

We've been saying that for over a decade, though. Considering the summer sale is in, what a week? I just hope their system works. It's practically inevitable that there'll be a ton of people requesting refunds when they buy games before the sale, or buy a game during the sale only to see that game go on a flash sale or something... [deleted] They actually officially and explicitly accept that as a legitimate reason for requesting a refund!

&gt; We do not consider it abuse to request a refund on a title that was purchased just before a sale and then immediately rebuying that title for the sale price.

Kudos for them for doing that. Like really - mad respect for openly stating this is OK - so you don't even have to feel bad doing it &gt;This is a huge move forward for consumers.

This needs emphasis. This is REALLY huge. And it's exactly what we've always relied on Valve to do, and what they have consistently done: "abuse" their position of power for the good of consumers. Wow they are offering refund on almost everything you purchase from steam. Seems like a very good step moving forward. Especially that they limited it to a 2 week time frame, and 2 hours of play time. 

I can see how people might abuse that and get games as a free demo, but also it will be nice so people can see how things run on their machine.  &gt; ...might abuse that and get games as a free demo...

This may be Valve's intention in general.  Reddit has been full of people grumbling about Steam's terrible customer service, and the glut of poor-quality titles in Early Access/Steam Greenlight.  This move exposes devs and publishers to the risk that their sales can be undone if the customer isn't happy with the product.  At the same time it lets Valve comply with EU refund policies, and makes their entire service more customer-friendly.  

It's a big win for everyone **except** the studios putting out low-quality shovelware and hoping to score some money off curious shoppers. And it gives people even *less* reason to pirate.  There's plenty of people who pirate to try out a game before buying it (especially if their hardware is iffy), and plenty of those who then say "fuck it" and play the pirated version because they don't want to be bothered to download it again. 

Keeping such people within Steam will undoubtedly lead to a lot more sales, if they don't feel like pirating is less risky than making a purchase.

 You rarely have to re-download the bulk of a pirated game when you purchase it. At most you'll need to re-download the executables since cracks rarely touch anything else. Just copy the data files to the Steam install folder and do a verify files.  You underestimate human laziness.  I personally downloaded GTA V twice... Yeah, I steam installed games that I had on DVD (here buying a box and paying shipping is cheaper than buying some games on steam) just because I preferred to play or watch something in peace over listening to DVD reader vrooms and whoshes You severely underestimate the lack of skill/laziness the majority of people have It also says "Hey I can take a risk buying this game" which might make more people want to buy it.


Edit: It also makes it more appealing to buy it through steam as opposed to Amazon or somewhere else. With one of the allowed reasons being "just didn't like it", sounds like they are encouraging people to "try out" a game and they are totally cool with refunding you if it didn't meet your expectations. It seems like a lot of the risk has now been taken out of preordering a game as well--the two week/two hour rule doesn't start until the game's release, so if the game releases to extremely poor reviews, you can refund it.

Of course, they also said "Don't abuse the system" so maybe you don't want to blindly prepurchase everything, but it takes some of the risk off of it. As someone with an integrated chipset, this is EXACTLY what I needed. I can run Source games and FO:NV [with mods] okay, but any other 3D game can be hit or miss. Any time I see something that isn't a 2D pixel graphic style, I have to worry about performance and if the game will be enjoyable, let alone playable. This makes it such that I don't have to worry so much and can try a game out to see how it runs, but don't have to totally eat the cost if it's unplayable. Right now when a game does not have a demo version on steam I pirate it anyway. And sometimes the game is good but a little expensive so it's easy to think "eehhh I'll keep it until it's on sale". 

Now if I "abuse" that steam refund to try a game I would think twice about keeping it (because I paid for it). They probably block people that do more than X refund in Y time until they check by hand. Or will once some players will start to abuse it just constantly buy &amp; refund games.

Especially if those will be non-steam wallet refund, as those operations cost real money as opposed to just a bit of power to change some numbers in database That might even evolve to giving developer an option to make their full game to work as time-limited demo.

Download game, play for an hour, click "you are out of time, do you want to buy that game" popup if you liked it so far and still have an hour to refund It's basically an extension of the unspoken rule of getting a "courtesy refund" Steam has had forever. Glad to see they've legitimized it in writing.  So:

1) hopefully bad games will be returned, more developers start to make good games and not just rely on marketing;

2) abuse cases incoming;

3) no preorders campaign just became irrelevant for PC / Steam users! On the other hand, fun little cheap games that take under 2h to finish will vanish from the store. I wanted to try out "Goat Simulator" and "I Am Toast" after all their youtube campaigning, and now I basically can.

I think a game should be able to be flagged for less time if the developer chooses. Doing so would tell the consumer "Hey, this game experience might last less than 2 hrs, so we cannot offer a refund for more than 30 minutes of play time." With pirating available to pretty much everyone, how is this any problem? If you want to play a game without paying for it, you can already do that. This makes it a bit easier but just like people buy games after pirating to try them, people will not refund games after finishing them because they were actually good games and worth the money.  Yes, that would be a great solution. However, it would have to be manually supervised by Valve, otherwise every single AAA publisher would abuse this flag. [deleted] Their user review system should help for things like this. If someone does feel duped into having played it longer then 2 hours, trust me, they will let their voice be heard. Then again, these sort of deceptions will probably be pointed out a lot in the user reviews so customers will be wary.  I think you are reading too much into it, I think you both are. I doubt this will have that large an effect on the quality of games or the "frontloading" or "apifying", as I would call it, of PC games. &gt; *If you have been banned by VAC (the Valve Anti-Cheat system) on a game, you lose the right to refund that game.*  
  
Lovely. Even more incentive for people to not cheat. There needs to be more privileges like this withheld from cheaters. the 2 hour period is more likely to be up before I got VAC ban from it - any game! Vac is a delay ban. It's delayed in telling you that you got banned, however, I'm sure valve already knows and can deny, or delay, your refund. That will defeat the purpose of a delay ban.  

Let's say I write cheat for a living. To test if my latest one is safe or not, I buy a game, use it for 2 hours, then try to refund. If I can get a refund, now I can safely sell it! If not, just another account down the drain, it's no worse than it currently is. Only for new cheats I think. Like if they detect a new cheat and add it to the VAC database, they don't ban instantly but instead check for a while for people using it. When these first timers got banned, anybody else still using that cheat should get banned almost instantly.  [deleted] My mind is blown by the complete 180 they're doing on their consumer support policies. In a single move, refunds went from something most people couldn't get for a clearly broken title to something the average Steam user can actively benefit from, and in a variety of situations.

We'll have to see if the system actually pans out to be as responsive as they claim, but it *looks* unbelievably amazing. It's because they managed to develop a system that is mostly automated. Allowing refunds that were a manual process would require most resources in support and we all know that Valve fail in that department. 

They added a working system for refunding pre-orders and have just extended that to purchases on live games. The criteria will cover most of the cases - bought it and it went on sale, game doesn't work, game has Uplay etc etc - so their support team will only see additional tickets from those who try to get a refund out side of the rules. 

In doing this, they get in the good books of many people and become even more loved. It's a win win for them.
 That jumped out at me too.  Probably the most applicable part of the new policy. The funny truth is, most people who fall into this sort of problem don't visit the price of their games often enough to know they missed the sale price.

Valve isn't offering to retroactively refund recent purchases just because they want to throw a sale, they're just saying, "Hey... if you actually manage to notice and it makes you mad, we'll make you unmad."

:D Yeah, Amazon has a similar policy- if something you bought goes for sale soon after you bought it, you can request a "refund" for the different between what you paid and the sale price. This looks like an excellent refund policy, I'm really happy Valve is moving out of the stone age when it comes to customer service. I just took a shot a getting my money back for Dungeon Defenders II as it doesn't run too well on my old laptop, bought it well over 14 days ago (whenever it was on sale for like 12) and had 4 hours playtime (most of which was spent mucking around in the settings trying to work out why it wasn't running well when it should have been as I meet the requirements), and got accepted :o Can't believe they actually accepted that. *A copy of the policy page:*

**Steam Refunds**

You can request a refund for nearly any purchase on Steamfor any reason. Maybe your PC doesn't meet the hardware requirements; maybe you bought a game by mistake; maybe you played the title for an hour and just didn't like it.

It doesn't matter. Valve will, upon request via help.steampowered.com, issue a refund for any reason, if the request is made within fourteen days of purchase, and the title has been played for less than two hours. There are more details below, but even if you fall outside of the refund rules weve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and well take a look.

You will be issued a full refund of your purchase within a week of approval. You will receive the refund in Steam Wallet funds or through the same payment method you used to make the purchase. If, for any reason, Steam is unable to issue a refund via your initial payment method, your Steam Wallet will be credited the full amount. (Some payment methods available through Steam in your country may not support refunding a purchase back to the original payment method. Click here for a full list.)

**Where Refunds Apply**

The Steam refund offer, within two weeks of purchase and with less than two hours of playtime, applies to games and software applications on the Steam store. Here is an overview of how refunds work with other types of purchases.

**Refunds on Downloadable Content**

(Steam store content usable within another game or software application, "DLC")
DLC purchased from the Steam store is refundable within fourteen days of purchase, and if the underlying title has been played for less than two hours since the DLC was purchased, so long as the DLC has not been consumed, modified or transferred. Please note that in some cases, Steam will be unable to give refunds for some third party DLC (for example, if the DLC irreversibly levels up a game character). These exceptions will be clearly marked as nonrefundable on the Store page prior to purchase.

**Refunds on In-game Purchases**

Steam will offer refund for in-game purchases within any Valve-developed games within forty-eight hours of purchase, so long as the in-game item has not been consumed, modified or transferred. Third-party developers will have the option to enable refunds for in-game items on these terms. Steam will tell you at the time of purchase if the game developer has opted to offer refunds on the in-game item you are buying. Otherwise, in-game purchases in non-Valve games are not refundable through Steam.

**Refunds on Pre-Purchased Titles**

When you pre-purchase a title on Steam (and have paid for the title in advance), you can request a refund at any time prior to release of that title. The standard 14-day/two-hour refund period also applies, starting on the games release date.

**Steam Wallet Refunds**

You may request a refund for Steam Wallet funds within fourteen days of purchase if they were purchased on Steam and if you have not used any of those funds.

**Refunds on Bundles**

You can receive a full refund for any bundle purchased on the Steam Store, so long as none of the items in the bundle have been transferred, and if the combined usage time for all items in the bundle is less than two hours. If a bundle includes an in-game item or DLC that is not refundable, Steam will tell you if the whole bundle is refundable during check-out.

**Purchases Made Outside of Steam**

Valve cannot provide refunds for purchases made outside of Steam (for example, CD keys or Steam wallet cards purchased from third parties).

**VAC Bans**

If you have been banned by VAC (the Valve Anti-Cheat system) on a game, you lose the right to refund that game.

**Movies**

We are unable to offer refunds for movies on Steam.

**Refunds on Gifts**

We are unable to offer refunds for gifts after they have been redeemed by the recipient.

**Abuse**

Refunds are designed to remove the risk from purchasing titles on Steamnot as a way to get free games. If it appears to us that you are abusing refunds, we may stop offering them to you. We do not consider it abuse to request a refund on a title that was purchased just before a sale and then immediately rebuying that title for the sale price.

**How to Request a Refund**

I think this is pretty huge in a way. It doesn't give you too much leverage if you already spent more than 2 hours on a game, but I still think it's worth a shot at asking for a refund if you buy a game planned for discount like a week before such a sale. I know it gets said a lot on this subreddit (and Reddit in general), but this is why competition is important. This is clearly taking a page from Origin's book, which many people have been praising for its superior customer service and refund policies for a while now. Alright then, here we go: I just submitted a refund request for LEGO Worlds because I'm not happy with it yet.

1. Had to fill in a simple form, choosing whether I want to have it refunded to my wallet or mastercard.
2. Was able to give a reason but it wasn't a required field
3. Got a simple email telling the following:

&gt;Hello Quatroking  
Your refund request has been received by Steam!  
We're reviewing your refund request and will get back to you as soon as possible.
 
&gt;LEGO Worlds  
Purchased: Jun 2, 2015  
Refund request: 14,99

&gt;Requests are considered on a case by case basis and are not typically issued for purchases of released products that are more than 14 days old, or if the purchased product has more than 2 hours of playtime. For in-game items the refund period is 48 hours and the item must not have been consumed, modified, or transferred.

Lets see how this goes.

EDIT:

At 23:40, 2:30 hours after my first mail, I got the following reply:

&gt;Hello Quatroking

Very nice indeed! You'll only get refunded if you played less than 2 hours. I should be good then, I've only played 72 minutes. The form said I played for 1 hour. The quote says 72 seconds...did they mess that up/do they have a bug in their system? PSA:  Doing a steam refund will lock down your account from using the community market for a brief period of time.  For example, I got a refund on my batman pre-order when purchasing a new video card.  This is critical for folks who like to participate in the assorted steam mini-games/quests, and there is a steam sale coming right up, so be mindful of that. Do you know what that time frame is? How long are you locked out of it? What a terrific wakeup call to publishers, telling them to shape up and stop releasing broken games. 

I only wish this existed before Colonial Marines. Consumers are finally getting the power they deserve. This will have a huge effect on the industry. No more bait and switch.   I think this is the most important point in the discussion. I will no longer fear pre-ordering PC games and refunding them if they launch poorly. If only this were announced a month ago to catch all of the Mortal Kombat X PC purchases, NRS might actually feel compelled to fix the product. :P  Wow, this is great and solves the biggest problem with steam. People have been complaining about the lack of decent curation as the other major problem, but that was only so bad because of the lack of a refund policy.

Please don't abuse this, gaming community.  [Origin's refund policy for comparison.](https://www.origin.com/en-ca/great-game-guarantee-terms)

[GOG's refund policy for comparison.](https://www.gog.com/support/website_help/money_back_guarantee)

The big difference which I've noticed between them is that limitation on hours played. I don't know whether that makes this policy fit in with European regulations on returns, but its got to be better than the [complete bullshit it was before.](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/sorry-europe-you-still-cant-get-refunds-on-your-steam-game-purchases/) GOG's guarantee only applies to games that don't work on your system, it's not the same at all. On GOG.com, if you haven't started a download you have 30 days no questions asked. Otherwise you'll go through tech support. Funny comparing it to Origin, where only EA published games can apply to the Origin refund policy everybody quotes. New Steam refund policy applies to ALL titles. 

Funny, also, to treat this big leap just an improvement. Steam refund policy just got orders of magnitude better, from customer point of view. Amazon level, if you ask me.

Valve aligned with customers, instead of publishers. Same as Gog (one of the pioneers of putting clients first) but a step further:  automatized.  &gt; New Steam refund policy applies to ALL titles

Maybe this will get EA to adjust their policy to match Steam's. The competition GoG and Origin have brought to Steam have already worked wonders, hope this keeps up. if this actually works within a reasonable amount of time it might be better than the ea-only origin refund policy. For reference, here is EA's policy:

&gt;You may return EA full game downloads (PC or Mac) and [participating third party titles](http://help.ea.com/uk/article/what-s-the-great-games-guarantee/) purchased on Origin for a full refund. Refund requests can be made within 24 hours after you first launch the game, within seven days from your date of purchase, or within seven days from the games release date if you pre-ordered, whichever comes first. And if you purchase a new EA game within the first 30 days of its release date and cant play it due to technical reasons within EAs control, you can request a refund within 72 hours after you first launch the game instead of 24.

So EA has more flexibility with the 24 hour "trial" from game launch, whereas Steam has more flexibility in the 14 day unplayed refunds. And surprisingly, Steam offers a faster process of 7 days to EA's 10.

Great to see Valve not only taking steps forward, but also being really competitive with EA's policy.

Edit re: EA and third party titles. I think the difference, as stated below, is that the EA Policy on Origin is for EA only titles. Steam is offering refunds on -all- titles.

Edit: [Refund Policy Page](https://www.origin.com/en-us/great-game-guarantee-terms): "You may be eligible for a refund of purchases made on the Origin Store (...) of full game digital downloads (...) published by Electronic Arts (...) or participating third party titles designated as Great Game Guarantee eligible."

So for Origin, it is an opt-in for 3rd parties, and assurance for all EA products.

Sounds like Steam is for all products, Valve published or otherwise. A company opts in by being on the Steam platform itself. At least, that's my guess. And since most publishers wont want to leave Steam, they sort of have to accept being opted into this. Well, EA titles and 11 other games that participated in the "Great Game Guarantee", the point still stands though, it's nowhere close to ALL games. Oh, right. Didn't think of the fact that Origin actually has third-party titles. (I don't use it all that much) My bad, I'll edit in the relevant stuff. Yeah, and according to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/388t8u/steam_refunds_policy_updated_you_can_request_a/crt8o70) post by /u/bizness_kitty, the list of 3rd parties is pretty unimpressive. Just 11 titles. Its apparently automated. Someone reported requesting a refund and getting money back in ~5 minutes. It looks competition is really benefiting consumers in this area.  EA's refund policy doesn't cover all the games they sell so now the ball is in their court to offer refunds on their entire catalog. How does EA's refund system work? I believe with Origin, you can only get refunds on EA published titles. I fully understand why they've added the time restriction and don't fault them for it, but damn was I really hoping I'd finally get a refund for Godus. And me for broken and with lack of content they promised - StarForge. I think this will also decrease piracy. I have pirated games before to check if they ran decently before buying them. Some of my friends have the  'Meh, I already went through the trouble of pirating the game, why go through more trouble and buy it'-mentality. This makes it way easier to test a game before adding it to your collection permanently. This is amazing. This is probably the first actual step toward improving customer support/satisfaction that they have every made. Hopefully this continues. It is the law in Europe, so I guess they are just finally trying to get in line with that to avoid future problems. (They have been sued multiple times over this already) So... Did valve just murder the hell out of 20 minute long "personal experiences down a corridor" indie games with this? That's kinda sad, now the developers will attempt to pad them. Well really if one is a fan of those games, they wouldn't request a refund as to support the dev. If one is not an fan of those games, why buy in the first place? Yea. If they'd resort to using Steam to get free games I'd assume they'd have pirated it either way. I think most will want the money to go to the devs if they have been buying games on steam for a long time. I highly doubt this will become a significant problem. And any game that is literally twenty minutes long should only be a dollar or two at most. If it became enough of a problem I'm sure they'd just stop offering refunds on those certain titles and they'd be marked as non-refundable at purchase. I applaud this, finally Steam is showing customers a little more respect then in the past. Ive been EB Games/Amazoning stuff for awhile now and only buying on Steam as a last resort since being treated like a fucking peasant by them.

Its nice to see our business is finally being valued a little better. It mentions that you can't refund gifts if they are received by their recipient. So can you return a "gift" in your inventory? I am going to email valve about this and edit in a response since I don't think anyone here knows. Please post when you find an answer thanks! Also to note is that it includes pre-orders! The 14 day limit starts counting from release date, rather than from purchase date. So if you preorder something that doesn't work, you can get a refund. My refund requests have always been the same: "Hi, yes, I am an idiot and did a dumb thing, where I bought the simple version, then was enticed by the complex version! Because I am an idiot, you see. Please have pity on my difficult life." Huh, maybe the [ACCC proceedings against Valve](https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/full-steam-ahead-accc-institutes-proceedings-against-valve-for-making-alleged-misleading-consumer-guarantee-representations) made an impact. Finally. Looks like the good and popular refund policies of their competitors, namely GOG and even Origin, finally forced Valve to do something about theirs. Good stuff. This is amazing. This potentially solves so many problem people are having with steam right now. 

I heavily criticized the fact that there is no way to know if a game will run on your system. System requirements are not reliable, and if it doesn't work you're stuck with the game. Now you can just try it out and refund it otherwise. 

It still sucks that there are no demos for games, but this is at least helping with that too. How many times have I bought a game because it looked interesting, just to be disappointed by it after 10 minutes. Now I can reverse my bad decision. 

I would still not recommend doing this regularly multiple times a week, because then you might loose this "privilege", but all in all this is a gigantic step forward! Now that they've added this if they outsource their customer and tech support most of the problems with steam will evaporate. This is huge. I don't even mean Half Life 3 huge. I mean this is a landmark precedent for consumer rights in the digital age. This is Fred Rogers arguing in defense of the VCR huge. As a consumer, this is awesome. As a former developer...I'll be very interested to see how this affects sales. &gt; When you pre-purchase a title on Steam (and have paid for the title in advance), you can request a refund at any time prior to release of that title. The standard 14-day/two-hour refund period also applies, starting on the games release date.  

This seems like a great way to get all the preorder bonuses you might want from a game but not be tied down to a game that turns out to be crappy. Thank you EA/Origin for effective competition and forcing Valve/Steam to step up their customer service game.  EA only offers refunds on their own self-published games and ***11*** third-party ones.

There are ***5502*** games currently on Steam - not counting DLC, non-game software, demos, etc.  Adding software to the total brings it up to 5639, and DLC 10666.

If anything it was EU law that forced the issue. Give people an inch and they'll demand a mile. This is *by far* the most generous refund policy of any digital distribution site and there's already people complaining that 2 weeks/hours of playtime is nowhere near enough time to find out if their game works or not.

Meanwhile, game piracy is now as easy as buying a game, downloading it, patching a single DLL and issuing an automated refund. I feel sorry for all the torrent sites that are going to lose traffic over this.

EDIT: People are already abusing this for trading card drops. I can't wait to see all of the other ways that this feature gets abused in the coming days! Maybe they'll quickly reverse it like another recent feature that was bombarded by abuse. I'm sure you're right but I'm also sure valve has thought of this scenario and probably has some metrics how often a single user can buy and refund games.  &gt; game piracy is now as easy as buying a game, downloading it, patching a single DLL and issuing an automated refund

... which is still more involved than getting it from TPB or similar. not to mention the risk of just getting your refund request rejected. TPB will still get the majority of people pirating because it doesn't require a method of paying for the game, and is easier to do in the first place Should be easily fixed by making it if you sell/trade anything earned from the game, you lose your right to refund. Then you refund before trading selling.  They could then remove from your inventory any items generated by the game. &gt; game piracy is now as easy as buying a game, downloading it, patching a single DLL and issuing an automated refund.

This process is at least 3 times as complicated as simply pirating from a torrent site, as most games come pre-cracked nowadays. I guess certain smaller games will be exempt. There are many games on Steam that doesn't require Steam to be running and that are basically "portable", meaning you could potentially purchase, install, backup the folder, refund and still play the game.
 Then again, you can do similar with GOG. I would hope they don't limit everyone for a few bad apples. I imagine those games could be easily pirated regardless. Good step! But a stand-alone 14-day (or hell, even 7-day) price guarantee would be the icing on the cake. Recently, I've been considering purchasing titles on Origin (god it hurts to say it) rather than Steam just because their support/terms are miles ahead. 

I like Steam. I've earned steam level 28. I'm invested. But when I'm disregarding my investment and truly considering to buy DRMed titles from EA because their support and T&amp;Cs are *better*, you've really screwed the pooch.

I'm glad Steam is moving in the right direction. This is an amazing development, and I applaud them finally getting on the boat. However, I am a little concerned for those games out there that are only 2 hours long to begin with, and are priced accordingly. What's stopping me from rushing through To the Moon or some other great-but-shory title only to return it? There's a place for those games too.

Also I seem to remember people manipulating their computer's clock while playing a game to artificiality inflate hours played. Couldn't one do the opposite to make it easy to return something they've put a good many hours into? What about playing it offline? The last time I checked, Steam couldn't tell if I played a game for any amount of hours if I had played it offline. Hopefully this works for Early Access games too.

If so, it will really cut down on the amount of shovelware in the shop. I assume this is in response to EU law and Valve's lawyers finally told them to stop trying to side-step the issue. This seems perfect. I'm not a big fan of Valve, but they hit pretty much anything that you would want from a digital refund policy. So how do you ask for a refund for a game that is outside of the time period? I go to the game that I want to refund and all I'm met with is a "This purchase is outside of the product return window and can not be refunded" I'm submitting a question via the support. Is this a big middle finger to shitsville green light games? I hope they will still issue manual refunds for games that are broken or otherwise not functioning how they should if you don't meet the &lt;2 hours of playtime criteria.

I know I've spent more than two hours trying to troubleshoot a problem in a game that I really wanted to play in the past. That should hopefully fall under what they said here:

&gt; There are more details below, but even if you fall outside of the refund rules weve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and well take a look. Thats great to see. A few months back I bought the wrong digital item in Dota 2 (I wanted points for a compendium item, and bought more compendiums instead), and my request for a refund was shot down then. I ended up having to sell the items for a slight loss on the market once the trade restriction wore off. damn, this is a huge step forward for digital goods. most importantly it seems to remove the 'can i run it?' issue that has plagued me for so long, i might even drop the cash on the new witcher right now.


this seems so straight forward and well done that, despite the fact it is valve, i'm stumped on what the catch is. So it seems like you will be able to get the preorder bonuses for an upcoming game without actually committing to buying the game before release. Preorder the game, don't play it until reviews are out, refund it if it sucks, play it with the preorder bonuses if it's good. &gt; even if you fall outside of the refund rules weve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and well take a look.

It would be awesome if they could make this happen for games that literally don't work anymore, ie anything that died when Gamespy servers shut down a while back. They definitely just won me back after feeling unsatisfied with them for a few minor reasons recently. good job guys. I wonder, would this work with ubisoft games requiring Uplay? Since the game key is bound to both it and steam. Even spite? This is probably related to the Source 2 update coming to DOTA 2 later this week. They will probably be selling UGC/Mods with Source 2, so they need to adopt a model like this.

personally, I am excited for it, although I understand everyones concerns with this. This is pretty great, wish I could refund a game or two I have now that are just broken or bad, but it will be a great policy going forward. So what will happen if you buy the game on one account, share it through the family option, then play it on another account and go to refund it with the original account after finishing it? I mean, you won't have played through the 2 hour limit on the account you bought it on. They've said all these years that it was contractual obligations that prevented them from doing this (a different contract for each publisher, etc.); it probably took this long to get everything updated.  This is the first thing Steam has done in years that makes me want to buy games on their platform over GoG, Humble Bundle, etc.

Imagine if this policy was in place when Gone Home came out.  How many people would have either.. finished and returned it, or come really close to finishing it and then return it?  It'd have been a really weird situation. It's pretty great how Valve can go from the devil incarnate to amazing godsend PC saviors in about a months time.  Hopefully I can get a refund through this. I bought Elder Scrolls online like 4 weeks ago, so I am outside the 14 day window, but I only have 20 min of game time because the launcher is broken for me and never progresses past "Loading..." so hopefully I can get a refund through this system. Wow, according to this, if you preorder a game and it turns out to be shit, you can return it as long as the 14 day-2 hour span didn't elapse after the game was in your library... No more Aliens: Colonial Marines bait and switch schemes anymore! Something that should have been there years ago, but it's nice that they're finally catching up with the fucking times. Damn I wish I had this when the Witcher 3 came out. It's a fucking amazing game, but my pc barely runs it and I would have rather played it later on a better system.  You can't refund a game that you purchased from a third party and then activated on steam - while that would be obvious when you think about it they may have actually considered that they stand to claw back some sales by making purchasing through them the "safe" choice. Even more so than before. The peace of mind that you can refund the game hassle free will also certainly be worth the extra money to some people? [deleted] Based on Valve's statement: Yes, this would be totally legit. This is great news.  I rarely ever want a refund of a game on steam.  Usually games I buy either I really want or they are so cheap you might as well just keep them in your library.

A few weeks ago I bought Project Cars.  For perhaps the first time ever I immediately wanted a refund.  They game wasn't what I was looking for, I didn't like the presentation and it felt like ass with a controller.  The only reason I've played for two hours is because I was trying to give it a chance.

That's not a knock on the game in general.  Obviously it has value to some people.  It just has none to me.  Certainly not $50 worth.  If this policy existed then I would've used it right away.  Slight bitter, I must admit :).

With that in mind, I think in some cases a refund policy could be good for sales.  I generally only purchase full price games when I really want to play them.  Maybe now I'll jump on something sooner knowing I can essentially try it for a little under 2 hours risk free.  If I actually like it, I'd keep it. I can imagine this will hurt those "early access" green lights where they rush out complete scrote to try scrape up more money for development. 

Good. Dear indie devs, stop releasing shite as early access. This is making it easy to root for Valve again. They have really been losing me lately. Glad to see them enacting policies befitting a market leader.  Good, seeing how Steam isn't very well curated, it's good to see them having a generous refund policy, especially with all of the terrible Early Access games. This is a big deal.  It still uses steam support though.  Hopefully improved support comes with this change. Another poster's comment indicated that it was automatic. You select the game, select where you want the refunded money to go, and for that person it was refunded no more than 5 min later. Do you download the games you own or do you just put the disc in? You have to download the game, but it's free if you use a 360 copy.  So can I just borrow a bunch of games and get them to download? Do you have to have the disk in to play? &gt;Do you have to have the disk in to play?
  
Most likely, the disk will be used as an authentication key.  I feel like this is very close to what MS was trying to do at the start of the XBone's life.

Edit:  *Close*, but obviously not the same. This is what they did with installing games late in the 360s life. You could install the full game from disk, but you had to keep the disk in the drive to authenticate. No, they were trying to do a digital license tied to your account (and possibly hardware) as the authentication key.  The disk was just another content delivery mechanism along-side downloading. The only hardware aspect of the licenses they were looking to implement was console licensing and in-home sharing. 

With the system they have in place to replace consoles, it would be an absolute nightmare to tie licenses to specific hardware.  &gt; it would be an absolute nightmare to tie licenses to specific hardware

Tell that to Nintendo. it's what both Sony and MS do right now.  Install game, authenticate with disc. No, this is exactly what they are doing with games now. You can download/install any game as long as the disc is in. No disc, no game. This is EXACTLY what they are doing for XBO/PS4 games today though, the disc just acts as a way to copy the whole game to the hard drive and then the disc works as a DRM token.  I get the feeling they're doing this now to warm users back up to the idea of it. It was a great idea, just very badly communicated. If they kept away the online check-in, but let you use the disc if your Xbox is offline, it would have been perfect. I imagine the disc would need to be in there while it runs. Even if it doesn't actually use it.  it's still a good guy microsoft move, plus since you download a bunch of games you'll need more memory space, oh wait whats that microsoft, a 1TB hard drive bundle is coming out, ya don't say You can plug in an external USB 3.0 hard drive right into the back of your XBone if you want more space. I brought a 4tb just for my xbone They did this originally with the 360 but they changed it so that you had to have the disk in because people were doing exactly what you're saying. All games on Xbox One are installed to the HDD, the disc serves as a key to download the X1 packaged version. If you own a retail copy, it downloads a digital version. If you own a digital copy, it'll show up in your game library to download. My poor game library is about to become a lot more crowded. *YOU GET TO BE DOWNLOADED! YOU GET TO BE DOWNLOADED! YOU ALL GET TO BE DOWNLOADED!* *Warning: Hard Drive 97% Full* Good thing they're selling a 1TB version now, right ? As a PC gamer I'll tell you right now 1TB is not enough. My games live on a 5TB drive.  Somebody needs to exercise a little more restraint in the steam sales... Modding can easily add a ton of GB to that. :)  Seems like you download them. Does this include Xbox Live Arcade games? Likely so given Super meat boy was among the preview there. YES YES YES. Ill be able to play my favorite game of all time on the Xbox  one.  This is an incredible move by Microsoft. It's possible that they knew backwards-compatibility was one of the things the PS4 was almost certainly incapable of (given the PS3's unique architecture), and made their move based on how difficult it would be for Sony to counter. Ten bucks says Sony counters with Playstation Now licenses, and provides them if you have the PS3 disc. From my perspective they don't have a choice. If you are an average consumer sitting at home with your ps3 and 360, trying to decide which next gen system to go for, I think it's pretty obvious to go for the one that can also play your entire huge library of 360 games.  I switched to Sony after being a 360 loyalist since release.  I can honestly say that having backwards compatibility would have likely swayed my decision enough to remain Microsoft had it been available when i bought my PS4 in November. I did the same thing, and I'm thinking the exact same as you Why? You still have your 360. I think backwards compatibility is more appealing to someone like me who never had a X360 so has never played Halo 3,4 or GoW. Now I'm considering getting a X1. Because people like convenience and rather have one console in front of their TV than two. Or that there aren't a ton of classic games out for the one yet like there were for the 360 Old consoles can break down and I'd rather put that money towards a new backwards compatible version of the new console as opposed to buying another old console that could break down again. People prefer buying an updated version of a product if they find themselves having to replace it. This is my situation.  My 360 broke in early 2014.  Rather than buy another, I decided to build a new PC.  If I had known that the Xbox One was going to be backwards compatible, that would have been a compelling alternative.  As it is, I've already re-bought several games on the PC that I already owned on Xbox 360. I found out my 360 was totally broken only two days ago (it's been on the fritz for months). This was very good timing.  Difference with Playstation Now is that it costs Sony money to stream the game to you as they need hardware to run and stream it.  I don't see how Sony would give that away for free. Because chances are the feature would not be used that much at all. Backward compatibility seems like one of those features that everyone wants but doesn't actually use much. Sony would look good by offering PSNow licenses for already-owned games, while at the same time might not actually experience too much of a burden on their servers. I could be wrong though, this is just my speculation.  Yeah but that's only going to work as long as they have enough servers to continuously stream the games, while 360 games only need a one-time download on the Xbox One.

PlayStation Now only works in the US/Canada just like OnLive did at its infancy for a good reason, and that is because streaming content not only needs a lot of servers but they also need to be as close to the user as possible to minimize the latency and maximize the bandwidth, and it takes quite an investment to cover all possible regions.

In the meantime, they can get far better profit margins by just selling full price ports of last-gen games with the engine's internal graphics settings slightly turned up. I don't think it's about "countering" so much as "how do we get all these lagging Xbox 360 users to upgrade to the new console?"  The 360 sold 85 million consoles, the One has only sold 12 million.  That's over 70 million console owners that should have some level of brand loyalty, but for some reason MS is really struggling to sell them on the new console.

The market is *plenty* big enough for multiple consoles, and trying to play cat and mouse two years into a console's lifecycle seems much more distracting than productive to me. [deleted] What he meant is that Xbone is trying to hurry up the migration since there are many Xbox fans that haven't bought Xbones yet I'm just saying one easy way to get a large cohort of users to upgrade is backwards compatability, and MS still has about 85% of the 360 user base to go after. That's the purpose of this - not to convince buyers the XB1 is better than the PS4.  That's absolutely huge. Is this a surprise or were people expecting this? Big surprise, did not see this coming at all. At Build last year, someone posed this question to Microsoft engineers, they said it was very difficult but were looking into it. That's what Phil Spencer said when he announced it too. They weren't sure if they could do it. This to me means there's absolutely no excuse for Sony not to. They're gonna have criticism about this just like Microsoft did with the always online thing. 
 
As /u/Nin10dude said: 

&gt; Insert disc into PS4, which then allows you to play the title via PS Now. You need the disc inserted to play it, just like on a PS3. Digital titles on your account should just be accessible. What's stopping them from allowing that? Insert disc into PS4, which then allows you to play the title via PS Now. You need the disc inserted to play it, just like on a PS3. Digital titles on your account should just be accessible. What's stopping them from allowing that?  That's actually what I hoped for PSNow to be, when they first announced it. I mean, PSNow is a clever idea, I give 'em that, but I want to play the games I already own, when I want, and not because my subscription is running out soon. PSNow is probably too expensive to run on a month-to-month basis for Sony to offer it for free, while the compatibility layer is a one-time cost.  Playing the games via PS Now, even with a physical disc, is a distributions rights nightmare.  For instance, a game like Marvel vs Capcom 3 is no longer available for sale (Marvel pulled the rights), so it's not available on any stores thus impossible to play this way.

The other thing I imagine is it would be relatively easy to hack.  Someone could probably make a rootkit that would emulate physical copies of the game. Sure, there are exceptions that wouldn't allow for compatibility with certain titles. Hell, limit it to the titles that are currently available. Doesn't mean that what isn't already possibly available shouldn't be available.  To be fair the PS3 is an entirely different beast compared to the consoles from last gen/this gen. Yeah as a PS4 user I think they'll have a lot of heat on them for this, but my guess is they won't be following Microsoft. Problem is the PS3 processor is a completely different beast. Emulating that thing is WAY more difficult than the PowerPC processor the 360 used. There is a huge excuse still available and that's the technical aspect. The Cell is going to break a lot of PS3 games on any other architecture. Uhh you should probably go look up how the Cell processor works. There is literally no way backwards compatibility will ever be possible for that infamous processor. x64/x86 are much more similar That's due to the fact that the Xbox 360 uses a PowerPC-based instruction set while the Xbox One uses x86.

Basically, you need to write an Xbox 360 emulator for the platform, and that requires a lot of time and manpower to accomplish. Which of course, prompts an interesting question, doesn't there now exist an xbox360 emulator that can run on x86 systems? Microsoft may be letting a genie out of a bottle here.  They kept saying they'd have to put a 360 in it to make it compatible. But I guess they figured it out. I hope cloud saves can be cross platform! Definitely a big surprise. Now the question is what are the first 100 games they're supporting? Perhaps a noobie question: Does backwards compatibility mean that CERTAIN games will get it, or all games? That's a perfectly valid question. I believe the answer they gave was that it was available for every game, it's just up to the developer/publisher as to whether or not they want to enable it. Based on what they said at the press conference it seems any game can be made backwards compatible, but as of right now they are going to roll out with approx. 100 titles by this holiday. Basically, what it sounds like to me right now is that they've managed to successfully make a PPC-to-X86 (or is it X86-64?) recompiler. Is it wrong to think that? Probably. A recompile is a lot more than just "the publisher says ok". It just doesn't "work" - you'd have work to do. It *could* be a full emulator, but those are generally slow. If I had to bet, I'd imagine there's some emulation occurring (BIOS, etc) and the rest is just more like an application compatibility layer like WINE. I don't think anyone saw it coming though industry insiders have been saying that Microsoft will own E3 for the past few days.

Guess we now know why. Backwards compatibility and mods on console? How can Sony possibly beat this. As a former 360 user, and current PS4 user, I think I need a xbox one. [deleted] Wait for Sony's press conference though. They might surprise us. Xbox is even holding back for gamescom, we didn't even see quantum break. When did they say anything about mods? Fallout 4 is going to be mod compatible. However, that's the only game that has it so far Must've missed that part, thanks! What about Doom SnapMap? Is that only PC or on console as well? Not really mod if it's built into the game. That's like saying LittleBigPlanet support mods. Great analogy. I haven't seen much on Doom, but Google tells me it's on console, as well. Although, that's different from Fallout's situation.

SnapMap looks to be a level editor, while on Fallout 4, you can transfer PC mods onto your Xbox One to use them. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] I have no idea how the hell they managed this. Apparently native as well, not emulation. Microsoft have been kicking ass lately. was probably a top level secret for when sales tapered off. Like how Fallout 4 was the break-glass-in-emergency for Bethesda after the angry mob was at their doors for the paid mod thing?

We should march on Gabe Newell's house right away. Maybe we'll get Half Life 3. [deleted] They already did that, and that was "strip Kinect from the base package".

Looks like they had a few more. Including "make Windows 10 more useful for gaming". If they can't have the console market, they'll make damn sure Sony won't keep it for long either.

They don't want Valve taking it all either, so expect some serious aggression from MS in the next few years. As long as it's aggressive innovation and not paying for games to include some shitty GFW successor, that sounds great. It can't be native, the Xbox One runs x86 and the 360 ran Power PC. 

However, Sony has an x86 emulator for the PS3/Cell so this shouldn't be too surprising. 
 Digital download implies it's being recompiled for x86. Games are easy (compared to doing it with an operating system, which they already did a few times)  Huge surprise. Microsoft has stated they've been listening to gamers, which everyone just snubbed off as bullshit. They [did this](http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/19/always-listening-microsoft-thankful-for-vociferous-xbox-one-feedback/). They started talking about Windows 10 with a focus on gamers. But, it appears [they weren't joking](http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/23/7877491/microsoft-pc-gaming-is-very-important-to-windows-10-and-the-companys). 

Now this? I'm honestly shocked to hell and I've never owned an xbox system. But now I may actually consider it. They've delivered on the Xbox end, but I'm still waiting for Microsoft to actually deliver on the PC end. Gamers are more interested in titles to play than new services and clients, so saying they've been listening to PC side is premature until further announcements are made. Until then it's the same thing they've been claiming year after year. With the PC, it seems every two months they say, "Sorry for not paying attention to you, we'll do better. Pinky promise." Nothing happens and two months later they say, "We're paying attention to PC, and by PC, we mean Xbox." Rinse and repeat. This might just be the best thing I've heard in awhile. My 360 stopped reading disks a long time ago. Now I can play my games again!!!

...And finish my brothers games. Same here! I'm glad I didn't get rid of my 360 games I came so close to selling them Honestly, thats Why I have not traded up yet. The *trade*. I want to keep my Xbox 360 games and play them. If I can play them on Xbox One, then I can keep my games and get new ones as well. :( I just sold all my 360 games to buy the Witcher 3 for $3 So does this mean that Xbox One owners get access to the vastly superior Xbox 360 GWG deals??? Yea it seems that way. Now I regret not downloading them all over the last year.  [deleted] [deleted] Couple things...

* They mention 100 titles available by holiday.  Does that imply that they have to add compatibility on a per game basis?  If some of my games might work and some might not, then I may be less interested...

* What's stopping me from borrowing all of my friend's games and downloading the games as if they are mine?  As far as I know, individual discs don't have identifiers so there's no way to identify unique discs, right?  They don't have "serial numbers" of sorts? Maybe you can only play while the disc is in the tray. That's how it worked on the 360. I can't imagine them changing it. &gt;They mention 100 titles available by holiday. Does that imply that they have to add compatibility on a per game basis? If some of my games might work and some might not, then I may be less interested...

Sounds like they're recompiling the game and sending down the binary when you put the disk in. Disk is also required to play. The list thing sounds just like how the 360 was compatible with Xbox games Whoa... Can I dream a little?

- One is essentially a x64, running on AMD GCN, DX12, Windows 10 box. A heavily protected one, but that's it.

- If this is an emulator, it's in software form inside the update pack.

- Someone will inevitably be able to get the 360 PPC interpreter/recompiler code from the update sooner or later.

- Xenia will be obsolete and we'll get a Microsoft-code-powered 360 emulator on Windows 10. &gt; Someone will inevitably be able to get the 360 PPC interpreter/recompiler code from the update sooner or later.

Or better; MS will release the emulator themselves. With Satya Nadella EVERYTHING is possible. Yeah... Satya is the greatest thing to happen to Microsoft in the last 10 years, direction-wise. The recompiling is likely done at Microsoft and you're just downloading a digital game bases on your disks license, not recompiling on the fly I did not expect to ever have a reason to buy an XBox One.  If all of my old 360 games are supported, I will purchase an XBOne.  I never thought I'd say that.  Ever.  

I need to know more about this.  NEED to. So far they've said "100 titles by holiday this year, hundreds more to follow."

And that they're doing all the work, and just need a thumbs up from the developer (meaning teams won't have to worry about doing the extra work to make backwards compatibility available, but they could theoretically camp on a disc if they plan to re-release the game as an "HD Xbox One edition" later, or something).

I'll need to see a list of titles before I commit to putting away my 360, but this looks like it'll be fantastic. Disc in to download, if you don't need the disc after that, suddenly my library is going to become retroactively digital, which will be phenomenal. Extremely doubtful they wouldn't need the disc after otherwise you could just borrow games to get them permanently. I am betting it will be set up like Nintendo's Virtual Console.  They will make these games available to buy digitally for anyone.  The difference here being they will actually allow people who own previous versions to get them for free.  But I think you're right.  There will probably be a flag on the ones unlocked from disc to require a disc to play.  The mess it would make if they somehow rendered the disc unusable but not required would be a nightmare. &gt; So far they've said "100 titles by holiday this year, hundreds more to follow."

I hope this doesn't turn out like the Xbox backwards compatibility for 360. I had high hopes for that and bought a bunch of Xbox games and one day they just said "We are happy with the games you can currently play and we won't add any more" :( &gt; I'll need to see a list of titles before I commit to putting away my 360, but this looks like it'll be fantastic. 

Yeah I am right here with you.  I didn't see that there's just 100 titles on the list so far, thanks for sharing that, i completely missed it.  If all my stuff winds up on their list, I'll wind up getting an XBone just to get rid of the jet engine/360 fan I currently have running next to my tv.  &gt;.&lt; Same. If I can also play my XBLA games I'm sold.  So you never thought you'd buy an XB1, meaning the games they've announced over the last 2 years haven't been enticing enough for you to spend money on the newer console.

But the announcement that you can play games you have for a console you already have is going to make you drop $300 to play games you already own and can already play while not spending $300?

I'm sorry that makes absolutely zero sense. &gt; So you never thought you'd buy an XB1, meaning the games they've announced over the last 2 years haven't been enticing enough for you to spend money on the newer console.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry that makes absolutely zero sense.

These are fair points and I'll answer to them.

In regards to your first point, the games that were announced for the XBone that I had interest in were also announced for the previous gen (GTAV for example).  

As for your second point, I have spent a lot of money on 360 games and DLC.  A *LOT* of money.  One of the bigger ones was Rock Band.  I knew that one was able to have some backwards compatibility (primarily the DLC i believe), but Rock Band alone was not enough to make me want to buy an XBone, even when I have literally hundreds of dollars spent just on those games and their DLC alone.  Even with all the DLC, it's still one game, and I can just hook the 360 up for parties and whatnot if I want to whip that one out.

With backwards compatibility, I can play *other* games I already have on a console that (hopefully) does not sound like a jet engine next to my television.  Also, I may be able to play good 360 games that I missed the first time around (Dragon Age 3, for example, which I still have not picked up).  

I am also not the only person with access to my console.  I keep my 360 games because I love them, and I want to have other people I know share the experience.  If I can share Dragon Age or Mass Effect 2 &amp; 3 or Red Dead Redemption or any of the others with people in my house and they get a better experience out of it than they would have from the old 360, that's a win for me. 

If the XBone can handle my old library, it is a direct upgrade for me and a huge value.  Instead of worrying about buying a new 360 for when my Elite craps out again, I can just get an XBone and upgrade.  

Of course, that's the caveat: if it can handle my old library.  I want to see that list before I whip out my wallet. Just commenting to say this was a very reasonable discussion with logical points on both sides and no idiotic fanboying. I do so prefer this sub over /r/gaming :) Why thank you!  :) This is huge for me.  I have an extensive 360 library, and I would love to be able to keep playing long after my 360 dies. I haven't yet had any reason to buy a Xbone, but this gives me one. Not all 360 games will be ported over...it will be a lot like the original xbox compatibility for the 360. Some will work, but they have to be approved. Only 100 by the Holiday and hundreds more to follow. It won't be put any 360 disc in and play it will have to be on the approved list of games Holy Fuck. Any idea if we have to download the games to the hard drive like we do with One games? If so, then I guess I'll need to pick up a USB 3.0 external drive... They *could* be smart about it and just require you to download the recompiled executable files for the game.  The vast majority of file storage for games is not in the compiled code but in the other resources - textures, audio, environments, etc.  If they could get the XBox One to download only native executables for the game on the 360 disc in your tray, then the game would truly be running natively but the download would be pretty small and it'd just load all the big stuff off the disc. Is it just me or did that Mass Effect clip they showed seem to be like sub 20 fps? Mass effect 1 didn't run very well on 360. I felt that was an odd game to show, rather than like, Gears. Gears ain't backwards compatible. Gotta sell that remaster, son. Is this true? Some games will *not* be BC? Correct. 100 games are currently going to be BC. With "hundreds more" to come.  So it's a lot like the 360 -&gt; OG Xbox backwards compatibility. Yeah it was really low, found that odd. Definitely a bit choppy. To be fair, it runs like that on 360 so, at least they're retaining the user experience from the original. Emulating the 360 on the Xbox One is already a tall order. I can't imagine any games will actually run better in the emulator than on real hardware. Even the 360 couldn't pull that off with OG Xbox games. [deleted] That is how most high level emulators work. The difference here is MS gives you recompiled binaries while most emulators use JIT to make the new binaries on the fly. True interpreters are rare except for when emulating very old hardware. Original Mass Effect didn't run that well on 360. It's not really an action game anyway. &gt; It's not really an action game anyway.

Alright, sure, Mass Effect is relatively story-based, but seriously? That's just plain wrong. It's a goddamn action-RPG. There's tons of combat in the game, and all of it is fast-paced. It's definitely an action game.  Neither is civilization and I still wouldn't want to play that at sub 30fps. They'll *probably* run however well they did on Xbox 360.

Edit: Clarification. It's obviously not absolute, but judging from how other consoles have handled backwards compatibility, don't expect magically improved performance. Console games are optimized for certain hardware, so adding more hardware won't normally increase framerates or anything. The ability to play Red Dead Redemption again after my 360 bricked is the only thing that could possibly make me consider buying a Xbox One. Wow. This seems like a direct attack on Sony's policy of mostly forcing you to rebuy games you already own on different systems. This is awesome, and  I wonder how much tweaking it took to get the Xbox One to do this. Is PSNow out of Beta yet? Is the pricing model set in stone? If not I think they'll be quickly getting disc based and download history verification on the go haha "Natively"? *HOW*? Sure, the 360 wasn't that powerful but there's no way the XBone is powerful enough to emulate the tri-core PowerPC deal in the 360.

They said that all the developer/publisher has to do is approve it for BC. Do they have some hyper-effective-knows-all-the-quirks-of-the-360 compiler or something? Since you have to download the game even if you have the disk, it's clearly new binaries compiled for the x86 XBone. Of course they know everything about the 360 compiler. They created it. Just like they knew everything about the OG Xbox's GPU and were able to make an emulator for 360.

Edit: aka "ports". These are 360 -&gt; Xbone ports. Porting involves adapting the code for a different hardware, OS, and libraries. The OS (Windows) and libraries (DirectX) are already backwards compatible. The hardware is the hurdle. The GPUs are both ATI, which helps immensely; they may even be entirely compatible. Any CPU assembly code would be a challenge, but I suspect that's rare. I wonder about RAM, tho. How hard is it to get Xbone's DDR3 + ESRAM to match up to the 360s GDDR3 + eDRAM? &gt; it's clearly new binaries compiled for the x86 XBone

That would imply they have the source code to every game.  If all the original developer/publisher has to do is approve it for the XBone, then does Microsoft already have the sources?

In addition, normally a port isn't completely straightforward.  You don't just take the sources built for one platform and re-build it for another.  You have to adjust for all the differences in the quirks between the two platforms.

If you ever look at the source code for something that is meant for multiple platforms, you'll see all kinds of macros and #ifdefs everywhere in the code saying do X for platform N and do Y for platform M.

Since the source code for these games was never meant to be multi-platform porting them would probably involve a lot of work.

They must have disassembled the programs, played with the disassembled representations, and rebuilt them for XBone hardware. Doing that on a mass scale is impressive.  I'm guessing eventually there will be some pretty impressive papers written about it. That's what Xbox 360 emulation for the original Xbox was as well. You had to download a package for each game. Those were not ports. Those were different versions of the emulator with hacks tailored to each game to get the best possible performance out of each game. They're doing the same thing here. They're not porting hundreds of games to the Xbox One.  &gt; They're not porting hundreds of games to the Xbox One.

I'm saying that's exactly what they're doing. Emulating PowerPC on x86 in unfeasible. And if they did somehow, you wouldn't have to download the entire game when you have the disk. &gt; Emulating PowerPC on x86 in unfeasible

So [Apple's Rosetta PPC emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_\(software\)) was a myth? Yeah I'm not sure what they mean by native if they don't have a PowerPC chip in the console. It must mean that there is a direct PowerPC to x86 conversion rather than emulating the entire processor. Its certainly possible for them, though obviously still not very easy. I think you have to insert the disc and then download a digital version, probably running in a virtual console. It won't be running straight from the disc. The point is that even with a virtual console, it's hard to imagine them being able to emulate the 360 on the Xbox One specs.

Now, granted, these guys have access to ALL of the hardware's intricacies which is not true of emulators being made by hobbyists on the internet.  But even then, I have a hard time believing it would work well.  Congrats to MS engineers, I guess. They're probably translating ppc assembly to x86 assembly at runtime like xenia does, not emulating the original hardware. So how is this going to affect the sales of "remastered" games?

Or hopefully it just means we will stop seeing "definitive collections" of games that came out 3 years ago ... after the Dishonored definitive collection which was already announced, that is. How backwards? Will it play Xbox games? Can I finally finish Sneak King, and start Toe Jam &amp; Earl 3? [deleted] &gt;won't charge you for the games you already own

Probably referring to the fact that if you want to play old PS1/2/3 games on PS4, you have to pay for a download or stream. That was really a step backwards in my opinion.

I'm able to transfer my games freely between the PS3, PSP and Vita, but the PS4 is locked out, just so they can offer another service? PS2, PS3, PSP, and Vita are all able to play PS1 games at least digitally. I really don't get why the PS4 shouldn't do so as well. &gt; I really don't get why the PS4 shouldn't do so as well.

Might be licencing issues. The publishers need to agree. They might have signed off on the Vita/PSP/PS3 but dont' have an agreement for the PS4 for the downloads. You just put the disk in that you already have, so you wont be charged again. But remember when it is realease you can't just put any 360 disc in a play. It is only a select few games (100 by this Holiday, with Hundreds more to come) so its not real backwards compatibility in the sense that you just put it any 360 disc and play.  I think they were taking a shot at Sony. PS4 has a paid streaming service for PS3 games. Was definitely a shot, PSnow streaming service is a joke. They made it sound like you put the disc in and download it for the Xbox one.  Was thinking about getting an Xbox 360 so I could play some of the classic series like Halo, Gears of War etc. Some of the exclusives that I never got to play because I own Playstation. 

If this works properly I might just get an Xbox One instead so I can also enjoy the new exclusives.

 [deleted] [deleted] Engineers worked towards creating a translation library that would allow them to recompile native source 360 code to native Xbox One code, and this is the result. 360 games will be available digitally for download on Xbox One as they work to get them recompiled. If you own a 360 game disc, put it in the xbox one, it will read the disc and check the license contained on it, and register it to your xbox live account where it will be a part of your digital library permanently, ~~don't need the disc anymore.~~

Edit: My bad, I was slightly mistaken about the disc-based scenario. Although the game is added to your library and you can download it, you cannot play the game without the disc in the drive. That's just one of the unfortunately consequences of old-school DRM on discs. And I'm not 100% sure if that particular license check can be done offline. Oh no, what will happen to the booming industry of HD remakes of games we played a year ago...? I want a PS4, still, for Bloodborne, but this makes that decision harder. Wonder if Sony has anything similar in the pipeline.

Edit: Right. Forgot about PSNow. Guess it never seemed like something I would use. Oh, well. Props to XBox and Windows. Playstation 4 has a streaming service for PS3 games, but it's a paid service. This is a huge step up for xbox. PSNow, but it's streaming/renting. The "we won't make you pay for games you already own" was a nice dig at PSNow. I seriously hope that Sony pulls the same move. It would be great for both platforms and console gamers. Not with so much invested in their streaming service. PSNow is the only option, the Cell in the PS3 is so radically different that emulation is vastly more difficult. [deleted] Could they have PS3 disks act as authentication and allow you to stream your own games for free? It's not the best solution but it's an alternative to at least get backwards compatibility to some extent without having to pay. So, is it streaming, like with PSNow, or is it true backwards compatibility, like with the PS3 at launch? It's not "true" backwards compatibility like the PS3 at launch but it's not streaming either. Basically you insert a 360 disk into your XBone and download the "XBone version" of the 360 game from the online store. At launch there will be 100 or "backwards compatible" games in the store. Here is a link  (http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/backward-compatibility) on  how the backwards compatibility will work and a list of games that they will have on the backwards compatibility for now.  so can I buy a console now and get it in a hardware update, or does it need a whole new batch of consoles? I think it comes in an update It will be a firmware update, beta preview will get it soon and the rest later this year. The fact that my 360 is dying actually makes the XBone an attractive alternative. This is why competition is good for consumers. Microsoft got slammed this generation so they compensated. Sony got slammed last generation so they compensated. The compensations become the norm, consumers win. Hmmmm, how would this affect online multiplayer in games that are on both current and last generation? For example, could I transfer the save files I have for Destiny on the 360 to an Xbox One and play with my old characters? How would this work? I'm really bummed that PS4 isn't doing something similar with their older games.. Renting games or rebuying them for PS Now is kinda lame.  now the xbone has more "exclusives" than the ps4, hilariously with this. this is great news. the Xbone is fucking killing it, even though I don't want either console, the PS4 is not looking good in comparison, as the xbone not only has some exclusives, it has backwards compatibility that isn't through some shitty streaming service or paying for it again. This is the argument taht will make me buy an Xbox One. Sony's conference needs to be **really** special to top this one. As a Ps4 owner I am thrilled for this news, seriously. Not only do Xbone users have access to hundreds of extras titles now, this only brings pressure to Sony to do something like this as well. I look forward to hear what Sony has to offer as this is truly game changing news.  I think it's too late for Sony to pull this off. Most of their exclusive Ps3 titles are remastered on the PS4 now. This won't phase them a bit. Sony got a mad head start thanks to Microsoft's idiotic DRM stuff a few years ago. I would be happy with PS1 and PS2 compatibility if they can't get PS3 games going. They started releasing emulated PS2 games for PS3 a few years back, and PS1 should be able to run on anything these days. I don't see any reason why they don't have both working for PS4. Hell, every other console they've released can play PS1 games, including their handheld systems. Not allowing it on the PS4 is just being lazy. The big question for me is can I transfer my saves? The second question for me would be are there any saves left that I actually need? I'm not actually sure now that I think about it. How many of my old 360 games do I still play?

If you can't transfer, basically all I'd need is to finish ME3 and then I'm all set. Pretty cool. Have an Xbox One, but there's nothing interesting to play on it. Maybe their 360 games have something to offer, since I've never had an Xbox before. I think this works because the old (360/Original XBox) games are being recompiled as native Xbox One executables. It's not technically backwards compatibility so much as a "port" of each game. That's why only a few games work, and third-party publishers have to approve each game.

That's also why Xbox One features work, and disc games still need to download... because they're just Xbox One ports.

That said, there's no reason Sony couldn't do this... recompile and release PS3 games as PS4 executables. But they won't because PS Now. So now let me ask this:

I have GTAV for XBone and my friend has it for 360. Will we be able to play together? Probably not. For one GTAV isn't listed as backwards compatible yet, and two I'm sure Rockstar has the 360 and One MP servers separate, so unless they change something you won't play together. Get to your local Gamestop today! They'll probably have the prices jacked up within the next couple of days. Will the online lobbies be able to merge together?  I.E. If I am playing Black ops 2 online on my Xbone can I play with my buddy if he has the xbox 360? Incoming plethora of cheap 360's! If you ever wanted one as a media console for an alternate room, here's your chance! It's a slow trickle (10 titles now with about 100 total for this holiday) and expect 360 titles with Xbone remaster to not work.
 &gt; "We won't charge you for the games you already own"
- Microsoft, 2015

WHAT IS GOING ON?? This has been a great start to E3, I don't own an XBOX One, but this massive for them.  
So many on the fence 360 owners will have their heads turned by this. So... Between this and the exclusives I guess I'm upgrading to the Xboxone over PS4. Guess my Vita purchase was a mistake... For all the people that complain about the lack of backwards compatibility, now that the Xbox One has it and the PS4 does not, sales should start shifting toward Xbox, right?! It certainly won't hurt. Honestly, if they just delayed the PC version by a month or so, they could have avoided all of this bullshit. PC gamers are used to waiting, as long as it's worth it. Broken games are really common lately and it's hurting the reputation of great devs. Yeah. Look at how long people waited for GTA V. Sure, people voiced displeasure, but it still sold incredibly well and Rockstar's reputation is good because the port was great. the port was great and mods started popping out right after launch. Exactly. Rockstar is getting better and better at PC ports with each one they do. So people are willing to wait because it's usually worth it. Well they used to not be ports at all. Rockstar started out as a PC-only company, then switched over to consoles, and suddenly started making shit ports/no ports at all around the time of GTA 4 and RDR. Now they're slowly coming back to the PC ever since Max Payne 3. They followed the money. Can't fault them for that. Now that PC gaming is becoming more popular, they're coming back strong in that area too.  Red Dead Redemption on PC one day maybe?.. maybe?.. Never. The code is a huge mess that is barely held together and most of the team that worked on it have left Rockstar San Diego.  I read RAGE on GTA IV, as awful as it was on the hardware available at the time, was highly optimized compared to Red Dead Do you have any articles about this? I'm a really big fan of reading about troubled development cycles. I have high hopes for Red Dead on Xbone's backward compatibility.  If I'm not mistaken RDR is in the top 10 most wanted games for backwards compatability. Can't really link a source, but I'm pretty sure I read it on /r/xboxone It's number one. 
http://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/298503-game-requests There are six Call of Duty games in the top 20 Ah awesome! I'm planning on picking up an xbone next year, I hope RDR will be ready by then. Maybe a remake ...or a sequel. That contains a remake. Like Metro 2033 redux. 

Fat chance on it happening, but my wallet would support the endeavour. I feel like they could make an absolute perfect sequel to the Red Dead series and it still wouldn't capture the magic RDR had. Rockstar's reputation may have been hurt a bit by the whole Steam Summer Sale situation They came off as greedy, yes. But the quality of the game speaks for itself. Next time theres a Rockstar PC game, people will be much more exited about it because GTA 5 was a good port. Also, people will forget the summer sale fiasco, but every benchmark out there is going to be using GTA 5 for a long time. I don't think it was. It's one of those things gamers get angry at for 2 weeks and then forget about it. Seriously, nobody seems to remember all the shit they pulled with Vice City and GTA3 when their music licenses expired. What happened? The music they had in the game was only licensed for a certain amount of years, so when the licenses expired, instead of just removing the music from the version they were selling on Steam and other digital distributors, they made an "updated" version that was basically just a mirror of the current mobile version, which ended up breaking the game for a lot of people. Now the only way to get the original version is if you own the disc, didn't auto update an earlier version, or illegally pirate the original version. They did this without warning people, so anyone who had automatic updates turned on basically got all of their saves deleted and had to start over with a broken version. Heck, Rockstar probably double-dipped by delaying for PC because there are people who bought in console first to play it right away and then got in on PC later for the maxed out experience with mods. I know people who even triple dipped. [deleted] They delayed AK twice already so I guess this release date was set by the publisher.  I do recall AA being release after the console version was release by several weeks.  I can't remember the reason though. Realistically only the PC version needed delayed. The PS4 version is quite possibly the best looking game on the console to date. The rain and flying effects on batmans costume are like nothing I've ever seen in a game before. It looks amazing.  If they're taking the entire game off sale, then I think it's safe to assume that this isn't going to be a quick-fix. They really should have just delayed the game on the PC. The damage this will do to them both financially and to their reputation is going to be hard indeed. I don't  think their reputation will be all that badly damaged if they manage to do the gamers right and fix this version. Many botched PC releases never get this treatment. Especially  not so quickly after launch. I wish them the best.  Look at SE with FFXIV. 1.0 was so bad they completely nuked it and started over.

I'd say their reputation just improved because of that. 

If they can make it right, they will be seen as a company that not only realizes mistakes, but fixes them to satisfy their customers.  I love how SE tied the nuking into the games story itself.  and we got a great cutscene too! And that amazing title song. Everything about the intro for reborn was fucking awesome.  It honestly is kind of cool.  And Heavensward so far has been pretty great. Pretty great is an understatement! The story alone blows 2.0 out of the water and puts it up there with some of the FF greats for me. It's just amazing.

Dark Knight is a pretty cool guy too.. Heavensward is quite probably my favourite Final Fantasy story. I haven't had so many feels in a game for quite some time. Couple the great story with great dungeons and areas and it is fucking fabulous :D

Also Griffin mount is fucking badass It seriously is great.  They literally wrote their mistake into game canon. It was fucking brilliant.

   Mind explaining for those of us who've never played? This is the game's intro video, which tells the gist of the story pretty well.

edit: that sphere at the very start is one of the planet's moons. wow, that was very engaging. And I don't know a thing about Final Fantasy.  The only common elements between Roman-numbered FF games are certain monster types,  magic and ability names, and the presence of crystals of some kind - and even all those change a lot in the specifics. Some of them have extended settings and sequels, like VII, X, XII and XIII aren't related to eachother but all have sequels and prequels. Some are just very similar (the races of FFXI are an awful lot like the races of FFXIV, even if they have different names and origins), but XIV is its own story, not part of a pre-existing setting. And now XIV's original version is *literally* unplayable and committed to history, where it now forms the backstory and lore of XIV 2.0 and onward.  &gt; The only common elements between
&gt; Roman-numbered FF games are certain monster types, magic and ability names, and the presence of crystals of some kind - and even all those change a lot in the specifics.


And then there's Cid. Don't forget Cid.
 Where there's a Cid, there's an airship.  And Biggs, and Wedge How do these devs come up with so many different yet popular games? I have never been interested before because I thought I would have to play FF1--&gt;FFXBCXCBVC just to catch up. Well, one, they're one of the largest gaming companies around. Two, the first FF game was back on the god damn NES, so they've had 30 years or something like that to work with. In that time they've made 14 main titles, along with a few spinoffs (Tactics, sequels to main titles like X-II and XIII-2/3, also Kingdom Hearts to an extent).

For comparison, Nintendo has made even more games, including having like 5 main series (Mario, Zelda, Metroid, Pokemon, Smash), each having spinoffs and sequels galore, and they also make consoles. Well, it's taken them like 30 years.  And it's not the same people working on all of them. Well, the thing about Final Fantasy is that very few of the stories are tied together at all. FFX has nothing to do with FFXI or FFXII, and FFVII has nothing to do with FFVIII. FFXIII, the PS3 game, has jack shit to do with FFXIV, the MMO. Holy shit, this is really-really good. They really know how to make CGI cutscenes. That was fantastic. I still think I like FFX's intro the best; that damn attack and shit, whew.

Man, FF games make me wish I kept up with consoles, heh. PS2/Wii were the last two I plan to ever buy; I wish they would make these properly for PC, they would make so much more money. Bahamut, the iconic dragon, comes down from the moon and lays waste to the world. A major NPC sends your characters five years into the future to save you from Bahamut. The real-life time it took to rebuild the game is supposed to represent this time Wait, but how does the land in the video look that good after being destroyed by Bahamut 5 years prior? It doesn't, parts of the world are still destroyed and nature has taken over. Other parts have crystallized from the attack.  The world is pretty big and Bahamut only torched a few parts of it. There's plenty of land that went unscathed. Around the zones he did burn, 5 years later you can still see plenty of destruction and pieces of the moon prison and in the coil itself. . . Bahamut's body parts suspended in the air. One of the fights is actually in his frozen palm/claw. The first time you zone in and pass under a giant crystalized Bahamut wing is pretty mesmerizing.

His main moment was torching two armies just as they clashed, and that area (The Carteneu Plains) is now a PvP zone. Bad guys wanna crash the moon into some people, they succeed but it turns out to hold a giant evil dragon that can bring on an apocalypse, 12 badass mages try to stop the dragon but can't and instead send powerful people(the players) into the future to save the future world.

The time travel part is where the new game begins. &gt;world going through an apocalypse

&gt;send people into the future

In the future, surely everything is fucking blasted???  Am i missing something? Right? Don't you usually send things into the past to stop the world from FUCKING DYING. I haven't played FFXIV. Can you give me a quick summary of how the redo is tied into the story?

EDIT: thanks for the all the replies. As a FF fan, I've never played the online ones but I am interested in FFXIV. Maybe someday I'll play it if it's still popular then. It really was unique though in a way completely unseen in gaming. Others have described the event but it really betrays the gravity of what was being done to the game and how it was a literal rebirth of it, and tying that into the plot in this way that was pretty organic but so deliciously meta. 

Basically you spend the game trying to stop this moon from crashing into the planet, but ultimately fail despite how much work you put into stopping it. As you played, as the end approached, the moon was actually getting bigger until it was this monstrosity in the sky. Meanwhile, in the actual gamey part of the game, there was a countdown until the literal shutting down of the game servers. It was only 2 years after the originally released. The game was originally a failure - and like the developers, it was at the end of it that your attempts to stop the calamity fails. Everyone kind of knew in a meta-sense that they were going to fail. It had to, because they were remaking the game. But as the countdown ran, people amassed in the zones together and became a community one last time just watching to moon descend until the servers shut down for good (for 1.x). Then they were treated to the first viewing of a cinematic detailing their failure, and the near-destruction (not total, but certainly devastating) of the world. Also that totally baller song that I believe was unvieled with the cinematic. The ones that were playing the game when the servers went down were to my knowledge the first to see that cinematic outside of the company. The in-game and literal destruction of MUCH of the work that went into that world. It was such a clever way to tie the reality of it and the game lore together. And then the servers closed!

They literally destroyed the world through the in game raid and story events. Realm Reborn begins after Bahamut (the dragon in the clip) destroys the previous world. I think with the refund system in effect and the bad press in the forum and online reviews from steam probably made there decision a lot easier. It depends on how long it takes them to fix it and what the state of the game is when they release it finally. If it's literally only on par with PS4/XB1, people will still be upset after the delay, I think. I'm not giving them a pass. They royally fucked  up and deserve this shit storm. Maybe it will teach publishers a lesson this time around. [deleted] This time is different.

The fact that this is the first trainrweck AAA game to be released after Steam implemented their refund policy is not a coincidence.

Gamer outrage on the internet is pretty easy for a publishing executive to ignore, but the dollars they are losing are a whole other story.

Hopefully the other publishes will learn WB's lesson without having to make the same mistake. I suspect we'll find out when we see what state the next huge release from Ubisoft ships in. This is why steam refunds are such a major deal. Even if you pre-order a game, if it's a complete mess when it comes out you can refund it for 100% of the money with basically no questions asked. This gives a lot more power to the consumers and will give publishers a reason to make sure the PC release is at least at a minimum standard of quality before releasing. Just stop pre-ordering. Preordering then refunding is probably better, it lets the dev/publisher know just how much they are losing. If they look and see 100,000 preorders that all got refunded because the game is buggy then they'll know they lost a few million bucks because of that and next time they will be willing to spend more time and money getting it right. I think refunding is way better than not pre-ordering

By not pre-ordering, the publisher doesn't know that if low pre-orders are because of lack of interest or people just waiting for reviews

But by refunding a game, you exactly tell them that we do have interest in your game but refunding it because of the shitty quality of your port Or just buying the game day 1 and then (if it sucks) refunding it tells them pretty much the exact same thing. We want the game, but you need to create a functional and valuable product. No preorder necessary. Why not have the opportunity to preload the game and get a refund on day 1 if it's a broken mess? Like it or not, pre-order sales, pre-order exclusives, pre-order free DLC, and other pre-order bonuses (and just "hype" in general) exist and work. Not to mention pre orders let you pre-load the game, which is very beneficial for a LOT of people, especially those with bad internet connections.

I agree that pre-ordering isn't consumer-favorable, but lets face facts and realize pre-orders aren't going anywhere, no matter how often this "just dont pre-order" sentiment is repeated. 

But thanks to steam refunds, we now have a very powerful way to refuse shitty releases. It will force developers to put some serious QA into their PC versions before releasing. This is honestly one of the best things Steam has ever done. Honestly, I think that the fact that they've decided to suspend sales for the time being is only going to do good things for their reputation.  Most folks would release a god awful PC port and let it sit and fester for a few weeks/months before finally releasing a patch.  Kudos to Rocksteady and WB for apologizing to the community and, in recognition of the poor state of the PC version on launch, *refusing to sell it to people* until it's fixed. I'm torn with shit like this. On one hand, it's good when a company responds to feedback and tries to make it right. On the other, they knew the state of the game and released it anyways. The only reason they are doing something major is because the Internet loves to blow up and showered  game with hate (thus hurting sales).

So I'll resolve to buy the GotY edition for a steep discount.  I don't know about batman games. But in battlefield 4, dice Sweden didn't have much manpower to patch the game. It was pretty broken in the early state with random crashes and freeze. 

When dice LA took over the support, they worked on the game and after a while finally patched it. This is being done because Battlefield has a lot of Hardcore fans that stem from the earlier success of the franchise. Not giving them support will result in losing some of this fan base. As it is now, I'm satisfied with the state of Battlefield and may buy the game in the future but no more pre ordering for me.  I have been playing Battlefield since the 1942 and have logged around thousand hours on BF2 and 200+ on BF3 and BFBC2. They lost me after BF3 both because of their shitty support for the game and their change in mindset. They overtly tried to take over this role of being a COD killer and ruined their reputation over their own fans for it. It just became eye candy more and more while the gameplay and the content kept getting shallower. Really? I love bf4. Its basically everything bf3 was but better.  Me too. It's not like bf42 or 2 was particularly deep. Let's not be naive here.

This is happening because of massive refunds are likely bleeding WB right now.  Wait until another AAA title comes out that's this buggy and watch the pre-order sales mean nothing.

It's a reaction to a loss in sales, not simply because of the displeasure of a customerbase.  It just so happens that, right now, there's a mechanism to directly affect a company if their product ends up being substandard even when pre-ordering a game. Spacebase D9 never suspended their sales, shit you can buy it right now for 10 bucks. Neither did [Eternity's Child](http://store.steampowered.com/app/19500/), which has had the last 40% of the game "coming soon" since 2008. It isn't like this stuff is new. Steam has never taken issue with devs selling unfinished crap. So, your saying I shouldn't buy spacebase?  It's abandonware. Yup. I thought it was gonna be amazing, so I bought in really early on.

...fuck me I guess. You have to realise that crowdfunding is essentially a donation drive. There's no guarantee that anything will come of it. If you're intrigued by the concept and want the game but don't want to throw your money at the devs(for one reason or another), just wait for the release The issue with DF is that they abused the Early Access system. Early Access implies there will be a finished game coming later and you are buying the chance to get to play EARLY and provide valuable funds that may help improve the final product which, barring unforeseen events (hence the disclaimer), is coming LATER. 

Early Access revenue should SUPPLEMENT the games funding not be its only way of being funded. DF used early access revenue to pay their professional developers salaries and pay off their other funding sources then cancelled development when early access sales slowed down. 

They should have used KICKSTARTER to get the funds they needed to FINISH the game, then used EARLY ACCESS to give people a chance to play the game and give feed back before release while using the early access money to supplement the kickstarter funding to make the FINISHED game of higher quality. Well, considering some of Tim Schafer's antics, I sometimes wonder if Double Fine cares about their reputation at all. Until it starts hurting sales or the media turns against them like they did with Molyneux they wont care. Has Double Fine gotten any *good* press in recent memory? It seems like, more often than not, many people are content to shit on them for various missteps. Now, I'm not saying that's unjustified, but I do think the overall media opinion has probably *already* shifted from "beloved developer of games like Psychonauts" to "financially struggling developer with repeated mismanagement issues". Ever since Brtal Legend, Tim's competency has been under fire.  Based on the Double Fine Adventure documentary, I think that they really do care. The only problem is that Tim Schafer has always had ridiculously high expectations for all of his games, and his priorities aren't in line.

Not bashing them, I really did enjoy Broken Age, but I don't understand why every single line needed to be acted out by some famous actor. The only reason they're doing this is to stop bleeding money on refunds. I'm not positive but I wouldn't be surprised if steam passes the merchant refund fees back to the dev/publisher. IE not only are they NOT getting the money, they also lose a little bit every time someone refunds to cover the costs of both transactions ( purchase/refund ) MKX had an absolutely terrible PC launch as well.

Don't support WB PC products until they get their shit together, IMO. There been so many instances where companies have come out and given PR speak about how they are working on improving things, and not delivered.

This move actually gives me a lot of hope that they are actually dedicated to fixing the issues. I hope in the future companies aren't afraid to delay the release of the PC copy if further work is needed. People will complain about the delay, but if the quality of the product is good then people will respond positively like they did for GTA V. It could very well be a fix that only takes a couple of days but they know the majority of steam reviews would take place in those first couple of days. This is entirely thanks to Steam refunds. Without it they would've made enough off pre orders to justify leaving the shit port. Like they are doing with Mortal Kombat X Not quite true, as it looks like they have dumped HVS and brought QLoc on board to fix the mess Ah nice. I tried it last when they released the Tanya DLC, and that patch made that game even worse than before. I'll check back once Predator comes out I guess. "You're Welcome" - EU Trade Commision Wow, this is unprecedented. I've never heard of anything like this. I'm honestly shocked that they're going to suspend future sales.

Now, let's hope all the spit, shine, and polish pays off.  well thats because the reviews are so bad for it and so many people are refunding the game that they actually have to take action. This is what refunds are for. All those whining about refunds hurting indie devs just need to look at this as a shining example of why we *need* refunds on a digital distribution platform. Without them gamers would have no recourse to get their money back and Rocksteady/WB could (and probably would) have laughed in our faces as PC gamers' money lined their pockets.  
  
Imagine what could have happened with Aliens: Colonial Marines if we had refunds at that point. you just got me really angry at ACM again. I still want to refund that POS. Pretty sure Final Fantasy 14 was complete taken off after their abysmal launch and then reboot/relaunch later as a completely new game.

EDIT: Seems it was still being sold just terrible. My mistake. They let it go for quite a lot longer than Arkham Knight.  This was out for one day. It wasn't due to tech issues either.  It was just shitty. Good point It was? It felt like at least a week... the internet has screwed with my perception of time. They let it go but didn't charge people subscriptions for around or even over a year. It wasn't taken off immediately. They waived the subscription fee for over a year and the game was running and even receiving content updates for about 2 years. The story culminated in a battle were Dalamund (the false moon containing bahamut) was pulled toward Eorzea and released the primal which destroyed and reshaped much of the world. The heroes of light (players) were saved and teleported into the future where Eorzea was recovering from the event. Anyway they shut down the servers before Dalamund fell and I believe everyone who was logged on got the cool cinematic showing Bahamut being released.

Pretty amazing feat they accomplished, rebuilding a game while supporting their current failure and being able to tie the relaunch into the lore. And IMO it's the best MMO currently available. [The (totally fucking rad) cinematic mentioned above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39j5v8jlndM).

 Never played an FF game ever and that cinematic was absolutely amazing. The whole red vs blue thing near the end was some of the best artistic direction I have seen in a while.  That was a pretty radically different situation. ff14 wasn't broken, it was just really shitty. Also, it was out for a significantly long time before it was taken down (over a year). They didn't take the game down to fix it, they took the game down to *remake* it. Arkham knight isn't being remade. Steam refund policy...With so many negative press the game got allot of people who are interested in it probably just buy it now to see how bad it really is on their PC and then refund it with in the two hour limit. It is more unlikely that those customers come back after a few patches compared to when they never see the  game in its bugged out state.

Plus the negative feedback of PC users will affect their console sales as well. This may actually be an added benefit of the refund policy. 
Maybe we can see this kind of group action take place in the future for other shitty ports. ArenaNet suspended sales of Guild Wars 2 shortly after launch because their server capacity couldn't handle the player load.  That's almost even more impressive to me. Yeah, but there wasn't a huge issue with the game. They just underestimated the demand on their servers. That happens frequently at launch with MMOs. This is the result of all kinds of bugs, missing features, etc. I wouldn't say the two are very similar. Yep, aside from the auction house not working due to server load for two weeks, the actual game itself had no major issues. It was as smooth as an MMO launch can go. That was my point.  

Warner Bros took Arkham Knight down because it was unequivocally *bad*.  

There was nothing major wrong with Guild Wars 2 other than the server load. And yes, you're right, server load with MMOs is a very common issue.  But when have you ever seen another MMO or always online game suspend sales in an effort to relieve the stress for people who have already paid money for their game?

ArenaNet taking down sales in an effort to better their player's experience of an already great game is more impressive to me than Warner taking down sales of a disastrous fuck up. Ah. I see what you're getting at. Yeah. I agree. It's more impressive because it shows they care. WB only did it because they were losing money and trying to save face after their last two PR statements caused more outrage. PC performance test said average of 48 fps for me (min 34). 90% of the time the game is smooth and playable. But that 10%.. oh man. Occasionally game drops below 10 fps for upwards of 30 seconds! You can imagine that in middle of a fight or while driving this is a serious issue. There are freezes where the game simply stops for several seconds and then continues. This was after I disabled VSYNC. With VSYNC on, the stuttering was constant and unbearable.

I was lucky enough to have relatively little issues (I can power through these stutters and freezes), but many people are reporting that the game is completely unplayable for them. So I think this is the correct way to handle things until issues have been fixed. But I don't think this has been done before? At least not in my recent memory. [deleted] This makes me wonder if the relaunch will be under a different entry in the Steam catalog, essentially wiping all of the existing reviews. Unlikely, the store page is still up and says  
&gt;Batman: Arkham Knight will be available on SteamOS, Linux and Mac in Fall 2015  
  
Probably they will be using the same page for the re-release as well.  It'll be the "Arkham Knight Rises Edition" or something Of course they won't do that. Everyone would just re-add their reviews, angrier than before.  a few might, maybe even the majority, but I bet they could get down to mostly negative Unless... you know, it works when they re-release it Exactly this. When Bethesda introduced the paid mods for Skyrim, the reviews went from around 96-98% positive to ~80% positive. And that was just for paid mods which didn't really affect the actual core game. 

If they re-release Batman and even keep all the negative reviews - which they'll likely do because they'll probably push it out as an update and just keep the same store page etc. - then a lot of those would turn positive should the game work and actually turn out well.

It looks to me like Rocksteady may have actually forced Warner Bro's hand in this instance for all WB is the publisher, Rocksteady will want their reputation protected for any future IPs. Rocksteady is owned by WB. They are not independent but funded like Avalanche (who works with both WB and Squeenix), they are closer to Bioware except with probably less meddling.

Rocksteady probably had something to do with it to force their hand as you say, but it's in the best interest of both. Dont understand why they didn't delay the PC launch to begin with, If I remember they delayed the Arkham City port by a month too(AC didn't have visual downgrades compared to the console version and actually looked much better with the DX11 effects, but it still ran like shit, so dont know how much good this will do). Sad thing is they knew it ran like shit and then probably decided to lim the FPS to 30 so that it would run fine on most PCs at launch. Hopefully they sort their stuff out cause I really wanna play this. I imagine it had something to do with this release window. They had an opportunity to launch before a several huge titles and they took it.  It makes sense to avoid the noise and a crowd but it bit them in the ass big time.  Holy shit, that is insane. I have it on PC with very little problems, but it must be unplayable for a lot of people (and not just shitty) for them to stop selling it. How in the world were they THAT unaware of the state of the product? I'm not even contributing this to the company thinking they could pawn off a crappy product to PC users. I think they were just completely unaware how bad it was, like they checked if it launches and thought "Eh, good enough!" Honestly it's not just performance. The graphics are severely bugged too and I hope they are also a priority. The textures themselves have awful streaming issues (A lot of textures flat out just [fail](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/689397333172041579/1FEF7906C2858666333E0A770FDE73F23A66A24B/) to [load](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/689397333172038574/07F58EA3E47BC78E81C0728B5250E475DF0614A9/) in unless you wait a long time) and they are sub par to what we saw in the Nvidia showcase, limited only to 'Normal' for some bizarre reason.

Additionally some other graphical effects like HBAO and enhanced rain have been  omitted entirely even though they are clearly present in the console versions. Digital Foundry covered this [here.](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2015-batman-arkham-knight-pc-lacks-console-visual-features)


 Arkham Knight is also missing a number of graphical settings present in Origins. In Origins, you had maybe seven different versions of anti-aliasing alone. FXAA Low or High, MSAA 2x, 4x and 8x, and TXAA Low or High if you had a recent Nvidia card.

In Arkham Knight, you have "On" or "Off." They don't even tell you what kind of AA you're enabling, or how much. I've been playing games for a long time, and I don't remember ever seeing that before.

In Origins, you can actually toggle motion blur off, and set ambient occlusion to Off, Normal, or High. In AK, there doesn't appear to be any AO at all, or it's bugged, And no amount of fiddling with .INI files can get rid of the motion blur, which appears to be causing performance degradation every time you move the camera around.

Edit: Also, no in-game mouse sensitivity adjustment. You have to dive into an .INI file and do trial and error, because the default is "30," but you don't know how it scales. Every adjustment of that requires restarting the game. Pointer acceleration is also on by default and can only be disabled by digging up another .INI entry.

Texture resolution also maxes out at "Normal," even if you have a Titan X with 12GB of VRAM.

This game needs more than a patch. I think Normal is just a name, the two texture presets are pretty much "PS4 standard" or "Lower than PS4 standard". If they changed the word 'normal' to 'ultra', 99% of gamers wouldn't notice.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xgx4k83zzc I think you meant omitted.  [deleted] Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if the reason for them to suspend sales was due largely to the fact that customers can actually get refunds for their digital purchases through steam, and other online retailers like gmg we're announcing that they would allow customers to refund the title as well. 

We've had shitty PC releases before, but up until now companies just give us a very PR spun"well tough shit. Deal with it." But now that the stand to actively lose money on a poorly put out product, they have an incentive to take the steps to remedy it sooner than later.   I'm pretty much certain they're related..  Suspending sales on a buggy blockbuster port is unprecedented, as is the launch of a buggy blockbuster port where refunds are possible and almost definitely happening by the boatload.  It's really unlikely that somebody who refunds a game is going to buy it again when (if) it's fixed, so they have to do damage control for future sales. This is a PR move, and a smart one. Everyone is blaming Rocksteady for this (even though they probably did nothing for the port but provide assets), so Rocksteady is getting out ahead of it. Why tarnish their name. There are probably tons of games getting refunded, so they are losing money. Suspending the game might save them money in the long term. Regardless PC sales usually make up 10-20%~ of a AAA games sales, so why risk your name over it. Their name is already a bit tarnished for me. They handed the assets over to a company and at best provided no oversight and let the sub company just barf it out, or at worst simply thought no one would notice or just didn't care that it randomly bogged to 5fps on beast hardware while still missing graphical effects.

There's no scenario for what happened where the customer came first in this thought process 6_6 Yeah, I thought it might be just a large overreaction, but if you look at the Steam forums and user reviews you can see that it actually seems like a majority of the people who own the game on PC are having serious issues with it. Even if you were just basing it on the reviews, which would be a bad thing to base it on, 70% of the people who own it on Steam are having issues trying to play it.  Yea, certainly isn't an overreaction like some people seem to think. Just because it's been mostly smooth for one person doesn't mean it's like that for everyone.  The people who are claiming "smooth" also tend to be running 980s or better - and they're getting 70 fps "smooth" with dips in the 40s.

Which is ridiculous, that's grossly inefficient especially when you compare it to the graphics quality, resolutions and system usage of other AAA titles (GTA5 and Witcher 3 being good examples).

It's a disgustingly inefficient use of hardware. 90% of people don't mention their resolution either. Saw a guy on the steam forums claiming everybody was overreacting and the game ran perfectly fine. Then it transpired his idea of fine was running the game on his laptop at 800x600. Took me by complete surprise, as well. After editing the game's config .ini, I've managed to get a fairly consistent 50-60fps and have since thought the problem has been vastly exaggerated. I was obviously wrong. Having to go into ini file is a problem. Work arounds shouldnt be seen as fixes. Not only that, but Rocksteady told people *not* to edit the ini. True but if changing the ini does fix the problem, then it should be a simple patch to fix the game. No need to halt sales. So I just got a brand new evga 980 super clock today and it came with B:AK. I was wondering how widespread this problem was and if it would effect me. After playing for about a half hour I noticed:

* 60 fps if I'm just standing around
* &lt; 30fps gliding
* &lt;= 20fps if I'm powersliding the batmobile
* Cutscenes stutter and go from 60fps down to 20fps
* I tried calling the batmobile once and it went down to ~10fps

I didn't pay for the game obviously but it did influence my choice of cards.


 I wouldn't be surprised if this is an issue related to certain builds. I got a i7-4790k, a GTX 970, 16gb of RAM and I'm running this game on Ultra, including the NVIDIA Gameworks stuff, without any performance or texture issues. I'm 20 hours in and I've had frame drops once or twice when driving the Batmobile and the game crashed on me once and that was while I was exiting the game.  I think a lot of people also take issue with the fact that turning off motion blur seems to force the game to redownload it entirely, turning off depth of field makes some things invisible. I haven't had a chance to play yet (its still downloading) but if those reports are wide spread and true then its a pretty terrible issue and one that should have been QAed immediately. They would not have withheld review codes for PC centric reviewers if they didn't know how bad the problem was.  Make no mistake. Steam refunds allowed for this to happen. Without them, they wouldn't have cared. I'm sure they lost a ton of money over the past few days due to refunds. This is absolutely incredible. I hope it was the reviews and refunds that pushed this to happen. But I can't help but think about how foolish Rocksteady and Warner Brothers look right now even after this move. I hope this doesn't take too long to fix, but I'm not sure I'm so optimistic at the moment. This is the second terrible Warner Brothers PC port this year and they don't give a rats ass about the first one so I'm guessing this is entirely a Rocksteady move. Or maybe steam refunds had an effect?  Back when mkx came out, refunds weren't a thing. It's far more difficult to pull this shit now. Steam refunds are definitely a game-changer.  We can say STOP PREORDERING until we are blue in the face, but thousands of people do it anyway.

By giving these people a recourse with Steam refunds publishers are now SOL if they release a bad game on PC.  Make no mistake, people will get fired over this behind the scenes because the amount of money lost can finally be counted in dollars and cents.  It's not just a nebulous 'that hurt our reputation but we'll do better next time'.  No, it's 'we just lost $1 million because our PC port was too buggy'. That can change the industry over time - for the better I hope.

Ubisoft in particular must feel incredibly lucky refunds were not possible when they launched Unity... As someone else said above the preorder+refund combo actually carries an even stronger message: preorders show how much people look forward to the title, while refunds are the money the publisher lose if their product isn't up to par.

Not that this should justify pre-orders in general, the best thing would be still not preordering at all, but at least this is a wake up call they can't miss.

Ubisoft and the others better learn from this. That's a big surprise. I assume third party sellers will still have redeemable codes but this is an unprecedented move, which i only imagine could be due to high rates of steam refunds or a desperate PR move. 

They never should have contracted this to iron galaxy. This happened with arkham origins which also had a rough start, and their track record isn't great - if you ever played the vita version of borderlands 2 you'll see horrible textures, tonnes of bugs, and a framerate that dips to single figures when 4 characters are on screen. WB was tempting fate from the start. &gt; high rates of steam refunds 

Previously if you bought a shitty game you were stuck with it. Publishers didn't have to give a shit because they already had your money, and you'd probably forget about it by the next time they released something.

Now, pissed off users can finally request a refund and that sends a *much* clearer message than a bunch of angry forum threads ever will. Imagine if there were steam refunds for Aliens: CM? Or assassins creed 4 

Edit: I did in fact mean unity. It's hard to keep up.  AC4 was fine and had a decent port, I think you meant AC3 or Unity. Is there any equivalent recourse of returns for console users? Makes me wonder if PC could become even more neglected in the future because they don't have to be held as financially accountable for a shitty game on consoles (Looking at you Microsoft, thanks for that piece of shit Master Chief Collection). In the EU and other parts of the world, refunds are a legal right for many goods, including games, which is one of the reasons Steam *had* to implement it, but they choose to implement it globally instead (which was a good move from them). 

As a dev, it doesn't make me feel less about PC, just now I know that my games will be more fairly judged when I finally get to releasing on Steam. I really don't like the idea of making money off of the fact refunds don't exist. Refunds have always been the norm to me, not allowing them is the exception. It depends entirely on the retailer you purchased from.

Some of them will do refunds, others will not. &gt; Dear Batman: Arkham Knight PC owners, 
&gt; 
&gt; We want to apologize to those of you who are experiencing performance issues with Batman: Arkham Knight on PC. We take these issues very seriously and have therefore decided to suspend future game sales of the PC version while we work to address these issues to satisfy our quality standards. We greatly value our customers and know that while there are a significant amount of players who are enjoying the game on PC, we want to do whatever we can to make the experience better for PC players overall. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you to those players who have already given valuable feedback. We are continuously monitoring all threads posted in the Official Batman: Arkham Knight Community and Steam forums, as well as any issues logged with our Customer Support (http://support.wbgames.com/). If you purchased your copy of the game and are not satisfied with your experience, then we ask for your patience while these issues are resolved. If desired, you can request a refund at https://help.steampowered.com (Steam refund policies can be found here: http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds) or the retail location where you purchased the game. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Batman: Arkham fans have continually supported the franchise to its current height of success, and we want to thank you for your patience as we work to deliver an updated version of Batman: Arkham Knight on PC so you can all enjoy the final chapter of the Batman: Arkham series as it was meant to be played.  Hopefully when they put it back on sale it's 60fps capable and has ambient occlusion working correctly. anyone notice they reset the voting on the Steam user reviews?  the most helpful review has 25 votes, there used to be thousands. Not reset, They just tagged them all as funny and they hide those from the helpful reviews.  They're all still there, but as before they're not really helpful when they're just cracking jokes and not even pointing out the very real issues with the game. Honestly, i'm a forgiving person. I didn't pre order specifically to avoid this mess, but i'll definitely buy it in a year or so if all of the problems are fixed. Apparently someone isn't happy about the number of refunds they've had to give.

Thanks, Steam and GMG.   Seems like damage control to me, all those negative reviews must be really (and deservingly) taking there toll. I imagine most people are just refunding the game at this point anyways so it's probably not going to make a massive difference.

Still, it's something a little more positive from what they released earlier. I can't imagine they will want the game off of steam for very long so it hopefully implies that a 'fix' might be on its way soon. At this rate Rocksteady should just take the port away from Iron Galaxy and just try and salvage it themselves now they've wrapped up on the console versions. 
 I think it was the refund tidal wave that forced their hand.  What a great feature that is. The recent GMG statement probably helped as well, seeing how lots of people bought the game from them, since it was like, 50% off. Or was it 40%? I got the premium edition for $54, that GMG is willing to refund that says a lot about how great that company is. 40%.  I was one of those people.  To be honest, I don't regret it.  But I am prepared to take the refund if things don't improve.  It's weird. I think they took it out for one reason: it wasn't selling. The game was #1 on Steam for only a few hours and then dropped to third behind Ark and GTA. So yeah, it probably was selling very below expected and it was with a 70% disapproval rate. We're talking millions of dollars below expected...

So what do they do? They stop selling it, fix the issue, and then in a month or so when the shitstorm is over they get basically a second launch window marketing as if they redeemed themselves. If they are smart, they will probably throw a DLC or two... Of course it's damage control. But this is what they had to do. Ratings were getting worse and worse, people were requesting refunds, and their PR attempts failed. Obviously it's going to take some time to get things fixed and it doesn't make sense to leave it up during that time if it's going to take a few weeks or months. I'm thinking this is solely because of steam refunds. Didn't MKX ship from the same publisher in a similiar state for PC a few months back and nothing really came out of it? 
&amp;nbsp;

So if this is any indication of whats to come, PC ports might be treated with more care. With MKX, they probably made enough off their preorders to stop giving a shit. With the inclusion of steam refunds, however, it's hurting their bottom line. Now they can't just let it slide anymore. So what happens now if you buy a graphics card that bundles the game?  You continue to play Witcher 3 and wait for Batman to be fixed before booting it up, like me :P Wow, I almost upgraded my PC this week and picked this up but on a whim I decided to wait another week. Looks like I made the right choice... Despite who is to blame, be it the port company, Rocksteady, Warner Bros. what is absolutely certain is that Arkham Knight really has burned a lot of the goodwill that the franchise has generated. 

All those past wounds of Arkham City's PC issues, Origins have issues that remain to this day (and the statement along the point of "We've moved on to do DLC, if it's not fixed in this patch it's not going to get fixed") are reopened. 

Yes, good things can come out of this problem: namely, the Steam refund system has given users the ability to have a lot more control over their purchases, and that given the opportunity and market share, other outlets will follow suit with refunds if things aren't fixed. 

Maybe this is the first big push that developers and porters need to establish that with refunds in hand and readily available on multiple platforms, they cannot continue to neglect and abuse the PC gaming space in the face of the amount of revenue it generates for their own benefit. 

As someone who almost pre-ordered, but chose not to following the report of a lack of PC review codes (I didn't assume the game would be broken, but it made me think back to WB's pre-review stipulations for Shadow of Mordor and gave me an uneasy feeling), I have absolutely no pleasure in this. I looked forward to Arkham Knight. I am having to actively avoid streams, discussion threads, and other gaming outlets *because* I care about the experience of playing it. 

The most unfortunate thing as I see it, is that this is not the first shitbomb that Warner Bros. games have been party to in recent history. They are establishing a reputation as the possessors of amazing talent that they are unwilling or unable to curate correctly. 

The only WB released games in the last few years that have been spared such drama is the LEGO series (Lego: The Hobbit being the exception, as it remains an unfinished game due to licensing issues, but still delivering less than what players paid for).  I can't even run the game for longer than 10 minutes without it crashing due to a RAM issue. The game eats up all 8GB of my RAM fast. The fact that they're telling users to let Windows manage their page file is a sign that they know they screwed up on keeping memory usage to a reasonable amount.  I'm running a machine with 12GB of RAM with Riva showing me usage and temps. A play session will beginning with about 7 total (counting whatever the system is using in the background) being used after opening the game. It will slowly go up to 8 and after an hour or two it'll be at 9. When it starts reaching 10, the stuttering begins and I have to reboot the game. In the past, I've come to the expectation that a game with a bad port will stay a bad port. The company will say, "We fucked up. We're releasing patches to fix the game we fucked up." But in the end, it stays a bad port. It doesn't get fixed. 

Rocksteady has gone above expectations in this regard. I thought they'd say they'd fix it like every other producer and just let the pc port sit and fester.

Instead, they removed the pc version of Batmam: Arkham Knight from sale, which no one else has done before. I think Rocksteady really cares about the PC port. They recognize they fucked up. They want to fix it. 

I really hope I'm right. I hope they fix it. I hope they set a standard for other companies, even though their sales might drop.

I hope their sales increase because of this, even though history shows that won't be the case. Battlefield was released with huge problems and it still made bank. The Sims got released as a totally unplayable piece of shit and it still made bank. I want this game to be different. 

I want Arkham Knight to actually get fixed. I want it to be a good game. **Conspiracy theory:**

Valve threatened to pull the game from Steam due to the high number of refund requests. WB then pulled the game from all online stores to try and make it look like it was their decision.  Well, this was the Steam store front page on launch day: http://imgusers.com/images/2015/06/24/batman-arkham-knight-steam-store-page.png

Yesterday it was actually quite difficult to find... It sounds like they're doing this because of GreenManGaming's threat of processing refunds to Warner Bros, which would get the keys removed from steam, which would lead to the game being removed from steam because of all the revoked keys. They're instead putting themselves in control of the game's removal.  When ports get outsourced, it'd be nice if the original developers got some sort of final right of approval. It's honestly seeming like that never happens with games. Do two things to 'gain' *SOME* rep back, WB:

1. Fix the damn game. SO many issues.
2. Compensate PC gamers by offering free DLC. Heck, maybe do what Ubisoft did and offer a game or season pass.

Done and done. I hope they pull through with 1, but don't get your hopes up for 2. They're incurring significant expense by canceling the release and adding extra engineering time. They're not gonna cut into their potential profits even further by offering free DLC for a fraction of their player base. Perhaps they'll give you some additional content like free skins and side quests for the game, but they most definitely still want you to pay for that DLC. I would hope that seeing them take the entire game off the shelves this shows they are serious when they say they're going to fix it. Can't wait for the relaunch in August with a free extra DLC and maybe a re branding of the PC version. Of course we can play the smartasses now and say "You should have waited with PC release!" or we can just acknowledge what a freaking big step this has to be for the company and how effective steams refund policy seems to be. Remember how everyone was saying GTA5 on pc was an awful port?

No?

Thats why you delay it until its ready. When TotalBiscuit said on twitter that reviewers were not getting review code for the PC version of this game, and suggested not pre-ordering, a ton of people on this subreddit accused him of giving "marching orders."  Apparently, WB just never releases PC code on time as a policy, and their games always are fine regardless of this baseless practice.  Anyone urging caution was just trying to tell you how to spend your hard earned money.

Those people are conspicuously absent from this thread, or have changed their tune.  Honestly, I said it then and I'll say it again, if you preorder a PC game in 2015 you are either willfully ignorant or financially irresponsible.  Even with Steam refunds it is still an issue, you only have a small amount of time to play the game before you can no longer refund it, and you still have developers pay-walling part of the game that should have been there to begin with.

This isn't something TB is trying to push on the PC gaming crowd, this is COMMON SENSE resulting from this community being burned over and over and over again by the same shitty companies who couldn't care less about making a decent PC port.  This is a systemic failure of the industry, not an invented problem, and I'm sick of people coming to the defense of these companies who couldn't care less about them. I find it a little strange how gamers will push back against anything... even against their own basic interests. Honestly, I think a lot of it is that financially irresponsible people don't like being reminded that they made a bad/impulsive purchase.  Game critics are just doing their job by informing people about value, but some people confuse individualism with the inability to take good advice.  

If you really want a game, it can be hard to hear that your preorder might not have been smart.  People get extremely defensive about this stuff, especially when they know deep down they shouldn't have spent the money. I hope this means it will actually get fixed.  Certainly a step above being told Origins couldn't be fixed because they were too busy making DLC. "Now that there is a big chance you will ask for a refund once you buy our shitty game we will simply withold it because that costs us money, instead of leaving it there rotting like we did before." Wow. That was... honestly unexpected. Given how crap the previous Arkham games were with fixing their bugs (Origins is still glitchy, eighteen months after release) and WB's stance in general on patching their games, this is quite the shock. Perhaps it's just Rocksteady screaming that they need to run damage control, but it's still surprising. Perhaps they realized that people would start asking for refunds now and all the bad press was building up too quickly.

Regardless, credit to Rocksteady. Let's see how fast they can untangle this shoelace. Sounds like "it's broken, so please don't buy it until we think it's fixed so you don't tell your friends not to get it." It's good they're acknowledging it. Would be nice actually if they'd offer up a digital download for a console for people with an active steam installation, but I can imagine how that'd be abused. "we are getting our ass handed to us with refunds, we are going to try and salvage this turd before we all get fired" I wonder how much of a factor steam refunds were in this decision.  I'm sure that Arkham Knight was setting some new all time records for refunds.  This is why steam should have had that system in place since day one. Release a broken product on PC? Well now it's not so simple as customers being stuck with it and developers making off with the money.  I wish WB well on this, hopefully they get everything sorted out and can do a proper re-launch with a product that is in a state worthy of being shipped. Maybe give the PC port more attention than 12 people can manage in 6 weeks. How about. How did it pass your Quality assurance at first place? So it seems they're going to announce/tease it before E3. They probably knew it wasn't gonna be a surprise announcement anyway.

Either way, gonna be exciting! &gt; They probably knew it wasn't gonna be a surprise announcement anyway.

And decrease the risks of having a leak from somewhere.. I'm flabbergasted this game hasn't had a huge leak by now in this day and age. [deleted] This has been sealed tight.  Other than that, I remember an asset leak (last month?) that had no known game origin, and it was speculated to be F4, but there was no hard evidence. Pretty sure that ended up being from one of the new Tomb Raiders? There was also Ron Perlman tweeting he wasn't in fallout 4 about a year ago.  I know he supposedly hates doing the games (just for the sheer amount of ending slides needing narrating) but that's a damn shame. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Maybe they will try to get the announcement out so they can get some gameplay at E3 Possible?  I think with that image and the URL being fallout.bethsoft.com, I'm gonna go ahead and say, yes, a Fallout 4 announcement.

Though it would be funny if all this was just building up to a Fallout 3 remaster. It's going to be fallout 4, not a remake.

is anybody really expecting it not to be a buggy mess when it comes out?  It's kind of their thing IMO New Vegas was more entertaining than FO3, and I loved FO3. But since when was Fallout New Vegas a fuck up? I thought it was the best Fallout game. :( Thats cross domains though, so they want people who look for that term to be directed there. They may choose to not call it Fallout 4, but it will undoubtedly be another Fallout game. That's just for the analytics tracking, since they have both urls going to the same content.

    .announcement-preorder .form-dropdown-option {...}

404 on the image.

There's a preorder form on that page tomorrow. Yeah preorders on Pc, Ps4, and Xbox One Based on the icon.png list in the CSS, it looks like it's going to 360 and PS3 too. That ain't good. But it's understandable, since the game has likely been in development since before the release of the current console generation. And hopefully it's only available on those platforms. I'm guessing it will be.  And IOS which it was developed for iOS for the apple watch of course. A bit small but integrating smart watches as pip boys would be kind of cool... Why would they not integrate something that has a similar *size* and *functionality* to the PipBoy though? Like, I don't know, maybe **a phone**? I'm imagining somebody strapping a 7-inch tablet to a 10-year-old's wrist. Samsung Pip^ 7! I'm having this irrational fear of it actually being like a Fallout MMO or some shit. People might want that, but I absolutely detest MMOs and hope it isn't that. I don't think they'd do that. Especially after ESO went over so poorly. If they do it anyway, holy shit the nerd rage.  Yeah the sodium levels would be rabid. Fallout Mobile!

&gt;PA system failure has occured.
            Shutdown of the Masterbrain has been authorized and all sensitive materials have been removed for security purposes.
            Please attempt re-access. Have a pleasant day. Definitely. Seems like a warning message that might occur if a Vault were to fail. It might be a hint to something else completely. Masterbrain would probably be some sort of computer/AI. 

Either way, it's definitely related to Fallout and not random code. The Masterbrain was a mob in Fallout 3 in the Vault-Tec headquarters. 

http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Vault-Tec_headquarters There is probably more than one of those. Maybe one will be a major character in Fallout 4 similar to Mr. House from New Vegas or Calvert/The Brain from Point Lookout.

If the speculation is correct and Fallout 4 will revolve around the Commonwealth and the Institute, it would make sense since all we really know about them aside from where they're located (Massachusetts) is that they have advanced technology.

Maybe we'd get to play as an escaped android like Harkness. All speculation of course, but it would be interesting. &gt;Masterbrain would probably be some sort of computer/AI.

Masterbrain was in Fallout 3.

&gt;The Masterbrain was manufactured for the Vault-Tec Corporation to act as a kill-switch for all other robotic security measures within the headquarters. It still remains active 200 years after the Great War. The Masterbrain is identified by the large Vault-Tec logo on its chassis.

http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Masterbrain In lieu of a human Overseer, perhaps? Could be, the Overseer's job was making sure the experiment ran well first, safety of the residents second. This could easily be done by an A.I similar to Henry Eden. Considering Vault Tec and the Enclave were closely related, it wouldn't surprise me if Vault Tec had access to the same type of technology. Also the name Masterbrain would be perfect for an organisation as insane as Vaulttec. Could be that vaults experiment. What happens if we replace the human overseer with a computer? I remember reading a fan story that actually did this. Spoiler, what happened was the water supply was faulty and the computer was mysteriously killing more and more people off in accidents as the water supply deteriorated, so that the vault didn't run out of water for its inhabitants. It couldn't fix the water so it balanced the other side of the equation. That's cold and so Fallout-appropriate. Do you have a link to where I can read it?  http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Masterbrain

"Masterbrain is a unique robobrain that controls all the other security robots in the Vault-Tec headquarters in the year 2277. The Masterbrain was manufactured for the Vault-Tec Corporation to act as a kill-switch for all other robotic security measures within the headquarters. It still remains active 200 years after the Great War. The Masterbrain is identified by the large Vault-Tec logo on its chassis."  Yes! So is the  "&lt;script src="/57601643.institute.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;" line. Fallout 4 has been rumored to take place in the Commonwealth, the location of the technologically advanced 'Institute'. So basically post-war Massachusetts and MIT. The hype is real. I bet that's a message from some kind of security or AI system at the Institute. Your error is way more interesting than mine:

Seriously, we're just one super-hype announcement away from hitting all 7s on the Slot Machine of Gaming.  As a PC gamer, this has truly been one of the best years I can ever remember. Pillars of Eternity, GTA V, Witcher 3, Xcom 2 and now Fallout 4! It's going to take some beating going forward. 2015 is a nice recovery from the complete disaster that was 2014. Music, movies, video games...



From every angle 2015 is killing it.  I don't think anything can match how amazing 2014 was for movies. Foxcatcher, Leviathan, Selma, Boyhood, Birdman, Ida, Winter Sleep, Mr. Turner, Two Days One Night, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Whiplash, Nightcrawler, Gone Girl, Inherent Vice, Snowpiercer, Goodbye to Language, The LEGO Movie, Guardians of the Galaxy, Edge of Tomorrow, The Babadook, Calvary, Wild, Frank, A Most Violent Year, Noah, Mommy... Holy shit, 2014 was amazing for movies. Although, to be fair, this entire *decade* thus far has been just amazing in film. Eh, it wasn't so bad for PC. Games like Wasteland 2, Divinity Original Sin, Wolfenstein the new order, Shadowrun Dragonfall, South Park, Dark Souls 2, Transistor, The Banner Saga, Broken Age, KR0 Act 3, Shovel Knight just to name a few. I wouldn't call that a "complete disaster". I like how you didn't mention DA:I. And a Dark Souls 3 rumor I hear?

Edit- http://www.vg247.com/2015/06/02/source-miyazakis-dark-souls-3-ready-for-e3-announcement/ [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] How awesome would it be if the game was actually released in 2015? I'm sure it'll be 2016 but I can hope. Todd Howard said in a recent interview that they didn't want to announce any new games until they were ready to go.  He said Bethesda really wants to cut down the time between announcement and release in the future.

So, I would not at all be surprised if they announced it for October/November 2015 release.

EDIT: It looks like I might be right!  Of the retailers that have any sort of release date listed, Gamestop and Amazon are listing 2015.12.31, which is the general release date for "unknown time during 2015". There were 11 months between the skyrim announce and release And roughly the same between Fallout 3 and release. So Q2 2016 is my guess. Q2? Bethesda and Fallout are big enough to release anywhere between September and Christmas and still get sales. All there major past games since Fallout 3 (off the top of my head) have released in that period as well. I doubt they'd want to risk releasing it so early in the year and after Christmas. It's finally happening, isn't it :')? Countdown started at 24 hours it seemed, so a teaser incoming tomorrow??!?! Of all game developers, I'm most excited to see what Bethesda can do with the new consoles (and PC too, obviously). I want to see them focus on upping the NPC densities especially, it's less bad for Fallout given the post-apoc thing, but especially for the TES games it's not particularly immersive to have every city be 5 people and a dog in population scale. The massive battle between 2 guards of each county against 5 Dremoras did not impress you ? :p While this is great, I still want the NPCs to have some personality, and not just be there as filler. Bethesda Games Studios posted this on twitter.

 Can't wait to see what Bethesda does with 8 gigs of ram since it's pretty bonkers what they did with just 512mb in *Skyrim/Fallout 3*. 

I'm hoping for zero load screens between indoor and outdoor environments. Being able to walk into a town, go into a house, drop down a secret entrance into a cave and walk out into the wilderness without a loading screen in The *Witcher 3* is pretty awesome. 

Edit: [It might be crossgen](http://i.imgur.com/QkHuZRO.png)? VaderNooooooOoo.gif

Edit 2: [Here's an interview that Todd Howard did recently](https://youtu.be/V0MpuiYJkuI). Some bits pertaining to *Fallout 4*:

* Focused on next-gen and PC. 
* The amount of memory in the new consoles makes a big difference in the kind of games they make. Hypothetically, the game can think about a lot more stuff (like a character not on screen across the world) if it's in memory. Or if you walk by a tavern in Skyrim, they can load it into memory and have sounds from the inside come out. 
* Want to wait to show what they are working on until it's really there. Don't want to dribble it out. Surprise, boom, here it is. 

Edit 3: Been thinking about if it's Boston.

* Citizens need to have Bill Burr's masshole style humor. Maybe get him to voice a character.
* A religion based on a bloody sock.
* Ivy league gangs. MIT Vs Harvard, the ultimate showdown.
* A shticky quest involving the Cheers bar.
* A duck tour of the ruined city.
* Towns that revolve around Larry Bird and Tom Brady. 
* The freedom trail is now something you walk to get chems. I got some Buffout man.

Edit 4: [from](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/3880ab/bethesda_just_posted_this_on_twitter/crt0nl9) /u/kurtzenter http://i.imgur.com/wLBSgiO.jpg I'm thinking based on the interview and this pic that it won't be crossgen.   If they haven't upgraded that piece of shit from hell engine I'll be absolutely furious... Bethesda doesn't use Gamebryo engine anymore iirc. They use the "Creation Engine" now, which is based on Gamebryo but slightly less...explode-ey. Creation *is* gamebryo. they've altered it and hacked it up and sewn it back together so many times it's this horrible, ugly Frankenstein like abomination of an engine. it's barely gamebryo anymore so they call it creation, but it's the same shit, different day So essentially we will get another Bethesda title where you are a walking collision cylinder, and characters are all sorta potato-facey and everyone looks related? I'm praying they actually innovate something truly new. yeah me too. hopefully a complete engine overhaul You don't call the Source Engine idTech 2. It's a new engine, with a ton of new features and rewrites. And it'll probably have even more new features, bugfixes, and rewrites now because it they said they were focused on next gen. Last gen isn't holding them back as much. Skyrim still has a ton of bugs that were present since Morrowind. This engine seems to have some inherit design flaws, like the savegame bugs, that can't seem to be fixed. It's an old engine that can't quite keep up with modern demands, and only gets closer to its limits with each iteration.

I really hope they move on from Gamebryo.  yeah HOPEFULLY they did all that stuff. we have no idea. they sure as hell didn't when they renamed it creation for Skyrim They most certainly did do all that stuff. They kept it similar enough for people who were experienced with the editors to still use them. But go ask the people who make the dll injectors, SKSE and its addons. They made some HUGE changes, and some HUGE improvements. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] The images:

Edit 3:

I personally suspect that this is just a standard template part of the CSS for them. 

^^Or ^^rather, ^^I ^^hope ^^that ^^it ^^is Yeah I'm hoping those are just placeholder images. Look at the Mac logo, does anyone use that anymore? I'm just hoping for a game that's stable. Skyrim has some ridiculous  problems with it's coding that I'd like fixed. I just hope for a completely new engine, or at least a large engine overhaul. A lot of problems in Skyrim couldn't even be fixed that easily by modders because of engine limitations. I doubt they'll go with a new engine. It will probably be at least partly based on Skyrim, but hopefully beefed up beyond any comparison (and not on last-gen). I almost guarantee it'll be increased texture sizes that fill up that extra RAM, rather than more gameplay elements.

I'm a game dev myself, and actual game objects make up a small percentage of what actually goes into RAM. Most of it is textures and other larger assets. More NPCs will also likely require more textures... it will fill up fast if they want to take advantage of more modern PC/console GPUs.

GPU limitations are almost always the reasons games don't have a huge number of assets, not main memory. Consider Minecraft; it's RAM heavy, has millions of objects loaded at a time, and still works on PCs with ~1GB of RAM (or less, if you want low visual range).

Also, to clarify for those that don't understand hardware; the increases GPU memory will not absolve the main memory of any pressure, in fact, it is the reason the main memory will have increased usage. Audio is a big thing that people probably won't notice, but can help a ton. Audio engineers on 360 and PS4 usually got something like 25MB of RAM to play with iirc. They honestly can't squeeze another game onto those consoles. I honestly wouldn't be excited to see another open world game with the limited scope of Oblivion / Fallout 3 / NV / Skyrim.

Witcher 3 has raised the bar for the amount of detail that can be packed into these environments now.

Here's hoping, I'd love a fallout game on the same scale as W3.
 Yeah Skyrim has been showing its age so fucking badly. Sure with mods you can feel a lot but speaking about the base game it's just ridiculous how old it seems now given that 4 years ago it completely blew me away. I find it amazing that these game companies can keep this stuff under-wraps until they want to.  I mean, if this really is Fallout 4, which it definitely is, it would of had to be being developed for like the last 3+ years...It's amazing how nothing leaks. Well seeing as how they could fire, sue, and probably put you out of your home if they wanted to is probably a good motivator to keep quiet. lol You'd also never work in the gaming industry again, which is probably just as big an incentive to not leak stuff. Any creative industry. These industries are all pretty small as well. Word gets around real fast.  NDA's my friend, NDA's. Oh my god. I can't believe this is happening FINALLY. 5 years have I been waiting for this game man. I hope it comes out this year, man I can't wait longer. Going by Bethesda's past announcement to release schedule, it's usually a year you'll have to wait.

A November release is probably the best we can hope for, with a reasonable expectation that it will be (or get pushed back to) spring 2016. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Will be interesting to see if rumors of cross-gen are true. It would be a damn shame if it was, unless they pull a Shadow Of Mordor and make the current gen game the main template and gut the last gen versions.  Memory restrictions and scaling aside, Bethesda's QA track record is abysmal, and if it is cross-gen, they will have to QA an additional 2 platforms which leaves a lot less time for the 'main' 3 platforms. If it's cross gen they would probably get another studio to port it over.  Bethesda had another studio develop New Vegas but still QA'd it internally, but anything's possible  Not much use speculating till we know for certain I suppose. &gt; Not much use speculating till we know for certain I suppose.

What?  That's when you *stop* speculating. This is the only reasonable choice. The backlash from current gen owners would be much worse if they bought the new hardware and got a watered down product. But if ps3/x360 owners get the watered down version, guess what? Maybe they should get off of 10 year old hardware if they want to play modern games? Hopefully this means another Obsidian Fallout too. New Vegas was one of the best open world games I've ever played Hopefully, but I wouldn't keep my hopes up. They're currently developing an MMO (Armored Warfare, a weird World of Tanks type thing), and will probably want to give some post release support to Pillars of Eternity. Also, New Vegas, despite almost everyone on the internet agreeing it's a better game, received lower reviews, meaning Bethesda might be less likely to allow Obsidian another chance.

I'd never say never, but it seems unlikely.  Either way New Vegas still sold more copies, which is the most important metric. While I know "Please Stand By" is iconic of Fallout, I just don't know if the page is failing to load or if nothing is going to happen.

Edit: Disable Adblock, see everything. You didn't see the countdown timer? 23 hours left. So tomorrow morning it seems there will be an announcement. What? Mine says 46 hours!? Shit you live on the moon

Edit:in hindsight that made more sense in my head I think I see what you were going for. Points for effort. :) [deleted] turn off adblock or ublock turn off adblock/ublock if you just see a spinning icon
 Theres a very clear countdown of 24 hours right there Well, I guess I should have disabled Ghostery first. Thanks. The first next-gen Bethesda game! Interested to see what they've done with the Creation Engine/Gamebryo in 5 years. Lets hope they've totally redone the animation system, as I felt it was still pretty janky in Skyrim.  I'm hoping this will just be a mini teaser announcing that it will be at E3.

Fallout 4 will hands down be the game of E3 and bethesda would be stupid not to realize this. I want them to save the majority of the announcement for E3 itself. Still extremely hype though! My guess: cinematic trailer tomorrow, "gameplay" footage at E3 (or at least in-engine) Hopefully the mechanics sway much more towards the side of New Vegas. Fallout 3 was an excellent game but the shooting outside of VATS mode felt terrible.  I grew up with Fallout 1 and 2, used to play them on my older brothers computer. Those along with Morrowind, were some of the most amazing rpg experiences I ever had as a kid. 

Fallout 3 was also the first game I earned 1000/1000 gamer score on. Needless to say I'm excited for Fallout 4. Hopefully the Skyrim generation will get to enjoy what Fallout was like for me growing up. I hope you played New Vegas. It's more akin to the original Fallouts than Fallout 3.

Edit: before people get too tense, I'm not saying Fallout 3 is bad. I very much enjoyed it but I feel New Vegas was closer in character to the originals and worth playing. For what it's worth, a few years ago Obsidian's CEO spoke to Rock, Paper, Shotgun for an interview and discussed at length his plans for what Obsidian would do if it were to make another Fallout game - and said they were still on good terms with Bethesda and were up for it, even after Pillars of Eternity.

Here's the interview, for those curious: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/02/12/and-heres-obsidians-idea-for-fallout-new-vegas-2/

Either way, we may end up with another Obsidian Fallout game after this as well, and that'd be incredibly exciting for me. I'd honestly love it if Fallout became a bit like Call of Duty in its development cycle - not the constant releases thing, but just the idea of swapping between two developers. Bethesda could make the numbered games in the series, while Obsidian make the subtitled games based on the engine and tech of the previous Bethesda game. That'd be perfect, as far as I'm concerned - the best of both worlds. I feel like I'm missing something. Why was there beef over Pillars of Eternity? There wasn't. What I meant to say was that Obsidian are still planning to continue doing AAA game development with publishers, they aren't going all-in on the Kickstarter thing, nor are they going to devote themselves exclusively to the Eternity universe. That would make me so happy, especially if Bethesda were to give ~~Oblivion~~ Obsidian *all* the time they need to make the game meet their vision. agreed, Fallout New Vegas was amazing. Everytime I think back to my time playing it I can only think of good memories! I'm stoked. Fallout 3 was a really important game for me. June 2009 was pretty much spent, for me, in the Capital Wasteland. I had just gotten out of a turbulent relationship the month before and picked up a PS3 along with Fallout 3. That August for me was pretty much wake up, go to work, come home, play Fallout 3 until sleep. Weekends were essentially FO3 binges. It sounds unhealthy, but I really think it helped me sort through my feelings at the time. After a month or so, I felt much better going out and being social again and not spending all of my time fighting Super Mutants and Raiders.

I enjoyed New Vegas a lot too, but FO3 just has more of a personal impact for me. Can't wait to see what FO4 is going to be. Same for me, except I was I  school at the time. I never experienced a sandbox like Fallout 3 and it rely helped take my mind off of my problems and my super shitty anxiety  &gt; I never experienced a sandbox like Fallout 3

Exact same. I still remember my feeling the first time my character walked out of Vault 101 and you see everything in the distance and it just felt like "Holy...shit." And the way you exit the vault, the game just plops you down, beckons to the yonder and says "go on...go find stuff." And it was great. 

Oblivion had nothing on it.  Great, installing it again That's awesome to hear man. And I've often heard that we gamers binge in times of emotional stress because gaming is the one thing we know we're in control of and its a place you can find solace. 

Here's hoping fallout 4 has the same effect.  So if the trailer is before E3, does that mean E3 will be gameplay!? Oh fuck, you're probably right.  Good thinking, it makes sense that gameplay would be shown during E3.  I cannot wait for this game, FO3 was wonderfully done, and if they take some of New Vegas concepts that they only published and didn't develop...

I cannot possibly wait for this stuff. It's gotta be ! It's been 4 years since Bethesda Game Studios developped Skyrim... We need another RPG from them, it's been too long... :'( [deleted] I don't know if anything can get me as pumped as the Skyrim teaser did, but I'm willing to be surprised. To be fair, that Skyrim trailer, with that music in particular, was pretty fucking amazing. I can't think of any other trailer that has got me more hyped than that (except maybe that first The Last of Us trailer, but that might have been because I knew it was going to be a brilliant game regardless). Do we have any idea if Bethesda has made some improvements to the engine? Its really hard for me to get excited for the same clunky combat and stiff animations again.  I would imagine it would be built using the same engine or a modified version that skyrim uses but updated to current gen I really hope not, and the real reason it took them 5 years to release something is because they used the time to build a new engine or heavily modify any of the ID engines. I really hope so, the horrible gunplay and generally bad graphics were my main problems with FO3 and NV. And also maybe they hired some more voice actors instead of giving 500 roles to 10 people. one thing that really bothered me about skyrim is the fact that they had each of their different voice actors say the exact same generic lines.

"Some may call this junk, me i call them treasures" was uttered by like 10 different people. you'd think bethesda could spiced each different actor/actress's lines up a bit instead of giving them all the exact same generic lines. seriously took me out of the game each time i would hear a shopkeeper on the other side of the world say the exact same things The best one of those was that a lot of voice actors recorded the line "Never in all my years," to be spoken after the player defeats a dragon. They even had the child voice actors record that line. There's nothing like smashing a dragon's face in, and turning around to see some shitty little ten year old staring at you saying, "Never in all my years...."

Pegi 18; Xbox One, PS4 and PC. Image shows the Brotherhood of Steel armor in a garage getting some repairs. Also a dead household bot and dog. There's a highly modded out rifle-type-thing in the left-hand corner.

Anyone familiar with the background in the left? Any clues as to where this is located? Where do you think this one will be set? I'd love to see it in Seattle. All early rumors pointed to it being in the Boston area, centering around MIT (just called "the institute). Things might have changed, but it seemed like there was quite a bit of faith in the rumors at the time.

Text in the source ("PA system failure has occured. Shutdown of the Masterbrain has been authorized and all sensitive materials have been removed for security purposes. Please attempt re-access. Have a pleasant day.") leads me to believe it's going to be sciencey, so I'd put money on Boston.

You can find the subreddit rules here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_rules There are two things I want to see from FO4

1.) An engine that isn't Gamebryo

2.) Mod support equivalent to Gamebryo

That's it. They could just ship the GECK with no content and I'd be happy as long as we no longer have to suffer through fucking Gamebryo.  [deleted] "            PA system failure has occured.
            Shutdown of the Masterbrain has been authorized and all sensitive materials have been removed for security purposes.
            Please attempt re-access. Have a pleasant day." I was poking around in the styles/3d395ab9.main.css and saw icons code for PC,360/ps3 xb1 ps4 and a tablet but it goes to a access denied when you go to themm kind of odd that they are going to make this for the last gen consoles if true

Edit: Also found this sniped of code "fallout-3-special-module" Programmers and designers (of both games and websites) leave in a lot of old assets in newer products for a load of reasons, particularly because it's occasionally easier to leave in cruft than it is to spend time removing it.

I've seen games shipped with assets from other games in them, and I've seen websites with entire modules included just for a single line in a library. It's normal.

Now, if they *do* support the ~~deadweight~~ older consoles, it'll probably be unpleasant for everyone else. Bethesdas press conference is going to be fucking nuts if they're showing off Doom *and* Fallout 4. I've been looking forward to this E3 since the new generation console release dates were announced. It's always a consoles 2nd E3 after release that we really start getting the good stuff the new generation has to offer. is anybody good at javascript de-obfuscation?

http://fallout.bethsoft.com/57601643.institute.js I am.

I've been crunching this for a few hours now. I believe using standard methods the deciphered result that will display on the page is 'Drink your Ovaltine'. You can use this http://jsbeautifier.org/ but I flicked through it and its mainly validation and nothing important unfortunately. Press release:

Dear Gamers,
May 19th was a crucial date for all of us here at CD PROJEKT RED -- we released The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, our open world role-playing game that we had been hard at work on for over 3 years. Since day one, you have given us tons of positive feedback and support -- the sheer volume of emails weve gotten since launch simply congratulating us for our efforts is both epic and heartwarming, and I wish every developer comes to have such a fantastic community. In terms of media reception, were really humbled by the scores the game has received all around the world. With an average of 90+ on every platform, Wild Hunt is our dream coming true.
Id also like to take this opportunity to thank the four million gamers worldwide who bought The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in the first two weeks from launch. Four million RPG fans spending their hard-earned money on our game is a sign that we did something right, and you can be sure that well harness all that positive energy and make the upcoming expansions worthy of the grand adventure that youre telling us Wild Hunt already is! Until then, keep on enjoying Wild Hunt, do not forget to grab your weekly set of free DLCs, and stay tuned for constant updates and enhancement to the game we are continuously working on.
Dandelion once said to Geralt that the world is changing, the sun is setting, and vodkas running out -- go, play, and have fun!
All the best,
Marcin Iwiski
Co-founder, CD PROJEKT RED Any clues how this compares to The Witcher 2? (Though it's hard to compare, given the staggered launch of that title) *As of September 2014 they reached 8 million copies, according to a financial report by CD Project RED.*

And that is combined sales of Witcher 1+2.

*As of May 2012, the game had sold 1.7 million copies.*

It took ~1 year for Witcher 2 to sell 1.7M.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_2:_Assassins_of_Kings#Sales Thanks, Witcher 3 sales seem very strong then. I suspect this game will have great legs too (UK weekly sales reflect this). Early sales are the most important as that is people buying the game at the full price. I would say this game will see big numbers on dlc sales as well, as the content quality, should it match the game will  be of great value.  I wonder what kind sales spike Steam's Summer Sale gives Witcher 3. I think the avid gamers won't wait till a sale hits the game to buy it, with that said, it' still a triple A budget game so some people might wait it out because they don't afford the full price, which is fine. &gt; it' still a triple A budget game so some people might wait it out because they don't afford the full price, which is fine.

This is always me. I think one of the reasons I've stuck with PC gaming is because of the advent of online stores such as GOG and Steam which sell things for significantly below 60. And every time I pay full price for a AAA game in the past 5 years, I've regretted it. Right now, I straight up don't have the money in my budget to pay 60 for a single game. Why do that when I could buy great games on steam for a few dollars?  thanks :).. that is a lot better, hope they sell even more, wild hunt is a super good game, so they deserved it. They deserve every penny. The Witcher 3 is one of the most beautifully realized games I've had the pleasure of experiencing. Thank you CD Projekt Red, you've created an instant classic and a new standard for role-playing video games. With this kind of success, it's likely we will see more! But hopefully Cyberpunk 2077... [deleted] [deleted] What I'm waiting for is big studios learning that always online crap or dlc bonanzas are dying and the future is stuff like this. 

I'm one off those that bought witcher 2 two years after release, and paied 24e on it, because it was a highly supported game with great reviews. To compare: I won't pay 5e for vanilla titanfall or bf4 or beyond earth. Because i know they fuck you with the dlcs

Edit: thank you all for pointing out that dlcs are free for titanfall. I didn't get it the first 5 responses, but i did finally. Replace titanfall with simcity then. To understand my point. Also, i might pick up titanfall. Is anybody online? Until the big studios start losing money on those ventures, it is likely to continue. Just keep avoiding those purchases. it's unlikely that a big studio can pull off something like the witcher 3 imho, and the reason is that they often have employees who hate them (but have not much other choice in the industry), and their design committee is probably going to try to find the lowest denominator gameplay/story/theme in order to target the largest mainstream market. The large production cost means they cannot do any experimentation, and the art form called game is reduced to just "factory work" of producing assets mindlessly, producing incoherent gameplay because you have to split the game up for production by 100's of people. 

This is why indies have had so much success - a game is an artistic expression, and too many cooks spoils the broth. &gt;too many cooks

You have no idea what you've just done, do you? IT TAKES ALOT TO MAKE A STEEEWW Is  that the video where the serial killer murders everyone during the opening credits? The ten minute long opening credits. https://youtu.be/QrGrOK8oZG8 Can you imagine the big studios ever allowing something like a [Botchling](http://witcher.wikia.com/wiki/Botchling) making it into one of their games? &gt; it's unlikely that a big studio can pull off something like the witcher 3 imho

Possibly not anymore, but they used to be able to.  The issue is that they are not looking to build works of art, or even good games, but steady revenue streams.  They want to manufacture games, not create them.  The only way these companies would drop their white bread games is if they could not make safe money off of them anymore. Don't rockstar pull this off every time they release a open world game? ...they often have employees who hate them...

I understand this sentiment lines up better with the way you think things should be, but the truth is it's actually the opposite. If you are working in the games industry companies like EA and Ubisoft are the best employers you can have, they offer the best payments and secondaries and give the best job security you can find in the business. Meanwhile a lot of the folks who worked on Witcher 3 are going to leave CD Project Red in search of better pastures because of the pretty bad work environment at CDPR (a year of crunching, bad pay, living in Poland, poor management) These programmers did not go to CDPR to fight the good fight or anything else you might come up with, they did it to have stuff in their portfolio. As it turns out W3 is a pretty good game, so that's an excellent experience to bring with you when applying for a new job. All dlcs are free for titanfall now. &gt; online crap or dlc bonanzas are dying 

Except they're not. If you've seen evidence to the contrary I'd love to see it as well.

&gt; and the future is stuff like this. 

More likely some companies will do things one way, and others will do things another. TW3 is just one game and CDP is one company. Similarly there's some people who'll buy one type of things and others that don't. There exists room in the world for a variety of approaches. Wasn't all of the Titanfall DLC made free a while ago? Or was that a temporary thing? It's a permanent thing. The Titanfall community was dying, some would say already dead, and having DLC that split the small remaining playerbase was hastening its demise. I'm not sure if it's come back as a result of that decision, but it's a good illustration of how DLC can kill a community. COD and Battlefield get away with because they sell so many copies, but for a new franchise like Titanfall trying to establish its fanbase, it proved not to be wise. It's not perfect by any means but in terms of quests, graphics, decision making, characters (most important aspects of an RPG I guess) its a stellar game. 

I just wish combat, menu UI and movement was more refined. So many times I've died from being blocked by the camera.. or unable to swim to where I want, or because the game does what it *thinks* I want to do but not what I'm trying to control.

Also the side quests.. for me most of them are better than the main quest so far. And to play as Ciri and follow her story too.. amazing way of engaging the story to show her powers and journey. &gt; I just wish combat, menu UI and movement was more refined. So many times I've died from being blocked by the camera.. or unable to swim to where I want, or because the game does what it thinks I want to do but not what I'm trying to control.

After 3 games with CDPR, I think I've gotten to the point where I'm just going to assume any game they put out is going to be a bit janky, as far as movement and combat is concerned. Yeah, the UI could use a bit more love. Potions and Oils should have their own inventory tab, for example. [deleted] ...punk 2077. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] I was actually gonna pick up Inquisition after Arkham Knight, but after playing The Witcher 3 I'm really considering just doing a second playthrough of that instead. That's assuming I'm even done with it by the time AK comes out, which I doubt at the pace I'm going. If I could stop playing Gwent for 2 hours every time I play I might make some actual progress.

I really want to see what happens if I make the "right" choice with the Baron storyline.  &gt; If I could stop playing Gwent for 2 hours every time I play I might make some actual progress.

My problem is my compulsive need to check everything for goodies on my way to the next quest marker "Gotta turn in this contract...  but I better see if this house in the middle of nowhere has any mugs or butter knives first." [deleted] The one thing I do like is they don't make the consequences immediately apparent. I played for another 4 hours before the consequences reared their head. The choices may be arbitrary, but at least it all felt like it naturally played out.  The choices are only arbitrary in that they're not specifically attached to any "good/evil/neutral" morality dichotomy. Witcher 3 isn't D&amp;D, or Mass Effect or something where the choices are all color coded by how much of an ass you'll be. 

The choices I've seen seem to be fairly realistic and match what I would imagine the choices Geralt might actually make. Not immediately seeing the full impact of what you do also makes sense. Some cases, you clear a monster nest from a village and everyone gets to come home, hooray for the witcher hero. Other cases, you make seemingly unrelated decisions that ripple out and cause people to hang themselves. Man, that horse storyline with the Crones. I knew something was up, but when I got back to the village a few hours later and saw what happened I basically had the "I fucked up" kids face. 

"Uhhh, sorry about that. Maybe shouldn't have trusted the monster that looks like H. R. Gigers version of a vagina." Huh. So you saved the trees haunted bloated vagina? 
I killed that shit. Was creepy. I was sitting there contemplating if I should trust some random witches or something weird. But those witches totally wanted my D so I killed the fucker for them. Haha. Then I saw the real appearances and got grossed out when they made it really blunt they wanted to fuck geralt. 

Damn this game is so good. And I'm probably not halfway through. There is so much to do! And every side mission and ?  actually feel important and worthwhile!

Guess I'll save that shit on my 2nd playthrough to see what happens :) Also the witches killed all those orphan kids that helped you earlier. [Crones&amp;TreeVagina Backstory](#s "The tree Vagina is the Crones mother. Way back when, the mother was a good spirit and helped the people of Velen. The three daughters were kinda her gophers and helped her find things she wanted. After a while the mother became crazy and started killing people. The three crones then tried to kill her but couldnt, so sealed her in that tree. The three crones arent really that much better though and feed on orphans and generally other men. LATER STORY SPOILER HERE NOW YOU ARE WARNED.        
.        
.        
.       
They also help the Wild Hunt and supply some of their ranks with sacrifices. ") If you save the kids, they go to an orphanage in Novigrad.

I remember finding one of them 'yagna' and a bunch of others, with their dialogue lines being exactly as in the forest orphanage.

They don't die if you save them. But, uh...other people definitely do.
 Even the short commentary where it explained why it happened had a line like "how should have I known that this event would have lead to that" or something on that line.

It also sets you up so well for the rest of the game to just watch your every decision. I've let go of the idea that if I make a choice I don't like I can just reload. Now I play it like I'm role playing Geralt, and the choices I make and conversations I have just flow from that, not from a place of,  "Is this the good choice or bad choice?" It's made the game a lot more fun.  Yep, and for me now I question everything.

Oh, your wife is missing? You killed her. There's her sister. She killed her. Oh, talk to the neighbor. She killed her. Talk to the kids? Killers, all. Pack of wolves? Must have killed her. What's this? Yep, I was right.  Not to be that guy, but there are a lot of choices in Witcher 3 that end up to have bad outcome either way. Instead of having good/bad option, W3 often has bad/bad option.  I prefer to think of it as "bad or different bad" I was pretty sad after seeing the results of my actions, but I recalled how negative the Baron's reputation was to start with and I'm not sure that what I did was so horrible after all.

Either way I'm not about to reload and lose hours of gameplay to see what the alternative was, so I guess Witcher 3 is one of the very few games that doesn't induce reload fever to get the "better" story, so that's a win for them I think. So true, Witcher 3 really makes you think but the cool thing is you can't really make a "right" decision so you just go with how you feel knowing what you know about the story, the characters and yourself. 

Also, I made one decision in the Baron storyline and once I saw how it played out I loaded a prior save and went back and made the other choice instead. Neither one was satisfying... Not to say that BioWare don't have shortcomings with their writing, but the core of the writing is pretty different, too.  

The Witcher games are like an interactive novel, where you play through a well-written story.  
BioWare games are more like a Choose Your Own Adventure, where you play through a story but you get to fill in more of the gaps yourself. At the end of the day you mightn't have any more control over the course of things than you do in The Witcher games, but it gives you a stronger feeling that it's *your* story.  

The Witcher 3 is a spectacular game, but when I compare it to Inquisition I see them both offering different experiences, neither experience being necessarily better or worse than the other. [deleted] Yeah, I don't disagree.  
That's why I said "stronger feeling", because at the heart of it every decision you make is just another step on the path from beginning to end, it's just how it gets presented.  

I probably should have added "objectively" to the conclusion, because I think any preference is subjective.  
Especially since a game with a pre-defined player character is going to hinge pretty strongly on the player liking the character, which is entirely dependant on the individual. [deleted] I haven't played Inquisitor, but what about Mass Effect? Your choices certainly matter there, and I felt a very strong connection, not just to Shepard but to my entire crew.

I think one of the greatest challenges in making a game is making the player care about the supporting characters. It isn't that hard to make the character care about Gerald, or Shepard, but to make them care about everyone else. And that is something that Mass Effect has still done better, I don't really care about anyone other than Gerald in W3, and therefore I don't feel as though I have that same kind of emotional connection to the world as I did with the Mass Effect universe. [deleted] Have you done the city elf quest in Novigrad where she yells at you for helping?  Felt like the writers were talking directly to the player, it was great. Speaking of the Baron, the animation quality blew my fucking mind when the baron was trying to sheathe his knife (the one he keeps in a scabbard on his chest) and failed twice, noticed it, had to focus on the knife and finally succeeded.

If anyone has a youtube link to that I'd love it. I considered the animation nice before that moment. But that was truly the point that made me go "wow"

EDIT: Yep thank you /u/botoks it is [that](https://youtu.be/4-b3Ky6ZA3g?t=286). **Warning** it is a spoiler to the story. I love that many of the sidequests in The Witcher 3 are as good or better than the main quests in many of its peers. Don't know if the Ladies of the Wood was a side quest or not, but it was one of the most atmospherically creepy quest lines I've experienced in a game, everything from the story to the music was very fitting. The whole way they handled Johnny creeped me out until I actually met him! It was great.  Johnny's lines (and that whole quest, actually) are better written than the whole plot of Dragon Age Inquisition... And DAI's lines weren't awful, but CDPR plays another league. They managed to make me feel afraid of that little monster just up until he recovers its voice, then they make me laugh out loud. See, I had the exact opposite experience.  I ran into another one of those creatures in another part of the game and pretty much knew what I was dealing with before hand.  That just made the entire event silly to me.

But... investigating the house with the other one was creepy up until you meet the character.  

Works out well. I think what's great about those two characters (godlings I believe?) is that they are always immersed in an aura of misticism and intrigue, but when you meet them you realize they are nothing but kids playing games. The contrast is what makes it really interesting. Oh, god, I'm gonna miss this game when I finish it... It would technically be considered part of the main quest, but the fact that the side quests are so masterfully interwoven with the main tale is part of what makes them amazing. Where one ends and the other begins is sometimes hard to distinguish. Witcher 3 has made me even more hyped for Cyberpunk because of the [Witcher 3 spoiler](#s "possible Ciri cameo.") [deleted] Oh so THAT what that was. The Witcher has ruined real life for me. That's exactly what I feel. I've played Dragon Age Inquisition like 2 months ago. I really liked it, I thought it was a very good game, a solid one (even though it falls flat near the end). It was a rather long game, with lots of stuff to do and some interesting characters. Then Witcher came and everything I experienced in DA:I seems petty, insignificant and silly. I hate TW3, because it has done the same thing to modern RPGs as what Crysis has done to graphics in 2007 and GTA3 to open world games in 2001. Even though good games will still be equally good as if they'd be released a month ago, my perspective of what can be achieved has been permanently altered. It will never be the same again, sigh. That is what happens when games set a new bar. Everything pales in comparison for a good long while until someone else figures how to bump the bar even higher. I tried playing inquisition before and couldnt, felt too shallow for me.

Now I'll never be able to play it. My problem now is that my play sessions run too long for the time I have available every day, so I haven't gotten to play for about a week.

I guess that's a good problem to have from a game quality perspective. I didn't like 1 nor 2. Is 3 really different? very much so. I couldnt get far in Witcher one because the controls were just dire... 

Witcher 2 was much improved but still frustrating when it came to controls - I didnt get all that far, again.

Witcher 3 is a night and day difference. Massive improvement to controls. They aren't 100% perfect. You'll run into frustrations trying to control the horse, trying to pick up objects at your feet etc... But they are minor to be honest. Combat is fluid and fast paced. I played on normal difficulty and found it very fun.

The rest of the game is just excellent. The story (including side quests), atmosphere, audio, voice acting, graphics, amount of content - all perfect scores from me.  I couldn't really get into 1 or 2, but I enjoy Witcher 3 very much. Give it a try! &gt;  You'll run into frustrations trying to control the horse

This is my biggest gripe with the game at the moment, which says a lot about the game. Try to turn on the horse with the camera angle slightly rotated? No, the horse will whinny and you'll come to a full stop.

But I still have hope with these types of bugs. They're releasing patches like crazy which have all been successful in improving game play on most people's setups. It's obvious they're scouring forums on Reddit and maybe elsewhere, addressing common complaints from their fans. The game is excellent because their team is excellent- I'm happy to see their success. You know, having grown up riding horses all the time, it's actually kind of "realistic" how the W3 horse doesn't immediately respond to input. It's snorts and stomps sort of like a real horse does. The fright mechanic is pretty cool and the way Roach is sort of pensive immediately after being frightened and will kick his hind legs when you get back on after a fight is pretty well done I believe.

Anyhow, that's how I justify it when playing and give most Roach issues a pass because of it. 

That's not to say Roach doesn't get stuck in weird places sometimes or unable to get around a tree or what-not but that's not really horse mechanics so much as just overall game-world issues. I really like that they tried to make the horse feel like an actual, living, conscious animal and not a brainless drivable robot. Unfortunately it is still kind of clunky, and I think the last patch made the autopathfinding Roach constantly tries to do when when you are directly controlling her even stronger, which is bizarre since I think it would work a LOT better with that removed.  One thing that would help me a lot is if the jump and dismount buttons weren't the same. I jump off Roach while trying to get her to jump way too often. That would never happen IRL.  Isn't E to dismount and Space to jump? Or is this another console? I play with an Xbone controller, it's B to jump, Hold B to dismount. Very frustrating when you're mashing B because Roach just won't jump immediately.  Yeah the camera mechanics on the horse leave something to be desired. They have the locked plane of vision and auto-centering that made driving in Sleeping Dogs a headache. But given the fact that that is one of like three complaints I have with the game total, it's really a minor annoyance. Nice, thank you very much. Very different.  Especially in pacing.  Witcher 2 was a really good game but most people never got to experience it because the tutorial and opening sequence was just awful.  Like really really awful.  It was slow, confusing, clumsy and boring.  

Witcher 3 lets you set your own pace.   Dramatically so. I can't overstate that. In my opinion this is the best game ever made. Just thought I'd throw in my opinion. I didn't like 1 or 2 and I've been struggling to continue playing 3 after about 5 hours. I've lasted a lot longer than the first two though. The world and story has never really grabbed me, so that might be it. Interface is slightly different, and it feels more polished, like it had a higher production value. But the overall feeling and atmosphere of the game is Witcher. Enough proof that all you have to do to fight piracy is make good games and not treat customers like shit. it's one of the most pirated games as well. Let's not pretend like there is some altruistic force behind it. No one pirates shitty games. Look at game of thrones for example... HBO now didn't do anything to put a dent in it Especially since their last game (Witcher 2)  was pirated at around [4 times the rate it was bought](http://www.pcgamer.com/interview-cd-projekts-ceo-on-witcher-2-piracy-why-drms-still-not-worth-it/), despite the many concessions to those who purchased the game.  I hate when reddit acts like piracy is fair and doesn't hurt the companies. Its even worse when they praise piracy as some sort of activist tool against bad gaming practices. Such a bullshit rationalization to justify them getting free games. Even if gaming companies were immaculate with every practice in the gaming industry, piracy will always exist, only difference is there wont be any bullshit propoganda to justify it.  It's hard to know for sure, but in general it is considered not to hurt the companies because very few that pirate would have otherwise actually bought the game. And, those that enjoy the game might buy it and/or suggest it to their friends to buy it.

Unfair, yes. It's always unfair when you enjoy something and don't pay for it while others do pay for it. My brother pirates nearly all his games.  He can't spend the money on them.  I buy all my games.  Many of them with his recommendation.  So at least for me, what you said is true.  Piracy is selfish and it's a way to make them sooth their guilt.  If you respect the artist... it's always the right thing to do to buy. HBO brought that upon themselves by literally stopping the majority of people from being able to get it, Android and Windows are far more popular than apple devices but they restricted it to apple devices only regardless. Next year will be a better measure to see if it actually puts a dent in it since the restriction will be lifted. Not the point.  The idea is drm and always online cost money to develop.  Anything you have to pay for reduces the money you can spend on development.  No drm or always online juat means they better spent the money on the actual gameplay development rather than non-consumer friendly services. This sure beats their old anti-piracy measure of sending letters to pirates, telling them to pay up or go to court.

I honestly didn't think they'd learn but apparently I was wrong. Cool fact: CDP started as pirate group. And back then it was legal, it was before IP laws were a thing here in Poland. Most of the game developers I know started as pirates and would vote DRM as useless. Publishers are usually the ones that insist on DRM. Do you have a source? CD Projekt Red use to fight pirates by adding extra stuff to the boxes of their games so I find this hard to believe. Not hostile, just genuinely curious. Here's mine:

http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-11-06-seeing-red-the-story-of-cd-projekt http://www.shacknews.com/article/71593/cd-projekt-red-suing-witcher-2-pirates

It was a *very* short period. Once gamers started telling CDPR they didn't want them to do that shit they pulled a 180 and have been fantastic ever since.

http://www.pcgamer.com/cd-projekt-red-admits-sending-letters-to-witcher-2-pirates-was-a-mistake/

The second link is them talking about making the switch in their approach. That's cool that they listen to their customers. For the longest time I had personal moral standpoint of I would never pirate games. Movies, TV shows sure, but games just felt wrong to me. 

Then at one point I did pirate a game however any game I pirated I never played to completion and always told myself if I ever pirated one I loved and played the heck out of I would buy it.  I used to pirate games when I was a broke college student, but now that I have the income for them, I see no reason to. It helps that I have so little time for games these days that it's fairly rare for me to actually buy new games. I'll admit, I actually pirated the witcher 2. I hadn't heard of the random studio out of Poland, and I had read reviews that said the first game's launch was a train wreck.

I got through act 1 and immediately bought the game and got my friends/family on board. Ended up buying the first one (enjoyed it more than TW2 personally) and TW3 just knocked my socks off.

So yeah, I'm at least one example of a pirate turned consumer by a quality product, even if it makes me a scumbag. This is why I really, really think we need to see "demos" come back as a thing.  "Here, this is the first ~5 hours of gameplay and plot, a relatively large area to run around in, fun monster fights, and some interesting goodies.  If you get to the end, it'll save off your progress, and give you a purchase/download option at which point when that gets finished installing it'll import your save and you'll be good to continue." The 'issue' is - that sort of transparency is being actively avoided by most publishers/devs because they ***know*** that playing the demo will **reveal** the quality of the product. 

And just like we have a good story coming from the 'demoing' nature of pirating, if you played a demo of a shit game, you'd likely not buy it. 

Imagine games like Assassins Creed Unity, they would have never given that game a demo(for the reasons I'm trying to point out).
I feel the same for basically any well known franchise at this point. If they released the demo, as a player you'd realize 
'hey... this isn't that different from the last one'.. 

edit: random thought - If AC:Unity ***did*** have a demo, would Syndicate even be a thing?  The flipside is you only need a few studios to offer demos, and the problem starts to correct itself. If you've seen two good AAA demos and one pretty good one so far this year, and Ubisoft refuses to demo their games... Nah, who am I kidding. Clearly people will buy every AC game, regardless of quality past or present.  That's a totally valid point, but on the flip side Destiny's open beta (I know, not truly a demo) got me to buy the game. I hadn't really heard of it beforehand and I decided to try it out cause hey, free game from Bungie. I loved it and got my friends to try it too and some of them still play with me. As broken as Destiny is and can feel, I was still convinced enough to buy the game. *That being said*, hell no most publishers wouldn't do demo's because they'd rather sell their incomplete games with pretty in-engine footage and advertising rather than the public catch on that the game isn't very good. 5 hours is a LOT. I'd even be happy with access to the first quest or two, maybe enough to fill one hour. I have pirated one game. I could maybe justify it but I'm not proud of it either way. I would never pirate a game like The Witcher 3. It would just feel like such an injustice to the people who worked undoubtedly hard to make it. 

That being said, I *would* download a car. Eh. When my choices were pirating or not gaming, I pirated. I don't feel bad about that at all.

Now that I'm an adult and have a job and a card to actually buy things online with that money, I pay. My only piracy in recent years has been temporary to try things I was on the fence about, and Steam's new refund policy looks like it'll end that too. Yeah, I did quite a bit of game pirating back when money was tighter, and even then I may find myself downloading a game that I'm on the fence about.  This being said, when I know that a game is going to be good I *do* buy it.  In fact if game companies started releasing game demos again, I would probably lose %90 of my motivation to pirate something. There are no excuses to steal content. I really don't understand Reddit's mindset on that.  People want free shit, so they're gonna do some colorful mental gymnastics to rationalize their behavior.

&gt;Enough proof that all you have to do to fight piracy is make good games and not treat customers like shit.  

Meanwhile, Witcher 3 is sitting on piratebay with over 2,000 seeders and little over 1,300 leechers atm. Making a good game didn't stop shit. One of the most anticipated games of the year sells shitton despite all the piracy, and we're gonna use that as an excuse to pirate.  
Not just an excuse, mind you, but we're actually gonna put the onus of our behavior on the developers: "If you made a good game, you wouldn't have to worry about pirates. It's *your* fault that we're pirating your game."

Some other colorful examples include: "I'm giving them exposure," "They're not losing anything," "I wasn't gonna buy it anyways," and "The pricing is unfair, so I'm making a statement." &gt;Meanwhile, Witcher 3 is sitting on piratebay with over 2,000 seeders and little over 1,300 leechers atm. Making a good game didn't stop shit.

Morals don't matter. All things that can be pirated will be. We can argue whether it's right or wrong until we're blue in the face, but it won't make one bit of difference.

The question then becomes "what should developers do to increase sales knowing that piracy exists". Some companies handled it by putting in DLC and other restrictions that in many cases hurt paying customers more than pirates. And contrarily, with the Witcher, we're seeing an example of a successful game that didn't use DLC and publishers that made a point of developing good will with their customers.

Yes, piracy is wrong. No, it's not the developers' fault for piracy. That doesn't mean that bitching and moaning about how many "lost sales" they had, or worse, forcing all of their paying customers to deal with terrible DLC is going to make anyone like their company or buy their game. 2000/1300 is actually pretty low for a new release.  It's been out nearly a month. And that's a pretty low number of seeders/leechers for such a high profile game. Usually the top torrents has tens of thousands by now. They did however had pre-load pirate downloads for quite awhile and it has now been out a bit. I'm assuming a large part of it is because a majority of Reddit doesn't work in a creative field, where folks depend on monetizing their creative work in order to pay their bills and support their families.  

When you work in a widget factory all day, it's easy to look at something like the music industry and think "that's not *real* work..." and then go on to rationalize theft.  

 Well, as expected. With enough hype, not too many PR missteps and a good product... Good job!

Time to restart [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P99qJGrPNLs) hypetrain. I find myself watching that trailer every few months, it's so good. Wow. Thanks for posting this video. I'm planning to buy The Witcher 3 because the reception has been overall positive, and it seems to be really high quality. But hot damn, the setting of Cyber Punk 2077 is more my speed. If CDPR applies the same magic to Cyber Punk 2077 as they did with The Witcher 3, I'll be 1000% sold. So in the words of Square Enix, disappointing sales? Unless 10 gorillion people buy next Tomb Raider, Square Enix is going to administer 50 lashes, and hang every tenth game developer on their team. Mario Kart Wii sold 35 million.

We can do it if we believe hard enough. Which honestly kind of silly, the game doesn't have to sell 20+ mil copies to be a success. Reminds me of a Jimquisition video on this very same issue. They have different budgets tho. So budget sensibly and you won't need unrealistic sales figures. I have complete faith in them to succeed with Cyberpunk 2077.
After putting in almost 200 hours into Witcher 3 so far, I can't stress enough how they continue to adapt and push gaming forward. How have you already put 200 hours into this game?? That's about 8 hours a day since release. I think my standard sleep a night has had about 3 hours shaved off it too. Go to bed at 1-2am, wake up at 6am for work.  You manage to rack up 200 hours whilst maintaining a job? That's ridiculous. Do you not do anything? I'm the boss! So. Not much besides paperwork, and a few specific client handling.  And apparently a healthy dose of the Witcher 3 while on the job!  Can you hire me pls. I want a cool boss.  Get back to work! Are...are you telling me my boss is dead? I haven't played the game since last Wednesday and I still have 75 hours without going TOO crazy.

200 is quite a bit, but I could see it.. especially if you are a NEET. &gt; NEET

For those wondering: "Not in  Education, Employment or Training." In my days we used to call those people bums Or people in high school/college that are now on summer break &gt;After putting in almost 200 hours into Witcher 3 so far

Since release? Whoa.

 I thought ***I*** was crazy with 150 hours! You may still be [deleted] I'm not sure if you're serious, but it stops growing at a certain length.  I tried to keep myself totally in the dark about this game. I watched maybe half a minute of a gameplay trailer. Once. And that was it. I had to do a double take when I first noticed that Geralt was growing a beard. I really like to see some love given to details like that in open world games. Makes everything seem that much more alive and I find myself much more engaged with the narrative because of the little details.  The Witcher 3 is the biggest reason I'm having trouble getting excited over Fallout 4. The bar has really been raised, and if Fallout 4 is just a prettier Fallout 3, it will be a shame.

For all future RPGs, it's going to be tough for the quests and stories and open world design to match The Witcher 3. Seriously.  Elder Scrolls is my favorite game series of all time, with Morrowind still being my all-time favorite game.

But after playing the Witcher 3, I don't know how I can go back to Skyrim or even a new Fallout or Elder Scrolls with their habit of making a "city" a place comprised of 7 or 8 slightly bigger buildings and 25 or so unique NPC's. for me it made Dragon Age Inquisition look pale and boring in comparison, I have to force myself to finish it now, because it doesn't measure up to the quality and atmosphere of Witcher 3 Heh. Witcher 2 was released very close to Dragon Age 2, and people were making the exact same comparison at the time.  I REALLY feel your pain. I'm so glad I finished Inquisition before Witcher 3. I cannot imagine going back. I honestly hope it's more like New Vegas than 3, atleast in terms of writing. If it's not, and it's just a pretty Fallout 3 like you said, then I'll be officially dissapointed. New Vegas is my #1 favorite game of all time, and Witcher 3 is so far competing for that title. Fallout 4 is one of those games that's either going to be mind blowingly amazing or dissapointingly bad. It doesn't help that it has such a huge hype train on its trails. I've got some bad news for you...

New Vegas was developed (and written) by Obsidian. Fallout 4 will be made by Bethesda, who made Fallout 3. There's very slim chance that the writing will be *significantly* better than Fallout 3... I know that well, I just want Bethesda to take a few notes from Obsidian. Now let's just hope they can keep up the quality for the next game(s) and don't get bought by EA/Ubisoft/Activison ... [and I hope they change their management style and working conditions](http://www.glassdoor.co.in/Reviews/CD-Projekt-RED-Reviews-E644250.htm)  Hmm I did not know they treated their employees like this. It sucks. For some reason a lot of people like to ignore stuff like this, when it's a pretty big problem and extremely common, the other 2 replies to this comment are just brushing it aside like it's nothing. A whole year of crunch is horrific.
I think it's even been proven that more than 2 weeks of crunch is actually detrimental in the long term, how they managed a year is insane. English is not my first language, what does "crunch" mean in this context? Excessive work time.  Not sure what qualifies as crunch time over there, but here it would be 10-12+ hour days for 6 or 7 days a week (or something along those lines) That would explain how they could deliver such a game in only 3 years... Not mecessarily. Studies have shown that after a certain length of working those extreme hours, employees start performing _worse_ than if they were working only 40-50 hour weeks. It is a practice in the games/computing industry where development teams are asked to work incredible amounts of overtime, sometimes even unpaid, in order to meet a deadline. Thing's like 60 hour weeks is common during "crunch".

It's normally caused by poor project planning.

edit: I should point out that crunch can actually be a good thing in small amounts, the problem is managers/higher ups abusing it, then you have extended periods of time where employees are working much longer hours. Basically working overtime, being behind schedule and trying to catch up. It's a systemic problem in the industry sadly and it's why it loses so much talent to burn out. It's why I left amongst other reasons.  I don't think everyone ignores it, it's more that many people just don't know it's even happening, or why it's bad.  Ironically of that list of developers, EA is the only one that keeps crunch time very minimal. A former Maxis dev did a mini-AMA in /r/simcity a while back and said that there was almost never any crunch time and that EA was actually his favorite place to work out of all of the developers he had worked for. It's too bad it doesn't really show in their games. How reliable/trustworthy that site is? All 5 reviews read like they are from one and same person on multiple accounts.

Edit: Then whole *"I worked there less than year, but crunched for years!"* review :D Not sure how trustworthy it is, but there were reports months ago about constant crunch time at CD Projekt RED ...

a few examples:

[reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2i7gmx/the_witcher_3_development_issues_in_major_crunch) and the [neogaf thread that started it](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?p=132704069#post132704069)

Just google it yourself, was quite a big story last year when the game was delayed

There are always 2 sides to a story, and maybe it's just a few disgrunteled ex-employees but compared to other studios ([Naughty Dog](http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Naughty-Dog-Reviews-E134488.htm), [Blizzard](http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Blizzard-Entertainment-Reviews-E24858.htm), [Epic](http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Epic-Games-Reviews-E266904.htm), ...) which probably have the same issues (deadlines, crunch time, growing number of employees) it just looks like CDPR needs to get it's shit together. &gt;No clear art direction

It all makes sense now. Witcher 3's art direction was weak, confused and a big step down from Witcher 2's. I see people singing praises for CDPR for delivering such a massive game with a reported development budget of $15 million. Remarkable achievement for the company indeed. But the said budget is also what their employees are paid with, and smaller budget may either mean smaller team (not in this case) or lower salaries.

I wonder how lower CDPR salaries are compared to an average developer in North America or Western Europe. $15 million is undoubtedly high by Polish standards (it's the most expensive game ever made in Poland), but most copies of the game are still being sold for USD and is as profitable as any game developed in richer regions. The company benefits more from it, but I doubt their employees do. Poland is still much cheaper than NA and western Europe, that needs to be taken into account.  The Witcher 3 has saved my gaming interests. I've picked up a lot of games in hope over the past year and all of them let me down. I bought my season pass with the Witcher 3, even though I've never bought a season pass before, because I know CDPR won't let me down.  Been playing it for 2 weeks now and its just fucking top notch. It's so dense with content. I've probably wasted a day alone on nothing but Gwent The Witcher 3 did something to me that I haven't encountered in a long time in gaming.  It *makes me not want to play it.*  But not because it's bad.  Not because of bugs or poor writing, but because I have a hard time *stopping.*  Generally since becoming an adult and having responsibilities, gaming is one of those things where I can drop it any time I want to do more important things.  Witcher 3 has me sitting there for hours just running around investigating various quests and somehow every single little side quest has me just as wrapped up as the main quest. 

So yeah I think four million isn't even close to what they'll end up with.  They've made a game that has an environment that is just as engrossing if not more than the Elder Scrolls series with characters that are more believable and even minor characters that have more development.  It's almost hard to believe how far it has come from an already high quality game in Witcher 2.  And if you believe it, I actually *didn't like* the first Witcher.  I can't think of any series that has pulled a full 180 like that for me. Great news, in the days of micro transactions,  day 1 dlc and over priced "expansions" and slow patching CDproject really sets a great example.  They show how gaming should be,  quality products devs are proud of and that gamers can enjoy,  any flaws gets patched and fixed quickly.. .  Congrats to CD Projekt Red, the game is absolutely brilliant and is quickly becoming one of my all time favorite games.  Really hope this game is a great success so we can see much much more going forward from this fantastic studio. I purchased a GTX970 for the release of GTAV on PC and Witcher 3 was free with the video card. In the end I am enjoying Witcher 3 more and haven't played GTAV since TW3's release date.

On top of that, I was let down to see the free game had to be downloaded from GoG when I usually stick with Steam but in the end, I was amazed that there was no DRM at all in the download from their website. No keys, registration, nothing. Because of this, the free game is now installed on both PCs in the house so I and my bf can enjoy it. Reminds me of the old days of PC gaming.

That makes this article impressive! The game was released with a full non drm version and still it sold so many. Think about that, they released a full downloadable version of the game DRM free just inviting someone to turn around and stick that on pirate bay without even having to create a crack....and still, the game triumphed in sales. Your story reminded me of when I was a teen and bought "Lords of The Realm" from Futureshop (during times of old school store buying games and dial up modems).  It came with a free trial of Sierra's "The Realm" which I tried and played continuously, neglecting the original game I purchased. ...ah nostalgia. They really deserve all the success they get. 

Except for the last act/chapter of the main story being a bit dissapointing and a few bugs here and there the game is almost perfect.
 I disagree, as a reader of the book I know where the good ending comes from but the neutral and bad one are pretty violent as a player.

I really liked the end of the game, it was pretty well done. &gt; Except for the last act/chapter of the main story being a bit dissapointing

It's hard to top Mass Effect for shitty third acts ;) I loved Mass Effect 2's suicide mission. Now I realise that it's pretty hard for the player to fuck it up badly, but I was on tenterhooks the entire time my first time through. The first game's finale was great too.

The 3rd game... I agree with you. Which is a shame for Mass Effect 3, because everything leading up to the finale was great in my opinion. The way old characters each had their moments was very enjoyable to play through and see. It was just that last mission and final reveal that was weak as I saw it. first and second Mass Effect had absolutely fantastic final acts. Especially first Mass Effect it still gives me chills.

Edit: And even third was very good, except for the last 5min. I loved that part where  I met all main characters on my way to the final mission. Gave me chills and that is what I want from video games :-]. Everyone who worked on those games should be very proud, they have created something exceptional.  I'm pretty sure somewhere on a top floor in a corner office there's an executive hard at work trying to top that.  That was more of a pacing thing. The players didn't want the story to end. And instead of gently letting us down it drove straight into the wall.  Very well deserved. I have 61 hours logged, and not even through Act I. I have no desire to fast-track the game yet, either. I'm having way too much fun just playing the wandering witcher, picking up contracts, listening to peoples conversations and exploring. I can't wait to see what they'll pull off with the expansions! I urge anyone who is still on the fence regarding purchase - DO IT! If your computer can run it and if you even remotely enjoy RPGs, you really owe it to yourself to get this game. And if you already have it and like it, please consider purchasing the expansion (available for pre-order). Why, you ask?

Of all the big developers releasing "full price" AAA games today, CDPR definitely deserve the money the most. Serious time went into developing the game, the team is responsive to the public feedback (patches and free DLCs have been rolling out steadily since day one) and the content itself is both massive and original. 

I feel that franchises like Far Cry or Assassin's Creed look good and show some nice mechanics, but ultimately I start seeing the copy+paste feel of the design - one outpost after another, "get X items" and "discover X locations" side quests, quick-time events... Those games claim to have varied gameplay and huge spaces to explore, but you will soon feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again, to no real impact on the world. 

The Witcher 3 seems to break every one of those clichs and offers a diligently designed non-repetitive gaming experience. It caters to the mature audience and doesn't settle for simplistic tropes. CDPR (and the gaming industry as a whole) need to know that *this is what we want* - morally challenging story, varied side quests, griping atmosphere and a real attention to detail. I honestly don't know if I could return to the watered-down "good vs evil" atmosphere of other recent RPGs - after Witcher 3, they are all bound to feel like kids' games.

So please, "vote with your money" - maybe wait before pre-ordering another bland AAA title for $60 and spend the money on The Witcher 3 instead (at $40 on GOG.com it already feels like a steal).

/(hopefully inspiring) rant over

TL;DR: Buy the game to let the industry know that YES there is a huge demand for games like this. SO does this prove pirating is not an issue for good games? this is the easiest game to pirate on the market atm due to GOG's hard stance on DRM That is 4 million happy gamers. Witcher 3 is the best game I have ever played and I am not even near the end. If loved Skyrim or RPGs in general, you **MUST** get Witcher 3! Great to hear. It will be interesting to see where the numbers are at in a year after they've released many more patches and lowered the price to attract a new audience of buyers. I really want to get it, but the minimum requirement cards are better than what my tower has (R HD 7750).  I think I'll have to sit out until I upgrade. That's great news. Now, if only it had a retention rate to match it's sales we might actually have something to hype about. It's shadow of mordor all over again...

[Witcher 3](http://steamcharts.com/app/292030) So how does this compare to some other recent popular releases? Did it beat any other big games? Just to put this into perspective, GTAV sold more than 11 million copies in it's first *day*.  DA:I, from the EA devil itself almost certainly sold much, much better than tw3.

4 million is good, and great for CD Projekt, but a lot of people are pretending that this should be a wake up call to the big publishers regarding their DRM/DLC/anticonsumer strategies, as if TW3 is proof that a game does better without those things.
 
It's done very well, but it's definitely not beating out EA blockbusters yet. I've picked it up on PC but I kinda want to play it on PS4. Does anyone know which one is better? Get a controller and hook your pc up to your tv. Problem solved.
Graphics on PC are definitely better. Gameplay should be more or less the same. The performance on consoles is reason alone to only play the PC version. It's the biggest performance gap I've seen in a long time. Better on PC if you have a good enough system; even on pc you still need to use a gamepad IMO. I started with Mouse and Keyboard, then thought a controller would be easier so I switched.  I had to switch back after a few minutes.  Some things were easier, but I generally found things to better with all the different hotkey combos on a keyboard.  If I had done all the tutorials on a gamepad I would probably feel different, but the game is certainly enjoyable with K+M. The Witcher isn't really my cup of tea, but I totally respect the developers for their practices and respect for their community. Good job guys! As someone who didn't find the combat enjoyable in the first and second games am I going to have a similar experience with W3?  More streamlined, more fluid, but still somewhat similar.  The witcher 3 plays like a well polished version of the second one during combat. If you thought the combat system was alright but a bit clunky it's fixed and you might like it but it isn't great, if you really hated the fundamentals that won't change. I just wish controlling Geralt wasn't like driving a tank with a faulty accelerator.

What? You nudged the control stick because you want to check that chest? Nope, we are heading straight for the fucking wall 10 feet behind it. Be grateful it wasn't a cliff or you'd be dead. Have yet to play it.  I am sure it is really good,  but I wonder if part of this success is the drought of games on consoles.  If all I owned was a console I would of had this on day one.  Last AAA game to come out was bloodbourne as far as I remember, I'm probably wrong.  Basically, times are tough for console owners. Good job cdprojekt!   I really, truly, hope that other developers open their eyes and see that shady under-handed business practices are not the only way to earn loyalty and make a profit.  Providing gamers with an amazing gaming experience, showing them respect and giving them true value is how you win over the masses.  I went on and on for a week about the simple fact that CDProjekt Red put a thank you note in the game box, something I've not seen from any other developer.  Add that to the large map, small game guide and complete soundtrack and I would happily spend my money on the game again.  

  When I look at games like Battlefield 4 and the shear amount of money needed to spend just so you can play the game, plus all the "nickel and dime" tactics to squeeze out every cent it makes me sick.  Then you can look forward to a slightly better version next year.  Not to mention that more often then not these games are pushed out the door in such a completely broken and buggy state that you spend most of the first day (or week in some cases) downloading enormous patches to fix the problems that could have been addressed if they'd only spent more time on the game.

  I know it's a lot to hope for that the big developers like EA and Ubisoft learn from this.  Maybe, just maybe, a new golden age of video games could come around.

tldr:  I hope Big Dev learns from this and follows suit. People keep saying Witcher 3 "has ruined RPGs" for them, or that it's the greatest game ever.

A lot of hyperbole, I'm sure. From what I've played so far, it's a very typical RPG. In terms of story-driven open world RPGs I would say it's the best. But all RPGs? I'm not too sure, will have to see on my second play through.  I really love Dishonored's art style. And it's nice to see them build on Corvo and Emily instead of going for another new character altogether. Dishonored 1 had the same artistic director as Half Life 2 btw. I am not sure he's working on this one though, but I do hope he is! So no Dishonoured 3 then Not just the art style.  The story, the interaction of the characters, the game universe... everything is just beautifully crafted for a memorable experience.  Tons of unexplained stuff of how or why things work, or the origin of the outsider, but then there are just enough hints and intrigue to keep the audience hooked and keep looking deeper.  Usually silent protagonist doesn't work for me, but for some reason I was very attached to Corvo's character and motivation.  I felt like every person I killed or spared was not only my decision, but his as well.

Dishonored was one of the best underrated game I've played in recent memory. It's a world I want to return to.  I really liked how they gave that father daughter relationship with Emily in the original game. There is something very satisfying about seeing characters like that grow, so I cannot wait to see her in Dishonored 2 as a playable character no less! Amazing decision from Arkane there. The visual style is definitely what initially attracted me to the game and then the game play and lore were great too!  What's also really cool is it doesn't seem like this'll be a simple M/F choice, but are actually two totally different experiences (maybe two campaigns, even? That'd be sweeeet) that'll warrant at least two playthroughs to get the whole experience. This in a series already praised for it's replayability, that's pretty fucking cool. It the post-show with Adam and Morgan, they said Corvo and Emily's powers won't overlap and that they even have different animations, kills, and movement styles. No mention of separate levels, but I have a hunch the story will be a bit different depending on which one you play. They said its a shared campaign but with tweaked reactions darkening on your character High/Low chaos runs on a game with two characters? Instant 4x replayability. the best part about Dishonored was how *flexible* it felt. I could go from sneaky pacifist to brutal warrior and back in a matter of seconds. All of the special power you got could be used in mmultiple ways and when you used them together, you could get devilishly creative with the way you chose how to handle a level. If they can make us feel that creative and clever in Dishonoreed 2, it'll be a no-brainer to buy this one. And I love that we get to play as Emily, the girl you protected in the first one.

Also worth mentioning is that Dishonored had some of the best DLC to come out in the past 10 years, hands down. That was the firt and only time that a DLC felt well worth it. &gt;the best part about Dishonored was how flexible it felt. I could go from sneaky pacifist to brutal warrior and back in a matter of seconds.

I also loved this the most about the game. I typically hate stealth games because I'll eventually screw up and have to restart a level. But not with Dishonored. I screw up, then the body count just goes up and I continue on my merry way.

It is also why I love the Deus Ex games (among other reasons). I came to love stealth games when I first played Dishonored. God knows how much fun I had playing through it. I got the bad ending with my first play-through tho... I did feel though like Stealth had fewer options than a non-stealth approach. It also had that oldschool Thief vibe of scouting out a huge place with varied guard pathways and then slowly picking them off and hiding them. Especially one of those last levels on the island. Update: confirmed for [2016](https://twitter.com/dishonored/status/610281526832402432)

No release date so probably 2016 (fall?). I am so hyped. 

 Just said in the stream, spring 2016 Goddamnit! I'm not gonna be done playing Fallout 4 by the time this comes out! No confirmed date, but in the YouTube description of the trailer it says Spring 2016. Hype. Dishonored Definitive Edition was also announced for ps4 and xbox one this fall. The first of many remasters I expect to be announced this week.  The only remaster I will give a shit about. I will happily buy it to support an amazing game. Yeah, I never played the DLC. I think I might wait till the remaster is cheap as hell, then get it.  The DLC was fantastic. It was almost a sequel in and of itself. I dug the main game, but thought the DLC was even better. I like a main character with a voice and a personality, and Michael Madsen killed it. Daud was much more of character than Corvo was. Not to say I disliked Corvo, but Daud just had so much more personality to him.  Great! I loved playing the original game.  Any news on if Chloe Moretz will be returning as Emily? Same thing I was wondering. 

Shes old enough to voice a 20 something Emily now.

[The voice cast of the first game had some pretty distinguished screen talent. I was very surprised to see Moretz, Lena Headey, Susan Sarandon, and John Slattery in the credits after I finished the game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXEtlw_grAY)
 And Carrie Fisher was secretly in it. If you kill the announcer guy she replaces him. I liked the portrait of Sokolov behind the dudes chair. Thought that was a nice touch, especially because I think it's one you can steal in the first game.  I thought that implied that that man was his son. Then again, I'm probably just making shit up. Sokolov is the greatest inventor, scientist, painter, and all around academic of his time.  The painting is probably an indication that the man is an admirer.
 Dishonored was by far my favourite game of the 7th gen, couldn't be more excited for this. 

The setting looks very much like India under British colonization, nice take on the Victorian setting, Arkane seriously has a flair for design. Yeah it's Karnaca on Serkonos, which is a Mediterranean/subtropical island part of the Empire headed from Dunwall. It's Corvo's and Daud's homeland too, so it will be interesting if any backstory is explored. How can we be sure its on Serkonos and not Pandyssia (or whatever the jungle continent was called?) They said it was Karnaca after the trailer. Also, there's no way cities would have been built on Pandyssia that quickly within 10 years (which I'm assuming is the difference given Emily's age). The interview with the developers just said it was 15 years, that would make her like 25 Corvo's around 54 then. Damn.  the devs said in the aftershow that we're 15 years after the events of dishonored in dishonored 2 No one lives on pandyssia according to the lore as all attempts to colonize it have failed...spectacularly. Where did you guys read all this? All in game or...? All in-game. There are lots of books lying about. In fact old Granny Rags is actually [Dishonored lore spoiler Spoiler](#s "a well known aristocrat who travelled far and wide to the Isles and Pandyssia. It was there that she met and got the Mark of the Outsider. From then on she slowly went insane.") Read the books in game. The place is unbelievably dangerous too, the plague in the first game is caused by rats from there. The locust things or whatever they are presumably come from there and Granny Rags goes mad just from visiting Pandyssia. I've always assumed that if dunwall is "England" then Pandyssia would be "Australia" but with the Lensman arms race of evolution there sped up a thousand times.  Plus the doom of pandyssia has come, according to Raava, all the time, so I think that means pandyssia's civilization completely fell. I think the 'Doom' was just the plague from the first game.
