They can't take everything into account, which is why they'll often misread their audience.  \nThe result of that is that a sale is not the same as a non-sale.  \nA sale sends a clear message of support for the product in the form of a +1, whereas a non-sale doesn't send any message at all.  \nImagine Reddit without downvotes, you lose the simple metric that allows you to tell whether a post or comment is just not popular, or whether it's unpopular.  \nThe point is that not buying *doesn't* send a message.  \nOf course, if a game is crap then you shouldn't buy it, because that's just a responsible purchasing decision.  \n\nThe second is that the developer/publisher aren't in your head.  \nAs an example, if I looked at Fallout 4 and thought \"that looks good, but not \u00a350-good\" and didn't buy it, how would they know *why* didn't buy it?  \nEven if they were able to determine the number of people who would have bought it, but opted against it, they wouldn't know why those potential customers decided against it (and looking at the feedback on the internet is really not a good means of determining, since people will bitch at length about pretty much anything, creating a very unfavourable signal-to-noise ratio).  \nAll they would see is that interest in the product isn't as high as anticipated, and without the context of the individual decisions they can't know why, and the simplest conclusion is just that \"gamers don't want another [series] game\".  \n\nThe TL;DR of it is that not-buying a game doesn't provide any meaningful feedback.  \nDon't buy games that are bad, but don't kid yourself into thinking you're making a meaningful change to the industry with just that act alone.", "gilded": 0, "score": 393, "created": 1434562894.0},{"body": "The best way is a refund system. \"Oh, we sold 100,00 units!\" \"Yeah but, 90% of those were refunded within the first five minutes.\" \"Shit.

Its phil spencer answering the question. He's the boss of Xbox, not of Ea, not of Ubisoft, not of Activision. He can't control the state of games other studios want to release.\n\nPersonally I think he gave the best answer he could. Forcing every future game to have a demo is the best way to ensure companies do well. If people can try the games before playing them, then people can know if a game is broken or not before buying. This will make companies try harder to actually release a good game, because now people don't have to pay to find out its terrible. \n\nEdit: I think demo was the wrong word to use. Elite: Dangerous and The Long Dark both had 60 minute free trials. This means play as much as you can in 60 minutes. Since the first to games of the preview program have this method, its safe to assume every other game will also just have a 60 minute free trial. Play as much as you can in 60 minutes makes it hard for the developer to hide a broken game. This eliminates problems people have mention like developers making the demo perfect, but leaving the rest of the game broken. No, it isn't a flawless plan as people have mentioned. Things like Battlefield 4 campaign loss bugs that take time to happen might not be caught, but it is much better than nothing and still encourages the developer to try their best to eliminate a majority of the bigger bugs.

It's a chicken-and-egg problem, we don't want to spend the development time making a game for a store that has so few customers, and because nobody wants to develop for the store, there continues to be so few customers.\n\nMicrosoft could've stood to have a decent review process for apps in their store as well, instead they let the store go to shit and it ended up with all kinds of malware or apps that didn't even work. By letting the quality of the store drop, customers are less likely to want to use it, which just means even fewer people will see your app, making it even harder to make a profit on the platform.\n\nMicrosoft did themselves no favors by using DirectX on the phone, forcing developers to support a different graphics API than Android and iOS use (OpenGL ES 2 and newer). They also didn't support native code (C++) on Windows Phone 7, which drove away a lot of developers early on that didn't rush back when Windows Phone 8 was released. Developers that had already made multi-platform apps for iOS and Android often did so through C++, and now their multiplatform app couldn't run on Windows Phone 7 without being ported. These things aren't as big of an issue for developers that are using game engines to abstract-away most of the hardware and platform, but that's not a luxury that all devs get to enjoy.\n\nUnrelated: To speak to why many apps launch on iOS ~~first~~ before Android. There a handful of reasons, but there are two big ones that I often see:\n\n1.) Apple will often hint (they never directly promise) that they will promote your app upon its global release, if you launch on iOS-exclusively for a few weeks or more. This allows them to advertise iOS-exclusive apps, and for the developer it can mean a good promotion. Just getting your app in the first 5 slots of 'Best New Games' often translates to at least 150k downloads per day, trailing off to 75-100k minimum by the end of the week long promotion. That's about 750k-1m downloads from a promotion. Without promotion or advertising and your game gets lumped in with the other few dozen games that are submitted each day, and you'll likely see download numbers less than 100 per day. Basically that means that if your app has even a decent ARPDAU (Average revenue per daily active user), that the promotion will bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\n2.) Developing for iOS is easier and takes less time. The development tools for iOS devices are better. But most importantly, the number of hardware devices you'll likely need to test on is maybe 10-15, if you want to be safe. For Android you'll be releasing an app that will run on literally 3-5k different types of Android devices, depending on what kind of restrictions you place on minimum OS version, and some other stuff. Trying to get a game to run properly on most Android devices is a complete nightmare. If you don't have the backing of a decent game engine company (like Unity), then you may have to deal with all the individual qwirks of the different hardware and software issues between devices on your own. Subtle and ridiculous differences that aren't well documented and you often won't know about until the game is released and customers start complaining that your game sucks because it doesn't run on their obscure device. For example, Nvidia GPUs are some of the only mainstream Android devices with 16-bit depth buffers, everyone else is using 24-bit. Your game could run perfect on all iOS devices and not on any Tegra GPU for that reason. Or Qualcomm, who assigns non-sequential unique-identifiers to textures as texture handles, instead of the way just about every other OpenGL device out there does, which is to just increment a counter for each texture, which allows textures to be indexed in an array/list/vector. I've seen a game that ran fine on the Galaxy S2, S3, S4, and then the screen coords were completely screwed up on an S5. I can't remember the exact reason behind that one since it's been awhile, but Samsung made some obscure change in their hardware that forced us to handle the S5 specially. You end up with special case code all over the place to get things working on more and more devices, and that's the kind of shit you almost never have to do with iOS.", "gilded": 0, "score": 2597, "created": 1434605920.0},{"body": "Well microsoft is introducing 'porting' tools for both ios and android with windows 10.

", "gilded": 0, "score": 26, "created": 1434611017.0},{"body": "Been playing non stop for a couple of days, here are a few helpful hints that will get your vault up and running in no time!\n\n-Dwellers have certain S.P.E.C.I.A.L attributes which make them produce more resources when assigned to certain room types. ( Dwellers with high agility stat produce food from dinners quicker than dwellers with a lower agi stat.\n-Dwellers are happier when working in a room that compliments their highest stat\n-Complete challenges ASAP to get lunch boxes. Lunch boxes give you resources, weapons, armor, and rarely, elite Dwellers. Confessor Cromwell pwns.\n-There are 3 methods of gaining new Dwellers:\n \n-Waiting for them to randomly show up at your vault door(low    chance later in game)\n\n -Sending a male and female dweller into a Living quarters room. Give it enough time and they will make a baby! To make the baby making process faster, make sure your maters have a similar charisma level. It takes 3 real hours for the baby to be born, and 3 real hours for the child to become an adult. A bit of warning, children drain resources at adult level, but can't be assigned to work, so be sure not to have too many pregnancies at once. In addition, pregnant women will not fight Radroach infestations, fires, or bandits. \n\n-Occasionaly, your base will be raided by bandits!!! They can chop through your vault door in seconds at level 1, so I recommend upgrading it ASAP! Also, make sure your best armed and armored Dwellers are assigned work close to the vault door, ensuring quick transit to the Vault door room. When bandits are inside, they will drain your resources, and occasionally switch rooms, so make sure you have additional Dwellers waiting just outside the vault room.\n\n-A room of CRITICAL importance is the Radio Room. It is the third method of gaining new Dwellers! Once every few hours, the room will broadcast a signal, and bring a new dweller to your doorstep. As if that wasn't good enough, it also boosts the happiness of all your Dwellers!!\n\n-Perhaps the most important tip however concerns the building of rooms within your vault! All rooms, with the exception of the vault door room, can be expanded to 3 room lengths. The expanded rooms can hold 6 dwellers, is cheaper overall to upgrade, produces more resources, and at a faster rate! \"Sounds OP as fuck!!!!\" You say? Well the downside to 3 long rooms is they consume MUCH more power than a 1 long room, forcing you to balance room size with power consumption!\n\n-once you have some decently equipped Dwellers, you will want to send them to explore the Wasteland! Resist the temptation to send Dwellers out untill you have at least 3 armed Dwellers(1 to explore, 2 to fight off marauding bandits). When out in the waste, your survivors will earn exp killing monsters, find caps, and even find new armors and weapons for Dwellers! Your Explorer will take physical and rad damage in the wastes, so if you're going to send them out for more than 45 minutes, equip them with stims and radaways. To send a Dweller to explore, simply drag them outside your vault door, then add the stims and rads necessary for the length of trip. The longer the Dweller is outside, the more exp, caps and loot you can find!! To see what your Explorer is doing, simply tap the wasteland outside your base, and a event log will pop up for your Explorer. To recall your explorer, click the red recall button bottom right. It takes half the exploration time to return to the vault, goodies in tow!\n\n- Later in the game you can build med bays and science labs to produce stims and rads, but lunchboxes are a decent source if you're lucky early on.\n\n-Eventually you can build stat training rooms, such as gyms, classrooms, and game rooms. Higher stats means more production in given rooms! \n\n-Another danger to your Vault is fires and Radroach infestations. When one pops up, IMMEDIATELY SEND DWELLERS!!!! These emergencies will spread like wildfire(excuse the pun) and can quickly overwhelm you at early levels!!\n\nWell folks, that was a bit more than anticipated! Hope this guide will help you Overseers expand to a massive, thriving community! Good luck!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 142, "created": 1434606738.0},{"body": "I love how your \"helpful hints\" are basically the hints the game gives but with more words. Lol.

Be it killing, stealing, or trading, all hats are mine.\n\nI brought a similar level of role play over to FS. Some of my upper level workers were also guards in certain cases, and since these guards happened to be mostly female (combination of agility favoring women in my vault and having my largest diner up top), this spawned a strange cult of warrior women who abstained from having sex. After changing their names to end with \"The Pure,\" they were forever bound to a life of abstinence and badass gun fights.\n\nI'd also name some of my dwellers after people I know, and try and fit them to that role. I named one guy \"Robbaz of Sweden\" (YouTube guy) and buffed the shit out of his strength. Then he banged every woman in the vault. After banging one of the Pure, Robbaz was banished to the Wastelands for a full day with the armor and weapons he held and 3 of each health/RAD item (he got lucky with his good armor and I forgot that he served as the third floor roach exterminator so he had a decent gun). The Pure lady was renamed to \"The Unpure,\" and was also damned to a day outside the vault. She wasn't so lucky with her items, but so far she picked up better items in the Wasteland than Robbaz. \n\nFallout Shelter is similar to most of my experiences playing Bethesda games.
