To focus entirely on the Klingons would be to abandon, or at least, lose focus of the message of hope for Humanity. \n\nAlso, from a purely pragmatic perspective, Humans tend to need Human characters in their stories so they can relate more easily to what's going on and form an emotional connection or philosophical interest in the story. A series without recurring Human characters with Human problems to overcome will probably fail to land with a large part of the show's audience. I'm sure there are a few niche movies, t.v shows or video games that focus more frequently on other species and races, but all the major licenses I can think of are very Human centric. \n\nHowever, the Federation angle is a touch worn out as you said. Perhaps a Klingon soap opera that focuses heavily on Klingons as well as looking closer into the goings on of other races, who only usually got a few episodes a season and were constantly shrouded in mystery to make them appear more threatening to the Federation, would be an interesting direction for Star Trek to take. But, to counteract the lack of Human connection that could cause, Klingon-Human relations could be seen to have progressed some more, so that more Humans could be involved in Klingon proceedings and customs and it wouldn't be so strange for Worf to have a contingent of Human friends permanently lodged in a Klingon environment. \n\nOops, sorry this reply got so long, but hopefully it makes sense.

Shelter is a fair broader concept than 'homes' and it better captures what happens after a disaster - straight away, the NGO is trying to get people under cover so they're not out in the heat or rain (tarpaulins and emergency shelters), then looking at intermediate steps that might be rebuilding and repairs, rental subsidies etc, and then finally looking for longer term housing options. Maybe some ARC marketing person thought it would be better to talk about housing rather than shelter, which created some of this ambiguity. \n\nHaving said that - I'm sure you as the authors know all this, and you know the ARC says that they spent some of the money on hospitals, roads, the cholera response, shelter etc etc. So, it seems to me to be a bit of a strawman argument to focus only on the lack of permanent housing.\n\nOn the issue of permanent housing, ARC wrote that they built some houses as a pilot, but that there were lots of challenges with permanent housing - including corruption, land title, government land policy etc. They decided not to go ahead with that part of their work. So.... basically, an NGO does a pilot exercise, decides that it doesnt work, decide to change their programming strategy to something else ... and then gets criticised for it? They should have been criticised much more if they stuck with a strategy that they (and all the other donors trying to build houses) could see wasnt going to work. \n\nTL;DR - ARC should be more transparent and accountable.

I have just as good of a chance of choosing the right NGO on the ground as the Red Cross seems to have had despite the millions and millions of dollars at their disposal.

Following the Haiti earthquake in 2010, I submitted my resume to the Red Cross and other notable aid agencies and never received any responses. I indicated on my cover letters that I was a Haitian American and that I was fluent in French, Creole, Spanish, and English. My engineering background and experience were extensive, having worked at several major corporations (i.e. PdVSA). My references were excellent, describing the co-worker/cohort confidence in my professional abilities. Head hunters and human resources personnel from major US and Canadian corporations were contacting me during this period for high paying opportunities in my field. Yet, I was never contacted by the Red Cross. I wanted to work in Haiti and make a direct contribution that would benefit my people. I guess that I was not foreign enough or considered a 'viable' expat. Perhaps, the Red Cross was only interested in using Haiti's misery as a means to satisfy its own debt relief. If the proof is in the pudding, the Red Cross baked a lemon (six houses). So, for all of you who say that it was not the fault of the Red Cross because they just could not find qualified Creole speaking personnel....Hogwash! Myself and other Haitian Americans/Canadians tried and we were never given the opportunity to get to stage no. 1. To Justin Elliott: Thank you, for bringing this issue to light. In the words of William Cullen Bryant, \"Truth Crushed To Earth Shall Rise Again!\"\n\n----\n\nThe Red Cross is a classic example of an organization that's been around too long and whose focus has shifted from fulfilling its mandate to guaranteeing its own success and survival. Typically, they're arrogant and unassailable. Individuals behave much the same way, only within a shorter time span. We have much to learn about how we handle change.\n\n----\n\nI worked in the global health field for years, and ran projects with USAID, the World Bank, Gates, and the other major funders. I also have many friends/colleagues who worked in Haiti after the earthquake (though none for the Red Cross).\n\nI wish I could say that this story is unusual, but it isn't. There is an awful lot of waste, dysfunction and hypocrisy in the aid industry. Yet I would caution readers who do not know much about how global development and aid works to remember a few things:\n\n(1) Overhead is not evil. \"Overhead\" makes an organization function. Like everywhere else, donors get what they pay for. You want a bunch of inexperienced, idealistic 20-somethings to run a multi-million dollar program? Then insist on razor-thin overhead. If, instead, you need professional management (as you would choose for any other kind of major initiative in, say, the States or Europe), you need to have a professional organization run by people who make sustainable (not unreasonable) salaries.\n(2) You cannot simply go into a country like Haiti and do whatever you want. Haiti is/was not a blank canvass for foreigners to begin anew with. For starters, government there is so far beyond dysfunctional and corrupt as to make working there extraordinarily hard even before the earthquake. Absentee landlords will demand extortionate prices for land use (i.e. building homes) when they learn an international group is involved, because they know NGOs have deep pockets. Gov't officials demand endless bribes, and insist on orgs hiring their family/friends/people who have paid them. The gravy train never stops.\n(3) Local talent that has the needed competency level is often hard to find. They've also been bid up already by competing NGOs/agencies who want to poach them away. Experienced expat talent who's willing to relocate to Haiti is often hard to find, and definitely not cheap. Not only is it extremely hard working there, but don't forget that the security situation is constantly hairy.\n\nThere's no doubt that the Red Cross programme in Haiti is demonstrably not a success. But be very careful before concluding that the people involved were incompetent, venal or stupid. They have been trying to operate in an extremely hard situation, often with donors/agencies - like USAID - that are more interested in good press than results. They could've done much better. But there are reasons why they didn't.\n\n----\n\nWe owe a great debt to PP for persisting in this fine investigation. Wiki says that Gail McGovern's original background includes a Johns Hopkins degree in \"quantitative sciences.\" I'm guessing that makes her extra skillful at conflating statistics. This has been going on a very long time in the Red Cross and is typical of most large, bureaucratic non-profits: they stress donor collection skills over anything else. And they justify large CEO salaries with the excuse that it all starts with gathering funds. Well, that may be true, but if you can't deliver on the ground, you're useless. Corporatism (which has certainly spilled over in the non-profit arena) has become micro-focused on making money at the expense of production and quality. It shows up well in the boardroom. How can we expect less from a major non-profit like the RC? They get their leadership from private industry. And frankly, they\u2019ve become greedy.\n\nSure, we know it's difficult to work with locals in other countries. Non-profits should know that going in and spend most of their overhead on educating and sophisticating the actual development workers who must interface with the afflicted populace. Learn to do end runs around local corruption. Learn to target and manage efficiently. Above all, ASK the locals what they need. And be more transparent with your donor public.\n\nThis much of a disconnect between the publicly stated purpose of the Red Cross and what has actually happened is a disgrace and it sounds illegal. Certainly, they shouldn\u2019t be tax exempt when they\u2019re not using this money properly.\n\nI stopped trusting the RC years ago when I discovered that they didn\u2019t always use donations the way they said they were going to. You\u2019d donate for one purpose, and they\u2019d use it for another. Charity Navigator is a good place to check before donating and we need to educate our friends and neighbors about that.\n\nAnd I\u2019m going to complain to my legislators.\n\n----\n\nSpent two years working in Haiti after the earthquake. I could write a book about all of the problems. Somewhat surprised that writers have chosen ex PM Bellerive as a source, as he was a very large part of the problem.\n\nSomeone should ask him why he blocked delivery of Typhoid medicine to the country, and later the Cholera kits.\n\nBill Clinton's IHRC turned into a joke, because Bellreive had ultimate veto authority over the projects the committee approved. Many of the major projects approved by the committee such as sanitation improvements hit a brick wall due to him. The Haitian Government does have imminent domain powers in their Constitution...One needs ask why he never exercised them.\n\nGoing in, we knew from experience at other disasters that the NGOs were very good at the basic rescue portion of their mission. The could get doctors on the ground, food, water, and shelter. The problem is none of them are geared toward, or capable of fixing the basic infrastructure issues on a long term basis. Haiti has a lot of basic infrastructure issues from lack of sanitation, electrical power, safe water, and basic construction issues having to do with the low quality concrete used in buildings - concrete failure, which killed most of the 250,000 or so victims.

But *good* journalism should have noted this beyond \"latest in a series of layoffs\" since I think anybody concerned about donor dollars should actually note the organization's changing business model and view it as a positive, not a negative. The word \"transformative\" gets thrown around a lot, but in the past few years the Red Cross truly has transformed and virtually nobody outside the disaster relief community even noticed.\n\nUntil four years ago or so, the Red Cross (outside of blood services) ran virtually in a franchise model, where each chapter had its own bank account, finance people, HR people, purchasing, marketing/PR, board with fiduciary responsibilities, health &amp; safety product sales force, fundraising, etc. with all of the overhead that entailed.\n\nThe national board brought in McGovern from AT&amp;T with the intention of stripping all that inefficiency out of the organization, doing things like centralizing HR or accounting or purchasing at the state level or higher; taking marketing away from local chapters and making it a district function, combining smaller chapters into bigger regions, etc. She did. It was really painful. In some cases, I think it's gone too far. Locally, for instance, we've probably got less than half the number of staff members in disaster cycle services than we did three years ago but we're responding to the same number of disasters regardless.\n\nHaving lived through this as a volunteer I hated watching a lot of people lose their jobs or have to move around the country, but as a *donor* to the Red Cross it's clear to me how much more efficient we are today than we used to be and how much lower our cost structure must be just given the empty cubicles in the local chapter. Again -- bad for the folks involved, often frustrating to volunteers who're trying to figure out who's got a particular responsibility these days, but done entirely with an eye toward fiscal responsibility. \n\nI'm not against independent reporting on the Red Cross -- I'm a former reporter myself, I value good journalism -- but I do feel that I've yet to see *any* reporting on the Red Cross that truly understood and explained it in all its complexities to an audience.

People like Lawrence Lessig are trying damn hard to change this, but I don't believe they're making much headway. *Result*: Upstarts cannot win elections campaigning on this issue.\n\nYour tool could really help on the \"Ignorance and Apathy\" side, especially if journalists can use it to find stories, but I'm worried that targeted muckraking won't have much effect on the system itself. Do you have any thoughts on that, or on the other two issues?\n\n(Disclosure: Sol is my co-worker, and I think this project is awesome.)", "gilded": 0, "score": 716, "created": 1433095382.0},{"body": "Hi mysterious coworker (find me on Monday to tell me who you are)!\n\nYou bring up a lot of great points.

It's far from decisive.  A better run campaign, or more effective message, will nearly always trump more money in that kind of situation.\n\nAfter that, people also are aware of what most seem to think is a secondary problem, which is that contributors buy access or get what they want from elected officials - although people don't always understand that a lot of this is a mechanism of *selection* rather than direct pay-for-play.\n\nWhat hardly any people think of, though, are things like this:\n\n - [The Wealth Primary](http://cos.livejournal.com/123909.html) (that's a blog post I wrote while working for John Bonifaz's campaign for secretary of state of MA in 2006, but the original blog is gone so that's my update on my personal blog).\n\n - How it skews a politician's outlook and work when such a large chunk of their day to day job is fundraising, personally.  How someone who spends many hours a week making phone calls asking for money is going to do a very different job than someone who spends all their time on legislation, committee meetings, constituent meetings, and other things that we imaging an elected legislator's job actually is.\n\n - How the need to spend much of their time fundraising actually turns a lot of people who away from even running.  People who would be great at the job, who have some experience working as staffers for elected officials and/or on campaigns, but who know that the job is half fundraising and that's not a job they want.\n\n - How it changes the tenor of a campaign when the candidate spends so much less time talking to voters door to door or at town hall type events, because they have to spend so much time fundraising.  This is much more salient in state and local elections, where candidates really could spend most of their campaign talking to voters if they didn't have to fundraise, but these kinds of campaigns are what build up the pool of likely candidates for governor or federal office.\n\nSo many people out there are fed up about how money corrupts politics, but are focused on solving the rather minor problem of duelling Senate candidates competing for who has more millions, rather than the things we really need to be focusing on, like the wealth primary.\n\nThis matters a lot, because these problems are different enough that they call for very different kinds of solutions.  While *some* things (like a Constitutional amendment undoing *Citizens United*) will help with all of it, many other measures are more targeted at the more important problems - and these are exactly the kinds of measures most people don't know enough to care about.\n\nEdit: For people who clicked on it earlier, there was a stale link in my Wealth Primary post.  I fixed it.  This is a post I wrote exploring ways in which money distorts and corrupts politics, many of which a lot of people who aren't in politics don't usually think of:\nhttp://bluemassgroup.com/2006/05/money-and-campaigns/", "gilded": 0, "score": 72, "created": 1433101537.0},{"body": "&gt; find me on Monday to tell me who you are\n\nLol this is reddit, no one can know who you are on reddit!

Can you imagine this now?? That you don't have to worry about getting a job after all of this.\n\nBTW education was truly free. If you pass the tests to get into university, you'd study for free.

So I don't know what North Koreans would say, but I can say that having been so isolated for so many years, even though nowadays there is much more foreign media smuggled through underground organizations, I feel that North Koreans could take a bit of time to figure out what freedom really means. For example, when I was in China, I was offered to come to US, and I said \"no\" because I was told that in North Korea, the US is our enemy state and we have to destroy it someday. So I said \"no\" first, and then the person who offered me told me to discuss this opportunity, so I went back to my underground church pastor, and I asked him \"Why should I go to America?\" and he said because i could continue my education, and the second thing is that I could have freedom. And that didn't catch my ear, because I knew what freedom was, but until he was elaborating what freedom *WAS* - I could go outside anytime I wanted to go out (because when I was in China, I was hiding, and then I stayed in an apartment for so long, so going outside was something luxurious).

We made a [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/solojazzcup?fref=ts), we made a [tumblr](http://solojazz.tumblr.com/), sold shirts, and eventually, one of us decided to contact Solo Corp. about the design.\n\n[The Solo Jazz design was created by a designer in the Springfield, MO Art Department at Sweetheart. Her name is Gina](http://i.imgur.com/h9WBVvR.jpg). So, I hope you guys can find Gina, because I really like her design, but I also doubt that she understands the emotional impact the cup has on children born in the 80s and raised in the 90s.\n\nLATER EDIT: Googling has revealed [another Solo Jazz related e-mail thread which confirms Gina as the designer](http://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/comments/25gm07/super_verbose_guy_is_way_too_interested_in_solo/). The Reddit thread is a year old, dunno the age of the e-mail thread.\n\n**LATEST EDIT**: So, this has become far more interesting than I could have hoped for. I recognize that this thread is over, but perhaps someone searching reddit next time this topic comes up will see this and find it as interesting as I do.\n\nLate last night I got several replies / messages from a designer named Stephanie, who uses Reddit as /u/samm0404. She appears to be the designer of the original 'Jazz Design'. Stephanie worked for a company called Imperial Bondware, which may or may not be known as [Imperial Paper](https://www.internationalpaper.com/US/EN/index.html) these days (google was unclear). There is an Imperial Bondware in WI, but Stephanie claims she worked for them in Ohio... who knows, not that important.\n\nStephanie designed the Jazz design in 1988, which falls in line with the response Solo Cup gave someone else in 2009 regarding the Jazz design. After putting the cups into production, Imperial [\"thought it was too forward thinking\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/394teo/ama_request_the_graphic_designer_who_made_the/cs19yki), and discontinued production. What happened next is unclear... somehow the design fell into the hands of Solo Cup in 1991, who gave it to Gina to tweak before putting into production in 1992, and the rest is history.\n\nI'm still trying to find Gina, because it's important to hear both sides of a story before declaring one canonical over the other. I wonder if Solo bought the design from Imperial (without consulting either artist, of course). Solo claims that the Jazz design came from \"an internal design contest\" so maybe Gina 'took insperation' from Stephanie's design and submitted it as her own... \n\nEither way, it would make for one hell of a 99% invisible story... get at me NPR!\n\n**REAL LAST EDIT**\nObligatory [WE DID IT REDDIT](http://www.news-leader.com/longform/news/local/ozarks/2015/06/17/internet-looking-designed-cup-springfield/28881969/) followed up by a shout out to /u/tgounley for doing real reporting!
