The answers below are me babbling about how much I love to love my bird.  This is like a \"best of\" of parrot ownership.  It takes a lot of work, preparation, effort, and research to own a bird (much like choosing to have a child).  But if you put in that hard work, it's so very rewarding.  \n\n-  Age:  8 years.  [Here are pictures of his 8th birthday!](http://imgur.com/a/epDBj)  \n\n-  How loud:  Average noise level throughout the day is remarkably quiet.  Definitely quieter than any kids in my neighborhood, I'll tell you that.  He can sometimes scream at an uncomfortable volume (think toddler tantrum level), and it usually means the same things as a kid screaming.  The cause is usually that he's scared of something, he's hungry, or it's getting close to bedtime and he's tired and cranky.  At most, we'll hear him scream a couple times a week.  He normally talks at a normal indoor volume when he wants something, and we always pay attention to him when he does (to encourage normal volume vocalizations).  Sometimes he just gets caught in a neverending loop of \"hello\"s, but you can just let him do his thing and it never gets intrusive.  \n\n- Lifespan: Normally around 60 years.  World record is somewhere around 90 years.  \n\n- Strangers:  We've only had him since October, and Dad his still his favorite person in the world.  I only recently gained his trust.  We had to slowly teach him that I did not, in fact, want to kill him, and that strangers weren't going to hurt him either.  He's pretty \"hands-off\" with everybody though; he's not particularly cuddly and doesn't like much physical affection.  He'll let us mess with him and play with him, but nothing that lasts more than a few minutes.  Nowadays, he will step up onto just about anybody, and will accept treats and do tricks for anyone.  Trick-training helped his overall demeanor immensely.  \n\n-  Flying:  We're only just getting to harness training him.  Up until this point, we've kept one wing clipped.  Now, we're letting it grow out so that we can work on flight training.  The goal is to eventually let him fly in an open area on a 40-foot elastic tether.  For now, he wears his harness outdoors just in case he tries to fly away.  But I've still never seen him fly.  He's content to just pad around on the floor, and I'm not really sure he's ever tried flying.  Once he's flighted, I'm not terribly worried about him trying it indoors.  Our apartment is too small for that.  \n\n-  Cleanup:  He's potty-trained.  He really likes to poop when on a perch or perch-like thing so that it doesn't get in his feathers.  He has a large manzanita play perch in the living room which he can climb onto or off of via ladders.  The perch has a large catch tray below it with layers of newspaper covering it, so cleanup is as easy as swapping them out twice a week.  He will also go to the bathroom on command, which is convenient for trips outdoors and car rides.  His food is what's messy!  Half of what he eats ends up on the bottom of his cage or on his catch tray.  But it's just a matter of sweeping up crumbs, or the weekly wipe-down.

As in, if you're in your 20s, and buy a hatched macaw, there's a very real possibility that animal can outlive you.  While some are well adjusted and loving and sweet (macaws especially are usually a little less needy), they can simply be born \"hell on wheels,\" and be extremely difficult to deal with.\n\n\nTaking good care of them involves good quality pellets and tons of fresh food.  In my house, where we normally hover right around 10 birds, we have an entire freezer full of chop, birdy bread, and various fresh foods.  I cook for them more than I cook for my SO and I.\n\n\nAll that being said, parrots are extremely interesting and amazing animals.  They have a capacity for intellectualism that I have never seen in any other type of animal.  The ones that have been abused, have a very good chance of being friendly again in the right hands.  They can make wonderful companions FOR THE RIGHT PERSON.\n\n\nSo yes, sorry for rambling, I just get a little riled seeing somebody telling others that they're great pets without going into why they can be awful pets.\n\n\nSource:  I rescue, foster, and adopt birds, many of which have been abused and majorly fucked up by their well meaning owners that had no idea what they were signing up for.\n\n\nEdit: if anyone is truly interested in getting a parrot, check out local rescues in your area.

KBB tries its hardest to imply that they are an \"official\" value but really a car is worth what someone will pay for it, just like anything else.  \n\nHere's some mental exercises to demonstrate this:  \n-lets say you have a 1994 ford explorer 4 door sport with the KBB average 167282 in fair condition and standard options.  Trade value to a dealer is $353.  Now add the tow hitch.  Is this explorer really worth $125, or 33% of its value, more just because of a tow hitch? In all likelihood, this vehicle is going to the scrap yard either way and the extra 15 pounds of tow hitch will net the owner pennies.  But also in all likelihood, the dealer will offer you $500 or $1000 to make you feel good about the deal, and make up the loss elsewhere in the financing or price of the vehicle you are trading for. (Note, this does NOT suddenly make the explorer worth $500-$1000)\n\n-pick a 2010 Chevy Malibu LS with 250,000 miles (suppose a fleet, or some crazy person who drives 40k+ a year), then change the miles to 300,000, and then 400,000. Notice the value doesn't change? But those extra miles have to be worth something to someone.
