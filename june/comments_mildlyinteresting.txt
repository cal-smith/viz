How do they open that without releasing all the bees into the building? Beekeeper here. The entire structure probably detaches from the entry tube, I'm assuming you could just plug up the hole temporarily to bring the structure outside to perform maintenance and what not. I'm sure the material is some sort of plexiglass to prevent accidental damage, but what interests me is the climate control. Bees are able to (relatively) control temperatures inside the hives but without the normal means of open-air ventilation, I'm curious how they accommodate. A nature center near me has a similar setup, and they have air circulation fans on the non-clear sides of the hive box. Could be that we just can't see them. I posted elsewhere in the thread, but here are some more pictures if you were overly curious.  There are [vents on the sides](http://www.medinabeekeepers.com/index.php?title=Library_Observation_Hive). I guess they must just function ok with normal room temp... but I would imagine it gets pretty warm inside there.

What is normal temp of a bee hive? Usually 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit, they use their wings to fan and move air appropriately, but I was wondering in this case if the setup would be "overworking" the bees due to the lack of outside airflow  I bet that's why most the bees are toward the bottom.  All the heat is rising to the top. *You are now subscribed to bee facts! Did you know that each hive has bee "bouncers" that prevent bees from different swarms/hives from entering?* /unsubcribe *Did you know that the Queen bee doesn't have a barbed stinger like the rest of the worker bees? That means she can sting multiple times and bee fine. However Queen bees have bee known only to sting when killing other Queens. A hive may start to grow multiple new Queens at a time if something happened to the previous Queen. The first one to hatch will kill all the other ones in their eggs! They'll never bee Royals!* They'll never bee Royals!

I laughed way too hard at this. Oh *god.* *Did you know that if you split a hive in two you need to move the new hive more than at least a mile away from the old one? Otherwise the bees will abandon the new hive and return to the old one!* Don't you mean Oh Lorde?  you need to subscribe to Apostrophe Facts *Did you know the average lifespan of a Honey Bee in the summer is around 2 weeks? They work themselves to death! I can't beelieve it!* &gt; Queen bee's have be known only to sting

You missed a pun, chief. *Did you know that bee keepers wear white suits because bees sting dark colours more? One way to gauge the aggressiveness of a colony is to put a black target nearby and see how many times it gets stung!* It looks like you tried to write /subscribe but made a typo. You sure do love bees! You will now receive twice as many bee facts in your inbox! *Bee fact 247: you can order queen bees off the internet for $20-50 USD* ...one day I'm going to get too drunk to stop myself and buy some bees. /hang my self *Did you know that older Queens will sometimes start laying exclusively Drone eggs instead of Worker eggs? I like to call these Bee/Cougar hybrids!* Herro, and welcome to movie phone! WHY DONTTTT U JUST *TELLL* ME THE NAME OF THE MOVIE YOU SELECTED You should make a subreddit! There's already a /r/batfacts and /r/birdfacts. Why not /r/beefacts? That's not a bad idea honestly. We already have /r/beekeeping though, kinda similar? We'd love to have visitors! I use /r/batfacts for posting a daily fact while /r/batty is more for discussion and events and so forth. I'd definitely subscribe to a /r/beefacts or even a more broad /r/bugfacts (though bees aren't technically bugs!) &gt; bees aren't technically bugs

Go on.... you're so enthusiastic that even i, an insectophobe, actually visited! What's the smaller box between the rest of the tube and the housing? Perhaps thats helps? Wouldn't it be possible to have mesh screens to allow airflow without allowing the bees into the building? Probably wouldn't want to do that. Kids would likely get stung through the mesh. Plus the plexi allows for greater visibility. Drill some holes in the plexiglass. Yeah why dont they just take one side of the plexi glass off? Why are we acting like this is a difficult problem? Leave the hive completely open. Make the whiny brat children wear beekeeping uniforms at all times while in the library. Keep all the books in individually sealed plastic bags to keep them from being damaged by the bees. Done. Easy! Its like I'm reading the online comments in the politics section of my local newspaper. I don't see why we need to dumb down my melittological interests just to cater to a bunch of molly-coddled kids.  Mount the beehive against one of the windows. Kids look out, bees look in. Done. Double layer of mesh with an air gap in between... If only on the top / bottom would allow convective airflow and keep kid hands away. Then i'd imagine it would be pretty hard to see what's going on inside there. also noisy. Maybe we just shouldn't have beehives indoors. :| One issue to consider is allergies. In addition to honey, bees also collect and store a significant amount of pollen in the hive, which could pretty easily waft out of a screen. Another issue is the smell - I've got 11 hives, and believe me when I tell you, the shed I store my bee-related items (gear, old frames, boxes, etc.) in has a very distinct odor. I wouldn't go as far as to call it offensive, but it isn't necessarily something I'd suggest in a library. The best way I can describe it is as a sweet, cinnamony aroma with a bit of musk.  I've seen a lot of these and never have they been stand alone like this. Normally they share a wall with the building so you only get 1 glads wall. I imagine that would be much better for temp comtrol Japanese bees are pretty amazing at using that high temp as a weapon. It could be that these people actually aren't very good beekeepers, and *aren't* accommodating the bees properly. These things are really for easy observation,learning, and grabbing attention.

It's really a small fraction of the space a full sized beehive needs, and it requires a fair bit of juggling by the beekeeper to maintain the bees at this size. It also requires more artificial feed than a proper colony (hence the jar you see by the entrance tube).

Ventilation is likely not the greatest problem. It's probably in a temperature controlled building, and a small colony only needs a fairly small opening. Bee here... *flies away* [deleted] [Nah... I'll just watch the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmZvOhHF85I) Apparently i need to listen to more bass.

Usually when I wake up, I'm on the other side of the room and there is kind of a slug trail on the ground.

I don't know why I keep doing this... but it has something to do with the bees... I fucking swear. [They don't](http://i.imgur.com/ZpgdcBj.gif) The Butterfly Pavilion north of Denver [has one](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VZ1lMa_O2W8/VEL89dNfnuI/AAAAAAAAELQ/7wRtVkeZ4cg/s1600/bees.JPG) as well. That's awesome!  I really want to make one now. That is awesome! I would have spent so much time staring at that in my library. I was a nerd that hung out in the library all the time, and that would have been awesome to see :) I did! It was the coolest thing.  I did the same with aquariums growing up, just sitting n watching for hours I finally got to go to the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga not too long ago! It was amazing! I was the last one of my family out of the building because I just had to keep stopping and staring!

I was supposed to go in the fifth grade. Got sick instead! :( Too bad you don't live in Tennessee. You could visit it more often.  Maybe he could take the choo choo? As a Chattanoogan I hope my son doesn't take it for granted like I did growing up.  It really is amazing! Oh, honey. That's gotta bee the best pun I've heard all week. I wish I could delete all the horrible puns on Reddit. It would be a never ending job, but it would be so fun. What a buzz kill. Honey comb on don't bee like that This is such a happy comment. I didn't hang out in the library all the time, but I would have if that was in there. Libraries are awesome. We have a [bee tree](https://imgur.com/a/NdIX9) where I work.  This thing caused me to skip Western Civ as a sophomore. So entranced, didn't want to leave.  B3 I recognise that tree! [The beekeepers posted a gallery](http://imgur.com/84q3dtS,MmYuQkf,C2zenlp,frI5Dys,5sypVI3,K0F16yR,FpWNJO7,3tZzumF,hdZ5YWB,zLSdQUO,fkY8LQ6,sOT3gEt,YElf5SU,ZOSlk4T,uFDfTxC,9A7abWE,DqFJAnw,cTTv1Hc,8Skk9Js,vzB7HeF,x7ZGxBb,CXTDnq4,Fe8HAC9#0) of the installation at /r/beekeeping. A bee hive in a kids section? What could possibly go wrong!? I work at this library and nothing has gone wrong...yet. Where's the tube located on the outside? My first thought when seeing this is, some asshole is going to fuck with the tube It's well away from the sidewalk on the side of the building. I have yet to meet someone who is either 1. a big enough jerk to mess with the bees, which are our town mascot or 2. dumb enough to go toe to stinger with 100s of bees.  Or both. I know you probably aren't the one responsible for putting this there, but contrary to what people are saying I think this is really awesome. Honestly, I don't know anything much about bees but it is something very interesting and kids will remember having the bee hive in their library for a long time. Especially if something goes wrong... I kid, obviously, but yes it is very cool. And OP is being deceptive, it isn't even set up yet for the year. We've had to postpone because of all the issues that honey bees have been having with colony collapse, etc. and the hive won't be put in for another couple of weeks now.

Edit: apparently it got put in today after I left work.  you have a surprise waiting when you go to work tomorrow ;) ...aaand "I'm sorry for calling you deceptive, OP." &gt;yet.

 This is called an observation hive. Plenty of museums or schools have one. Reddit is full of kneejerk pussy nerds who think anything cool might equal a lawsuit. "Life is supposed to only be lived seriously and analytically post-high school. I didn't go to any parties or socialize or miss class once because I was in college for an education. I don't take part in frivolous games or hobbies, I have a career." - Shit I've seen many times on Reddit.

Meanwhile, there are millions of normal people who can balance these things without becoming homeless. And then the Redditors complain about being alone. I wonder why? Because they never developed any social skills. Being entirely adverse to risk makes for a horribly underwhelming life IMO. I used to feel that way, I wanted to calculate everything in my life, so I avoided cool things for a long time. Come to find out, you don't die stepping out your front door.

If you (proverbial you) don't mind that and just like to pursue wealth and achievement, that's cool. But don't berate others and diminish their happiness because you aren't. Reddit honestly makes me depressed because of how cynical it can be.

 I was ready to read something in your statement that went overboard, but you said that pretty accurately. So... How is the bees can find their way out through a narrow ass tube, but when they get in my kitchen they can't locate the wide open door opposite the giant crazy monster with a broom? Guys its probably a shatter resistant polymer like lexan I wasn't thinking about the viewing panel, I figured the weak link is the tube. I'm 100% behind things like this, but my first thought on seeing it was that we should probably take off that door handle on the front.

Even if that baby's screwed down, i could see some child tugging on it, and then tugging on it harder and then... bees. Are you really 100% *beehind* this? Now you're thinking like a 7 year old. ...with portals Yeah really it should have been right up against the wall with no tube. As someone allergic to bee stings, and a healthy respect and admiration for bees, I thought the same thing.

http://www.undercurrent.org/blog/2009/09/10/diving-shark-attack/ THERE IS AN OVERABUNDANCE OF BEES IN THIS THREAD. [THIS VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYtXuBN1Hvc) OUGHT TO PUT A STOP TO THAT! THE SITUATION HAS ONLY BEEN MADE WORSE BY THE ADDITION OF MORE BEES! QUICK, SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING BEE RELATED! yeah, im sure the librarians just let them put them bees in a kid section of a library with absolutely no consideration to the location its in  
  
kids just poke it and it'll break, the constructors just didnt care at all and want to get sued along with the library for getting sued because they just did not care even a little bit
  
le epic paranoid brainless redditor meme [deleted] Oh god! and the sharp corners on the books and table too! Wtf are they thinking?!? But.... Thomas J can't see without his glasses! :( At least it will make the kids beehave... Ha! You deserve a hivefive for that one.  I don't see what all the buzz is about An infant less than one year old could eat the honey. It has a door. I'm getting that call of the void feeling that I get on airplanes when I see the emergency exit at 30,000 feet, except with more bees. They can nurture an understanding and respect for these rapidly dying creatures that help our earth thrive every day without most people even knowing.  OH MY GOD WHY DONT WE JUST KEEP OUR CHILDREN AWAY FROM EVERYTHING JUST IN CASE.  Right next to the anaconda hugging tree over in the bobcat petting corner. Oh god. Not only the bees but think of the hard wooden floor, the sharp cornered books, and omg don't even get me started on those ceiling fans! I know just what this thread needs...

more BEES!!!

http://youtu.be/PYtXuBN1Hvc Bees? Beads? Beads! We'll see who brings in more honey! If there's one thing I've learned from my children, it's that they can't be trusted with glass objects nearby. Let alone glass objects full of bees. They actually have something similar at the science center here. On the top floor there is a hive on the side of the building except part of the hive is also inside.

It's encased in 2 or 3 plates of plexiglass all bolted together and sealed. I'm guessing this library has something similar. Let me try too: Vancouver?

Seems like they have these at EVERY science centre. Science World Represent!
 Anyone remember the old Vancouver science museum? Seattle? I remember going as a kid and seeing this, and have always wanted to visit again.  Yeah, the Pacific Science Center has one of these beehives. Museum of Science in Boston?
 Orlando Florida? Montshire Museum in Norwich VT? Academy of Natural Sciences in Philly? Exactly what I thought of when I saw this! I remember going there as a kid and seeing something similar. Philly. Liberty Science Center NJ/NY? 

Took my daughter there for her birthday last year and [the bees](http://lsc.org/see-whats-happening/current-exhibitions-and-experiences/bees/) were inside and outside on the top floor just like you described. 3 plates of plexiglass? That might keep the President safe but I give a determined toddler 2 and a half minutes. The only time I had a bad experience with bees was when I sprayed them with water and taped them to a table. I mean, I wouldn't expect that to result in peaches and rainbows for anybody involved. Good thing it's not a glass object  [deleted] Get outta here, this is MY town! [deleted] I haven't been to the Medina library in forever. How long has the hive actually been there? Maybe I'll make a trip there after work. I went to the medina library as a kid in the 90's. I went there for the first time since it was remodeled n couldn't believe it! Its gorgeous,  like a modern museum!  Yep that's the one :) Please note that it is Medina, pronounced like vagina. Choose your books carefully, kids, or you will release the bees from cleverly hidden tubes! TIL that outdoor bees don't mind travelling down a long tube inside a building to get to a hive.  

And now that I thought of the term "outdoor bees", I'm picturing people with pet bees, tied to tiny little strings buzzing around their heads.   Medina ohio home of some bees We had one of these at the nature center I worked at! You can feel the warmth and vibration of the bee mass by touching the glass (we not only allowed it but suggested it whenever a kid was around). 

What's really cool is trying to find the queen, she's usually surrounded by workers and is bigger than the rest. So, moments of terror followed by years of therapy are just a.....stone's throw away. Or just the last 4 Harry Potter books.  /r/interestingasfuck/ We just put ours in at my work yesterday :D How are the kids going to squeeze through that tiny tube to play with the bees? A few of my local museums have them, they're basically reinforced glass and steel cabinets where you can see the hive structure inside, but there's no risk of any getting out through the cabinet into the building  
Encouraging bees in the urban environment and educating kids in an interesting way all in one go  In case of children break glass.  #The sign above that handle reads *"WHAT EVER YOU DO, DON'T PULL"* [Did you press the button Dougal?](https://zippy.gfycat.com/GlitteringGrizzledFluke.gif) Upvote for Ted reference.  I hear this library is the buzz of the town.  I'd give it a B [It looks like their's a lot of bees, but they could always use more...] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYtXuBN1Hvc)

 My elementary school had this. The lousy part was the tube leading outside faced the parking lot that we played kickball on. So whoever was the kicker always had bees flying around them.  i thought this said "my local library has a kids section with a tube that leads outside." I was confused for a bit after i saw the picture. IS it just me or is this way more than mildly amusing? The bees probably think their neighbors are a bunch of annoying assholes. Their neighbors are little kids, so yeah they're annoying assholes. On a related note, bee stings in the general vicinity of the library are up 315% since bee hive was added.  They had something similar to this at the science center in Miami when I was a kid. Definitely one of my favorite parts.it was always fun putting your ear up against it and feeling the vibrations. that is like the key environmental exploit for a boss fight

shoot that with a shotgun and cue the bees
 And if the kids get rowdy, free the bees! Well that's cool. I have an observation hive like this at my Montessori school.
We got it from thebeecause.org.  Check it out.  It's a really cool project. This is the greatest thing ever.

It just screams OPEN THIS. Just to ensure that the kids Beehive themselves /r/mildlyhorrifying I would go so far as to say this could belong in /r/interestingasfuck
 In three weeks this is is gonna be on the front page of TIFU &gt; with a tube that leads to the outside.

definitely necessary but... I mean... that must be a fun parking lot right? Oops...I broke the glass.  I know the picture is potato quality but there is a door handle on both sides lol so no need to break the glass So kids can open this bad boy up and release bees into the library? "I saw this on Oprah once" It looks like there's a lock at the top right corner of the door.  Looks like 3 bees escaped They have something like this at the botanical garden/nature center near me. They even put a little white dot on the queen, so she's easier to pick out. It's a very popular exhibit.  I love playing with fire. I always love looking at these. I love how it helps you to find the queen. Yeah there was a blue dot on her, never realized how different she looked compared tp the rest :) Black &amp; Yellow! Hey son, wouldn't it be cool to see the bees come out? *bangs on glass* What if everything was bees? I've been going to the Iowa State Fair for the last 20 years consecutively. In one of the buildings there is 4 hives placed within the building in series. 
 Everything changed when the bee nation attacked.  :O I want that in my house! I think its the other way around: your local beehive has a library in the brood-cell section, with a passage so humans can get outside. I love it! But really, does it need that handle on that door? I don't see a lock. I am concerned. Welcome to MPLS! Wish I could stay! But I'm only here to connect to Salt Lake City. Your airport is fucking amazing though!
 too bad, this is the best time of year to be in Minneapolis Seriously though, I walked outside and was like this weather is amazing! Sadly in a few weeks it will be 90+ with high humidity.  even the birds are bumpin I need to smell fresh air, stepped out the backdoor and fell down the stairs. Ain't nothin like the sound of the leaves when the breeze penetrates these southside trees Leanin' up against one, watchin' the vibe All of this is in the wrong order and it makes me cry.  The kids get treats and old folks get classic cars?  Leanin' up against one, watchin the vibe. Forgettin' all about the stress, thanking god I'm alive
 Thank you for that. Ah, but the thing that makes summer evenings in MN amazing is that when the sun reaches the horizon, the humidity and temp goes down and it feels glorious to sit outside on the patio. And drink heavily. This man is doing MN right.  Then the Mosquitos come, I'll take the heat over Mosquitos any day  And that's when Duluth get's above 50. I can't wait. . .  Going there next week for a job interview! Can't wait. Good luck! The business community here is amazing.  Good Luck! The unemployment rate there is PHENOMENALLY low. If you have a recent work history, you should have no problem. Good luck!  Good luck! Pop on over to /r/TwinCities if you need any recommendations on food, etc! From Winnipeg, and I love visiting Minneapolis. Stayed downtown last time I went and everything is so easy to access compared to our shit hole here it's unbelievable. Great parks through out the city too. Had my dog with me, but felt very safe walking around late at night too.
 Bonus trivia! Minneapolis was planned such that all lake and riverside property remain public, as opposed to say, the west 'burbs where mega mansions dominate the lakes.  Love this city.  I went to the one lake that has the trail around it, just like five mins south of downtown. Was packed. Super cool. Like any largish city, there are some parts of Mpls that aren't great at night, but for the large part, the city is pretty safe in the evening (especially considering that in the 90's, Minneapolis was known as "Murderapolis" and had real bad crime rates.) If you're downtown or south of the city it's really safe, go north of the city and it's a little sketchier....

And, because it's the offseason and you seem nice - go Wil......uh, go Jets.  Or you can use judgemental maps' take on [Mpls](http://judgmentalmaps.com/post/48615076593/minneapolis) I want to know more about "That Fucking KMart." It's a giant-ass K Mart on Lake Street, a weird melting pot of trust fund hipsters, homeless hipsters, homeless, Africans, Hispanics, sketchy people, etc.... Basically the strangest place in the city. It's also the only K Mart I've ever seen that has good business It's also the reason that Nicollet doesn't go straight through the city and you have to take that messed up jog around the building. There have been plenty of petitions to tear it down to help traffic flow around that area. Isn't that Kmart closed though? I just drove by recently and I believe the signs were all gone Could be. I haven't lived in the TC for 3 years. I still visit my parents. I drove right down Lake Street around Christmas but I don't remember how the KMart looked.  Picture a major street. Picture a huge amount of traffic going through the street. Now cross that with another major street. Now take that intersection, and turn it into a T by throwing a big box store down on one side of it, making it the only block for miles that doesn't go through. Now all the traffic has to take a roundabout few blocks on fucked up side streets to get back to the main street. It's probably the most hated building in Minneapolis. It's built at the intersection of two of the biggest roads in the city, forcing traffic to go around on completely inadequate side streets. It is suspected that it was built to keep poor and minority people south of Lake street. It's also just a shitty pointless Kmart. In St. Louis, we have two bad compass directions: north St. Louis, and East St. Louis (technically a separate city, but whatever).

North St. Louis

* Basically the Wire
* Gunshots
* Bad place to get lost
* Empty lots
* Industrial decline

Can't fucking wait to hit up the cities again. And I'm all couped up inside studying alllll week... *sigh* I believe it was voted the best airport in the US! We're all pretty amazing too, and super humble. Thanks for the relevant username, buddy!  Contrary to my username, I actually love it here. I love your username though. &gt;Your airport is fucking amazing though!

Never woulda thought I would enjoy airport sushi so much. Hope you enjoy SLC! Lots to do, especially outdoors! And if you do partake in alcoholic beverages, don't let the "watered down" booze wife's-tale steer your away; there is plenty of great (full strength) booze to be had in Utah!  Ah! Welcome to Salt Lake then! When you get here, anyway! This is honestly the first time I have heard someone compliment our airport! Are you kidding me?  I love it.  You sit down, order some shit off an ipad and it comes to you quickly.  It's awesome.  You all use BGP? Networking jokes.  RIP or bust. Is this in North Mpls? I know they had a tornado there a few years back. I was freaking out because I am from Minneapolis but in Philly right now and was like, I didn't know we have a tornado! Must be from a few years ago in North Minneapolis. Also the airport is the finest, G concourse really I can concur as someone who travels every week Yes it is. I can see the house I grew up in on the photo, which made this *very* mildly interesting for me. Yeah, it's really amazing how grand of a scale tornadoes work on. This one in Wisconsin is visible on Google maps even when you zoom out to the full-state magnification: 
http://imgur.com/U54aFFE

Edit: since this is getting some attention here's the Google maps link for the lazy. Just zoom out to see the full thing. It's over half the length of door county! (The peninsula on Wisconsin) http://goo.gl/maps/EE9A4

Edit 2: ohboyohboyohboy, in the words of madonna, "like a redditor, gilded for the very first time" I'm amazed at how straight that is. I thought tornadoes were supposed to be all unpredictable and zig-zaggy. &gt; I thought tornadoes were supposed to be all unpredictable and zig-zaggy.

They are somewhat, but as they spend more time on the ground and pick up more debris, it smooths out the path. 

You can actually see this in the image above. As it starts in the SW corner, it is narrow and moves around a bit. Towards the middle (likely peak strength) it almost looks like a straight line because of the amount of debris causing damage to a wider area. Towards the end of the path, it weakens, narrows and you can see more variation again in its damage path.  What a plot twist. Plot - plot of land

Twist - twister/tornado

Dang, a double pun...I am not worthy Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hating I get money
Then I double on tonkas
 Man, that really has my head spinning.  [That happens too..](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Ground_Scar_from_May_31,_2013_El_Reno_tornado.jpg) http://i.imgur.com/ITG0iBL.jpg I feel bad but I'm having trouble seeing it :( [deleted] I'm pretty sure you would know really quick.  El Reno is an entirely different story. That shit was thought impossible until it happened.  I actually did a study using the damage path and laid it over top of the city I work for and used it as a good example of disaster planning.. Its used all the time now for examples of What If That is fair, but it is still an anomaly. That's all I am saying. If that tornado hit OKC, I don't even know... Could you tell me better the scale of disaster that would be? What happened with El Reno? Did it just turn unexpectedly? Yes. It did. It was also 2.6 miles wide, had winds in excess of 300 mph, and turned unexpectedly when it was completely hidden in rain. I had a few friends there chasing it, and they accidentally have photos of it, but at the time they thought it was just rain and wind. It was so intense it basically torqued itself around. 

[Most tornadoes follow a relatively straight course, from southwest to northeast](http://www.erh.noaa.gov/gsp/localdat/cases/2011/27April_EpicOutbreak/SoutheastTornadoTracks.gif), for reasons I cannot explain very well without some technical terms, but just believe me. 

That is just an example of one of the worst  (If not the worst) single day outbreak in history, April 27th 2011. Was in Tuscaloosa on April 27th. I can't even watch the weather channel storm chasers episode about it.  This was the day my granddad let me drive his truck while the 'quirky' Buick my grandmother lent me was in the shop. There were smaller tornados nearby but his truck only got the hail. 

My grandmother refused to make a claim to their insurance (they had full coverage), because she felt it would be dishonest since it 'should have been' in their garage.  Basically yes, it started moving southeast, then turned around and moved northeast again.. A very atypical moving storm.

I saw a supercell earlier this spring on radar moving directly south near Odessa. That is real strange too..

Supercells can latch onto any atmospheric boundary and move in strange paths.. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_El_Reno_tornado

Widest tornado in history according to wikipedia
 I read this as *Wildest* and thought "How can they judge that?" Left turns by tornadoes are not all that uncommon. It's a standard part of the life cycle of violent tornadoes: the parent [supercell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercell) storm produces a new circulation as the old one turns to the left and dies out (you can even see it in some damage path maps, like [this one](http://www.srh.noaa.gov/images/oun/wxevents/20110524/maps/overview-800.jpg) and [this one](http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=events-19990503)). 

The surprising part about this tornado was that it increased massively in size, from just a few hundred feet across to almost 2 miles across, in just a few minutes. That was the part that was unexpected, and ended up catching many people in its path.

[Here's a video of one storm chaser fleeing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNeLNoyGqVU). You can see how relatively small the tornado is around the two minute mark, then when they look back at the 9 minute mark it takes up the entire horizon.

Edit: Another issue was that the tornado sped up drastically, moving at around 50 mph as it turned towards the northeast. While nearby chasers should have known this was a possibility, the fact is it doesn't happen very often, so people tend to get complacent and take risks that can lead to tragedies like this. 
Skip Talbot's Storm Chasing Chronicles video about the[ El Rino tornado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJOjjzHUwsk) explains how this storm caught many chasers off guard.   

Also, I feel that this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxgU1QcFMJM) better illustrates how dangerous this tornado quickly became. Wow, this is a great video. Thanks for posting. Largest Tornado in recorded history barely missed hitting metropolitan area of several hundred thousand, also not to mention Tinker Airforce Base which is home to Billions of Dollars of B-52 bombers, B-2 stealth bombers, and other expensive military planes.

If I remember at the time the area roads where gridlocked with people trying to get out of the city, so if it had hit the area there would of been tens of thousands of people in cars with basically no chance of surviving.

I just had moved out of Oklahoma City the day this system moved in, I shit you not. I actually storm Chased in Oklahoma for a few years while I was down there, ended up driving all the way back to Idaho on the best day to chase storms in probably 10 years. It tends to depend on the size. The small ones are the ones that will hop around, they're less stable. The bigass EF4s and EF5s, like the one that removed Joplin a few years back, tend to be more like steam rollers. They're big, unstoppable, and they just plod along in a straight line tearing everything to hell. [This one is my favorite](http://i.imgur.com/IsS2jNC.jpg). The June, 2011 Springfield/Worcester tornado, highlighted the following winter. I was driving north and escaped it by minutes. The wind in Amherst blew out a window in my apt. If I didn't know any better, I'd guess that that was a cut path for power lines. It's crazy how that almost looks like surveyed and cut in in a straight line. I've never seen a tornado path on satellite before. It's much too big. A quick guess from the scale on Google Maps, but it looks to be around 3000 ft wide at the widest point. That's the better part of a mile, many times wider than the clear space needed for large power lines. Yo easy - this comment is too interesting.  I'll take an earthquake every 30 years over that tornado even once.  holy fuck Looks like a dog wiped his ass across the terrain.  Check out this [high res pic](http://www.meteorologynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/JoplinTornadoDamageSatellitePhoto.jpg) of the scar running through Joplin, MO after their EF5 in May 2011. I drove through five days after it tore through, and it looked like an atomic bomb had gone off...no exaggeration.

If you zoom in to a block, you might appreciate the extent of the destruction. Woah, no exaggeration. It's crazy how houses so close can be totally unaffected. It's super bizarre. I helped FEMA clean up on a street that had mostly been destroyed - some houses were completely gone, just concrete slabs. But right next door would be a house nearly untouched.  Duh one was a Christian household the other wasn't. According to my relatives, the houses on their streets that were destroyed were homosexuals, ethnic minorities, and the "wrong" type of Christian. Gotta love the Ozarks. CHECKMATE atheists.  

Oh wait- the Christian household was destroyed.  

The good lord works in mysterious ways. Go to Google Maps, Pull up Joplin MO, find Gabby St (the main E-W drag through town)  Flip to Street View, and compare the historic pictures.

The devastation is profound. Someone should do that.. And then post the pictures for us lazy/mobile users/unmotivated individuals to view.  I found this:

http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/before-after-pictures-of-joplin-missouri#.bfoQPx3oD
 But Buzzfeed though. 
Before and After Pictures of Joplin Missouri!

NUMBER 12 LEFT ME SPINNING The reasons why some houses my stand while the one next to it is completely destroyed is due to something called suction vortices. When a large tornado, like the one in joplin occurs, the tornado will have tornadoes that move within it and produce more intense extreme wind. The bomb comparison is really spot on. I went through the April 2011 tornadoes in Alabama and a whole neighborhood near me looked like it had been decimated by a bomb explosion.  The craziest thing I remember was driving down Main street (I think), right through the middle of the scar, and seeing nothing on either side but rubble and tree trunks, stripped bare of every branch and bough like a giant fist had gripped and ripped from the bottom up.

Somebody once told me they called tornadoes "God's finger."

edit: the gallery on [this news article](http://www.kansascity.com/news/special-reports/article300096/Housing-troubles-mount-especially-for-Joplin%E2%80%99s-poor.html) has many powerful images. That tornado hit the same day as the Minneapolis one in OP's pic. Interestingly, those tornadoes were within just a few days of each other, in [the same outbreak sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_21%E2%80%9326,_2011_tornado_outbreak_sequence). /r/desirepath What an oddly interesting topic, and I didn't know those even had a name. Watch them put up a fence halfway across My girlfriend and I lived in North Minneapolis during the time the tornado hit.

When did it happen? May 2011, the same day as the big Joplin tornado. May 22nd, 2011. It happened to be my birthday so I was off. Otherwise I would have been working at the north regional library on Lowry and Fremont [all aboard!](http://i.imgur.com/oWnva.gif) St. Paul checking in!  Don't forget about Fridley!

Right, it almost as if it were planetary. This is the part where Europeans ask why we don't build houses out of bricks, because they think tornados care about that. Yeah, I get so sick of that.  They think that this damage is caused by strong winds simply blowing over rickety wood houses.  They don't realize that this damage is caused by debris being picked up and violently thrown into structures.  Debris like cars, trucks, large trees, etc...

There are plenty of examples of metal/brick/cinder block structures, such as businesses and schools, being destroyed by tornadoes.

The types of tornadoes that we have in some parts of the U.S. are, with extraordinarily rare exceptions, only found in the U.S.   "We have tornadoes in [my morally and intellectually superior European country] too!!!"  No, not like these tornadoes you don't.

This is not winds from a bad storm, but just a small level higher.  This is a force of nature the likes of which is far beyond most people's ability to comprehend or relate to.  I am not religious, but the best description I've ever heard is something like "It is like God himself reached down from the heavens in a divine fury and smudged his finger along the landscape."  This is Old Testament style destruction we are talking about here. Google Maps search Moore Oklahoma and you can see the May 3rd tornado from 1999 still as well as the 2013 one! It's interesting to see where their paths overlap! Daaamn nature, you scary. 

Tornados were the most terrifying and obsession - driving thing in my childhood despite growing up in Vermont... Every thunderstorm was a teeth grinding ordeal. They still haunt my dreams to this day, despite never having seen one in person.  As a Minnesotan.... where is this? North Minneapolis. 

Edit: to orient you a bit that's 94 on the lower left. Crystal Lake cemetery is the green space on the far right... Directional   north would be basically the lower right.  Wow, visible on Google maps [satellite view](https://goo.gl/maps/OuWAZ) as well. Stretches all the way from 94 to Theodore Wirth Park Yep. It missed me by 4 blocks. [Found it](https://www.google.com/maps/search/cemetary/@45.0427366,-93.2549901,1349a,20y,228.28h,71.92t/data=!3m1!1e3!6m1!1e1?hl=en) North Minneapolis  That's North Minneapolis. 94 is the major road in the lower left with Dowling and Lowry being the two bigger crossroads. Go Twins!  GO VIK......GO WOLV.......GO WIL........GO TWINS!!!! tornadoes are suck dicks! This is incredibly interesting and not mild at all. /r/damnthatsinteresting /r/interestingasfuck [deleted] While not quite as frequent as say, Oklahoma, tornadoes are [fairly common in mid-southern Minnesota](http://i.imgur.com/Yys2cDt.jpg). For a second there, I was wondering why a /r/Minnesota post got so many upvotes. Dang. Natural disasters are sobering and that doesn't even look like the massive tornado that destroyed Moore. My aunt has a picture from a newspaper of an F5 tornado that hit Oklahoma City, that is very similar to this; it showed the path cut through the city, heading straight for Tinker AFB, where my Uncle was stationed at the time, before mysteriously making a 90 degree turn and heading out into open country. It came within a mile or so of the base before it turned, if I remember correctly. It's pretty surreal to have evidence of what could have happened. This thread is further proof that reddit is mostly made up of Minnesotans. 
 I thought I was the only one.  TIL everyone around me is on Reddit. How long ago did that tornado pass through there? May 2011 if OP is over where I think they are. Yes - it hit the same day as the Joplin, MO tornado. Tuscaloosa :(

 If you look really carefully, you can follow the tornado track all the way to north Birmingham My wife actually found out that day after that the tornado ended a couple blocks from her house. [Found it](https://www.google.com/maps/search/cemetary/@45.0427366,-93.2549901,1349a,20y,228.28h,71.92t/data=!3m1!1e3!6m1!1e1?hl=en) Switching to satellite view when looking at Joplin, MO in Google Maps used to clearly show that tornado's path of destruction through the city. Welcome to the mini apple. More tornados than the big apple, but we have Minnesota nice. I happen to find this /r/veryinteresting That is from Paul Bunyan dragging his axe Look at all the homes in that path. Truly terrifying. Sometimes I forget how fucking crazy nature can be around the world.

Here in Denmark the worst natural "disasters" we get is water in our basements. Even the hurricanes we get are like wet farts compared to some of the recent ones in the US.  Those aren't just trees, but homes.  Trees? ... And the homes, businesses, workplaces, schools, not just the trees. Minnesota is dope. If only simply, for not what we have but what we don't.  Mildly interesting.... i can see the house I grew up in in this photo. That doesn't happen on Reddit everyday.

Edit: This tornado was very unfortunate as it hit some of the lowest income homes in the city, many of which did not have decent insurance. Tornado Alley was under construction... so it took a detour. Mother Nature is incredible.  She's also a bitch when she gets mad.  Northside!  I can see my old house from up here!  I read tornado as tomato and was thoroughly confused.  That is absolutely insane!! It's one thing to watch the Weather Channel and have them talk about tornadoes...I can't imagine what it's like from a personal account.

At least with hurricanes, you have time to prepare. Tornadoes, not so much. I used to sub in schools near there. One day there was a thunderstorm during school and some of the poor kids were terrified remembering the tornado.  Looks like oldschool simcity. As long as your here, absolute must is have a jucy lucy at maxs! you are very observant, I wouldve never noticed something like that. /r/desirepath For anyone interested, the path is clearly visible from google maps.  If you search for Theodore Wirth golf course and zoom out a bit, you can see a more or less treeless line going to the northeast from the golf course to the Mississippi river, ending at the 37th Avenue bridge.  My house is in this picture. Neat.

Nobody will see this because this post is 23 days old, but still.  That's pretty cool. There should be a like /r/showerthoughts for pilots. I bet they see weird stuff all the time.

You mean a freezer. *Winter simulator Hey man, we don't discriminate. Speak for yourself. FUCK WINTER SIMULATORS! Go back to where you came from. ... The food storage section? hey now...

And in about 9 months she gives birth to a small toaster sized winter simulator This... actually sounds entirely plausible. Thank you, it came from the heart &gt;came

Hehe, yeah it did You mean it came from the CPU?

Edit: I suppose the CPU would be the brain, so the heart would be the power supply, or maybe the RAM. &gt;This... actually sounds entirely plausible.

All seasons are equally worthless I'd be really pissed if I signed up for a parachuting class and the fall simulator just dumped a bunch of dead leaves on me. Winter Simulator 2015 GOTY Edition. Pre-order now and get the Snowfall DLC for free. Shouldn't the GOTY edition have *all* the DLC already? This is bullshit Not just a freezer. It has optional high-powered fans inside to test windchill too. This is at Mark's in Canada, this one in particular is in Sherwood Park. You wouldn't think Canada would need something like this. Well it was 28C today. Not easy to test out right now. You wanna make sure that shit works well later in the year. I'm an American. I have no idea what you just said. 82F. Up here we call that a heat wave. It's the only time of the year that the meteorologists don't apologize for the forecast. &gt;82

&gt;heatwave &gt;82F. Up here we call that a heat wave.

Here in the AZ desert, we call that winter. It's June. Please save me.  I went camping in Death Valley last July. It hit 100 (38) at 7am, and the high for the day was 117 (47). That's 27 (16) degrees below the recommended cooking temperature for pork... Why in the fuck did you go camping in Death Valley in July? I was sweating just reading that. My friend and I (Canadians) were on a road trip last July and went through Death Valley.  The console thermometer got up to 49C. We drove past a trailer park/campground and thought "Who the hell would camp here?".  

Now I know. Whose recommendation is that? Seems awfully low for cooking something like pork. I live in Houston not a desert but still. In July it's hot and fucking humid. Your balls will stick to your thighs your shirt will fight you when you try taking it off cause it's incredibly sticky so uncomfortable living in humid areas 

Edit: Houston isn't that hot  Twenty-EIGHT degrees hotter is the recommended internal temperature to cook a smaller piece of pork to medium rare.  To cook it, the temperature of the stove should be higher.  It would take you so long to cook the meat in 145 that it would be nearly inedible by the time it was actually done.

EDIT:  It is a cool comparison though. You wanna come here and try that with 80% humidity? Dry heat you can spray a few drops of water and you're good.  Humidity you can barely breathe.  I know this because I was cooler and happier with 42C (107F) in India than I was with 32 after rain.  My family Brags about their mild winters. But I get my retribution in the summer. I'm from WI. Come! Well be happy to have you! Canadian here. Do other people not find that hot? Once it hits 20C I'm sweltering.  the desert people are mocking us

 Turnabout is fair play when they're shivering in +15 and we're breaking out the swimsuits. Canada's only desert is home to this: http://www.sparklinghill.com/cold-sauna Spent a summer near Toronto around 32C.  Between the humidity, the Lake Ontario Algal bloom, and AC systems that couldn't keep up, it was a lot less comfortable than 32C in the southern US. Toronto summers are their own special kind of hell. Its not that its particularly hot, its just so damn *uncomfortable*. You can't really escape the humidity and the closeness of the air.  I'm from Canada, and now I live in Australia. 20C *is* warm in Canada, but once you climatise, 20C becomes cold sweater wearing temperature. Over here it's winter and we drop below 20 and even below 10 degrees sometimes and you wouldn't believe the people complaining about how it feels like they're gonna die of cold.. To be fair a lot of homes in Australia don't have furnaces. People in Canada also complain when their homes drop below 18C. This of course rarely happens since a furnace is standard in every home in Canada. Edmontonian, and it's like 28*C right now, and even hotter in my house. I'm very comfortable but I've dealt with hotter. Not all Canadians can't handle heat. Nah. That's warm, but not hot. Here in a couple of days it's supposed to hit 92F (about 33C), and were not even in the dead of summer yet. We're talking about Kansas, by the way. Honestly though it gets hot as fuck in lots of places in Canada  90% of Canada's population lives within 100 miles of the US border. Where most Canadians live, it doesn't get much hotter or colder than whatever area of the US is on the other side of the border.  Up to a whopping 88! I know you're joking but in many places a heatwave would be more like 40C+ or 104ish+F It can hit upwards of 40C (~110F) where I live (in Canada). Here in southern California we break 115 in summer and it sucks ass  28C is 82F?  
TIL that to convert from C to F all one must do is switch the numbers around.  
Cool!  
Does it work the other way too? Well 82F is 28C, so it must work the other way too /r/shittyaskscience Meanwhile in Arizona...  Quick rule of thumb is double it and add 30. Imprecise, but at least you'll get the point. not using 0 as a freezing point is fucking insane  I'm also an American. I understand what you meant, we are not all dumb.  Whoever managed to make being proud of one's ignorance a cool thing among Americans is an amazing politician. That's 301 K. You're welcome. My brain just refuses to associate 28 with being warm. I'd imagine skydivers/mountain climbers/etc would love something like this. I spent so much time and pain trying to find gloves that could keep the feeling in my hands for at least 45min at &lt;-45 with windchill. *A freezer with a fan in it. Sounds expensive.  Was going to ask if this was the Red Deer north one since the inside looked oh so similar product and flooring wise. Wuddup YEG. Sherwood park! Hello fellow Albertan! Hey, while you're in there could you grab the vodka?  Cool! That reminds me, I forgot to take my chicken out of my kitchen winter simulator to thaw. Dammit. and don't forget to turn off the summer simulator when you are done cooking! Florida summer. We don't cook chicken in an easy bake. Florida Summer? Fancy ass steam oven. Fancy ass-steam oven?

 We have a winter simulator in England as well. It's called 'summer'. Come, visit Canada.  Let's talk about this winter thing. But.. he was talking about summer. I'm pretty sure we have way nicer summers in most of Canada than they do in England. I'm on Vancouver Island right now.. we hit 40C today. What about this winter thing? No... No you guys didn't. We did? It was a pleasant 32 north on the island  Pretty sure you guys got an even better rain simulator. Am I right? To ruin your joke: it's supposed to be 22 degrees this week I would walk inside with a tight T, just to walk out with pointy nipples. You're a guy, aren't you? Yum. solid standards right there solid nipples too Totally relevant life hack:

If you ever need pointy nipples in a hurry, just flick them with your finger kinda hard. Guaranteed pointy nipples in 20 seconds or less. You can do both or one at a time.

... God bless printed shirts We have to share pics Shout out to marks work ware house Acclimating to winter is a process.  I live in Minnesota.  It snows like 6 months a year.

In the fall when it gets cold you have big jackets and layers below.  You wear mittens because they are warmer than gloves.  You just aren't used to it.  It's just goddam cold when November really comes through.  Just two weeks ago it was 60 and you were in shorts.  Now it's 25 and what the hell happened?

December sets in and you have been out shoveling a few times.  Still wearing that heavy winter coat and mittens.  Every time you bring it in you have to turn the sleeves inside out so the sweat will dry by the next day and you can wear that coat again.

January.  Fuck that coat.  I'm snowblowing and shoveling in a long sleeved shirt and an insulated hunting vest.  It's -10, and I have a hat on with some gloves, and it's just about right.

February.  I don't give a shit.  I just wear a hat and a long sleeved shirt.  For everything.  It's still -10 or so, but I have to fill the bird feeders and shovel the sidewalks.  It's not even a thought or an issue.  A hat and a long sleeved shirt is all I need when it's -10.  Just jersey gloves now, enough to cut the wind. 

March.  Fuck you.

April.  You wear shorts and only shovel if the snowstorm is over 10".  I was just visiting Minn and was told there are only 2 seasons there; winter and construction.  That's true for everything up north. The wide variations between winter and summer are hell on the roads so as soon as the snow melts they need to start fixing all the potholes. And then there's always a couple streets that finally get to be resurfaced once every score of years. Is it true that people from  Minnesota use the phrase " don'tcha know " regularly.  I like your state.   You guys have what it takes.   The right gumption.    It is time for Minnesota to join Canada. That sounds awful.  Move south man We have these in American convenience stores, with beer in them. We are JUST NOW getting beer in grocery stores in Ontario. Our liquor laws make me want to break things. I am in Pennsylvania and I can only buy beer at a dedicated distributor or a bar/restaurant.  Until recently the distributors only sold cases, they were not allowed to sell in smaller amounts. Now they can sell 12 packs, that is the smallest denomination you can get at a distributor. If you want a 6 pack, you need to go to a bar.  I just drove through Wisconsin on my way back from school in PA. They actually sell hard alcohol in gas stations there.  As a life-long resident of Wisconsin, I thought everyone's gas stations had alcohol until I started coming across comments like this on Reddit. And it would be really weird to go to a grocery store that didn't sell alcohol. Usually there's an entire isle dedicated to it. Brit here. Confused as hell. Shops can't sell alcohol? Laws vary from state to state, and some of them only give liquor licenses to liquor stores and others only allow grocery or convenience stores to sell stuff below a set ABV. I've spent my whole life in one of the states that has almost no restrictions on where alcohol can be sold, so I'm almost as confused as you are. What are the prices like? Out of curiosity, where is this?
 We have them in stores called "marks work warehouse" it's a store u buy construction clothing at like Dakota and Carhart and stuff, recently bought by Canadian tire.  At what point do things stop being recent? Because they were bought by Canadian Tire over 13 years ago...and stopped being called Mark's Work Warehouse 3 years ago. They stop being recent when someone points it out to you and you're like [](/sp)[](/grannyworried)"Wait, that was 13 years ago? Fuck, I'm getting old..." That makes sense. 
Looked like construction/safety gear in the background.

Also wouldn't expect to see anything like this in the U.S. As someone would find a way to get stuck inside and then sue. Are you kidding? It's summer here. I'd probably show up with my kindle and lock *myself* inside. Unless there's somehow gross negligence on the part of the store (e.g. someone blocked the door and trapped someone inside) a Canadian judge just would probably throw a lawsuit like that out.

Yes you can sue in Canada, but it's a hell of a lot harder. We accept the fact that some people are dumbasses and they are at fault... and then pay for their healthcare.  It's just Mark's now! They're trying to sell more than work wear lol. unfortunately they've gone for really generic dad clothing and diluted the brand. Death Valley, CA. The center of winter wear. Do you think they'd notice if I installed my server in there? Unless it simulates a wind chill, it's pretty much useless. They do. Very high powered fans inside. This bit of information really negates everyone's comparisons to a regular freezer. I think it's fair to call it a winter simulator.  yeah and he op didn't even mention the snow that falls or the yeti. true winter simulation. And there'd better be a bunch of black slush in there to get all over my pants and a shit ton of rock salt to fuck up my hoes with. Yay winter.

Edit: Hahaha, shit. Shoes. I meant shoes, not hoes. *Shoes.* I hate it when my hoes get salty Damn rock salt fucking up my hoes Yeah we try not to mention the yeti. Hurts sales.  well how else will you test the yeti-proof rating of your gear.  I had a feeling they wouldn't just have this if it was just a freezer.  its at marks work warehouse, many of their customer base are dudes headed up north to work in the oil patch when the ground is frozen enough for machines to work in the muskeg.

This machine is going to be quite legit in a store like that. Always thought it was more of a marketing thing, since they make a lot of claims about their jackets.  It is. I work in a -15 degrees freezer and anything feels good for 20 minutes or so. Most people testing this thing probably won't spend 2 hours in it and when they to extreme cold with their gear that lasted 5 minutes in the simulator they'll be freezing their asses off.  They do! There's one near me It does! It's inside a Canadian Tire store. Well inside a Mark's Work Warehouse store that is inside a Canadian Tire. Mark's is a work/practical clothing store and Crappy Tire is a hardware/outdoors/home stuff store.  REI has rooms that simulate rain in Seattle. They also have a bike trail around the store. Mile high club? Prepare for the sub zero club.  Wait a minute...So let m get this straight. 100's of people are dying in India because of heatwaves and we have freezers that simulate winter?!?!? WTF, do you know how many Indians we can shove in that freezer!!  /u/jeebus_t_christ could tell you more about that  You'd have better luck posting that in /r/Navy

Money is the object, man. If there was money to be made by saving Indians, they'd all be saved. They have no sense of humor there, brother.  I believe the T-max below zero winter simulator drops below -30 *after putting on every coat in the store*

"I'm still cold."

-My girlfriend  Is that Marks Work Wearhouse? Yes What a horrible waste of energy.  I would just chill in there all day. Eat some nice chilli. And would feel all round pretty cool. Winter is Coming...to a store near you How much does this cost to install? How much energy does it use? would it really boost sales enough to cover that? 

somanyquestions They get pissed off if you try to store your meat in there.

Or beat your meat in there. [deleted] If you like this you should come to Hamburg and pay "Globetrotter" a visit, they have a winter cloth testing chamber even bigger, with a chair made of ice and a build in wint simulator (a big ass fan)! It f*cking awesome, I loved to play "who can stay in there longer" as a kid ;)

EDIT: found a picture of the chamber: [PIC](http://image.8264.com/album/201107/18/165126njtbmboy5tc5x7bc.jpg) What a waste of energy that is  "Alright Boss, I set up the meat locker just like you told me. It's right there in the middle of the GAP right now."



"You mean to tell me that you put the my new meat locker in the middle of a fucking  clothing store? A meat locker? For fuck's sake, man! That was supposed to go to the fucking food court, you idiot. Now I've gotta go explain to the manager why some dumbass put a fucking industrial freezer in his fucking store."



"But boss_"



"Shut up, Fred. Go clock out and tell Jimmy to get the forklift over there. I mean honestly. What the fuck is a clothing store going to do with a freezer? Get out of here!"



"That's just it though. They_"



"Fred."



"Just hear me out. They were happy to have it."



"...you're telling me a clothing store was happy to have a freezer dumped in the middle of their store? That right?"



"Yea."



"Okay, you're gonna come with me and show me why a clothing store needs a freezer and then I'm going to show you why you're a complete idiot. Got it?"



"Alright, Boss."



"Come on."



"See just like I told you. They had a perfect use for it. Trying on winter clothes and shit."


"It's July, Fred. They aren't even selling winter apparel. Go get the forklift. I'll sort this out."



The end.




i tried but it's not great. 4/10. Enjoy.
 The blue neon lights make it super cold. What a fucking waste of energy Yeah I install those refrigeration systems. They consume a lot of power. A pretty neat idea. The only problem is that you really start feeling how well your warm coat is doing after half an hour in the cold. I wonder how many people spend enough time in that chamber to properly test the clothing. &gt;The only problem is that you really start feeling how well your warm coat is doing after half an hour in the cold.

Are you in Florida or something? Step outside when it's -10f with windchill bringing it down to -30 and you'll know real quick how well your winter gear is working. ottawa canada here. 30 minutes is accurate Where do you live?

When it's -40 it's not bad.(For 30 minutes)

-20 with wind? Go fuck a goat.

This simulates wind(Fans) so if it goes to -20 with a really decent wind... I can gauge how well my clothes would work at -50 or -55 pretty well within 5 minutes in there. ...do you live in Yellowknife?  Fort McMurray. We get -40 for like a monthish straight, the odd time it will dip to -50 and the very very once a winter day it hits -55 and once -63. With the wind chill of course.

It's really weird to because it's 28-35 right now, and odd day it goes above 35 in the summer.

It's either to fucking cold, or to fucking hot here. With little transitions in the seasons. Ah the ol' Fort Mac weather! I heard you guys get crazy windchill and had a massive forest fire a couple years back. I live in the Northwest Territories so I can relate to your pain. Minus all the windchill crud, we have lots of tall trees to protect us.  We have some places in Florida that have a hurricane simulator. It simulates wasting $5. It'd be great if you could test sleeping bags in it as well. TIL I have a winter simulator in my kitchen i bet its packed on hot days How does a company make a product for such a niche market and stay afloat? I can't imagine the demand for winter-simulators is very high. It is literally just a freezer. I can imagine the demand for freezers. Winter came. In a box. Yeah i live in a "winter simulator" called alaska, very well designed, comes with the bear and moose function. As someone living in central California, I'd like one of these in my house, please. Reminds me of this:

https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5166/5352623403_6e2e44019d_b.jpg Who wants to fondle my Johnson? Any takers? In Greek too!  Pretty close in spanish as well ...and French! Remember the French soldier in that Mel Gibson movie who hates the country he's patrolling and he says "Putain pais " or some shit like that right before the bullet shreds the buglers throat.  In my French oral exam, I mentioned a heated swimming pool - "une piscine chauff". Piscine is pronounced "pee-seen"; and I accidentally pronounced itn"pee-sceen". I soon found out that I told the examiner that, to relax after a long day, I enjoy the luxury of a heated whore. 


Edit: I AM JUST GOING OFF WHAT MY TEACHER TOLD ME. HE MAY HAVE BEEN WRONG. I AM SORRY FOR ALL THR UPSET I HAVE CAUSED. I'm very fluent in French and that doesn't mean whore, it still means pool. Same here. I've spoken french almost everyday since I was 6 and I have no idea how any of that could be interpreted as whore. What dialect do you speak? Might be some regional slang or something. Sounds like a class teaching French to people who don't natively speak French.


In the U.S. lots of foreign language teachers are Americans. My French teacher was an American with an Italian last name who also taught Italian. And that was in Louisiana with lots of Cajuns who still speak French, which granted is an American  Cajun version, but it was still enough for my dad to get to play interpreter in the Navy when his ship was docked in France.


So its possible the OP's teacher didn't know any better, or possibly was an idiot who wanted to stress correct punctuation.  Yeah, I don't know French at all and my Spanish is awful and I was thinking the same thing. How does what you said = whore?
 I have been deaf, mute, and blind since birth and I was also thinking the same thing and also where am I please my drool tray is full agairthfgfkgjbblb. I'm impressed at your progression in learning Romance languages despite all that. I'm French and it still mean pool to me..  Far from sounding like 'pute" or "putain" to me..  I mean, you're not wrong. I'm not saying that did not $100% happen, but there's no way any variation of "piscine" can be understood to mean "prostitute."

 100 dollar percent Whats the difference between those two pronunciations? Is it a hard c? Im pretty sure that doesnt mean anything in French. I'm French, and I don't see any French slang in "pee-sceen".
Maybe you'd like to write "pee-scene" ?
Now I get it, but still not in French language :-) Do you mean you said putain by mistake?

Piscine is pool. Always pool. And French, sort of! Putain? Haha Poutine Mmmm whore fries. Merde! Ta mre est une poutain. Je pense qu'/elle va baise-moi cette nuit. Huehuehue 'je pense qu'elle va me baiser la nuit', c'est ce que vous voulez dire. aussi, le mot est putain, pas poutain. Ta mere la pute va me baiser ce soir. Go back to your seats

Mmmm! *My* ding-ding-dong The only real German words are "nein" and "haut" (skin). I'm a little disappointed since they've even managed to build a readable French sentence. And they probably were using "haut" to mean "hot", so it barely counts. That makes more sense. *Disappointment growing* you should probably go take care of that semi Der Rekt Rekt is feminine brah, die rekt  Fucking lssig How knorke.

    ---\|  You wouldn't use "nein" either. 'Droppen', 'knakkers' and 'ze' are accepted Dutch words. Just for your information I always knew it, Dutch is just mock German [o nee](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/2e/2e5e1f2c0d3a6c6ae7f17887ed65b43081ac74566658027d0f9c64e749b26d18.jpg) But it's a readable English sentence in a German accent with German-*looking* words. It's a different joke to the French one altogether. As a german, they dont look german, more dutch or danish  I second dutch  I don't, because I'm Dutch and that looks more German to me. Funny how that works, eh? :P Swede here. It does look like dutch. It's the "ze" and "oont" that makes it look like dutch to me. As a German speaker who has recently been trying to learn Dutch, the first line looks more German and the second line more Dutch. As a person who speaks both languages, yes. Dude, double o double p double k. This looks Dutch alright. 

Recently started learning Dutch and the double e and fucking ji etc. In your writing drive me insane. Duolingo thinks I'm retarded.  I think the point is it looks that way to the target audience (English speaking Canadians). Most probably see that and think German as opposed to anything else. As a Dane, I second Dutch.  What would mock english look like? Don't know what it would look like. [However, this Italian parody is a pretty good example of what English sounds like to foreigners.](https://youtu.be/BZXcRqFmFa8?t=13) 

TL;DW: fast whooping and gibberish slurs.  You know, I actually wonder if that's what it's like to have a stroke where you stop understanding language. It sounds like I *should* be able to parse it as English, but it makes no sense. To me, it almost sounds like he is speaking English words, just in a gibberish order. That entire video is gold. Thanks for sharing.  TIL we sound wicked cool! here's another funny example:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4Dfa4fOEY Maybe a lil like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gU4w12oDjn8) Is kaffe not German for coffee? It's been a few years since I took German 1, but I thought it was. Yea, you're right. It's Kaffee. But they spelled it wrong so that doesn't count ;) Close enough. Way better then OONT. One letter spelled wrong, thats still readable. OONT is no where close any german word. It's Col. Klink saying "und."  It's a traditional hack German joke sound in the US. I think someone was familiar with *und* but forgot what it meant.  Well that or they were writing these as jokes. Could go either way. How is that readable French? Maybe 'readable' is the wrong word but a sentence can still be grammatically correct even if the lexemes are made-up. [Most famous 'English' example](http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/jabber/jabberwocky.html) That's actually just Welsh. aFsejfgEfyge'jyhbdcjhbd! f''f'f'skufksh'dhsbfhjsdbnnnnn!

r/wkjsdnnnnhfhtnland That looks more Icelandic to me. No, Icelandic is more like "fgvujur songruhjuklorl hurgnarrgra" This, Welsh is more Llallallagghellallellkllallell

 You forgot the sea of Ws

Llanwwuoarollwllwloucuymnwwwaoweeewllwllwllljj Oh god, Finnegan's Wake is leaking! Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch just like everything else, the english have also stolen all the vowels from wales I was hoping that was a real sub.  l'area de oulala seems like a reasonable translation for 'the crotch area' It's d'oulala, obviously.  Just like the German they messed up the spelling. Not quite but as a French person I immediately thought about the crotch.  As a repressed American, I am going to assume this is because all French people are always thinking about crotches. Mmmmm, snicker-snack... Almost sounds like Atlantic Canadian French. Atlantic French Canadian reporting in, it does sound a bit [Acadien](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadia).

"Pour pas a su' ton lap, tu vas te burn."

(As a French speaker, I love "L'area de oolala") I'd switch "ton lap" for "tes cuisses", or "tchuisse" depending on how south east New Brunswick you're hanging, but yeah "area de oolala" is pretty great. Quebecois here, I've never heard Acadien, is it really a French-English hybrid? haha that's what i said. It's pretty much Chiac It's what we call Frenglish here in parts of Canada lol It's High School French.  I understood it 100%. looks more like dutch and not rally german The "German" reminds me of [Blinkenlights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkenlights).  Dat is niet German, dat is gebastardized Dutch. Oder ein mixung van de two. Edit: Hilarious, though. Eh... Dutch, Deutsch... close enough :) Its all europe right?! Lets call all of their languages europeneese. We had war over languages... To be fair, we've also had wars over [a bucket,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Bucket) [an ear,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Jenkins%27_Ear) and [a stray dog.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_at_Petrich)

Historically we've been pretty good at waging war at the drop of a hat. Pretty sure that's been done too. What hat? You said a bucket, an ear and a dog. I see no hat op. [Not a drop as such, but the Hats were definitely involved in this one.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Swedish_War_%281741%E2%80%9343%29) A certain Diego Marani, translator for the European Council, created Europanto, an authentic mixture more or less proportional to all the languages of the community, which has become very successful, even to being published in a Belgian magazine

 Holy shit, I speak Dutch, German and English and that was awesome. Isn't that true for nearly anyone who speaks Dutch? There's a continuum between Scotland, Holland, and Germany which makes all their speech mutually intelligible after the 8th pint. L'area de ohlala Duolingo has taught me it probably should have been l'area d'oohlala Yup! You are right! The sentence doesn't make any sense and it cant even be bothered to be grammatically correct. The mock German one looks more mock Dutch to me. Wait, isn't Dutch just mock German? It's just squelchy German. It's swamp German. I am from the Netherlands and i can tell you it looks nothing like dutch, every word looks german to me I'm from Germany. Definitely doesn't look German. Looks Dutch to me as well.  This exchange reminds me of Poe's *Murders in the Rue Morgue*. A Frenchman says that a voice spoke Spanish, another Frenchman says that it spoke Italian, a Dutchman says that it was speaking French, an Englishman says that it spoke German, a Spaniard says that it spoke English, an Italian says that it spoke Russian: none knew the language that they said the speaker was talking in.

From this and other clues, Poe's protagonist deduced the voice belonged to an orangutan. &gt; belonged to an orangutan

Those responsible for sacking the people who have just been sacked have been sacked. Reminds me of a sushi restaurant we went to where they would shout out random fake Japanese instead of a greeting.
"HAYAMASA HAYAHAYAHAYA!"
...wat
 Are we going to ignore the fact that it's warning us not to pour it on our crotch? Because that was my intent when I bought this cup of coffee... What does mock English sound like? https://youtu.be/BZXcRqFmFa8?t=14s You know, it's interesting how the "hot coffee" lawsuit has shaped our society.

Many people view it as a frivolous lawsuit and make fun of the fact that the U.S. now has to have notices on coffee cups warning you that the coffee is hot ("Duh... I know coffee is hot"). I'm assuming that this particular coffee cup is poking fun at that with the silly "Avoid pouring on crotch area" notice.

But in actuality, that lawsuit wasn't frivolous at all. McDonalds was serving coffee at 190 degrees. Way above drinkable temperature, and when the woman in the lawsuit spilled it on her lap, she had third degree burns.

You can read more about it [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants) and if you're feeling brave you can go google for the NSFL pictures of her burned pelvis. I always see this as a story of how the McDonalds PR team is fucking ingenious. They managed to take "McDonalds sued for refusing to cover medical bills for 79-year-old woman who suffered 3rd degree burns from their coffee" and turn it into "Woman awarded $2.9 million for spilling coffee on herself" McDonald's didn't do that.  The insurance industry did.  That lawsuit has been the biggest gift to the insurance industry ever - it was probably single-handedly responsible for more tort reform (i.e., destruction of individual property rights and personal responsibility) than any other case.  And as you already know, the story as usually told in 2 sentences is a lie. in this case the main issue is not the absence or presence of a warning label. the warning label is useless because obviously everyone knows not to pour coffee on their genitals. the issue is that the coffee was scalding hot. I live in the town this is from. It is quite literally the only coffee shop or restaurant for that matter to be original and stay in business in this entire little town. It's a great place. Is this in the Granville coffe in Quesnel, BC? You mean the Quesnel I live and work in? Quesnel shows up on mildly interesting. Sounds about right. I live in quesnel too!  I thought it was Granville Island, but I don't go there often so I don't know if any coffee shops.  *L'AREA DE OOLALA*

Goddamnit that kinda made me hard ITT: People who don't realise it's a joke. For a brief second I thought the mock German was real Dutch. Wait so dutch is just a mock of german?  No it's swamp German duh. I would have accepted that fake German as real Dutch if I hadn't read the title. [Reminds *me* of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqwzvtjeYBQ&amp;ab_channel=static85) Wouldn't it be "sur l'area de oolala"? Then again its mock French so it doesn't really matter "mock German"
We just call it Dutch. Kind of a dick move by this coffee place. The lady who sued McDonalds suffered severe burns and was hospitalized for several days. Her coffee was served at nearly 200 degrees... &gt; nearly 200 degrees

For those who are lazy, he means nearly 93 degrees in Celsius. Coffee, made from boiling water (100 degrees C) being served at 93 degrees C sounds normal to me... Yeah, this honestly pisses me off. If your coffee is hot enough to fuse a woman's labia, you deserve to get sued. And besides, it's McDonald's. They're one of the largest multinational corporations in the world. They're not strapped. Not only that, she originally just wanted them to cover her medical bills and they told her to fuck off.  Not just Severe burns, Fucking [3rd degree burns](https://imgur.com/a/WlKPo)(NSFW/NSFL) NSFL? Yikes!


[Eye bleach!](http://i.imgur.com/80RIIsJ.jpg) 



I am a robit.
 That's much worse than those who joke about it make it sound The coffee was served at 200 degrees Fahrenheit. The average brewing temperature of coffee is 165ish degrees and it's drinkable at 120-140 degrees. Pretty crazy stuff.  From Quesnel!

RIP But wait there's more! Not anymore. Is there anyone, *anyone* who can finish this battle? *Hey, it's Vince from ShamWOW* Ya followin me camera guy cause its about to get furious Yes this is dog This joke went over a lot of peoples heads To be a parrot bag man? It's been a dream of mine for quite a long time... But it's crazy right? A robot being a parrot-bag-man... Vet school is more competitive than medical school. Good luck.  &gt;Theres a pervasive myth that getting into veterinary medical school is much more difficult than getting into human medical school, but thats not supported by the data. Nearly 50 percent of those who apply to veterinary medical school end up attending, a percentage that is comparable to human medical school. Individual acceptance rates vary greatly between schools.

http://aavmc.org/Media-FAQs.aspx So... Veterinary school is *possibly* more competitive than medical school. I would bet internships and work experience opportunities are.  The difference is that there are 100+ medical schools and around 8 vet schools. I was looking into it but I couldn't deal with sick animals and dying all the time :(
I actually got my EMT license because it's less traumatic seeing humans in that situation than animals... Kinda weird... I don't know if it's that weird.   
Humans, in dire circumstances, can be spoken to and comforted. They can understand that other people are there to help them, not harm them, and feel a sense of support.  
Animals, in scary/painful situations, are nearly always frightened. They can't be told what is going on, most of the time won't understand that the people hurting them are actually trying to heal them, and can't tell anyone where or how much they hurt.

It's just another layer of chaos on top of an already heartbreaking/stressful situation. I want to point out one flaw there, if someone is drowning and panicking, they can shove you under water and drown you regardless of talking to them. If your dog is drowning grab it by the scruff and pull it out of the water. 
 He just said she was in vet school. It's not her job. Vet med / med school is kind of a job, you just don't get paid. how did she get that scar on her arm? She fell off of her bike and broke her arm. She had surgery to repair her arm, but the hardware caused her to have a severely restricted range of motion. Had a second surgery to correct the hardware issue.  /r/mildlyinteresting Oh wait As someone who's currently recovering from elbow surgery (pins and wires in there now), this does not comfort me at all. My range of motion is terrible right now. As a person who has recovered from elbow surgery (with pins and wires.), the first week or so you have very little movement, after the second or third you gain a bit more and so on. Its been a couple of years since my surgery but I've almost got complete mobility of my elbow, I just cant lock it properly. Looks like she just met her grandchilds best friend. &gt; Friend in vet school is in Belize

Edit to fix my link
 I know it's real, but it looks fake. Nature is amazing.  Keeping with macaws alone, there are some even more stunning hybrid colors out there.  (To say nothing of birds of paradise)

Normal types of macaws:  

- Scarlet (pictured in this post)

If you want to know what it's like to live with one of these goobers, feel free to ask.  I have a Catalina macaw named Sparky, and he is adorable.   How old and how loud is Sparky? How friendly is he? What's his lifespan? How does he react to strangers? Does he fly around the house? How's cleanup?

:) Edit: Disclaimer!  The answers below are me babbling about how much I love to love my bird.  This is like a "best of" of parrot ownership.  It takes a lot of work, preparation, effort, and research to own a bird (much like choosing to have a child).  But if you put in that hard work, it's so very rewarding.  

-  Age:  8 years.  [Here are pictures of his 8th birthday!](http://imgur.com/a/epDBj)  

-  How loud:  Average noise level throughout the day is remarkably quiet.  Definitely quieter than any kids in my neighborhood, I'll tell you that.  He can sometimes scream at an uncomfortable volume (think toddler tantrum level), and it usually means the same things as a kid screaming.  The cause is usually that he's scared of something, he's hungry, or it's getting close to bedtime and he's tired and cranky.  At most, we'll hear him scream a couple times a week.  He normally talks at a normal indoor volume when he wants something, and we always pay attention to him when he does (to encourage normal volume vocalizations).  Sometimes he just gets caught in a neverending loop of "hello"s, but you can just let him do his thing and it never gets intrusive.  

- Lifespan: Normally around 60 years.  World record is somewhere around 90 years.  

- Strangers:  We've only had him since October, and Dad his still his favorite person in the world.  I only recently gained his trust.  We had to slowly teach him that I did not, in fact, want to kill him, and that strangers weren't going to hurt him either.  He's pretty "hands-off" with everybody though; he's not particularly cuddly and doesn't like much physical affection.  He'll let us mess with him and play with him, but nothing that lasts more than a few minutes.  Nowadays, he will step up onto just about anybody, and will accept treats and do tricks for anyone.  Trick-training helped his overall demeanor immensely.  

-  Flying:  We're only just getting to harness training him.  Up until this point, we've kept one wing clipped.  Now, we're letting it grow out so that we can work on flight training.  The goal is to eventually let him fly in an open area on a 40-foot elastic tether.  For now, he wears his harness outdoors just in case he tries to fly away.  But I've still never seen him fly.  He's content to just pad around on the floor, and I'm not really sure he's ever tried flying.  Once he's flighted, I'm not terribly worried about him trying it indoors.  Our apartment is too small for that.  

-  Cleanup:  He's potty-trained.  He really likes to poop when on a perch or perch-like thing so that it doesn't get in his feathers.  He has a large manzanita play perch in the living room which he can climb onto or off of via ladders.  The perch has a large catch tray below it with layers of newspaper covering it, so cleanup is as easy as swapping them out twice a week.  He will also go to the bathroom on command, which is convenient for trips outdoors and car rides.  His food is what's messy!  Half of what he eats ends up on the bottom of his cage or on his catch tray.  But it's just a matter of sweeping up crumbs, or the weekly wipe-down.   My friend has an African Grey Parrot and my friend's father is the bird's favorite person as well. The funny thing is that the bird has an Indian accent :) Always have some good laughs! A lot of birds tend to be one-person birds (African Greys notoriously so), and even if they're not it takes a lot of effort to socialize them well.  

I'm having fun imagining an African Grey with an accent! Hello there fellow parrot owner, I don't want to be a guy that rains on your parade, but you're doing parro-kind a disservice when you make them seem so appealing as pets.


I know it comes from a place of love for your bird, but the realities of owning one of these animals, for MOST people anyways, are too much.


These critters live forever.  As in, if you're in your 20s, and buy a hatched macaw, there's a very real possibility that animal can outlive you.  While some are well adjusted and loving and sweet (macaws especially are usually a little less needy), they can simply be born "hell on wheels," and be extremely difficult to deal with.


Taking good care of them involves good quality pellets and tons of fresh food.  In my house, where we normally hover right around 10 birds, we have an entire freezer full of chop, birdy bread, and various fresh foods.  I cook for them more than I cook for my SO and I.


All that being said, parrots are extremely interesting and amazing animals.  They have a capacity for intellectualism that I have never seen in any other type of animal.  The ones that have been abused, have a very good chance of being friendly again in the right hands.  They can make wonderful companions FOR THE RIGHT PERSON.


So yes, sorry for rambling, I just get a little riled seeing somebody telling others that they're great pets without going into why they can be awful pets.


Source:  I rescue, foster, and adopt birds, many of which have been abused and majorly fucked up by their well meaning owners that had no idea what they were signing up for.


Edit: if anyone is truly interested in getting a parrot, check out local rescues in your area.  They generally do good work, and will actually check people out before adopting out a large bird. Yes, this does need to be said.  I didn't really want to bog down my post with warnings, but having a large bird is akin to having a child.  They require a lot of work, but as long as out put in the time, effort, and research to keep your bird happy, they're one of the most rewarding pets you can have.  

Most of the time on reddit, I only see the warnings and disclaimers for all the negatives of owning a bird.  How much work they are to feed, house, train, and entertain.  How destructive or loud they can *potentially* be.  Terrible stories from bird owners who didn't know how to care for them, and became bitter towards all parrots as a result.  

You get out of the relationship what you put into it.  We're fortunate to have rescued a mostly laid-back, independent macaw who only came with a few easily-remedied behavior issues.  We did our research to ensure that his diet, environment, and toys were the best he could have.  

And he is the best pet I could ever ask for.  I do love talking about all the positive aspects of bird ownership, but it takes work to get there.  I can see your perspective, though; I wouldn't want to create any impulse buyers from my post.  

It's just that not every post regarding parrots has to be "buyer beware".  I like having the opportunity to love on my bird, too.   I 100% agree, and I think your post is a fine example of a positive relationship between human and bird.  I promise, I was not trying to call you out in anyway, just wanted to offer a little something to any prospective owners.

Honestly, I'm probably a little too jaded and cynical to comment objectively.  I have seen some truly awful animal abuse in my time with dogs and cats, but the parrot neglect very often takes the cake.

Sorry if I overstepped. That's quite alright.  As a rescuer, you'd have every right to be a little jaded.  People can be dumb and cruel.  Abuse of exotic animals seems to be far too commonplace in an age of freely available care information.  

I'll edit my post with a disclaimer.   May i ask, what is he eating in his birthday  picture?  An altered carrot cake recipe with peanut butter frosting and coconut shavings. He loved it! Despite the fact that you posted those pictures for color comparison purposes, I clicked every one of them just to see the cuteness.

Birds are the best pets... [They really are adorable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGyVt_qigcY) I grew up with a red headed macaw named tiki and another parrot (can't remember what) named ronde.  &gt; (World's larges parrot; you might recognize him as Paranoid Parrot)

World's largest *flighted* parrot Can you own a hyacinth? Its seriously cool! Also how hard/easy are they to train overall? Yes, but they are endangered so they will sometimes be sold only in breeding pairs. They're also around $10,000. 

Overall level of difficulty for ownership: very high. It's a lot of work and a lot of effort. But, if you put that effort in, they reward you for it. 

Training is about the same as a high-strung dog. You use the same clicker/treat method.  &gt;[Greenwing](http://www.comingsbirds.com/discoverycove/slideshow/files/Green_Wing%20Macaw%202007.jpg)

AKA The "Glasurit" do you know what the evolutionary advantage is to be colored like this?  You forgot the Spix's macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii), yours to be had at your local swiss parrot collocter or qatari sheikh for a small sum of 500000 Euros each when you buy at least 3. Btw they are nothing special just rare as fuck. I was really hoping the Harlequin would be a specific pattern of black, red, and white I am curious why feathers would grow in the exact same order as the rainbow or spectrum of colors. Simple coincidence? Perhaps such an arrangement of colors is more attractive to this species for some reason. This is pure speculation, but I've read that some feathers get their color from their texture rather than their actual color. Like, if you blended red feathers, you'd get a brown goo instead of a red goo.

So if those feathers' texture was gradually changing causing them to reflect smaller and smaller wavelengths, then they would naturally appear like a rainbow. That makes a lot of sense, actually.  Does anyone know what causes color on a molecular or atomic level anyway? I know certain wavelengths of light are reflected or absorbed BUT do we know what physical quality causes those wavelengths to absorb/ bounce. IIRC it has to do with electron orbitals. Some photons are high energy enough (the violet side of the spectrum is higher energy than the red side) to cause electrons to make a quantum leap, in which case they're absorbed. Otherwise they're reflected. And different atoms have different electron configurations. HOLY FUCK thank you. Ive been asking this question for years to proffessors and online and every answer is always about light. Thanks Photons *are* light, so this answer was still like those. Not OP, but I learned that from Cosmos with Neil Degrasse Tyson, you should check it out https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_coloration

Not sure if this is relevant to this particular bird but birds like the peacock and some butterflies have atomic structures that take advantage of a physical phenomenon called thin film interference. 

As sun light hits these structures and they reflect in such a way that certain colors experience destructive interference. Pretty much 1 wave cancels out another wave coming in because of the phase of the reflected wave. So you see really vibrant colors on a peacock because the other colors have been canceled out. Same goes for why soapy bubbles have the crazy colors to them, some parts are thicker than others and cancel out different colors depending on how thick the "thin film" is. Holy shit this is one of the most interesting and informative threads I've read in a while. Energy levels of electrons in a molecule are quantized and therefore only absorb certain wavelengths or energies of photon to jump between levels, among other causes of color like scattering and refraction and stuff. The answers here are missing the biological component.  The wavelength of emitted or reflected light depends on the physical properties of the substances emitting or reflecting it, but _color_ is how we _perceive_ light of certain wavelengths.  Color isn't an intrinsic property of a wavelength of light--it's how our brains and eyes _interpret_ light of a particular wavelength.

There's a relatively narrow band of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that we can see--"visible light."  We have cells in our eyes called cones specialized for detecting visible light.  Specifically, we have three different types of these cells, one type that senses the band of wavelengths we perceive as "red," one type for green wavelengths, and one type for blue.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell

Color that we see is based on how much light from each of these bands is reflected off objects (or emitted by a light source) into our eyes.

Colorblindness results from a either a mutation or deficiency in one or more of the three variants of the protein cones use to detect light (rhodopsin). While what you said about the colors is true, this is a scarlet macaw so the colors you see are in fact the colors that the feathers will be when it's [fully grown](http://mrnussbaum.com/images/scarletmacaw.jpg). Cool. More info for the curious: http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/studying/feathers/color/document_view

Relevant quote:
&gt;In some cases feather colors are the result of a combination of pigment and structural colors. The greens of some parrots are the result of yellow pigments overlaying the blue-reflecting characteristic of the feathers. [I'm not entirely convinced on that being the case, but here's a fantastic video on structural coloration in butterfly wings.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE2v3sUzTH4) Shoutout to /u/mrpennywhistle who made it, as well as a ton of other fantastic videos.  CTRL+F pennywhistle

But I was looking for another video.  [This one.](https://youtu.be/VTVigNA3KCY)  There's something about this video that moves me nearly to tears...I haven't figured out what it is, but I love it. (Thanks Destin!  And Gordon, who's music is definitely part of the emotional hijack that occurs every time i watch this )

Watch the whole thing, but highlights are at [2:30](https://youtu.be/VTVigNA3KCY?t=2m30s) and [3:50](https://youtu.be/VTVigNA3KCY?t=3m50s).  I've watched this 20 times at least and still get chills.  ([4:43](https://youtu.be/VTVigNA3KCY?t=4m43s) gah!!!!!)

 Thank you very much! This is definitely true for iridescent feathers, I'm not sure about the feathers on this macaw though.  It's true of all feathers that are blue or green except for in a very small group of birds (no blue pigments exist in aves and only one group evolved green), and most that are deep red too (very few groups have true red pigment). Can you explain further? Blue macaws, blue jays, blue birds. There's lots of blue-colored birds.  ...Context man, we're already talking about structural coloration. That's not the case for red, orange and yellow feathers (usually) - those colors are caused by keratin or some other pigment.  Structural colors are usually blueish.  Some colors are a combination of the two.  Iridescence is also structural. Well, they are usually the preset gradients. Lazy programmers... /r/outside I think it's coincidence.  Birds of almost every species grow their wing feathers first, starting with the feathers on the tip, and scarlet macaws just happen to have wing feathers that are red/yellow/blue [like so](http://mrnussbaum.com/images/scarletmacaw.jpg).  Their bright primary colors are one of the reasons they're so popular as pets. &gt; more attractive to this species for some reason

Aren't they more attractive to you? [probably yes, they are] -- Why is that? [who cares why? I'm curious too, for sure -- I do not know the answer why rainbow-patterns seem to be attractive to us, except maybe that it's a striking, yet very uncommon-in-nature, recognizable pattern].

Since it's attractive to us, why shouldn't macaws' tastes trend the same way? For sure, the "attractive" (to other macaws) arrangement of these colors is the reason why it exists. It's not a coincidence; it's that bright displays are often selected for. In animal populations where one sex or the other can be choosey, [attention-grabbingness](http://i.imgur.com/C0kAdVv.jpg) wins out. Well.. Heh.. Well.. Might... Ya might as well ask, "why's a tree good? Why's a sunset good? Why're boobs good?" Man... Firecrackers! The universe is rarely so lazy. Nature mirrors nature.  you know thats not real answer, right? How Can Our Answers Be Real If Our Questions Aren't Real? In a similar vein, I wonder if the color gradient continues in the UV spectrum that we can't see without assistive tech. I had to look up if this applies, but most birds are classified as UVS (ultraviolet-sensitive, vs VS for violet-sensitive) for color vision. Apparently all parrots (Order Psittaciformes) are UVS.

In other words, I'd expect that a creature growing a visual rainbow on its body would include the entire rainbow according to what it can see. Macaww ley Culkin Goodnight Kevin Mom? Buzz, your girlfriend...WOOOOF M'caw It's just such a fun word to say.  Also fun to say: [onomatopoeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomatopoeia). arugula

arrrruuuugulaaaa /r/semanticsatiation That's a really gorgeous minidinosaur you have. They really do have [dinosaur feets.](http://www.aqua.org/~/media/Images/Animals/hyacinth%20macaw/animals-macaw-slide2-web.jpg) Mainly because they are dinosaurs, and T-Rex collagen proved it once and for all I want progress pictures, ask her to keep em coming :)  Baby birds are so damned awkward their first few months after hatching.  They go from "weird, tiny, raw chicken" to fully-fledged adult in like two months.  [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYm4A7D5vik).  

Going from zero-to-adult in such a short amount of time is so funny.  A baby bird's normal routine consists of:  

- Squawk or groan

- Sway as if drunk

- Flap wings once

- Blink slowly

- Repeat that african grey wouldn't stand much of a chance against the scarlet.


The store I used to work at had a small parrot get out of it's cage and decide to go be buddies with a blue and gold,  and the blue and gold just leaned over and ripped it's beak off.


parrots can be real bastards. All depends on the type of bird.  If they've never been socialized with other birds, or they just don't like having other birds in their space, they'll get aggressive if it happens.  

That's a terribly sad story.   It creeps me out a bit every time I see a picture of a baby bird with "new" feathers.

They kinda look like little darts stuck on their skin Good, I'm not the only one. Everyone else is talking about how cute it is or the scar on the woman's arm, and all I can think is how gross it looks with feathers growing out of tubes.  They're called pin feathers and googling them gives me the willies  they are.   the pins on the feathers are there to poke through the skin.   The bird will chew or pull them off so the feathers can grow,  unless a person helps.

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=baby+macaw Oh look! He knows his mummy! It's feathers are going to look even more beautiful when it gets older.  Your HP 3d printer is low on ink. I know baby robins can make a loud fuss.  I wonder how loud of a fuss this thing makes. If it anything like our parrot they can be ear splitting. It's more of a gurgle-rumble when they're babies, the screech comes later. But macaws don't quite screech like cockatoos. You've seen Ho-Oh. It is said that a rare glimpse of the creature will bring eternal happiness. It took me way too long to realize those are knees.  What happened to your friend's arm? I am going to guess broken arm that needed a plate inserted. 

Source: I shattered my arm and have 2 big scars like that from plates being inserted.  You are correct. Plate caused a restricted range of motion so she had a second surgery to correct the issue.  Best picture on reddit today. Guaranteed. From a an evolutionary perspective, what's the point of the colorful feathers? "Look at how beautiful my plumage is! I am very healthy and well groomed. I have *excellent* DNA! I am eating well and can bring you lots of food. Want to make babies?" Our world is so beautiful! I need to travel... /r/parrots check it out! ROY G. BIV!

I dont need your acceptance....I do D'aww. How can you say that is not the cutest thing ever? Pisses me off so much when this incredibly intelligent, near-human birds are in cages. At least they will never go extinct this way. They're almost out of habitat, sadly. And breeding pets domestically has a big impact on the wild-caught market. they look so cute So they kinda have to grow into that big ass beak, huh?

I know them feels, baby birdy. Your caw is very pretty. Maybe a dumb question but do you think it hurts when the feathers emerge like that? I don't think so, I would liken it to our own hair growth. It might itch, though. It always looks painful or itchy to me too! It can be itchy which is why a lot of birds like being "scritched" when new feathers are coming in. :) It does itch a bit, because the feathers grow in encased in a little shell made of then, plastic-like material (like a really thin layer of fingernail).  They're called [pinfeathers](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/15/7c/0c/157c0c5073c8bc9fb7800183b6cffb83.jpg), and the sharp tip can be itchy before it breaks off.  

As the feathers grow in, the nail-like sheath needs to be gradually groomed off.  But having sensitive quill-like protrusions all over their skin is uncomfortable, and painful if you happen to tweak or crush one accidentally.  Babies don't seem to notice as much, but adults will molt most of their feathers once a year and have to deal with a bunch of pinfeathers.  They'll spend more time preening, and will be in a more sour mood during that time.   OMG. It's a double rainbow all the way across the sky. This is one to most adorable things I've ever seen We had a baby rainbow macaw, the parents were a blue and gold and a scarlet. Beautiful! what happened to it A shiny!  cool Give me that thing - its the cutest thing parrot in a pouch Awww - so cute!! he is so wittle That baby macaw looks like a full grown parrot Kinda wrong to taste that rainbow Amazing! Reminds me of the imagined food in Hook.  It's turning fabulous! Macaws are born with a full sized head and beak? It's so fuzzy! Beautiful, incredibly intelligent birds, how cool your mate gets to work with them. This little guy is so cute! I hear in Hawaii you can have your photo taken with them in the street. This is more than *mildly* interesting. I **love** this!! Thank you God that we get to enjoy this. Sweet :p I read the title as "Rainbow appearance of new father's at a baby massacre". 

I think that I become dyslexic when I don't sleep. that seems more than mildly interesting parrots are the boss! /r/mildlyawwntristing &gt;A rainbow Appearance Of New Feathers On A Baby Mac[awwww](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww) Baby is 4 letters Thanks! Oddly satisfying. So very beautiful! Its an omen of gay things to come  "Check it sluts" DAT SCAR, DOE.

marry me, my queen. Neat  This is actually pretty interesting.  I love this  http://www.reactiongifs.com/dramatic-diva-kid/ I thought you were unwrapping him from a very long "trip" from belize. Beautiful baby  All black eyes still And a title of a new Wenders film Idiots!!! It's a baby Ho-oh! For whatever reason I find this completely repulsive. Goosebumps, shivering and all. I'm clawing my hands like I wanna tear up something.
I have a mild case of trypophobia and am getting a similar reaction. Anybody else disgusted out by this photo? Those aren't goosebumps. They get little black feathers in stripes on their face, and all those bumps are where they come in. I just realized that huge boob was a knee! &gt;Baby Macaw

**FTFY** They're like tiny coloured tassels!  Stuff libraries are starting to get super popular. My library lends cake pans and bike locks and had tons of cool stuff like 3d printers to use and conference rooms. They even lend ebooks which is awesome. 

Unless we go to the same library...in Mesa AZ What is the point of bike locks? You need your own bike lock, it is not like you only lock your bike every few months. Maybe its for those people that decided to use those session bikes that some cities offer that you can rent for a certain amount of time like NYC's Citibike. But what do you do with the bike while you're in the library checking out the lock? "Fuck, I didn't think that far ahead." You get it *before* you rent the bike? I just wanted a shoulder to cry on and you always have to go and try to solve things with your *logic*! How do you get to the library? Parks bike.

Runs inside.

Checks out bike lock.

*hurryhurryhurryhurryhurry*

Runs back outside to bike.

"God**damnit**!!" It probably gone. The ones I have seen comes with locks (Paris, London).

And you can only use them for free for 30 minutes at a time. You need to take it back to the station. My bike got stolen outside the library while I was checking out a bike lock.  My library lends them for use while in the library.  Lots of kids don't have them, especially those on training wheels following behind mom.  It's really more of a service offered to in-house patrons to encourage attendance. I have *never* heard of such a thing as a stuff library. Would you like to tell us more because this is interesting? I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not, so I'm going to reply as though you're serious.

It's a library that lends out stuff instead of only books. For example, my town has a toy library. You pay an annual membership fee, and you can borrow toys for a week at a time.  Totally serious. I can easily say on the Mid-Atlantic we just don't have that idea floating around. It seems so obvious. Like, why are we limiting ourselves to books anyway? Dang I thought Mesa sucked.  I was out there for an interview last week and did not seem like fun, but this sounds awesome.  However, with the much cheaper cost of living, I could just buy my own 3d printer.  Isn't Mesa constantly voted near the top of "most livable cities in the US"? As someone from the west side of Phoenix, it's not really my favorite area, but most people seem to like it. Westside! We are raised to think the Eastside sucks.  Us East Valley folks grow up thinking the west valley sucks. Probably because it's freaking far and the drive to get there sucks.  Nah man I moved to east Mesa a while ago and left pretty fast. It does suck. West side is the best side. East side is the Beast side I live in North gilbert. It's great. My mom lives in Mesa and loves it. I think it's nice on this side of the valley. I've always heard the west part  is the bad part of the valley.  Kind of depends on what you consider the "west part". A lot of I-17 west to about 43rd Ave is quite old and not all that attractive. The west west part, past 75th Ave is mostly (relatively) newer development, and then the tip of the northwest development going up to Lake Pleasant is really nice. Even going southwest, places like Avondale are starting to look much better. detail. Gilbert here, seems like when I see a shooting on the news I never watch, it's always on the "avenue" side of town. I'll stick to the "safest municipality in Arizona, and 25th safest in the nation." Despite being hotterm than Satan's asshole and asking why people would live here and I'm only in tucson Tucson is my favorite city in the U.S. . I lived there for four years and I miss it desperately. Aside from the awful summers. But still way better than Phoenix. At least Tucson has mt Lemmon 

Edit: wording.  Favorite city in **America**????? Have you only ever been to Phx and Tucson? Sure, if you are mormon. Fair. Interesting.  I wonder what is at my library.  I haven't been there for 15 years Which mesa  library?  Red mountain library You know I was reading your post, and I was thinking that it sounds a lot like my library. I was way too hyped to see the Mesa AZ. I know they have this at the Red Mountain branch. Mesa rent book on Jar Jar oh how I chuckled. Not just a soft, quiet chuckle, but a load ear splitting roar of which summoned a daemon of the prehistoric world, with my last gasp he opens one of his twenty seven mouths and sings the song that begin the apocalypse 

your world shall burn I really like my library's collection of rare seeds. I'm not 100% sure if they expect anything back, but they have little packets you can take.  I've never heard of a library lending cookery, but it's a good idea. Lending things that people need. Furthermore it's things that take up a large amount of space in your kitchen and you only use like once a year.  Or use only once. A dora/spongebob/anna-shaped pan would only be used for a single birthday party. Kid doesn't want the same cake year after year.

Sidenote: the library probably doesn't carry bachelorette cake pans that no one would ever want in their permanent collection. http://imgur.com/gallery/JjpLL The coconut tree one looks more like a cock'n'balls than the original probably did. A few of them are pretty convincing cover-ups (alligator, elephant, christmas tree) but you're not fooling anyone with the ["UFO Cake"](http://i.imgur.com/h49COlw.png). As that black guy from that one .gif would say, that's a penis.  I wouldn't say the alligator is convincing.  It looks much more like a crocodile. 
&gt;crocodile.

Cockodile.

- Joey Tribbiani My boyfriend glanced at my screen and said "why are you looking at painted penises?" Those are creative schlongs Speak for yourself. I demanded a ninja turtle cake every year for quite a while.  I wonder if my mom still has the pan. [Relevent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EeTN3dB8x0) "Farm Cake".  Incredible work they could just keep those in boxes with labels in the Adult section.. if they carry anything R rated at all. Or just keep them on the top/high shelf with all the other cake pans. No need to box them up its a cake pan not porn.  I have a Hello Kitty shaped pan that I wish I could use every day, but baking takes so much time. :(

Especially the cleanup part. Unless you ate an entire cake everyday you'd only "need" to use it like once or twice a week. Box mix cake is fine.  Woah woah woah. Who's Anna? Chick from Frozen. You forgot Penis cake. Ugh, my entire kitchen island is full of this shit. I would love this. Seattle public library now lends WiFi hotspots. Pretty cool option for those without. You just check out a hot spot? How long is it for?  Really I'm guessing is how that would work?  You get a 4G LTE device for three weeks. If it's overdue they turn off the internet to that device within 24 hours. Seattle Public Library currently has 126 devices and 1267 holds for them so you can't just go in and pick one up but I think they are just testing it for now and will get more if the demand keeps up. Huh?  Like a gsm hub or something?  Maybe it's a small town library thing...

I've yet to go to a library that doesn't have cake pans. From Nebraska - perhaps we just love our cake in non-conventional shapes.  You've yet to go to a library that doesn't have *cake pans* in particular? That's so oddly specific. I've never fucking heard of this. I just figured it was common. I have lived in 4 small towns, and each library had cake pans available.

And oddly enough, sports equipment. Just checked out a badminton set last week. Even I found that one odd... Eh, sports equipment is uninteresting to me now that I know that it's common for libraries to have sizable selections of ***cake pans***. The wildest it gets where I live is DVDs available to borrow. I feel like I'm missing out. The library near me hasn't got to DVDs yet. We have books and _tapes_ for audiobooks. Tip: check out Overdrive.com - if your library is hooked up, you can download digital audiobooks (and ebooks) right to your computer or mobile device. I love it! I currently live in a small town in the midwest. I've lived here for a year and a half now, but have yet to visit the library because our licenses are still out of state addresses until another month or two. It sounds like I'm due for a trip; if they don't have cake pans, I'll be really disappointed. just give them a utility bill, they will give you a card with that. I'm going to suggest it to my local library. Maybe I'd even get a new membership (used to go there every week but for some reason stopped a few years ago). I've never seen it and I live in a small town.  My small town library definitely does not have cake pans... It would be cool if it did because then I wouldn't have to sacrifice so much space storing mine. Talk to them and consider starting them off with a donation of you pans! Seriously. Publicize a drive, and people will be so happy to donate their cake pans that the library won't need to provide anything but space! No other pans?  Just cake pans?  What A normal baking sheet would be used frequently and worth buying for yourself. Cakes are made much less frequently, particularly ones of special shape. My library "lends" seeds to start a garden. They give you instructions on how to get seeds from your harvest so you can return them to the library.  There are several libraries in Iowa that have cake pan collections. My library just added sewing machines you can check out. There is a sewing co-op that meets every two weeks. Those who know how to sew are teaching those who do not. My hometown library in Nebraska did this 20 years ago.  I haven't been to that library since then do I'm not sure if they still do. I believe my local library lends not only pans, but small kitchen appliances as well, so if you want to try a recipe but you don't want to go out and buy the $300 doodad it requires, you can just check it out for a weekend and learn that way. Well, l they're becoming increasingly obsolete.  The more services they can offer, the better they can manage. Next up: lending cuddle buddies for Redditors. Some libraries are starting to rent basic power tools A tool library just opened near my work. Really handy, there's pretty much everything you could think of. Hammer? Lending nails would also be an interesting concept. You know for when you need to build something for a week or so  I saw a documentary a while back about a self-build development here in the UK (I don't think it was [this one](http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/may/07/uk-self-build-pioneers), but similar) where the street has a communal set of tools - a power-drill was the example given.

It makes a lot of sense, as I have realised myself after recently needing to buy a lawnmower. My garden is tiny, maybe 30m or 40m - the livingroom of the house I grew up in may even have been larger.

So there are maybe 20 people in my street all in the same situation, each spending 100 on a lawnmower we each use 20 minutes a week, 20 or 30 weeks a year, and all these lawnmowers sitting idle most of the time. It would be so much easier for us all to take it in turns with a shared lawnmower each Sunday afternoon. Me and 2 of my friends rented a house in college that had a communal lawn mower. But I think that was just because our landlord owned like 6 rental houses in a row and he just let us all share his mower.  Saw a tool library in Buffalo and thought it was a really cool idea. Now I see this cake pan idea too and I'm wondering what other good non-media libraries could exist. A toy library could be one for the kids. Those exist! My local library has had a toy lending program as long as I can remember. It's a lot of blocks and non-electronic toys, as well as dress up stuff. considering how impossible it is for me to take a normal muffin pan out of a wooden pantry without making noise, I can't imagine trying to look at these without making so much noise. So much. My library lends out tambourines and other percussion instruments. I guess you can imgaine what happens when people like you take them. A party? yep, party all day every day. People in libraries are always in a mood for a party any library ready to rent out the materials for a drum circle is just as ready to participate in said drum circle.  If you burn the cake, do you have to pay an *overdo* fee?  Eh?  I giggled, crap. You giggle crap? Fucking gross! The comma was there for a reason. Edit it out. It'll be funny, I promise. Not for me ="( Comma? Don't you mean 'colon'? Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa my library has framed art to check out. and videogames. Framed art, really?  For what purpose?  To impress people when you're hosting a party or something? Some people might like change and want something different every week? Not sure really. The impressing people might also be it.  Yes! My library has had this forever. Checkout period of 2 months for art. They have tons of different stuff. I think it's less impressing people (because honestly who's that impressed by a framed print?) and more about livening up one's living space for no money. I've always thought it was a pretty cool idea. They also have lots of toys and puzzles for children that you can get for 3 weeks. It kinda makes sense. I've seen a lot of art that I would have liked to look at longer or more often, but I can't justify buying it (partly because I'm poor) mostly because I know I'd probably be sick of it or bored with it after a month or two. Stage a house? That is really cool. There's so many cake pans I'd like to use, but I don't have the money/storage space. Some places that sell cake decorating supplies will rent out specialty pans (e.g. in Canada Bulk Barn rents pans). My library rents out toys. It's great when little cousins cone to visit. When I was a kid in the late 90's, our local library had computer games and stuffed animals you could borrow. My dad ended up having to track down and buy a specific goldfish puppet that my sister tried to check out every time we visited.  This actually sounds bad to me, but it's toy dependent.  Bleachable toys, great, stuffed toys, not so much.  I'm just imagining the bedbug and disease vector we're talking about here. Bleach, isle 3...

Edit: Obviously I meant some obscure, tucked away island with a name ending in "isle." But, the 3rd one. 

 For your own future benefit, Aisle*. And yeah...seriously thats gross. Never do that unless you wash them in bleach before hand, and be prepared to pay for replacements if they accidently get taken back home by the kids. Expected value for the trip is still way down.  North Liberty, Iowa library Urbandale library has them as well. Don't see Urbandale mentioned much on Reddit, thats for sure
 Pella too. Maybe it's an Iowa thing then? Impressive work! You live around here? When I saw that picture I immediately thought of NL but then I was like, nah, if NL has it then probably every library has it. Lived in NL last year and always made a stop to look at the plans when I went to check out the DVDs right next to them :)
Love to see Iowa on the front page! Yes. I moved out here a year ago for work. The community is nice, close to many staples and restraints, good school district. But what sold me was the cake pans My ex's mom is a librarian at the North Liberty library. Recognized it right away! It's a very impressive selection of pans. That's brilliant.  My library used to loan out sewing patterns, but a lack of interest made it fade away. I don't know enough about sewing to tell if this is a lame pun or not. I don't think it is, and I'm kinda sad that I can't check out a sewing pattern.

I bet it wasn't necessarily lack of interest so much as the changing needs of a sewing pattern. Some of us can get a vintage pattern that has no instructions and be fine, but many people need the instructions printed on the pieces to understand what they're doing. Because we don't teach children sewing, and don't expect everyone to know how to sew patterns have had to become more of a teaching tool over time than just a pattern.  A small-town library near me lends out kid's costumes. I think they're available all year but they do a big display every October for Halloween. I think that's wonderful. What the hell kinda library you goin' to, man? Do they have the cast iron cornbread pan shaped like tiny corn cobs? Does anybody have those?

Edit: Wow they do exist My in-laws do.  They also hold "corn-o-rama" every August and use all their corn themed dishes.  Hoosier? Or some other delightfully weird part of the midwest? Nope!  Pacific Northwest!  They just love corn.  Lol 


                corn I'm from the PNW. I demand they invite me to their yearly corn party. I'll bring corn.  I go to a corn on the cob festival every year in Maryland. We're a nation of subsidized corn fiends. My mom does. raises hand. cast iron, too corn.. bread My mom has those.  I made cornbread last week in a loaf pan and it's definitely not as good-- not enough crust. I have one.  Have I ever used it?  No.  Thing makes like six fucking sticks.  That's how many get eaten on the way to the table.  I'd have to have about 8 of them for it to be useful. TIL corn cob shaped cornbread pans exist.  Pan's Labyrary Are they sorted by the doughy decimal system? You know what? Fuck these comments, I'm done. I need this. I always need new supplies but don't want to spend the money AND never have anywhere to store it! Such a great idea.  Libraries are more than just books, free exchange of information!  Can they also lend me a cup of sugar? My library does too! It's awesome! I've been able to make great birthday cakes for my kids - Elmo, Winnie the Pooh, and Elsa. browsing through cake pans seems like one of the loudest things you can do in the library. Instead of "Be kind, rewind", there should be a sticker saying "Be a pal, scrape off as much burnt pastry as possi-bal". THAT IS AWESOME! Wish my town had something like this! Maybe my town does have something like this. Hmmmm.... Here in Canada we have a chain store called Bulk Barn that rents out cake pans.  Although they charge money. They should make that section dark and twisty, then call it"Pan's Labyrinth" Have libraries gone too far? I'd say they haven't gone too far enough! What's next, renting out sexy librarians?!?! I...would this be a bad thing? Picture number 4 will shock you! Is this the difference between large cities and small towns?  My only library experience is in big cities and my first thought was "how do they keep the homeless guys from jizzing on them?" They don't. And it doesn't have to be just homeless guys. Some outwardly normal people do weird stuff to everything they get their hands on.

I would clean it with alcohol and give it a 400 degree dry run before putting anything in it. I'd make sure to get my own jizz on the top layer to protect me from other people's jizz. Be the change. This is such a great idea. This idea is PANtastic! I e-mailed my own local library with the photo you posted, and told them I have several cake pans I can donate to get them started. Thank you for the great idea, flannelpancakes! Freaking awesome. Every time I read a recipe that requires a springform pan, I immediate close the book.. Because I do not have one to perform the recipe. I've seen some strange ideas that didn't quite pan out, but this one takes the cake..... I worked at a library as a teenager, and after how many things came back covered with piss or shit, there's no fucking way I would touch these. Key words: High School... Edited my comment to make it more clear. I was in high school. It was a public library. I can assure you that, having also worked as a library aide in high one year, the high school library received materials back in MUCH MUCH cleaner condition. 20 years ago we could borrow toys at our local library; that was way awesome! :D New toys every 2 weeks! :3

In Ommoord, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, it was called a Speel(Play)-o-theek, another cheapshot at wordplay xD (Since library is called bibli-o-theek) Neat idea! That has to be the noisiest library ever.  

 This is an amazing ideas. There are pans I would only use as a one off bit of fun. So borrowing them short term is a better solution than buying and filling my cupboards! got to love libraries. That's awesome. I love libraries, whether for books or physical objects. They played such an important part in my development. Being from the inner city, there wasn't really much positive stuff for us to do. I found solace at the library for many hours each week.  This makes a lot of sense except for the cleaning issue. Do they have a sanitizer or something? I think the people who check out cake pans (and who know that you can check out cake pans) most likely to return them clean. I'd also clean it before using it after I checked it out At the library in my town you can check out video games. It's pretty cool but kids just end up stealing them.   My hometown library has done this since before I was born.  We checked out an R2-D2 pan for my 5th birthday and they still have it available today.  They actually have some really old designs that are probably collector's items at this point. Mildly interesting? FUCK YOU THIS IS SO FUCKING COOL It's unlikely but could this be unsanitary? My library does this to. I thought most libraries had cake pans. As a chef, this is a pretty awesome idea.  I would start going to the library again for this.Great idea. I don't need a special pan for everything. So how do they keep track of them? Do you by any chance live in Iowa? Damn. I read this as "cake puns." I guess this'll do.  Clang! Crash! Bang!  Browsing would be noisy. Restocking those must be fun.  I always wondered how something like this would *pan out.* Mine does too! And hasfor a long time. They have a book with pics of cakes ppk have made with them for ideas too. If nothing else it's a great way for libraries to stay relevant in the age of internets and technologies. This is more important than you realize. I used to work at a library and here's the thing: libraries are not book warehouses. Libraries are *resource* warehouses. Sometimes resources are cake pans. 

It's important to remember this when looking at support for libraries. They are much, much more than they used to be. Support your local library, people, one day you may need those resources! Looks like Libraries are doing everything they can to stay somewhat useful in the digital age.     You would not download a cake pan! I think I heard about this somewhere. An older women had a large collection of various shaped cake pans and she willed them all to a library. Her idea was that instead of people going out and buying this one peculiar shaped cake pan for the one birthday your going to use it for then have it rot in the back of the cupboard, you could instead go to the library and loan on out.  A post about cake pans? This batter be good. Too interesting, not mild enough.
0/10 I humbly request a cake pan in the shape of boobies. Gonna make me a booby cake.  why are you so into boobs? lol Why aren't you? But mom, I want to be a kitchen!

Absolutely not, you are a library, and you're going to stay a library as long as you live in my County! I hope the library cleans them properly after each return. For all we know, some sick fuck could be making chocolate muffins with his own feces. This is AWESOME! I really need to encourage our local library to do that! Where's the penis pan? My library rented out puppies.  Someone is getting a new car Someone is lucky their windows weren't rolled down  Oh god I hadn't thought about that and now it's all I can think about! I have a convertible, I can't even imagine if that happen to me Someone just got a new paint job. Hardcore Plasti Dip I would have been so fucked. As a smoker, this was my first thought. My windows are never closed.

When they told me "the tar will destroy your lungs and kill you" this is not at all what I expected. Maybe it's time to quit.. Imagine peeling that skin off. /r/peeling would lose their mind. Well, you'd be peeling it off a corpse. That shit is hot.  Someone is getting fired Someone's getting laid tonight. Someone is playing a game tonight  Someone is getting murdered tonight Somebody's gonna hurt someone, before the night is through.

**EDIT:** somebody not someone Somebody find me somebody to love ~~Every~~*Some*body wang chung tonight. Somebody can feel it coming in the air tonight Oh lord. Somebody feels like chicken tonight, like chicken tonight  "I fucking hate the Eagles man!" Get the fuck out of my fuckin' cab! It's time to get things started on the Muppet Show Tonight!

 Someone Some body once  1 Someone's getting paved tonight.  [deleted] Our warehouse is the same. Somebody drove a forklift through the back door, so it's a permanent teaching  tool to get people to check that it's out of gear before hopping  off.  you could say...

he sealed his fate.. &gt;Someone is getting their car's value from the insurance company, which almost certainly won't cover the price of a new working car.

FIXED IT It's actually on the insurance company to research and find cars of the same model for sale in the area and give them that amount.  The insurer is required to restore the vehicle owner's vehicle status to that which they had before the accident.  NEVER let your insurer give you an amount which will not afford you the car you had regardless of the blue book value!

EDIT: all advice I'm giving is for the state of California.  There are few variations between states so a lot goes for every state but I'm clarifying it anyway. I'm glad I read this YUP, I was rear ended last Dec and totalled my car, the insurance company tried to give me about 2.5-3k less than what they were selling for at that time in my area, I showed them 10 comparisons of cars for sale in my area with less features and more miles than my car that were going for more. Said they were either going to fix my car and give it back, or give me an extra 2.5k, they decided to give me the 2.5k.. Insurance companies will compromise in order to reduce the chance you will go out and get an attorney, costing them more money in the long run. They would much rather pay you the extra couple thousand to make you happy, or at least most quality companies go by this standard Do you have a source or directions of what to do? Seems like every time it's been a here is your check take it or leave it type deal. Since the kbb value is technically what my vehicle is worth, therefore in theory what another one would cost..... Yeah but if they're all being sold in your area for 6 grand and the blue book value is 1500 they can't just strand you with a 1500 dollar check.  You need to be stern with them and tell them you know what you deserve.  The term for it is indemnification.  You have indemnified them to make you whole after a loss occurs.  The contract is your policy.  In return you pay them a premium. I know I replied to your other one also but this lead me to a new question. What if it's the other peoples insurance (like this case) can this still be done? I'm not paying their premium the truck driver is. Thanks again, just curious.  They are just as responsible.  This is why generally it is advised to contact your insurer regardless of whose fault it is because your insurer will go to bat for you in this situation.  Your insurer is still indemnified to make your situation whole, and in this case it's arguing on your behalf to the other insurer. In fact, typically it's easier if it's someone else's insurance, because your insurance company doesn't have anything to lose. KBB is technically what your car is worth is the same as saying Zillow is technically what your house is worth. KBB tries its hardest to imply that they are an "official" value but really a car is worth what someone will pay for it, just like anything else.  

Here's some mental exercises to demonstrate this:  
-lets say you have a 1994 ford explorer 4 door sport with the KBB average 167282 in fair condition and standard options.  Trade value to a dealer is $353.  Now add the tow hitch.  Is this explorer really worth $125, or 33% of its value, more just because of a tow hitch? In all likelihood, this vehicle is going to the scrap yard either way and the extra 15 pounds of tow hitch will net the owner pennies.  But also in all likelihood, the dealer will offer you $500 or $1000 to make you feel good about the deal, and make up the loss elsewhere in the financing or price of the vehicle you are trading for. (Note, this does NOT suddenly make the explorer worth $500-$1000)

-pick a 2010 Chevy Malibu LS with 250,000 miles (suppose a fleet, or some crazy person who drives 40k+ a year), then change the miles to 300,000, and then 400,000. Notice the value doesn't change? But those extra miles have to be worth something to someone.  The answer is KBB is simply an estimator like Zillow and something is truly only worth what someone will pay, finding sold comparables on ebay or through some other type of marketplace, will be more accurate because it is what someone actually paid for a car like this one.   I've gotten my car replaced twice by my insurance company and they have given me an ever increasing amount of money. I bought a car at 9.5k and they gave me 12.5k. bought the same car and totaled that and got 14k. Bought a different car this time. damn, at that rate you could get yourself a nice german car Until he had to get it repaired. Which is when you crash it and then keep moving up.  It's a late 90's Corolla, I doubt the owner is getting much for a 15 year old car. I hate to make you feel old,  but none of the 90s were 15 years ago anymore.  :&lt;

I say that because I don't know what year the car is exactly.  That model ran from 97-01, so it could still be less than 15 years old! I drive a '00 and I'm 25. We still party like its the year before she was made! Are we talking a 2000 model or 1900 model? Toyota Corolla (horse drawn) Wagon Would a chariot qualify as a horse drawn bicycle? Those were basically motorcycles. Moms and SOs were adamantly against them, I'm sure.  You party like 9-year olds? ICE CREEEEAAAM!!! Well it is a Corolla. It's not like you'll see it parked out front of a night club  Jimmy's Mom is driving us to Putt-N-Stuff! We can listen to the new Will Smith tape. It's gonna be sick! [deleted] My boyfriend's car caught fire because the asshole parked next to him decided arson is fun. BF got 2-3 times the blue book value, and that car was a POS. A viking funeral was probably the best fate it could have had.  Someone parked next to the car they set on fire? No it sounds like the arsonist burned his own car, (probably in an attempt to get insurance money) which happened to be next to OP's boyfriend's car. That makes sense  Former Auto Insurance Estimator here... You'd be surprised what you'll get for a piece of shit car.  That should really be some insurance company's motto.

"State Farm: You'll Be Surprised What You Get For Your Piece Of Shit Car." To avoid a lawsuit the company that owns the truck will get them something decent.  You mean blue book value of an old ass beater? My guess is they would rather have their car then the hassle of finding a new one.  Yup, my car is worth like $1000 but there's no fuckin way I'd find a car for $1000 that runs as well, nor would I want to bother. Most people with decent beaters are doing the same as me and running them (lovingly) into the ground. [deleted] Ugh, they're so easy to kill.

I could probably total my car if I kicked it hard enough :P

^^but ^^I ^^wouldn't ^^cause ^^I ^^love ^^her We ll that sums up how I feel about my wife. Don't knock it, even old asses need beatings. Good thing a chicken feather truck wasn't following him.

Fixed the username for you. Topical. Like the bronzer she used. I'm sure car's driver is glad his window was up.  Imagine if it had been a convertible. Imagine if it had been a convertible full of babies and puppies. Well, I know what nightmares I'll be having tonight.  Go on...  You know those nightmares where you are public speaking naked?  Well its kinda like that except you are clothed, at home and you are out of Doritos. Mine are being naked, at home and out of doritos. Only to realise im not actually sleeping. Mine are being naked, at home and out of doritos. Only to realise im not actually home. Well, hopefully you're at Walmart so you can stock up. "/u/CirrusUnicus ran through the fields of black tar, hoping, dreaming, there would be an escape. The asphalt slowly ate away CirrusUnicus' strength: every step pulled back, each march was a burning, solidifying hell. All that CirrusUnicus could hold on to was the fact that this horror was CirrusUnicus' alone, no one else was among the neverending darkness of ink-colored quicksand. Here, CirrusUnicus would die, without a scream or a sound or a witness. Thank goodness. No other soul would be hurt.

Then, a small whimper. Just a brief cry. CirrusUnicus glanced up, eyes wide in terror. A car, no a convertible, its hood open wide and its leather seats carrying children and puppies. Why? Why where they there?! CirrusUnicus reached out with a last remaining strength and waded towards the shouts. One of the babes met CirrusUnicus' gaze. Their eyes were still locked as CirrusUnicus' last breath gasped full of asphalt, and the tar eclipsed CirrusUnicus whole. The child screamed and watched the remaining hand sink slowly into darkness. The puppies howled in fear, knowing they'd soon meet the same fate." dude what the fuck TIL /u/CirrusUnicus is Han Solo Just go over to /r/creepy and look at the cute stuff they post. It will make you feel better. Imagine if it had been a convertible full of babies and puppies, but the driver  survived, went home, and mercilessly beat his wife. There was an accident about 20 years ago in Vancouver where a truck carrying hot asphalt lost its brakes and ended up broadsiding a minivan in line for the ferry.  The load dumped onto the van and the van got wedged into other traffic so the doors couldn't be opened and the people inside basically got cooked alive.  Not fun. I remember that.   Two were killed.   Five were injured.  Two families in the same minivan.  The truck driver was convicted of seven counts of criminal negligence.   There's a very steep hill down into the terminal and he failed to check his brakes.    I think he went to jail for three years. He probably still has nightmares about it. This is so terrifying. Going out for a family drive and bam! Fucking destroyed. And there's nothing they could do about it.  Fuuucck. How about this one?

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/buried-in-asphalt-15-year-old-manitoba-boy-dies-1.733824

You're just an illegally underaged kid working a road job to make some extra scratch for the summer and you go to work on Friday. You're looking forward to spending some money this weekend from your new job that you're exhausted from working. There's a fresh load of asphalt to offload and -BAM- you're dead in practically an instant (I hope). A truck full of that stuff tipped over in china too onto a guy riding a bike. There's a liveleak video of it. Yes he died in the same way And right after a truckload of feathers tips over and dumps on him. The news story said the sealant was a cool (temperature wise) type.  So he would have been covered in it, but he wouldn't have been cooked to death.   Still would have sucked balls Like scrotum balls even.  more like tar balls Sticky black tar balls.  &gt; the sealant was a cool (temperature wise) type.

The sealant talked in the movie theater, left his dirty dishes in the sink, stole his co-workers' lunches out of the office fridge. 

Sealant was cool, *temperature wise*, but otherwise, no, sealant was *not* cool at all. I feel like I *know* sealant now, you know? I now wonder if I ever knew sealant at all. how the fuck would you get that shit off http://www.homedepot.com/p/GoJo-Orange-Original-5-Gallon-Pumice-Hand-Soap-Pump-095804/202299834  Witg a paint safe solvent, like wsol which is almost the exact same as wd40, though for this something a little more bulk/powerful would be used.  Wash vehicle with soap and water, spray solvent onto oil, allow it to work for a bit, gently agitate with a microfiber, rinse, repeat. Motorcycle commuter here, instantly glad i wasent there. Jesus fuck.  How difficult would this be to get off? Would it damage you? [deleted] [deleted] You would know "old", time-keeper. I feel bad for that white sedan. They have got to be pissed at the tanker truck diver who took that corner too fast. Well they could get a decent chuck of money out of it for a new car.  I'd be pretty stoked. Sometimes I just wish I will get T-boned by someone texting so I can get a new car. Wait.. what is wrong with me? Got T-boned at a crossroads while driving with my mother in her brand new Mini Cooper S, nobody was hurt somehow, but the woman who hit us (and was found to be at fault) had the same insurance we did; after a year of legal fighting they gave us $2000 and put the car ($28000 about 6 months prior) on a salvage title. Repair costs were around $5000 but the shop owner was kind enough to foot the rest of the cost.

TL;DR: Don't rely on insurance to repair or replace your car. Depends on the insurer. Also the state; some let insurance companies get away with anything. Too often you need to sue you own insurance company just to get what they promised. Snakes. Yep. My dad's car was sideswiped when it was parked by some lady and it took us a month to get it fixed. They first had to "investigate" if the driver had valid insurance for weeks all while telling my dad to just make it easy and claim it on our insurance instead. They told him they would reimburse the deductible but my dad said fuck no and threatened to sue. One day later and we have one of their agents checking out car and cut a check to fix the whole thing and some. Fuck insurance companies, every last one of them. My insurance company read my girlfriend's post on facebook about how our furnace gave out (in the middle of a cold winter). They called me that day and told me I had special coverage on my insurance that would replace any piece of electronics that fails while plugged in, anywhere in my home. I thought that was pretty cool. That's kinda creepy though isn't it? This is State Farm, we saw that you just broke up with your girlfriend. We have lonely agents here, too. I'll transfer you to Jake. I think facebook is creepy, that's why I don't use it. well in order to get a replacement vehicle your repair has to over xx% the current market value of the vehicle... insurance companies are usually good about repairing exactly what you need for the exact cost + maintenance (given from an approved shop stated by your insurance company). this is all, of course, dependent on the type/amount of car insurance you have. A repair shop that covered $3k in repairs instead of robbing you? That's pretty awesome That just means they got more money than they said they did from the insurance company toward the repair of the customers car, or the repair costs were a lot less than they said in the estimate.  Ever since I got $3k from someone totalling my shitty civic, I keep hoping it'll keep happening and I'll eventually end up with a GTI or something.  I got my GTI for 3k, mk4s ftw I had a friend that kept happening to... he'd get rear ended or t boned every like 6 months.. he started with a old Chevy cavalier or something and ended with like a $15000 truck or some shit. It was ridiculous I feel like it's your friend's driving that caused the issues if he got hit like that so often. You are probably right, but there are enough drivers in the US that it should happen to a small number of people just by the nature of probability.  Need witnesses too. A truck running a red light totaled my car, but since there were no witnesses the jerk in the truck lied to his insurance saying that it was me who ran a red light, which means they didn't pay anything. Or a dash cam. $50 for irrefutable proof if I get in any accidents. I'll take that all day long.  Question: How do you go about using the video as proof? I'm guessing you wouldn't be able to show it to the police at the site of the accident, so do you submit it to your insurance?  Mine has a screen on it, so I could technically show them at the accident. It also has a timestamp, etc on it and it records in 3 minute video segments so no major editing needed or anything. It hasn't been needed yet, but it will pay for itself the one time I need it.  I showed mine on the scene after being rear ended.  The cop loved how it proved the little shit who hit me was lying to her. Some cops keep card readers on them so they can upload the file quick.  Or depending on the dash cam it may have a (very small) screen. 

Otherwise you can take it down to the station and give it to your insurance company.  I have heard stories about companies making it a pain to get them a video file though.  Sometimes witnesses aren't even considered. My Dad was in an accident back in the 70's.

He was stopped at a red light while going into work. It was the dead of winter, and a snowplow was going to go through the intersection, but hit a slick of ice, and slid. The truck slid across the road and slammed into my Dad's car, totalling it. Luckily my Dad was fine, just some bruises, but the car got totalled.

A cop was across the road parked in his car drinking a coffee (I think) and saw the whole thing, so he was on the scene in seconds.

The insurance company refused to pay out. First they claimed my Dad was at fault, but after the cop put his report in, they changed their story to say that he shouldn't have been there, at that time of day, at that specific moment. Lucky the window was closed. I'd trade a wrecked car over being burned by something you can't really get off.  I drive with my windows down every day. Pretty sure you've given me nightmares for the night. /r/oddlysatisfying  I was thinking that, too. So shiny and smooth. I just want to pet it. "Touch"  I'd run my fingers across it Just need a convoy of asphalt sealant trucks to spill on our local roads to fill the potholes in PA That truck driver must feel like an ass considering it was all his fault.

 He just sealed his own fate.  He's in a sticky situation for sure Yeah, I don't see a way he can turn this one around.  Its his own dumb ass fault.

http://fox40.com/2015/06/19/mess-from-oil-spill-creates-big-traffic-delays-in-elk-grove/ Hah. Elk Grove. One of the nicest looking dumps in northern CA  :( Laguna West, reporting in  Actual EG reporting in. :/ Same. Had no idea Elk Grove was considered a dump. Right? Fuck these guys, let's go to Perry's. "It was like a skeet and then a slam."

Who skeets like that??? Poor guy on the white (now black) car. This looks like an insurance nightmare- especially in a no phalt state. 
 I can't even imagine the extent of the smell Materials technician here. Once you get used to it, it's... Well, no, it's still pretty unpleasant. Laguna Blvd in Elk Grove California. I had to take a detour around this! 916 Represent!! All I can think about is how I wished it happened on my driveway That's going to be a nightmare for the clean up crew. I'm guessing asphalt sealant is toxic and must be rock hard from from being in the sun. The whole road needs to be scrapped and probably resealed.  &gt;must be rock hard from from being in the sun

actually asphalt sealant is rubbery/tar type substance and gets goopy/pliable when really hot. still probably a bitch to clean up tho. This stuff is a nightmare to cleanup.  Used to be an environmental contractor and cleaned up a tanker of tack coat that tipped over.  Tack coat is a bit different, it's asphalt that's emulsified with water so it's sprayable.  They spray it between layers of asphalt so it sticks together.  So what I cleaned up wasn't as bad as what's pictures but still a mess.  That one was on gravel and it ran down into grass.  We just dug it all up and hauled it off.  Ruined a good pair of boots that day though.  

I can't imagine cleaning this off the road though.  Likely they would put absorbent clay on it to solidify it and then scoop it up and load it in trucks.  But it would leave so much residue on the pavement that it would need to be paved over.   hm, it is a road, why not just leave it?  will it be bad? does the sealant reduce traction?  When it rains you're going to end up aquaplaning because its so smooth. Plus its at an intersection. I've never heard it called aquaplaning before, it's always called hydroplaning where I am from. Different parts of the country id assume.  I'm with you. I always referred to it at hydroplanning  Good thing it's in California and won't rain yes it does. when i ride my bike or motorcycle i have to avoid riding parallel to the stuff. They dumped a bunch of sand on it and scooped it up. Took a few hours.  On another note, why don't I think to post stuff like this? This happened not too far from me yesterday.   The road is so smooth where it spilled!  they'll be finding the well preserved remains of these cars thousands of years from now

 That wasn't today. That was yesterday, in Elk Grove California. Only reason I know that is be cause I was on my way to Sacramento Wizard World Comic Con and the traffic was awful.

*Edit* I'm not trying to be a buzzkill or anything. Just happened to know this because of yesterday That's a paddling  im glad the white sedan didnt have the windows down The news article mentioned that the sealant was cool, so the guy would have been covered in sealant, surely not good for you, but he wouldn't have been covered in slowly hardening super heated napalm asphalt, so that is a good thing.   Time for an asphalt truck tip over story.  My coworkers father,  when he was a teenager watched as an asphalt truck tipped over and dumped  its  load onto a convertible next to it.  The guy was screaming for his life.  The teenager ran over,  reached in to the hot burning asphalt and pulled the poor guy out.  He burned his arms and hands horribly and spent some time in the hospital. When he asked about the other guy,  the doctors told him the guy was alive but wasn't going to make it. 

Time goes on,  the teenager grows up,  gets married and fathers my coworker.  The coworker grows up and meets a special girl who he later marries.  When the special girl met his father at some point,  she asked the father about the scars on his arms so he tells her the story.  Her jaw drops,  she confirms the year and the location.  She just met the man who saved her father's  life before she was born.  That man? Albert Einstein. Well one things for sure that ashfault is gonna be sealed as FUCK  This actually happened to 2minutes away from where my parents live. Crazy traffic around the area. For the love of the Prime Directive do not, under any circumstances, allow Denise Crosby near that thing.  that patch of road is going to be silky smooth "I got a white car today!" *5 min later* "I thought you got a white car?" "WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP?" https://youtu.be/m01ICYfdLsA?t=3m25s That car's never going to rust!  Drive it forever! Shortly afterwards, a truck carrying a load of feather pillows crashed nearby, the entire road was tarred and feathered...
 Feather truck not far behind
 Everyone's all on how the person's getting fired, someone's getting a new car, but I am looking for the foot print's or something on how that bastard got out of his car?! On the plus side, *some* asphalt did get *extremely* well sealed. Good news is that part of the street is now sealed and taxpayers didn't have to pay 3 times the market rate to get it done.  Mmm dat Assphalt Dude in white car is so glad he didn't buy a convertible.  Guy is lucky to had his window closed Once you go black My dad was on a hazmat emergency clean up team. Showed him this picture and he gave the "fuck that" face.  That's Rachel Dolezal's car.  It identifies as black.  Now that looks like a *lowers sunglasses* sticky situation That 15 foot patch of road is going to be sooo smooth, except at the spot where the truck is.  Something from my town made it on reddit! That looks like a police SUV in the back...

"OK road put your hands in the air, I said put your hands in the air. Shit he's coming right at me!" *sound of shots being fired at the ground*

"Welcome to News At 11, our top story tonight a young unarmed black road killed by police" OP totally set the hotel on fire himself for a sick reddit post  Who here can honestly say they haven't set fire to a hotel for a bit of extra karma? *sheepishly raises hand* 1 fatality=1 upvote ...you've killed 23 people?

2) Leave smoke stains.

3) Become "Adult hotel".

4) Profit? I might as well buy the hotel now [Hostel](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450278/) They should get the el out of there. I chuckled. Thanks. This reminds me of the time I was in a small motel for business and sometime in the night the place caught on fire. All my nice business suits got burned but I wasn't so bummed about that because insurance paid for it. The part that really sucked was when the hotel owner found a nickel in the rubble that was red hot. He ended up throwing it on my back and man did he burn the everloving shit out of me.  It's such a toss up whether you get karma or are crazy downvoted for these white hot nickel stories I swear I was expecting it to be about tree fiddy.  It was then I realised that /u/LastWordFreak was a 500ft crustacean from the paleolithic era. Aww man, this account is actually pretty funny.  Are you trying to be like the jumper cables guy?

I don't get it. I bet for a solid minute that hotel sign looked fucking amazing. This is the true essence of mildly interesting. Well done. Guess mild is pretty hot these days^I'm ^sorry. A restaurant near where I live called 'Red Hot' burnt down about a year ago. 

Article about it here: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/police-investigate-after-major-fire-burns-down-a-northampton-restaurant--the-red-hot-world-buffet-9015426.html I drove by a coffee shop in San Jose that burnt down. It was called The Flame. my mixtape just dropped yo It was too hot. Hot damn. That hotel better cool it's heels in Mexico for a bit until the heat dies down  Stay out of the el bro, bad shit going down. That must have been one fantastic advertisement for about 10 minutes. Excuse me, I specifically requested a fully non-smoking hotel.
 I told them my mixtape was fire...
 that's pretty cool **ITS A SIGN** Hotel coral Essex!!! Nerds...NERDS....NEEEERRRDS!! Good old OP, commiting arson for fake internet points Irony is burning. "Did you remember to turn off the irony, honey?" Its the HOTel cORAL esSEX ! That's just great marketing. For those of you who don't "habla Espanol"...  hotel means... "hot the" That sign must have been hot as el. Mildly suspicious. Hotel Coral Essex Someone must have left the irony on. Seems like a night club or gimmicky restaurant
 Holy ham-hock how horrible! Call the Final Destination people, I have a million dollar premonition for them. Supa hot fire elllll lmao When you're hot you're hot. In Yorkshire this sign still makes sense. Same thing happened to a Wendy's near me but only the W burned off leaving Endy's  Looks like the kind of thing you'd see in a movie called "Hotel Hell" Probably the person who installed it was a prankster with a vandal side, wired those three letters in such a way as to be more prone to overheating.

Totally just talking out of my ass, but it makes a bit of sense. House of El. Superman clearly heat visioned the sign. /r/conspiracy To be fair the picture looks like it was taken in El Dorado  Up in... http://imgur.com/gULyUuf him. This would be a genius form of branding. El hot that was hot Not just mildlyinteresting, but fucking hilarious! Leave it that way and pretend it was on purpose. They are now the HOTel Now it sounds like a hip new age Mexican restaurant. 10/10 would go back. This is like black rain on your wedding day. I would leave it as is, if I were management. This place is on fire!
 And just like that, the world, if for just a moment, made perfect sense. now it's just "THE" Too interesting Arson was worth the karma. Hot the. Rather appropriate that this is on reddit.com/hot Neon sign probly pushy 12000 volts. /r/crappydesign They should leave it that way. It looks badass. My medium told me there would be hot and mild. el hot  I once saw the roof of a Red Roof Inn on fire.  Too hot? Hot damn. Call the po-leece and the Fiya-man! They requested my mixtape as a elevator music... The word "re" in repost means it has already been posted I guess you could say it's a HOTel ;) First time I've seen an /mildlyinteresting at the top...or is it "a /mildlyinteresting"?  Oh well, whatever the answer TIL.  BTW this is right in Reddit's wheelhouse, what a pun! HA! Ah, I see my mixtape got delivered. It's just "The" now lol that is sketchy how hot just got burneddddd On the bright side, they can now convert to a Mexican restaurant and save a few bucks on signage

Hey /u/Juju_bubs,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topredditposts with all the other top posts. This gives a whole new meaning to "I'm too hot, hot damn." "caught fire" God works in mysterious ways...  Too hot... **Hot**el C**oral** Es**sex** I thought at first the funny thing was it was being "sinister" and it was funny that it was " "el" diablo" or something like that. That's right where I went to lol That's just some clever advertising. All thas was left was THE I would have gone with...We put the "HOT" in hotel! And I just saw this post on the top of the /hot/ search on reddit.  As Reggie Miller would say, "No pun intended" Reminds me of a final destination thing. You think it will be the thing that kills you, and then a Buddha statue falls on your head for some reason. Hotter than el. /r/mildlyamusing
 Yeah but imagine all the ho's that went in and out of that place and the sign just sat there doing nothing  Imagine if only the Ho got burned? We have a CVS by our house that has a burned out light so it reads "harmacy" Zoom in on that bitch, photoshopped for sure. Called a police and a fireman. It's also 40% hollow, thanks for the extra plastic lads! Heh. I bought that same one, along with like three or four others, in an attempt to find one that would work with my linux NAS file server. I dropped it and discovered the placebo-antenna accidentally. Did any of them work? I'm going about setting up a Linux based NAS and don't want to go wasting money on wireless things that aren't going to work Don't you want a nice wired connection for something like a NAS? With the way my house and router are setup, wired isn't really an option and I don't have the ability to reorganise things. So wireless it has to be, I'll just deal with it being slower Ethernet of Power: http://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-TL-PA4010KIT-Powerline-Adapter-Starter/dp/B00AWRUICG/ref=sr_1_1/181-5869954-7742857?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433212285&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ethernet+through+power+outlet

I got one of these set up for my house because the signal between floors was ridiculously poor and I running a line through the wall is a pretty decently sized job. Now I have a router on each floor, and they talk to eachother over the power lines. That looks like it could very well solve the problem. Thanks for that I've never used one of those, but I've heard they work really well. Sometimes people have issues though because some outlets are on different circuits or something like that.  Why do you want Bluetooth on a Nas server ? The marketing makes sense, but the plastic waste though  Plastic is cheap so they don't give a shit. Most likely they made one form factor enclosure for multiple devices.  One device requires an antenna and that extra room.

A way to save cost rather than coming up with multiple designs and needing multiple variations.

That or they had these left over from a previous model.. Apparently plastic molds are fairly expensive to create. Atari eventually [sold the mold for the Atari Jaguar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Jaguar#Legacy) to a dental company. they can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and be over a hundred thousand dollars depending on how durable you need it to be. According to http://atariage.com/forums/uploads/post-541-1089225312.jpg it's worth a quarter million dollars. [deleted] &gt;Most likely they made one form factor enclosure for multiple devices. One device requires an antenna and that extra room.

I live in Shenzhen where all this is made, know a lot of factory owners. The is absolutely correct. The antenna does not hurt, but it's not like they custom made it to deceive people. So you don't have to look for it on mobile:

Imagin Systems, a manufacturer of dental imaging equipment, has since purchased the molding plates for the Jaguar's casing as with minor modification they were found to be the right size for housing their HotRod camera.[22] The game cartridge molds were reused to create an optional memory expansion card.[23]

In 2015, the molds for the console and cartridges were purchased from Imagin Systems by Mike Kennedy, owner of the Game Gavel video game auction website and Retro Magazine, a Kickstarter funded print
and digital retro video game magazine, to manufacture shells for a brand new, Kickstarter funded, cartridge-based video game console, called the Retro VGS (Retro Video Game System). The purchase of the molds from Imagin Systems was far cheaper than designing and manufacturing entirely new molds, and Kennedy described their acquisition as "the entire reason [the Retro VGS] is possible". They probably already bought the plastic mold, which is surprisingly expensive, and it's cheaper to use more plastic than to requisition a new mold. I blame the media and their unrealistic standards for what Bluetooth dongles should look like.  I can only imagine someone getting bad signal, twisting the antenna around a bit, and feel like the signal improved. Hehe  "Mom, trust me, fiddling with it doesn't do anything. It's just a piece of plastic."

"Then why is it working again?!" "It's called a cognitive bias mom. We *know* twisting the plastic can't help, and we *know* people tend to believe that things they do are affecting the world even when they aren't, so it's pretty obvious that the feeling you have that it's working is just made up by your brain, and you should not act as if it were true"

"Well it works for me" But pressing b totally improves catch rate B didn't do shit. You had to hold down on the D Pad.  Everyone knows it's a and b simultaneously  no you had to alternate between a and b as the ball rocked are you serious? Is down on the d pad and B at the same time Wait, it doesn't?

My life is a lie...  Last night with my mother, I was trying to explain why I'd rather keep my sight than have my father back (high rates of depression in those that lose their sight) and I cited relevant literature. Her response was "yeah, but this is the real world." as if the literature doesn't reflect the real world. ...that sounds like a terrible conversation to have on so many levels... It really was, it wasn't a convo I exactly wanted to have... &gt;  I was trying to explain why I'd rather keep my sight than have my father back

I don't understand. It sounds like a "would you rather" style question. Would you rather keep your eyesight or be blind but your father comes back to life? The correct answer is to change the topic. I read it as her dad is dead, and she wouldn't give up her sight to bring him back.   [deleted] "Let the bears pay the bear tax, i pay the Homer tax" [deleted] Well anyway, I'm still outraged. " Book 'em Lou, One count being a bear, one count accessory to being a bear."  I'm 32 years old and I haven't watched the Simpsons in quite a few years. I just got this joke seeing it written out. The show continues to amaze! &gt; Let the bears pay the bear tax, i pay the Homer tax

I still don't get it. Homer Home Owner Home Owner Tax.

Homer thinks a Home Owner Tax is a Homer tax. This episode was actually on FXX tonight. Coincident?  no coincident, illermanaty Don't poke fun! Coincident is a perfectly cromulent word! You need to embiggen your vocabulary! i embiggened your mom last night Er mahgawd  Yes. I want to buy your post. Not coincidence, synchronicity.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity Funny how "specious" in the time of Edward Gibbon meant "good as gold", as in "specie", and now it means the opposite. My MIL would tell me that when she unplugged the cable from the modem her laptop would say no ethernet connection, and despite multiple explanations she just couldn't understand why it did that and took it to best buy to have them look at it Had a coworker that was going to return a brand new laptop to Best Buy because it was broken. I told her to bring it with her to work the next day, and I'd take a look at it - if I couldn't fix it, she could take it back, no harm done.

She brings it in and plops it down. It's a pretty standard Dell, and I breathe a sigh it's not an HP (so I don't have to dodge their Idiot Guard settings).

The problem? "It won't open." Ok, sometimes people miss the latch. No biggie. I flip it around and open it no problem.

She is absolutely floored. Turns out, she was trying to open the hinge side, since the logo was right side up that way.

*She was going to return a laptop because she was opening it from the hinge side*.

**THE HINGE SIDE**. True fact: that person gets to cast a ballot for the President of the United States. True fact: that person is probably better than you at something. That may be true, but basic problem-solving is a skill that carries over to a great many things. Not being able to open a laptop showcases that they are probably terrible at a lot of other things as well.  Everyone has their blind spots. Some people's blind spots are hinges. "Hinge" gets stranger the more you say it. You think you're clever, but anyone born since the invention of the door should have the knowledge to open that. If you can't, you're probably stupid. This isn't a tech blind spot. I got sent out on an on-site warranty service call because "the logo on the back of my laptop is upside down". I mean, at least he figured out how to open it, but thought it was upside down until I showed him that it was designed to be right-side up when looked at from the back.

I had another call to replace a "bad optical drive" on a mini-tower. Walked in, opened the drive, pulled the computer out (it was in a cabinet under a cash register running POS) and flipped it 180 degrees. wasted 2 years of my life at geek squad. can confirm, almost all customers were like your MIL If people are able to figure things out themselves, they wouldn't go to Geek Squad.

I remember buying a laptop from Best Buy a few years ago and for an extra 50 bucks you could have them "Set up your computer and make sure everything was installed properly."  I was thinking "Who the fuck needs someone to do that for them?  It basically does it itself when you turn it on!"

Then I bought my grandmother an iPad and she needed my help setting it up.  I realized them why someone would pay 50 bucks to have something pre-setup.... they straight just don't know. "It says 'Click next to continue,' what should I do now?" Meanwhile, any message box with actual error info will be dismissed without looking at it, or mentioning it [This is what a typical computer interface looks like to your parents.](https://youtu.be/VkgdWTEwf5c)

 yeah people paid 50 bucks for that pre setup bullshit. its just a lot of button clicking and thats it. if people would stop being so fucking dense and learn to read then they wouldnt need to waste $50 but no.... I sense some tech resentment here, are you okay bro? now that i dont have to deal with idiots all day, yes. i still greatly enjoy building my own computers and improving them/etc. just not...the customer service side. Yeah. My mom(51) is a Master in Chemistry (MS) and for some reason she can't figure out basic computer/cellphone stuff. The thing is that she gets all worked up and when I try to teach her I feel like she doesn't even try to understand.  same thing with my dad. hes a brilliant father and brilliant with cars but he is computer retarded and i dont think he really absorbs anything i tell him. its alright really, i love him and i dont care. &lt;3 My dad is in his mid 60s but he's an electrical engineer. Even into my late teens *I* would be the one going to *him* for major computer issues.

My mom can use computers decently but never has gotten too savvy with them. But since dad is the computer expert she just calls him over if something is wrong :D /r/talesfromtechsupport I'm gonna get the one with the antenna, I'm sure it'll have better range Very effective marketing. Now I kind of want to break open my wifi dongle to see if the external antenna does anything or not. Best way to find out is to break them off.

That way you know they don't do anything.

Anymore. I'll settle for simply finding out if it unscrews and has a wire inside it, thanks. Sissy.  It's The Antenna Effect. It's like The Placebo Effect but for electronics. We'll call it the Placebo Effect! I like it!  I feel better already. I'm sober enough to drive after reading that. Its working already! Body gives off a small magnetic field. Putting your hand near the device will change how radio signals are being received and transmitted. Overheard at the TV plant, 1949:

ftfy ;) Growing up, my dad had this really shitty VHS player that always got really staticky every minute or so. He was completely convinced that whenever he pressed the down button on the directional pad on the remote, it would fix it.  I like my bluetooth that only sticks out a millimeter from the port. And that's only there so that you can pull it out. Are all the electronics in the USB connector bit then? [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/eCIs6wC.png) a look at one taken apart. I would not have guessed there'd be a dime in there Some come with fake antennas, some with dimes. [You never know what you might find inside!](http://www.imgur.com/gallery/sneoW)  I've seen em even more compact than that. I once broke the end of one of those logitech wireless mouse adapters and it still worked. The little chip was obviously snapped on the end, but amazingly that mouse still worked great. After 6 months it stopped working though, but I thought that was pretty neat.  And I'm pretty sure it was 3 mm shorter than the one in the picture. Lol I have this exact same thing right now. The cover broke off and now It's just a tiny little chip that actually still works Same. I super glued it back on and it's better. A- recommended if you care Bluetooth chips have gotten extremely small, thanks in part needing them small enough so they can fit more stuff into phones.  [I think he was just joking?](http://192.185.236.25/ebay/images/BTA33101.jpg) There is a lot of traffic in that circuit.  Look at all those cars on the twisty road. That's the antenna. How do cars drive on an antenna? Very carefully. Just because one thing uses the extra space doesn't mean they all do. Plenty don't use it. I'm not a clever man. Could easily fit in there, there's a lot of useless plastic in the USB connector. [deleted] Interesting, I opened up [mine](http://imgur.com/oPxcJlm) to see if it was the same. Perhaps they updated the tech without changing the case.   Maybe OP's dongle is a knock-off of yours? Or, considering the unnecessary complicatedness of yours, a knock-forward? It's not really unnecessary -- you can't get a reliable 100m range without an antenna.  The PCB printed antenna is no problem for *transmission* because you can just step up the voltage until it radiates OK, but the *reception* still benefits from a proper quarter-wave antenna. I think the real question is why are you and OP still using Bluetooth 1? That's Class 1, not the Bluetooth version. The class represents the range. Class 1=100m, 2=10m, 3=1m. This particular dongle is likely either v2 or v2.1. Wait, 100 meters? Really? TIL there are different levels of Bluetooth. Newest is 4.0, 3.0 is still modern-ish though. 1.0 is apparently from 1999.  The class is not the same as the version. The class specifies the power output of the transmitter, with [Class 1 being the highest power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Uses). &gt; Newest is 4.0

actually newer phones have 4.1

4.2 is coming out later this year 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Bluetooth_v4.2

 Those are class 1, not version 1

http://bluetoothinsight.blogspot.com/2008/01/bluetooth-power-classes.html?m=1 I design distributed antenna systems to boost cell phone signal inside buildings. For a typical office, we will put one white cone antenna poking down out of the ceiling about every 5-10ksqft. Once in a high rise building, up on the floor with all the executives, we needed a very strong system and ended up with an antenna in just about every other office.

Well after the system went live, this one executive that happen to have an office between two other offices with antennas complained that his service was still poor. We went and tested the signal, it was perfectly fine, 5 bars, no dropped calls, etc. 

The guy still complained that he was having issues, and this guy wanted something done! We said ok, we will fix him up after hours. So we sent down a tech and had him put an antenna in the ceiling, but not actually hook it up to the distribution system, since that would require probably $500 in parts and testing vs a $50 antenna. 


Lo and behold he called the next morning to tell us everything was working fantastic and we never heard from him again!

A little perception can go a long ways.

For those wondering, the antennas look like this:
http://i.imgur.com/8LCgV3o.jpg
 I feel like you could have saved $5 and just taped a plastic cup to the ceiling.Edit: I don't endorse artisan plastic cups, that was a typo. So a $45 plastic cup? So that's what those are.  I had something similar happen. Someone had a faulty keyboard, so we went and got him another one. He was upset that we didn't get him a new keyboard, despite the fact that it was new, all our spares were new since we really had many new keyboards and nothing to do with them.

So my boss just told me to put one of those keyboard in a box and unbox it in front of him so that he will believe me that it is new. Worked quite well. Whenever we cycle a laptop that is under 6 months it always gets re packed in a manufacturers box and unpacked at the employees desk. 
It gains us a considerable extra level of customer satisfaction. 

The box goes back to a corner for reuse with the next install.   I love this stuff, it's the kind of thing that a future tech will examine and say "Wtf? This isn't connected to anything". I think this would sell quite well to an older crowd. They understand antennas and would trust something with one more than something without. It does make sense, it would help them to understand it's a wireless doo hickey of some sort. And even the elderly know they need wireless doo hickeys these days. In their day a "doo hickey" was something for people with loose morals and a poop fetish. Well, that got weird fast.  TIL my parents are doo hickeys. doo hickey  I do hickey with your grandmother.  OH SHIT YOU SURE BURNED HIM! MAN! I find this post quite amusing, because as bluetooth is a UHF radio signal (not new tech at all) it's more likely that the "older crowd" mentioned by OC who grew up during the dawn of the radio and wireless age would have far more of an idea about how it worked than the current generation who just take "syncing" for granted. Synching for granted?  Half the time I can't even connect, much less have the link recognized and something useful done.  Bluetooth is suck. It's amazing how perfect it can be in one application, and wonky in another.  Take every modern console and their wireless Bluetooth controllers. You think this is targeted at an older crows but really 99% of people would buy the product with an external "antenna" over the one without. The average RC enthusiast - *let alone the average consumer* - doesn't understand antennas. Old people don't have a monopoly on stupid. I would rather trust a router with antennas than one without. My modem now has no antennas and it has worse reception than the router at my parents house that has 4 of them.

I think the apppearance of the product speaks for it's performance. 

Conclusion: Almost always trust antennas! And thats the reason my car, router, cpu are all painted red &gt; Old people don't have a monopoly on stupid.

This is a really poor way to look at things. Ignorance != stupidity. Do *you* know exactly how an antenna works beyond "it's a wire that picks up radio waves"? And assuming that you do, if you're smart (which you've implied that you are), then you would know that there are just about an infinite number of things on this planet that many people would probably consider extremely simple that are currently beyond you, just because you haven't previously experienced them or invested the time to understand them. 

Just because someone doesn't know how an antenna works doesn't mean they're stupid.  That's because if that antenna was actually connected it would have better range. Assuming the other device it was pairing with also had an external antenna. Are you sure you understand antennas? Lol, have you seen SSDs?

http://www.custompcreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/samsung-840-evo-ssd-250gb-750gb-custom-pc-review-13.jpg

That's a 250GB drive.

edit:

this comment should have been a reply for this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/3851hu/this_bluetooth_dongle_has_a_fake_antenna/crsc77b guess I messed up. Oh well. I'm not a computer guy, but might that have to do with the standard size fitments of hard drives in computer cases? I.E. this might not attach properly inside a computer if it was smaller than standard size. Yep exactly this. We have ports now that support way smaller PCBs directly on the motherboard, the M.2-standard:

http://www.ocinside.de/media/uploads/plextor_m6e_256gb_m2_ssd_1.jpg

Depending on the capacity those drives can be longer or shorter, in total there are three sizes for this port. Standards are a MASSIVE part of computer tech, without them things would be much different. It makes more sense to build something to spec than to try to start a new standard. So in this case they use a little excess molded plastic, so what. It fits the standard dimensions which means more people can use it. There's a notable amount of 'empty' space in computers that most people have no idea is there. I mean, I guess I'm kind of an old guy, but I'm in IT and it's perfectly logical to assume that something with a functional antenna will get a better range than something without an antenna. Don't get me wrong, they've done wonders getting surprising performance out of small, integrated antennas, but that hasn't changed the laws of physics. 

If I were just looking for something to use a mouse or headset sitting at the computer I'd look for something as small as possible. Absent other information though (such as the Bluetooth class and reviews) I'd definitely be more inclined to guess the larger one with the antenna would have better range.  "Old people understands antennas." -Youth Logic It's not wrong though.


When you have lived in a time when tech transitioned from cords to wireless via antennas, and all the wireless tech you have interacted with has had antennas, you become conditioned to couple *wireless* with *antennas* A while ago, I noticed my father didn't understand *at all* how WiFi worked and no matter how hard I tried to explain, for him the whole concept was pretty much magic. 

Eventually I asked him if he understood how over the air TV worked to which he replied that a big ass antenna would send the signal over the air, and the TV's antenna would pick it up. Well, that's pretty much it, so he *did* understand wireless after all. I just told him the router had a smaller "big ass antenna" in it, and his laptop had another one hidden behind the screen, but since things were closer together the laptop's antenna could also send  signal back to communicate what it wanted to receive next. 

That made sense to him right away; he promptly asked if cellphones had antennas inside them too and worked the same way. Apparently cellphones with external antennas also made sense to him, he just didn't understand current ones that have no visible antenna. 

&amp;nbsp; 

I'd be lying if I said I understood the "disconnect" in his reasoning between external and internal antennas, but that's when I realised many old people accept that those big wire thingies can send and pick up signals, but if no such apparatus is visible then the device probably operates based on black magic.  Placebo effect In case anyone was interested I highlighted the actual antenna

http://i.imgur.com/L3L3Txj.jpg I have no idea how this stuff works. How is it that little strip able to work as an antenna? The same way any antenna works. All you need is a length of conducting material that doesn't terminate on one end, where the length is related to the wavelength of the frequency being transmitted.

Think of a tuning fork- when you strike it, it rings at a certain tone. If you change the size of the fork ends, the tone will change. It's the same with antennas- if you change the length, the resonant frequency changes, ergo you get a better transmission at that frequency.


Since the frequency being transmitted is really high (blutooth is 2.4 ghz) the 1:1 antenna length would normally be 12.5cm. I'm guessig this is a 1/4 length antenna (which is pretty common) putting this at ~31mm long. You also need to factor in the reduced speed of light through copper (or rather, EM waves(, which sits at about 22cm /bs, or about .75c.  That leaves you with 1/4 wavelength being close to 2.5cm. Engineer here.  It runs on magic. Magician here, it runs on engineers [Engine here, I run on beer.](http://i.imgur.com/dJiZqlS.jpg) And dank memes. Radio frequencies (f), wavelengths (lambda, but let's say l) and their speed (speed of light, 3 * 10^8 m/s, or c) has this link:

f = c/l

Bluetooth has a frequency of ~2400MHz, so the wavelength is 3 * 10^8 m/s / 2.4 * 10^9 Hz = 0.125 meters. If you're American, that's 4.921 inches.
The antenna must be relative to that length in size, such as 1/4th, which means that antenna/strip is around 1.23 inches in length. Anything conductive can be used as an antenna, and that strip of copper on the board is quite sufficient for the task.

Edit: I can see /u/zoomdaddy beat me to it. Oh well. why pay somone to design a new enclosure and have new molds made  if you can just fit the dongle into an enclosure already being produced, perhaps for a wifi adapter. thats my explanation anyway. Hard (non-aluminum) tooling is usually only good for about 250-500k uses. If they only made a quantity less than this and repurposed the tool someone severely fucked up the forecasting. That mold likely cost 100-300k$ USD and had to be financed and amortized against whatever product were sold.  I think this is an aesthetic to meet customer expectations. (Source; former product manager)  An spi class 101 tool should be good for millions of cycles if maintained properly for most resins. (Never mind if you're using glass reinforced resin)

Source: consumables engineer- my company shipped ~20 million devices last year, each with 7 injection molded parts.  What about the cost? Was /u/xrandx accurate on that point? Because 100k-300k sounds pretty expensive when I look at all the cheap crap I can buy from China. I know some things they can probably sell millions of, sure. But there's a lot of really obscure stuff too. Stuff I doubt they could even sell half a million of. Then again, maybe I'm wrong on that front... An American built high end, high cavitation mold can run into the 100k's easily if there are complex parting lines, lots of slides or lifters, automation, hot runner, etc. 

But it should last millions of cycles. 

We had a 4-up straight pull polycarbonate mold on an 80 ton press go 30 million cycles. 

Pro-tip: give your vendor incentive to maintain your molds. This is most likely the case - adding an antennae would be an extra expense unless it was already made for other devices Except if this actually were a shell for a device that uses an antenna, then it wouldn't have a sham antenna part. maybe it connects via bluetooth yo dawg... I met a Building Engineer that put fake thermostats all around his building. Most of the ladies that worked there thought he was a god. It's a wireless antenna.  [I think you are all missing the manufacturer's noble intention here.](http://i.imgur.com/QnDqqBR.jpg) dat edited shadow I worry sometimes that everything in our world is like this; placebos to make us feel like we're doing something and have some kind of control, but behind the curtains we're just stupid apes being watched over by alien scientists. The actual antenna is the copper trace on the right side of the circuit board.  Psychology! The feeling of control can be a great selling point. Similar story to those Street crossing points that have buttons which don't actually function, it's totally automatic but the button is there purely to make you feel in control.  I've gotten burned too many times thinking I'm clever and avoiding random people's germs by not touching the button only to have to wait until the light cycles through again.

Always push the button. Yeah, there may be places where it does nothing, but usually it turns the walk signal on (although you can ignore this if you just pay attention to the traffic lights), and especially in desolate intersections it can change the lights altogether. If it's desolate, just live a little and walk toward the orange hand. I'm sure there are some crosswalks where the pedestrians will get a turn even if nobody pushes the button, but all of the crosswalk buttons in my area are functional.  The crosswalks near me are set up where if someone hits the button all of the traffic light turn red and the walk sign lights up...at the end of the traffic cycle.  So sometimes you have to wait a few minutes after pushing the button, but if nobody hits the button the walk sign never turns green, it just kerp cycling the lights for the cars. /r/mildlyinfuriating   What if it's made with that so at a glance, or whatever, there's no confusing it as a thumb drive or accidentally unplugging it.  What if it is connected via Bluetooth to the antenna?

When I finally opened it up, there were no antennas in it.

None. There were spots on the PCB (even though it was not a genuine PCB, either) that said "ANT-wifi", and "ANT-3g" and such, and in the *real* Note, the antennas are built into the rear cover and have landing contacts onto the PCB.

I could stand next to my wifi access point, and get only one or two bars of wifi signal. If you ever even touched the phone, the cell signal would entirely drop away.

Of course, the vendor gave me a crazy runaround on the issue. "This other custom in Ohio doesn't have this problem". Had me take pictures of where there are no antennas. Had me download an app to measure the RSSI of the wifi and 3g and stuff. He even said that I should order a real Note back and install that, and he's compensate me for it, which he only did 90% of the cost. And after weeks of back and forth, and me dumping 10-12 hours down this thing, he finally said he'd give me a refund, but I had to pay for return shipping. And even when it got there, he claimed I didn't include the charger, and declined another $15 from the refund.

I do have the pictures somewhere ... I should find them and post them to mildlyinteresting. But it makes you feel better.... Haha dongle  but its not on the box. My customers like to see the guarentee because it makes them feel good when they sleep at night.

antenne makes ya feel good. Hey, I'll tell you what. You can get a good look at a butcher's ass by sticking your head up there. But, wouldn't you rather to take his word for it? Salesguy "How can we sell this without an antenna?!??!"

Engineering Manager "just give him a damn antenna"

Engineer "Here's your 'antenna'" placebo effect probably a generic form factor This reminds me of the old days where I felt like a badass pulling out the retractable antenna on my cell.  That's a real antenna with a fake Bluetooth dongle. The antenna and device communicates via bluetooth, duh! i believe it was most likely a mid-run change for reasons such as cost, durability, platform alignment, etc. 

when a product is final, it likely must remain completely backward compatible in appearance, form, and function when making mid-run changes. 

things that may have been impacted had the "antenna" been omitted:

*    packaging

*   instruction manual

*    marketing material 

*  customer support

*  vendor contracts


*  shipping weight 

 Retooling the molding would have been more expensive then the cost of the extra plastic. So they just kept the molding from a previous model. Reminds me of the story of the magic switch:

http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/magic-story.html "Cutting this sticker will void antenna warranty" That's known as a "placebo antenna" in the biz. Am I the only one seeing a video of a drunk guy at an atm  It's not fake, it's telekinetic. It's possibly a marketing move. 
*It has an external antenna so it must have better range.* Maybe it's connected via Bluetooth? Did you also know that the noise that cash machines make is from a speaker?
It's to make people think that it's doing something important.
 Haha.  Dongle! [You lie!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=qgce06Yw2ro#t=13) A Digital Placebo. "Look our product has an antenna" *more profit here we come* "Oh.. you expected it to work?" Can we talk about the insane cost of a sandwich board?  It includes the printing of the two 2'x3' as well. Large-scale, commercial, weather-resistant, color printing is always expensive.

edit: yeah yeah, I realize now that the included two prints are for the A-frame itself. I thought that thing was smaller than 2'x3' at a glance. Fixed. It's still obviously not a rip off you're familiar with the industry. I'm in the wrong business.  Username relevant Have you seen how much jockeys get paid?  Not the desk kind Unless Desk is the name of the horse Or if its mini horses on a mini race course on a desk...incredibly skilled, to be able to stay on the tabletop without falling off...falling off to their doom all with a jockey riding them Normal sized jockey. We don't wanna make this too easy. They're usually little fellas anyway.  U might say duck-sized horse  U can't say anything, it's a letter. No, the name of the horse is Another_Desk Haha! What's a horse? But if it is, he's only *another* Desk jockey.

They're splitting that job up. No no, everyone's confused. The name of the horse is Another Desk. Not really the disc kind, either. plus disc ones get a lot of hassle too.

"Hey DJ play my favourite song!" says a twerking underage drunk person.

"Sorry, preset playlist, kind of configured it to be optimal for the best musical tone shift" the DJ replied.

Twerking person continues to complain and moan until they get their way.

Or so I believe anyhow. The few times I've been in nightclubs where such things happened usually ended with me carrying out my wasted friends annoyed at them making themselves stupidly vulnerable and stupidly stupid jerkasses to the staff.  Relevant: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUvhAPs38RA Sure, people asking for songs can be annoying for the DJ, but having a preset playlist is almost a guarantee the DJ is Doing It Wrong. *only having a preset playlist. Most DJs prepare for the night, and adjust with the mood of the crowd as the set goes on So, he'd be completely useless, just a human volume control? 90% of a DJ's work is done before the event, but he only gets *paid* for the other 10. I'd pay good money to see guys race desks instead of horses. Sign guy here. Shit like this is high cost low gain. High quantity Prints are where the money is at. Of course you're the sign guy! Your big red lips and blond hair are all over I-94! ...and on the side of every stinking bus in the city! I'm in this business. It costs us a lot too. Equipment is expensive, maintenance technicians cost money too. There's a good reason people don't have plotters and a press in their den or whatever. It'd probably help the cost of there weren't 4+ signs on one side of the A frame board... oh you I used to sell ice cream at city tourist attraction and make between 1 and 2 grand on a busy day, just on ice cream. lies make baby jesus cry. Well if thats the case he'll be sleeping soundly tonight then. Really? No one lied today? We did it! This is actually very plausible. Set up on a hot day with lots of rich tourist families passing by and the kids cry for ice cream all the time. Also in the business, those signicades aren't cheap. I direct print coroplast panels and they run ~$30 each as well. This isn't an awful price. It's high, but not terrible. Big printers are expensive, and so is renting commercial space big enough to house a big printer. how many do you think you could sell per week? The margins are OK, but the materials and printers are expensive.  Weather resistant my ass, look at the bottom of OP's.  Well it's a colored sign, so it knew to stop resisting.  If it's still standing, it's still resisting.
