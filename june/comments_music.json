Basically how many times the analogue signal can be sliced up per second. So, the idea here is to record as much data as possible for the greatest quality. **So higher sample rate = higher quality**. Quality here meaning closer to the original analogue signal.\n\nNote: There are some valid arguments why this is not necessarily the case for best quality (analogue vs digital etc), but for what we are talking about this can be ignored.\n\n**Bit depth** is (for each signal wave) how accurately the amplitude is measured. This can be thought of like vertical slices of the sound, how many different volume slices can be recorded per sample (zero to 8 or zero to 8 million). **So again, more bit depth = higher quality**. \n\nImagine a singer making a note from complete silence rising up to 70 decibels. If you only had 4 levels of volume, it would be the same note at 0, then say 50dB, then 67dB, then 70dB. Which may be very unorganic. Change those 4 values to a few thousand, and the dynamic range is much smoother and closer to what you hear normally.\n\n**Bit rate** is the compression of the audio recorded using the two above things (sample rate and bit depth). Generally the recording quality used is from CDs [LPCM ~ 1,411.2 kbit/s] to HD/DVD [PPCM ~ 18 Mbit/s] so anything less than the recording format means it will be compressed. Either the compression is done along the vertical axis (bit depth) or the horizontal axis (sample rate), mainly I think it is the bit depth.\n\nIf you imagine a vertical axis going from 0Hz to 20KHz (human ear frequency range limits) plus 0dB to ~90dB (human music volume limits) then this sort of represents the data space the audio fits into. If a 50dB note of 10kHz is only playing in one sample, then 40dB space and 10kHz frequency space is not being used (or empty data is being transmitted). This is where the compression space is found. [Here is an example](http://imgur.com/H7XiB5c). \n\nYou may also now realise why a heavily compressed song (like a radio rap track) sounds better in low bit rates that a song with heavier dynamics (like an acoustic orchestral track). Because there is less free empty data space in the acoustic track because it needs to store a larger dynamic range (the gaps between the loudest and softest noises is bigger). \n\nSo, **bit rate = closer to the original recording**. Is this better? Probably, but it only really matters if the track you like is very dynamic, as the higher bit rate (in these fairly high bit rates, like not 4 or 8) basically just accommodates the dynamic range factor. \n\nOr ELI5: Loud heavily compressed tracks (when recorded) will not really benefit from having an increased dynamic range capability (higher bit rate). Quieter more dynamic tracks will.\n \n___\nTL;DR: 320", "gilded": 0, "score": 36, "created": 1433315631.0},{"body": "Your explanation of bit depth is misleading, if I understand the principles correctly myself, in that a bit depth of 4 wouldn't give 4 distinct vertical slices, but rather 4 inputs into a function which translates the digital data to an analogue wave with the DAC, still producing an analogue wave but one with a higher noise floor (hiss) the fewer bits are used.  It doesn't create a \"stepped\" wave with separate heights, but with more bit depth the analogue wave output will more closely represent the original sound wave.\n\nHere's a [better explanation](http://www.sonicscoop.com/2013/08/29/why-almost-everything-you-thought-you-knew-about-bit-depth-is-probably-wrong/#sthash.YB9hBirv.dpbs).", "gilded": 0, "score": 11, "created": 1433326314.0},{"body": "Yes exactly.

Kendrick is an incredible lyricist, and GKMC is so popular because he makes the listener visualize and feel his story of adolescence in Compton, California.\n\nIt covers many social and personal issues such as drugs/alcohol, peer pressure, lust, and most notably - gang violence. The stories are told in little vignettes, but they all connect seamlessly to paint a picture of the troubled upbringing Kendrick had. Since you are 43, you probably have heard of 2Pac before, the revolutionary conscious rapper ~~from Compton~~ in south central LA who wanted to help his community and provide a better life for the oppressed in America. Kendrick takes more inspiration from 2Pac than almost anyone else, and this social consciousness shows in his music.\n\nNow sonically, the album is great. The production on each song sets the mood for the scene that is about to unfold, but each song's sound is unique. Some argue about certain songs belonging in there, but I believe each song has its place and helps make the movie. My favorite would be **Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst.** Lots of people think that Hip Hop is about money, drugs, and bitches, but this song is the antithesis of all of that. I don't want to describe it, I just want you to hear it for yourself. If you are willing to listen to the whole album, great. If not, great. You should get a taste of the best that Hip Hop can offer. The man has a God-given gift for storytelling and his artwork is beautiful.\n\nEdit: HUGE shout outs to **To Pimp a Butterfly** and **Section.80**, definitely listen to those too.

And the media is reveling in laughing at every misstep and misfortune and it's just compounding the problem.    The thing that annoys me most about Tidal, also annoys me about Spotify and every other streaming and mp3 download service; bad tags.\n\nThere's too much focus in the app on music vids, especially considering the fact they don't have many music vids up anyways worth watching.  If they had Youtube's collection of vids, I think it'd be notable to put it front and center, but they don't.   Great concept to work vids in though.\n\nTidal X is a great idea (live concerts), Tidal Discovery (for up and comers), and integrating the ability to buy tickets and band merch in the app is a stellar idea too.\n\nAll in all - I have a feeling the app will get a lot better as time goes on and doesn't really have much to apologize for.  One of the BIG things though.. is from the get go they tried to appeal to the audiophile market, and while audiophiles have some legit complaints (lots of albums are crappy remasters, for instance), you're never going to please that crowd.   and if you do, it'll only be temporarily.   But i do appreciate the fact that SOMEONE out there cares about uncompressed audio.  The only stores that do are 7digital and Bandcamp so it's nice to see another player in that regard.\n\nTidal fucked up their PR by making it \"feel bad for the millionaires\" when selling the fact that they were trying to pay out higher royalties to what they were  framing as \"artists\" but it goes to the label first who takes their cut and then passes on a pittance to bands and such.\n\nI have held the opinion that pirates make better customers than people who are looking to use streaming, not as a discovery medium or a radio replacement but as an ownership replacement.    At least pirates tend to purchase roughly 30% more music than non-pirates do on average - and bands get a bigger cut from a music purchase of an album more than they would streaming 1000 songs.   IMHO - this is driving the price of music - down to nothing.    And i think it's bullshit honestly.  Music has value and people deserve to be paid for it.  And not every type of music translates into a live show worth seeing.\n\nSo if i'm going to use a streaming platform - i want one  that's artist friendly as can be and while Tidal made it to be about Daft Punk and Madonna, overall their royalty rate does (so far) seem to be the highest.  It doesn't solve the label problem but it's something.\n\nHands down - i like Tidal.  It's got caching, a huge library of things, built in Last.fm support, flac options, spotify-like shareable playlists.    I don't get why people are hating on it honestly?\n\nPeople get all excited for one tech company after another, thinking they are \"solving problems\" of one industry after another - but all in all they're just adding another layer of bureaucratic, middle-man scum to the supply chain - who's driving the value of goods down to nothing while creating another player that needs to take a cut of an exponentially shrinking price.   \n\nIf something out there is artist owned, even by an establishment artist, who puts a good faith effort out there to be good to other artists, I'm all for it and they can have my money.   \n\nIf tech companies were somehow REPLACING labels, I might be more inclined to be for them.  But if streaming is the future - i'd like to see it, for whatever it's faults are, to be as artist friendly as possible.   \n\nGod knows Apple sure as fuck won't be. \n\nI'm never a fanboy of any company.

Most people havent bothered to look into Kanye's history or even his actual music. Kanye grew up in Chicago and was raised by his mother, who was probably the most important person in his life up until her death in 2007. Kanye dropped out of college at Chicago State University, where he majored in English, when he decided to pursue a music career. Kanye became a respected music producer, but had not put out any music of his own until he was involved in a near fatal car accident. The near death experience inspired him to release his first single, and then eventually his first album. Kanye's work has been praised for his soulful sound and commentary on racism. When Kanye's mom died, he remastered his sound for his most emotional work, 808s and Heartbreak. Kanye has continued to build his musical resume with praised works such as My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, which is considered by some to be the best hip hop album of the past 5 years. I have to strongly disagree with (name)'s statement that he hasn't done anything impressive since, given the fact that his last album Yeezus earned a whopping 9.5/10 on pitchfork and was backed by such powerful singles as Blood on the Leaves and Bound 2, not to mention the cultural impact Yeezus has had. Now, in regard to his egotism, most people will only really be able to name about two instances where Kanye acts like an \"idiot,\" when he interrupted Taylor Swift and nearly interrupted Beck. Neither of these events were entirely for his own gain, as they were both acts for Beyonce's sake and really, for the sake of artistry in general. Did he go about it in the best way? Yeah, maybe not. But these instances weren't egotistic displays of narcissism. Kanye interrupted both Taylor and Beck to protest the often criticized decision making process of award shows. It's also hard to call Kanye a total egotist where on numerous occasions he's given his own awards away to people he considered more deserving (Link: http://www.thefader.com/.../all-the-times-kanye-west-gave...). One could argue that the name \"Yeezus,\" where Kanye paints himself as a rap messiah is fairly egotistic, and hey, maybe, but it could just as easily be a joke on all the people who love to hate Kanye for being a jerk. To the people who complain that he lacks artistry, I encourage you to read the lyrics if not actually listen to \"Gorgeous\" (Link: http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kanyewest/gorgeous.html). Kanye comments in this song on the development of hip hop and the prevalence of racism in todays society. You could dismiss him as being \"vulgar,\" but give him a chance first. Hip hop isn't for everyone, but you never know whether or not it's for you until you try. 5 years ago, I never would've considered myself a Kanye fan or a hip hop fan in general, but when I heard all the hype surrounding Yeezus, I did what I urge you all to do, and took a chance with his music before I made assumptions about his character.", "gilded": 0, "score": 138, "created": 1434997289.0},{"body": "&gt; Neither of these events were entirely for his own gain, as they were both acts for Beyonce's sake and really, for the sake of artistry in general.

Harrison would be known and respected for organizing the Concert for Bangladesh, and known as a musician mostly for his *Cloud Nine* album (the one with *Got My Mind Set on You*) and as a frequent collaborator with Eric Clapton. Ringo would barely be known at all - and perhaps more for his work as an actor than as a musician.\n\nMcCartney, on the other hand, had a 10-year career with Wings, one of the most influential bands of the 1970s, releasing 9 top 10 albums (five reaching #1), 23 top 40 singles (6 reaching #1), and gaining 11 Grammy Award nominations including 5 wins.\n\nMcCartney has continued to release music, some chart-topping, some experimental, for the 35 years since Wings broke up.

I also have in my possession (still) every magazine and newspaper article that came out during that time period detailing the happenings of the grunge scene. Everything from Sassy to Rolling Stone to Time to Bitch to Guitar World. All of it. There are so many, they take up three giant rubbermaid tubs. I also wrote over 50 articles about the grunge scene. With that in mind: I'm stunned by the extent to which Courtney Love has been able to manipulate his biography, and the extent to which close personal friends of his like Buzz Osborne and Kim Gordon and Kathleen Hannah have been discredited as reliable sources. These are people who were around him all the time, who went on tour with him, who knew him before he was famous and maintained friendships with him afterwards. The Rome overdose was not reported as a suicide attempt after it happened; it wasn't even listed as a suicide attempt until Courtney Love started referencing it as such in interviews. Courtney Love had an affair with Billy Corgan that began before Kurt Cobain died. This was also well documented. The heroin use during Courtney's pregnancy was presented in Montage of Heck almost like it was a conspiracy theory to make their lives worse, when in actuality it was more than just a rumor. Do you know how hard it is to lose custody of a child, especially when you have the money for lawyers? It's really hard. There was plenty of evidence against them. Everyone around Kurt hated Courtney Love, and it wasn't because she had been tagged as some kind of Yoko Ono, it was because she was a vampire sucking him dry and seeking to alienate him from every friend he had. She hated Kim Gordon because of their mother/son friendship, and inexplicably punched Kathleen Hannah in the face by means of introduction during a Lollapalooza tour. Kathleen Hannah, for those who don't know, is the person who spray painted \"Kurt smells like Teen Spirit!\" which then inspired the title of the song. Kurt Cobain was notoriously snarky; watch some of his MTV interviews during that time period; Ricky Rachtman in particular always looks like he's about to cry. He had a wicked, dead-pan sense of humor, that a lot of people considered obnoxious, pretentious, and condescending. There was no \"two years off\"; Nirvana was only famous for about four years, and in that time frame they released five albums, with all but Insecticide reviewed positively. They toured regularly, and sometimes performed like shit. They recorded one of the most famous MTV Unplugged sessions ever. Immediately after Kurt's death Hole released Live Through This, which is a great album that many people consider to have been written by Kurt Cobain. It seems just as likely that Courtney Love could have been inspired by virtue of being around him, but the fact remains that she hasn't released anything that's not shitty since then. Since everyone in the grunge scene was such a tightly knit circle, it's hard to take any documentary about him seriously if it does not include interviews with those friends. Like a lot of kids from that era, Kurt Cobain was doped up on ritalin by a mother who took Oprah too seriously: that's a big part of why so many thought he spoke for them. It's hard to take his mother seriously as an interview subject, knowing that her reported role in his life in later years was relatively minor  -- at least according to the info I've gathered.
