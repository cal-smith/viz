Your hospital system is Seattle Grace. These two parties negotiate rates for individual procedures. Every medical procedure is coded as a numeric **procedure code**. There are thousands of procedure codes. The collection of procedure codes and prices are a fee schedule.\n\nFor example, code 47.01 represents a laparoscopic appendectomy. Acme Insurance agrees to pay Seattle Grace up to $5,000 for this procedure if a patient sees them.\n\nYour appendix hurts like a little bitch. You are covered by Acme Insurance and you go to Seattle Grace for a laparoscopic appendectomy. You are saved from mortal danger and you have minimal scarring.\n\nTime to settle up. **As a courtesy** and to avoid issuing a refund later, Seattle Grace bills Acme Insurance before you. Seattle Grace can bill for any amount on this procedure, but if it is over the contract rate, it will be discounted. Since you are covered by Acme Insurance, the amount eligible for payment is **the lesser of the billed amount and the contract rate**. The system just does this:\n\n    eligible amount = min(billed amount, contract rate)\nThe \"discount\" is the difference of the billed amount and the eligible amount:\n\n    discount = eligible amount - billed amount\nThe \"discount\" is **not** a percentage of the billed amount.\n\nFor example, Seattle Grace bills $30,000.\n\n    Eligible amount = min($30,000, $5,000) = $5,000\n    Discount = $30,000 - $5,000 = $25,000\n\nAnother example, Seattle Grace bills $30.\n\n    Eligible amount = min($30, $5,000) = $30\n    Discount = $30 - $30 = $0\n\nSeattle Grace wants the most money it can possibly get. The easiest way to do this is to bill for an amount that is so high that it will be well above each insurance company rate for the foreseeable future. In the second example, Seattle Grace could have received an additional $4,970, but they did not bill that much.\n\nOnce the eligible amount is determined, then Acme Insurance runs this through your benefits to see how much they will pay Seattle Grace. The difference goes to you.\n\nIf you don't have insurance, there is no negotiated rate in place, so you receive the outrageous price. Sometimes Seattle Grace will be benevolent and adjust for this with a cash price.\n\nBoth Acme Insurance and Seattle Grace have access to their fee schedule. Theoretically, if you give a procedure code to either of them, they could tell you the price. Your insurance company probably has a feature on their website where you can estimate the costs by selecting a procedure and provider.\n\nPersonally, I hate this system.

Two factors are in play here: (1) the arms race between hospitals/providers and insurers/Medicare/Medicaid and (2) lawsuits.\n\nSay you're an indigent wage laborer with no insurance and no assets.  You're on the way to your minimum wage job and you get hit on the highway.  You're going to need to go to the E/R just like someone who has insurance.  At the E/R you are just like any other patient in one important respect: you can sue a hospital or doctor who fails to provide you with adequate care *even if you have no assets and no insurance.*\n\nThe hospital, fearful of lawsuits, is going to go ahead and give you an MRI, a series of x-rays, maybe a CT scan, to rule out spinal cord injury or broken bones.  If you happen to have a herniated disk in your back or actual broken bones, the hospital will offer you care, possibly including fixation surgeries, in order to avoid any malpractice claims. \n\nNow in the scenario above, you can't pay the hospital back, but there's a good chance you'll have a lawsuit against the person who hit you.  The hospital knows that if you ever get paid on that suit, it would have to pursue collections actions against you for your outstanding bills owed to them.  In any collections action they are going to incur costs and likely settle the claim for less than the outstanding bill.  What actually ends up happening most of the time is that the plaintiff's lawyer for the injured person clears medical bills and liens by settling out with the providers, *for a discount* out of the settlement funds paid by the at-fault party's insurance company.\n\nHospitals thus know that they are going to get whacked on their bill no matter what: either the indigent person stiffs them outright, or the bill gets paid at a discount settlement via a collections action, or the bill gets paid again at a discount out of the proceeds of any potential settlement.  For every ten indigents to whom the hospitals provide care, the hospital might recover payment (usually via the third option above) one time.  They are typically not allowed (by law) to deny care to people who walk in, although they might try to ship them off somewhere else.  Ultimately someone is going to provide that care.\n\nThis is simple math.  If you only get paid one out of ten times, functionally, then you need to charge 10X the normal rate in order to break even.  You need to charge ALL TEN people 10X the normal rate, because you're only going to get paid once, and you need that one payment to make up for all the other non-payors.\n\nAll of this adds up to a great argument for some kind of blanket health insurance.  I don't care if it's government supplied, mandated through private insurers (which is Obamacare), or some kind of hybrid.  As long as every person who walks through the doors of the E/R has some financial backing and means to pay, then the hospitals can stop playing this shell game and begin to charge each individual 100% of what they owe instead of 1000%.\n\nNow that we are making baby steps towards universal insurance coverage, the next step is to begin putting pressure on the hospitals to change their billing systems to reflect their actual payment rates.  Over time, in theory, we should see charges begin to drop as the rate of recovery for outstanding bills improves as more and more people are covered by some form of insurance.  There are a lot of ways to bring that pressure (including, in my profession, allowing defense lawyers to discuss insurance coverage and fair market value with juries, which is currently outlawed by something called the collateral source rule in many jurisdictions, thereby bringing down overall lawsuit values and relieving runaway verdict pressures on the insurance system).\n\nTl;dr: 1000% charges are a symptom of hospitals getting paid 1 time out of 10 and the solution to this shell game is some form of universal insurance coverage.", "gilded": 0, "score": 200, "created": 1433866793.0},{"body": "Maryland solved this problem very well through their hospital rate regulation system.\n\nAll hospital services have their prices set by the State, and the State controls how much profit each hospital is allowed to earn.

Interestingly, many of these studies found *no significant difference* between the incidence/persistence of post-operative cognitive dysfunction over a MONTH after surgery despite the type of anesthesia received!  Now, without getting too technical, this opens our eyes to another question: is it possible that general anesthesia may not be the real culprit here?  Why would patients who had entire surgeries done under spinal anesthesia, who were completely awake and communicative throughout the entire operation and received none of the medications (NO halogenated, volatile anesthetic gases) associated with general anesthesia, exhibit post-operative cognitive dysfunction?  Could it be that the neurohormonal, inflammatory, and physical stressors of surgery themselves are causing a cascade of events that lead to these neurological problems down the road?\n\nSimilarly, in these pediatric patients, could that same neurohormonal milieu, *a direct result of surgery*, be partly to blame for the problems being observed in the developing, admittedly fragile brain?\n\nI don't know.

As many of you stated: It is already known that birds navigate with a cryptochrome (a protein in the eye) and their tip (its ferromagnetic) and the mechanism behind it is also known. The mechanism is called the \"radical pair mechanism\" (RPM) and it involves a photochemical triggered reaction that creates radical pairs (unpaired electrons). These electrons interact with the surrounding nuclei of the atoms and form so called triplet and singlet states. This states \"depend\" on the magnetic field (not super accurate, but you get the point). These states also create polarization on the nuclear spins, which then can and will control chemical reactions. The theory behind seems well understood. It was first stated by Kaptein in 1969. But now there is some kind of discussion around it, since it seems that the mechanism behind the RPM is different to what we thought it was. It still involves triplet and singlet states but the creation of polarization need to be described in a different way. \n\nWhat is interesting is, that this mechanism not only applies in birds (and also insect or may also be involved in our sense of smell) for navigation, it also seems to work in photosynthesis! This is actually also my research topic and the one of the group I'm working in. It is super interesting how nuclear spins with next to no energy can and will control complex chemical reactions and therefore lead to navigation or such highly efficient processes as photosynthesis.\n\nIf you are interested in the bird-navigation topic check Peter Hores research on it, if you are more interested in the RPM in photosynthesis I encourage you to check my boss' research (J\u00f6rg Matysik) or just ask me right away.\n\nedit: as stated below a review was missing.

The thing is that the mechanism itself contains variables that are field dependent and by itself have an orientation dependence, meaning they depend on the molecular structure and where in the molecule the radical pair is located. So on the first look it doesn't matter if the Earth's magnetic poles flip since the magnetic field is vectorial, that means it points in one direction. The mechanism itself doesn't care if it points up or down, but it is important how strong it is (locally). ~~Now if the Earth's magnetic poles would flip, I can imagine that also the local distribution of the magnetic field change, which means it gets weaker/stronger in some positions of the earth. This could lead therefore to birds not flying north instead of south but maybe west or east or any direction, since (as far as some people think, it is not fully understood so far)~~ (I was wrong here, see the edit) they know they arrived in there position according to the strength of the local magnetic field which they might feel with their tip (as stated: it is not really understood, it could be different). \n\nInteresting side fact that comes to my mind: If we are right and photosynthesis also depends on the magnetic field, it could also happen that plans (and other organisms that do photosynthesis as algae and some bacteria) change their structure. Some people did some research on how plants grow in a magnetic field and showed that they grow differently (mostly orientation I think) depending on the direction of an applied magnetic field. But I would need to look this up, I don't remember too much about it.\n\nEdit: I have to correct what I said: I talked to my boss and to another expert on the field and they said it doesn't matter if the magnetic field is reversed or not, because the bird itself can't differentiate between it. It only depends on the angular orientation of the magnetic field relative to the bird and this would not change if you would flip the magnetic field.

The \"field lines\" taught in many classes and used by physicists to visualize field strengths are purely to guide the eye; they don't have physical meaning. (Even so, they are useful lines to draw, and even contain weakly quantitative behavior, since the field strength is proportional to the density of field lines. Just remember that between any two such field lines, the field strength is just as strong as on the lines themselves. The field is smooth.)\n\n&gt; The reason for the creation of these pretty iron filing shapes is that each little iron filing, when subject to a magnetic field, becomes a little dipole itself. This dipole feels the force of the magnet, and aligns in the direction of the field lines. In addition, each little dipole feels a small force from the other nearby dipoles, and they move to minimize their local energy. This causes the clumping into lines that you see, as the opposite ends of the dipoles move together.\n\n&gt; The clumping is NOT a property of the magnetic field from the large magnet, it is a consequence of the magnetic fields of the small iron filings.\n\nPlasma is also self-interacting, and it's dynamic, that is it moves around a lot. Movement of charged particles induces a magnetic field, and because of interactions with the Earth's magnetic field, plasma movement tends to be restricted to flow \"along the field lines\". This creates instabilities that can only be resolved by clumping into lines in a way that's similar to how iron filings clump because of their own magnetic fields.\n\nedit: I hope this is correct!

This also destroys your immune system.  To restore your immune system there are two options.  The first is to re-transfuse in stem cells taken from your own blood before the procedure.  This is called an auto transplant.  The other is to transfuse stem cells taken from a donor allogenaic transplant.  \n\nThe allo is usually better at treating the disease but also has a much higher chance of killing you.  For multiple myeloma, the death rate from the allo procedure is 15-20%, and this uses a modified version of the allo to reduce the risk.  This compares to 3-5% for the auto.  \n\nThe risk from the allo comes from two things.  First, you have an extended period of no or very reduced immune response.  So you can easily die from catching the flu.  (Which is why I am sooooo pissed at the anti-vaxers).  \n\nThe other is that the new immune system can decide that anything in your body is foreign and attack it.  This is called graft vs host disease (GVHD).  Here \"graft\" means the new immune system from the donor.   And \"host\" means the patient in whom this new immune system has been grafted.

Secondly, by reducing the need for immune suppression drugs, it reduces the likelihood of death by opportunistic infection.\n\nsource:  My wife has multiple myeloma.

Some of these people are fit enough to undergo what is called an 'allogeneic bone marrow transplant', which is a very high-risk procedure and basically involves giving lethal doses of chemotherapy (and often total-body irradiation as well), while teeing-up a donor who will donate their bone marrow so that it is given to the patient just at the end of receiving all their chemo and radiatherapy.\n\nIt was originally conceived to treat blood cancers, because blood cancers originate from the bone marrow - essentially your body's factory of blood.  The idea was simply to wipe it out and use someone elses, and so cure them.\n\nIt did work at curing patients from cancer, but it didn't work in the way they thought it did.  To cut a long story short, they discovered that it was the new immune system from the donor that was key to finishing off the cancer.\n\nAfter an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, your body becomes something like a country that has just had a civil war.  The previous authority has been almost completely wiped out, and now there is a new power in town.  But this new immune system doesn't have the history and the knowledge of its new environment.  Its not sure what is good or what is bad, and goes on genocidal missions wiping out perfectly law-abiding cells - particularly in the liver, the gut and the skin, but in theory, absolutely anywhere.\n\nHowever, it's a two-edged sword, and if luck is on your side, it will also recognise the blood cancer as something that needs dealt with - something that the old authority allowed to grow and get stronger causing the disease in the first place.\n\nSo how well you do after receiving one of these transplants depends on how bad the graft-versus-host disease is (the damage that we don't want on healthy organs) and how good the graft-versus-tumour is (the damage we do want).\n\nUnfortunately, the immune system is so complex, we can only manipulate it in very basic ways.  The most simple of which is we can 'tone things down' a bit.  Using steroids and other drugs, the immune response can dampen down, which can avert fatal consequences of graft-versus-host disease.  However, we know that when you do this, it also lets the cancer off the hook as well.\n\nI've had a look at only the abstract of this paper, so I can't see the details, but it looks like they're using the rabbit virus myxoma to infect the transplanted T-cells.  The T-cells are like the conductors of your immune system, and they are the ones responsible for both the graft-versus-host and graft-versus-tumour effect.  It's only when the T-cells get activated (i.e. go into their 'killing' mode) that the myxoma virus cuts it short.\n\nAs the T-cells will interact with the tumour (in this case myeloma), they also deliver the virus to the myeloma cells.\n\nSo the idea is that you can tone-down the T-cell response, and reduce the graft-versus-host disease, but you can also kill myeloma cells with the myxoma virus.\n\nThis research sounds very much in the 'laboratory-bench' stage of things, and it's purely theoretical that this would do any good for patient, which is why it is unlikely to be used on patients as part of anything other than a phase-1 trial on a few patients.  Potential problems I see with it are: 1. It still seems to suppress the immune system generally - which means you may lose some of the graft-versus-tumour effect you had from the donor T-cells. 2. The T-cells may well deliver virus to the tumour and result in tumour cell killing, but presumably the T-cell will deliver the virus to elsewhere in the body as well - maybe even worsening graft-versus-host disease?  I don't know really know enough about this to know if these things are even possible, but those were the first two thoughts that popped into my head reading it.\n\nAs a side-note, something similar to an allogeneic bone marrow transplant might soon be regular use, which may bring the benefits without having to undergo a transplant.

Let;s use an oversimplified example of how this works.  \n\nSay you have one neuron which needs activating to remember a memory about walking your dog in the park while listening to radiohead when you met a pretty Japanese girl.  Once this neuron trips, the memory floods back.  Problem is, this neuron isn't tripping because a strong enough signal hasn't hit it in a long time.  \n\nThinking about stuff that's *related* to the components of this event will help activate it, though.  Maybe you can't remember the event, but you remember radiohead. You remember Japanese girls exist.  You remember your dog, and the park.  When enough of these 'related' schemes are activated simultaneously, suddenly you remember the event.\n\nThis is why you might not remember, say, who Louis XIV was when you're trying to talk to your friend, but when you're in your history class surrounded by similar cues to the moment you learned this particular fact, suddenly it's a cinch to recall.  With all these similar schemes in the network of the memory getting \"current\", as it were, there's enough power in the circuit to trip the memory.  That sum of current is referred to as summation of activation, which I mentioned earlier.\n\nA memory which was truly \"forgotten\" can't ever be remembered, because the connections between the neurons are gone.

If you're not asleep within 15 minutes get out of bed again.\n- repeat as often as necessary. \n\nEventually your brain cries uncle and you fall asleep.

Typically takes a person around 24 hours to adjust 1 hour of change.  \n\nConsistent wake time is another possible way.  Wake up at the same exact time everyday.  No exceptions.  Pretend you have to get up to feed a baby.  Drink a cop of coffee (or whatever you do) outside in the sunlight.  The sleep debt should eventually cause you to fall asleep earlier (but it may take weeks).  Remember, not everyone needs 8 hours of sleep.  You should get enough sleep so that you are not excessively sleepy during the day.  \n\nDevelop a bedtime routine as well.  Take a warm shower/bath, then sit on your couch and read a book with just a lamp on.  Do not watch TV or get on the computer (blue lights mess with your sleep).  When you start to feel sleepy, go to bed.  Do not lay in the bed unless you are sleepy.  Do not do activities in the bed other than sleep and sex (no TV, tablets, books, etc.).  If you don't fall asleep in 15 minutes, go back to the couch and read more (try not to pick things that are too activating, biographies, histories, and other types of non-fiction are probably best, but you know yourself).

From the top of my head some tips are:\n\n- Leave your room just for sleeping. Keep your computer, TV and all other daily activities outside your room. This will help your brain associate your room with sleeping.\n- Exercise: this is the obvious one in my opinion but very important. If you're tired you'll sleep easier and better.\n- Try to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. This is actually a big one. Doing this will help your body be tired when it's time to go to bed. It will also improve the quality of your sleep.\n- Have a set of activities that you always do before going to sleep. Example, brush your teeth, floss, meditate. Whatever it is. Try to have around 3 tasks that you do every time before going to sleep. This way, when the time is approaching and you're going through the motions, your body will associate those tasks with getting sleepy.\n- If you're not asleep within 30 minutes, get up and do something that will not wake you up too much. Meditating is a great one. Don't force yourself in bed for over 30 minutes.\n\nIf you do a quick google search you can find more tips.

From the Future of Wireless art.\n\n\n   \"It is difficult for a layman to grasp how an electric current can be propagated to distances of thousands of miles without diminution of intention. But it is simple after all. Distance is only a relative conception, a reflection in the mind of physical limitation. A view of electrical phenomena must be free of this delusive impression. However surprising, it is a fact that a sphere of the size of a little marble offers a greater impediment to the passage of a current than the whole earth. Every experiment, then, which can be performed with such a small sphere can likewise be carried out, and much more perfectly, with the immense globe on which we live. This is not merely a theory, but a truth established in numerous and carefully conducted experiments. When the earth is struck mechanically, as is the case in some powerful terrestrial upheaval, it vibrates like a bell, its period being measured in hours. When it is struck electrically, the charge oscillates, approximately, twelve times a second. By impressing upon it current waves of certain lengths, definitely related to its diameter, the globe is thrown into resonant vibration like a wire, stationary waves forming, the nodal and ventral regions of which can be located with mathematical precision. Owing to this fact and the spheroidal shape of the earth, numerous geodetical and other data, very accurate and of the greatest scientific and practical value, can be readily secured. Through the observation of these astonishing phenomena we shall soon be able to determine the exact diameter of the planet, its configuration and volume, the extent of its elevations and depressions, and to measure, with great precision and with nothing more than an electrical device, all terrestrial distances. In the densest fog or darkness of night, without a compass or other instruments of orientation, or a timepiece, it will be possible to guide a vessel along the shortest or orthodromic path, to instantly read the latitude and longitude, the hour, the distance from any point, and the true speed and direction of movement. By proper use of such disturbances a wave may be made to travel over the earth's surface with any velocity desired, and an electrical effect produced at any spot which can be selected at will and the geographical position of which can be closely ascertained from simple rules of trigonometry.\n\n   \"This mode of conveying electrical energy to a distance is not 'wireless' in the popular sense, but a transmission through a conductor, and one which is incomparably more perfect than any artificial one. All impediments of conduction arise from confinement of the electric and magnetic fluxes to narrow channels. The globe is free of such cramping and hinderment. It is an ideal conductor because of its immensity, isolation in space, and geometrical form. Its singleness is only an apparent limitation, for by impressing upon it numerous non-interfering vibrations, the flow of energy may be directed through any number of paths which, though bodily connected, are yet perfectly distinct and separate like ever so many cables. Any apparatus, then, which can be operated through one or more wires, at distances obviously limited, can likewise be worked without artificial conductors, and with the same facility and precision, at distances without limit other than that imposed by the physical dimensions of the globe.", "gilded": 0, "score": 25, "created": 1433724581.0},{"body": "Do you have more on this?", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1433725901.0},{"body": "Http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1908-00-00.htm that's the article they quoted", "gilded": 0, "score": 7, "created": 1433726784.0},{"body": "I love Tesla.

In essence, routers can broadcast their energy in a few directions at any one point in time, resulting in a much stronger signal in those directions where there's a much higher probability of being useful, and much weaker everywhere else where it'll likely be ignored--a much more efficient use of power.\n\nThe real magic behind how a router can direct most of its power in particular directions without moving mechanical parts is in how you can add multiple waves together to make another more meaningful wave.
