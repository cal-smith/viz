It tracked the main line of development and was not intended to constitute a fork. It was also the standard build mechanism for OpenOffice.org in most Linux distributions and was contributed to by said distributions.\n\n&gt;In 2007, ooo-build was made available by Novell as a software package called Go-oo (ooo-build had used the go-oo.org domain name as early as 2005), which included many features not included in upstream OpenOffice.org. Go-oo also encouraged outside contributions, with rules similar to those later adopted for LibreOffice.\n\n&gt;Sun's contributions to OpenOffice.org had been declining for some time, they remained reluctant to accept contributions and contributors were upset at Sun releasing OpenOffice.org code to IBM for IBM Lotus Symphony under a proprietary contract, rather than under an open source licence.\n\n&gt;Sun was purchased by Oracle Corporation in early 2010.

They fail to see how having corporation (which have controlling stakes of shares owned by the billionaire political bosses) being more powerful than the Government is going to be a literal Coup de Tat of US Republic the same as if the president announced he was now king.   Have to remember the bosses don't own the corporations outright, they just happen to be the single largest % of total stock share holder.  You know something like owning 10% of GE for example.  Then they in turn hold single-person largest percent of shares in the investment firms that hold the 401K's that make up the rest of the shares of most corporations...  Have to remember 90% of the money in the stock market is middle-cass retirement and other mutual funds.  But the 1%'rs at the one who run those funds and decide where to put Mr. Middle-Class's money.  \n\nBut nothing will stop this.  Eventually the power-bosses like the Kotch brothers or George Soros or Warren Buffet will succeed in the coup to overthrow the government \"of the people, for the people\" and put in its place a government \"of bought out politicians, for the 1%\"  \n\nFor the record there is *no* illuminati.  These billionaires are doing their thing out in the open.  Thing is they own the news networks too so they control the message.   \n\nThis will likely sort itself out, in 4-5 generations, and maybe the USA will be a republic again then.  But everybody alive today will be dead of old age when it does.  \n\n\nAnd then the wild card.  Maybe we'll get another Teddy Roosevelt, a leader so bombastic, ballsy, and competent they can save the Republic from its slow death by corruption.  \n\nNow really is the time.  Stop voting GOP or DNC.   It time to start voting in primaries for progressive-stance candidates.    And bloodbath the congress.  If we can flush out the turned Congressmen perhaps we can at least force the Billionares to start over in their schemes, meanwhile offering a window for Rule of Law to actually reassert itself over Rule of Money.  \n\nEdit: Gee gold?  Holy shit thanks.    \n\nCouple more points to make.  Corporations alone are not evil.  Our modern life wouldn't exist without them. Investment capital made by selling stocks enable great and wonderful products and services to be made.   \n\nNo its the owners of the corporation who are evil.  Its the billionaires who hold the largest % shares stock that are directing all of this.  \n\nI mention Teddy Roosevelt, because he pretty much single handedly saved the USA from being coup'ed by Rockefeller and friends back in the 1920's.  His dynamic personality and leadership won the people outright.  He used the public to strong arm congress into reforms that saved us from the Robber-Barons of the Gilded age.  IMO its either we find and elect the next TR, or we have to stage a bloody armed revolt to get our country back.  Personally I would rather not fight the US military, or have a 2nd Civil War....so lets hope we can find and support TR 2.0.   \n\nAnd Hillary is *NOT* that candidate.  IMO she is sociopath in love with her own power and willing to do *anything* to extend it.

Our drive to mate consumes some of us to the point where they have no control over it, the basic instinct is in the drivers seat. \n\nGreed is similar. It is the dressing we put over the primal urge to hoard resources to survive. We are hard wired to want infinitely because our ancestors had to take and hoard constantly to live. We have that extended in our very being, it is in the core of what drives us. \n\nThe problem is, you have a subset of people that lack any and all empathy on personal and social levels. Then you have people within this subset that lack the ability to control their basic instincts, be it the urge to mate or the urge to hoard. The really unfortunate thing, is these people will dedicate their every waking moment to filling that need at the expense of the rest of us. They are very good at it, and the lack of empathy allows them to lie and game the enacted systems more effectively than those of us with a developed sense of empathy. This leads to sociopaths trending into positions of influence and power, because influence and power lead to increased ability to hoard. \n\nThey cannot relinquish control of that. Never once in history has a ruling class consisting of the wealthy and powerful vacated their wealth and power for the greater good. They will see their country burned to the ground first, and they will send others to their deaths in droves. The only thing that has set them back, and not stopped mind you, is killing them in droves. This has led to innumerable deaths of common people, who fight because they are paid to, or ordered to, or have no choice, or are told to by whatever God or Government the wealthy own at the time. Some of these sociopaths always escape, and there are always more in line within whatever movement overthrows them to take the reigns of production and wealth, restarting the cycle again.\n\nIt's the unfortunate side of human nature that we like to ignore because thinking of ourselves as an animal who can barely control its own animal instincts is deeply unsettling to many people. So we don't plan to work with it, we ignore it and label it as \"ambition\" or \"appetite\" and treat it is if it is perfectly normal to leave that sort of switch turned on without any sort of limits.\n\nExcept there are limited resources in a limited world, and we are beings of limitless wants. If you don't think this is accurate, think about limiting yourself. Would you want that, even now, as a normal, empathetic human?\n\nIt makes me uncomfortable despite being cognizant of all of this.

The HTTPS request gets the page to load up encrypted -- but it GRABS data from 3rd parties -- and those requests all have unique strings in them that are used to backtrace who you are. \n\nAlso, your ISP knows the unique MAC address on your computer, and likely has an agreement with Homeland Security and the NSA and they aggregate this data. All the data the government collects is given to third parties -- so they can pretend THEY don't look at it. What does the 3rd party do? Sell the databases to anyone -- and I mean anyone, with enough money to buy it. China can buy it -- so much for national security, eh? I'd even read a Wikileaks where the CIA was selling databases to an Israelis consulting firm which then sells it to others.

And they know associations, interests and what you do -- on a blog, they know your opinion, and on social media, they know your friends. With HTTPS, they might miss a little bit -- unless they REALLY want to know more. Oh, and doesn't HTTPS require an authorizing body to create a token? More tracking.\n\nTo really be anonymous to 95%; you've got to use something like OpenDNS--perhaps changing to another DNS on occassion.

Use a VPN and do searches from another IP address if you can route it, because a consistent \"latency\" coupled with other data gleaned from your browser can profile you. You've got to use HTTPS and Disable or use \"clicktoplay\" for any media, control all JavaScripts and CSS files that are loaded and cross-linked images. \n\nFor complete privacy, you've got to search from a box you've never registered, from a coffees shop you've chosen at random and load up a random MAC address. Then run an app that does random HTTP requests and passes junk text because you have a pattern of speech that can be tracked. Likely any one of us on this blog could be identified with 90% accuracy by the words we most commonly used. So I and everyone on-line has a heuristic word database attached to any social media we engage in, likely tagged with a photo and our DMV records. If they have a DMV record WITHOUT some profile -- they might flag it to look harder.\n\nSo, if you act like a secret agent -- THEN you can start getting some privacy. Still; tape the camera on the screen and wear a disguise when you use the computer. Right now, for $300 you can buy an interferometer and add it to an iPad. Right NOW, there is technology to use an LCD screen to grab an image of what is in front of it (light hitting the screen causes interference and some measurable current, if you know the current you add to create the image and subtract -- probably not perfect, but it's something to think about). So if in 10 years, you might buy a chip to scan molecules on the surface of a person -- when do we think a high tech agency that dedicates itself to subterfuge and spying on everyone would put that into a chip on a computer or device we all have around us?\n\nNow if that sounds paranoid and deranged -- just remember that in Desert Storm I, they used they used radio waves sent from AWACs planes to get Postscript chips on laser printers  (ones that you and I might have had at an office) to broadcast the location of every office with a computer and printer. The design was built into the chip itself -- and you can imagine the secret visits to the chip manufacturer to make that happen. You can actually google this and find out it's not fantasy.\n\nI'm not a professional security expert, but I do have a vivid imagination and if I can think of 50 ways to track people (and I'm not digging deep yet, like mentioning that perhaps modems, cables, wifi, and innocuous communications chips on computers probably have a unique ping that goes out as if it were a bad packet and NOBOYD is looking for malformed HTTP packets amongst all the data).\n\nOut in Utah they built a building, larger than the Pentagon, that funnels through perhaps ALL data that goes over the internet. They probably have more data storage for each person in America than each person in America has for themselves. 99.99% is useless.\n\nThat's a lot of money and paranoia -- and you don't get paranoid if you expect to do right by people. People who cannot trust others tend not to be trustworthy. Out of patriotism, I believe you should not trust organizations and institutions. However, I'd like to disabuse people of the notion that their communications are safe from the people in charge. They can be made safer from the low-level crooks and marketers, but everything is more and more interconnected -- those connections define you as well as a fingerprint.\n\nEvery website you visit loads 20 other crosslinks, and every app or action in your computer calls up a website or two to transfer a bit of data.", "gilded": 0, "score": 11, "created": 1434483542.0},{"body": "Hey, do you have a link for the AWACS radio waves postscript story?

That's why \"man in the middle\" can slip in, duplicate the tower and the cell phone handshakes and just pass the data back and forth -- syphoning it all. If it's encrypted MAYBE they can't read it.\n\nHowever, the various black hat agencies can and have put in special designs to the chips that make up computers and communications equipment. For every HTTP request there is something like 4 packets made, because the system is very inefficient. There is also noise and out of band data and malformed packets. \n\nHas anyone analyzed 100% of the data transferred from a computer using HTTPS? If I had access to the people who made a ubiquitous communications chip, and money and power -- I could get them to add something to that chip, that would sit back and look for any encryption key going to the CPU and create a coded key for decryption. Aggregate these and send them via a malformed HTTP request to a random IP or the most common address the user goes to.\n\nThen, on the Routers that made up the internet, I'd visit CISCO (80% of the traffic) and a few others and tell them to install a device, that would look for a certain malformed packet and relay it. Only a few dozen people to watch, bribe or make disappear in this scenario.\n\nThe encryption could be perfect, the data line secure, and no flags would ever show in a security scan for hacking.  The stronger the encryption and the more professionals and degrees thrown at the security, the more they will convince each other that \"this is how it's done\" and if there is never any feedback that directly links a loss of trade secrets or someone stepping out of line getting indicted back to this collection of data -- it could go on forever.\n\nSo; reading security protocol books is awesome. But thinking you are secure without knowing every bit of data and thinking like a spy means you won't get to that next level.\n\nSure, 99% of all hacking is via social engineering of people -- but it's the stuff you will never know about that is changing the world. Key companies that are \"chosen\" will win trade deals and be able to patent things a few months before their competitors.

But the vast majority of Snowden's leaks fall into the latter category: international surveillance.  This includes the US spying on allies, enemies, and everything in between.  Americans, and Congress, support the vast majority of international surveillance.  \n\nSnowden is accused of violating the [Espionage Act](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793), (not for treason), which applies to:\n\n&gt;**Whoever, lawfully having possession of**, access to, control over, or being entrusted with any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense which ***information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to receive it***, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it;\n\nNow why would the US think that Snowden is giving information to foreign countries that could be used to the advantage of those countries and/or to the injury of the US?  Oh, right, because Snowden claims that he took the Booz Allen job to gain access information about specific foreign computers the NSA was hacking so that he could give that information to foreign journalists to publish.\n\n[Snowden on his plans](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1268209/exclusive-snowden-sought-booz-allen-job-gather-evidence-nsa?login=1): \n\n&gt;\u201cMy position with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists of machines all over the world the NSA hacked. That is why I accepted that position about three months ago. . . . If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country to make their own assessment, independent of my bias, as to whether or not the knowledge of US network operations against their people should be published.\u201d\n\n[What Snowden gave China while he was in Hong Kong, which is likely what he wants to do for other countries](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1260306/edward-snowden-classified-us-data-shows-hong-kong-hacking-targets?page=all):\n\n&gt;Classified US government data shown to the South China Morning Post by whistle-blower Edward Snowden has provided a rare insight into the effectiveness of Washington's top-secret global cyberspying programme....\n&gt;\n&gt;...The detailed records - which cannot be independently verified - ***show specific dates and the IP addresses of computers in Hong Kong and on the mainland hacked by the National Security Agency over a four-year period***.\n&gt;\n&gt;They also include information indicating whether an attack on a computer was ongoing or had been completed, along with an amount of additional operational information.\n\n[Glenn Greenwald on June 25](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/25/greenwald-snowden-s-files-are-out-there-if-anything-happens-to-him.html):\n\n&gt;Greenwald said he would not have published some of the stories that ran in the South China Morning Post. \u201cWhether I would have disclosed the specific IP addresses in China and Hong Kong the NSA is hacking, I don\u2019t think I would have,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201c***What motivated that leak though was a need to ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China.***\u201d\n\n[Glenn Greenwald on July 2](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/352213748917874688):\n\n&gt;I think there's a difference between what really motivated him to leak &amp; what he's leaked out of self-preservation\n\nSo even Greenwald agrees that the later leaks are not whistleblowing.  Leaking classified and sensitive operational information to the Chinese to \"ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China\" may not be treason or spying, but it's certainly not whistleblowing.\n\nHere's famed [NSA whistleblower William Binney](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/06/16/snowden-whistleblower-nsa-officials-roundtable/2428809/) discussing the difference between the domestic whistleblowing and the leaking of foreign surveillance targets:\n\n&gt; Q: There's a question being debated whether Snowden is a hero or a traitor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Binney: Certainly he performed a really great public service to begin with by exposing these programs and making the government in a sense publicly accountable for what they're doing. At least now they are going to have some kind of open discussion like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; **But now he is starting to talk about things like the government hacking into China and all this kind of thing. He is going a little bit too far. I don't think he had access to that program. But somebody talked to him about it, and so he said, from what I have read, anyway, he said that somebody, a reliable source, told him that the U.S. government is hacking into all these countries.

That being said, pardoning Snowden would not be a good idea right now. Here's why:\n\n\n1. It might be the end of the story for the best spokesman we've had, since any of future critiques of the government would be dampened by the fact that he, essentially, won, therefore the system can't be so broken. I'm sure Snowden wants to come home, but he's doing a lot of good where he is right now.\n\n\n2. It would create a very awkward precedent. It would put the President (Obama but also the next president, especially if they're Democrat) at odds with the intelligence agencies and possibly DOJ, organizations that desperately need reform. OP mentions lawmakers recognizing these problems, but reform of these agencies will require their cooperation and good faith, which a pardon would damage. They'd naturally play the victims - the losers of a popularity contest decided by the President - and turn inward. They're taking a PR beating right now - a pardon would be kicking them while they're down.\u00a0\n\n\n3.\u00a0 It might reduce the motivation for better whistleblower protections and other reforms of the intelligence community.\n\n\nI'd rather see Snowden get his day in court. I want to see the government try to substantiate all these charges. Some will stick (leaking) but I want to see the treason and aiding terrorists arguments crumble before scrutiny. To those who say \"we'd never know what happened in that courtroom, it would all be classified, if he ever even sees the inside of a courtroom\", Snowden could make openness and speedy trial conditions of his return. This would force the government to appraise the value of classifying everything. If it's so important, they won't accept those terms, and we're back where we started.\n\n\nSunlight is a good disinfectant, and a public trial would shed a lot of light on what works and what doesn't.
