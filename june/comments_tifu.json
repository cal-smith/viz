We were not yet actually having sex, but she would often fall asleep on my bed while I did homework (college) or played video games or something. I would kick her out around 1am and send her home, this happened almost daily for weeks. Problem is she was 17 still, and I was 19 at the time, so kicking her out was very important (where i live she was still below the legal age of consent, and not only could I get charged with statutory rape, but my Dad could get in trouble for allowing it).\n\nAnyway, one morning I wake up at about 6am and realize I had fallen asleep in my computer chair. It dawns on me and I quickly spin around to see my lovely gf still fast asleep in my bed. I panic, her Mom is a nasty person and is more than likely calling the police by this point or sending out search parties. There is a very real likelihood this women would happily send me to prison (even though I actually did nothing).\n\nI wake her up, she starts to panic as well. Just about this time there is a tap on the bedroom window. It's my gf's best friend and her boyfriend and they also had the same problem (though I'm pretty sure they had in fact knowingly done so). We quickly hash out a plan to say that both girls were staying at another friends house, and call her to make sure she would back up this story. She will, and her mom also agrees (I have NO idea why, I didn't know this person myself). Anyway, everything is sorted out, I just need to get her out of the house, problem solved. The other couple leave.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later we climb out the window, I start to say goodbye and I look just to my right to see my Dad sitting on the ground doing some early morning gardening only 15 feet from my window. He looks at me, looks at her, and gives me a look of \"I'm not an idiot\" like only a Dad can give. Anyway, to this day he still won't believe me that nothing happened and it was an accident.

There is a distance of about 15meters between both groups. Then you say some lines:\n\nBM: Who fears the black man?\n\nOthers: Noone!\n\nBM: And when he comes?\n\nOthers: Then we run away!\n\nFollowed by this the black man tries to catch them, while the others try to reach the side where the black man stood at the beginning. When all, but those who were catched, reached the other side, the black man and those caught by him will be on the side the others were before. Then it starts with talking again, same lines, only this time there are several black man.

The game is about a bogeyman called \"der Schwarze Mann\" (The Black Man).

The game begins with 1 person \"infected\" by the plague, and everyone he touches gets infected, too.

The Brothers Cuba A and Cuba C were smug when they passed me.\n\nThen I, a complete stranger with no fans or support, took the stage and all was silent. The bongos began their booming, I was frozen stiff - not out of fear, but to build suspense. Then the steel drums started, I drew my maracas and exploded into a dance never before seen. My jungle dance, that I spent a lifetime mastering. \n\nWhen it was over, smoke rose from the dance floor and there was a moment of silence. Then everyone accepted what they witnessed as reality and the standing ovation was so loud my ears hurt. The judges put 10's across the board. The undefeated Brothers Cuba A and Cuba C were in a state of shock.\n\nWhen the host presented the crown to me, he asked who I was and where I came from, how come no one ever saw me before.
