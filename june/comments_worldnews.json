Kansas has traditionally been a republican state. The last time we had elected a democrat to a national position was during the depression and even that was just one election. The Republican party in the state has traditionally been a fairly moderate group, but like many places in U.S. over the last few decades the culture warriors began to take over the states republican party. This led to the election of one of our former senators Sam Brownback to the governorship.\n\n When he was elected he decided that Kansas needs an overhaul of the tax laws in the state. He did this by getting our state legislature to pass obscene tax cuts for the wealthiest (Koch Brothers) and Corporations and slashing social benefits in the state promising that this would bring jobs and make Kansas a model of how government should be run. While doing all of this he also decided to cut education spending in the state as well. Our state constitution requires that public schools be properly funded and since they weren't our state supreme court stepped in and told them they had to fund the schools. This caused an out roar across the state and those who didn't back the governor 100% (ie the moderates) were ousted in primaries across the state and replaced with far right candidates who would back the governor.\n\n While all of this was going on it quickly began to become clear that the tax cuts they had just passed weren't working in fact they caused a projected $648 million budget deficit for the state. This forced our state legislators to create a new budget, but there was a fight on how this should be done. So, as the legislator was fighting over the budget they passed a law that says if the supreme court rules in favor of properly funding the schools then the judiciary budget for the state will be eliminated. Governor Brownback then went on to bully the state legislature into passing a budget that will increase be the largest tax increase in the states history through the regressive sales tax instead of reinstating the taxes that had been cut for the wealthiest and corporations. This all was in the last month and to add to it all our jobless rates across the state continue to increase. \n\nTLDR; State elects right wing government, right wing government slashes taxes for the rich, state has budget problems, state elects even further right government, government bullies state courts to get way, government bullies state legislators to pass largest tax increase in state history but only on poor, You get $600 million budget deficit and high job loss. \nedit: My mistake the judiciary budget fight is over the fact that the governor wants our supreme court to be stripped of power to instill chief judges of lower state courts. \nedit: Interestingly I just came across [this](http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/barbara-shelly/article24652759.html)", "gilded": 0, "score": 90, "created": 1435110351.0},{"body": "One of the comments from the article you linked:\n\n\"We need to pray for this man. so that he realizes that he is affecting the lives of real people.
