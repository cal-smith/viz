[{"body": "In theory, yes. \n\nIn practice, it's much harder, because the earth is so small and 65 milllion light years is a long distance. For perspective, all the visible stars in the night sky are within about 1,000 light years of us. The Milky Way is about 100,000 light years across. Andromeda is about 2.5 million light years away. If some aliens (or wormhole travelers) want to see dinosaurs, they're going to need a big telescope. We can barely even resolve planets in our own galaxy, and I don't think there is a single known extragalactic exoplanet, but I could be wrong. \n\nBut let's not let reality get in the way of our adventure; after all, we've already assumed wormholes exist. So how big does this telescope need to be? Astronomy is hard, and gets harder the further away you look, because you need bigger and bigger telescopes to get the same resolution- [so we can use the lens resolution equation to find an approximate size for the lens.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_resolution#Lens_resolution)\n\n      Angular resolution = 1.22 * Wavelength / Lens Diameter\n\nSo pick a wavelength in the visible spectrum- how about 500 nanometers since that's right at the transition between blue and green, and a distance of 65 million light years. The angular resolution to resolve the earth would be: \n\n     Earth Radius/Distance = 1.22 * Wavelength / Lens Diameter\n\nSolving for the lens diameter gives about 5.8x10^10 meters, which is about a third of the distance to the sun. This is big- this lens would fill up about half of Mercury's orbit. \n\nBut you wanted to see *dinosaurs*, not just the earth. If you want to resolve a dinosaur as one pixel or so, then we use the same equation again, but put in the size of a dinosaur (maybe 10 meters?) instead of the earth radius. [This lens](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2865+million+light+years+%2F+length+of+triceratops%29+*+1.22+*+500+nm) needs to be 4.4 light years in diameter- where once again I am surprised at the neat tidbits Wolfram has built in, like the length of an adult triceratops. \n\nAnyway, you're going to run into a problem here because when you start putting a lot of mass in one spot space starts to curve a lot, and eventually it's going to collapse into a black hole. For something with the density of glass, which is about 2.5 grams/cc, you're going to hit this point fairly quickly. In fact, [a ball of glass 14 light *minutes* in radius will have enough concentrated mass to collapse into a black hole.](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt%283*%28speed+of+light%29^2+%2F+%288+*+gravitational+constant+*+pi+*+2.5+grams%2Fcc%29%29)\n\nTough luck.", "gilded": 5, "score": 5191, "created": 1425750052.0},{"body": "There goes my dream of seeing dinosaurs, though I must say, I was not expecting the lens size to be the defining factor.\n\n Amazing answer thanks a lot.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 3300, "created": 1425751384.0},{"body": "you can actually get around the lens size problem, by having multiple lenses, or moving one around.", "gilded": 0, "score": 760, "created": 1425757237.0},{"body": "I'd expect a lens that size to be made from electromagnetic distortion fields rather than solid materials - the same way we use existing stars /galaxies as gravity lenses already.

This is the most basic concept needed here (sorry if I went to simple). \nAnd as we know, light has a m\u00e1ximum speed (roughly 300,000 thousand kilometers per second).\nWith those two facts we can predict that whenever we see something that's far away, let's say 300,000 kms away, what we're seeing is the light that was reflected on that object one second ago, so we could say we're looking at the past. The greater the distance, the longer time has passed since that light got reflected.\n\nThis is not quite noticeable on earth, but in stellar scale, it get's quite relevant.\n\nUsing this, we could say that someone that was one light year (the distance that light can move in a year (300,000 * 60 * 24 * 365.4 kilometers) away from earth, would be able to see the earth as it was one year ago, since he'd be seeing the light that was reflected a year before. Increase the distance, and the time increases.\n\nNow, in order for you or me to see the past, we'd need to travel faster than light so we could \"catch up\" with the light that reflected on ourselves before we started travelling. But as we know, faster than light travel is impossible.

But I'm not sure I can explain the difference very well.  This [AskScience wiki article](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/physics/light_through_material) explains why absorption/re-emission is not the correct explanation.\n\n\n------\n\n\nAbsorption is when an electron jumps to a higher energy level.  The energy gained by the electron corresponds to the energy of the incoming photon.  Re-emission is when that electron jumps back down to its most stable state, releasing a photon with energy corresponding to the transition.  The main point here is that the frequencies of absorbed and emitted light depend on the electron energy levels of the material, therefore only certain, discrete frequencies are allowed.\n\n\nThis is different from what I described.  The oscillating electromagnetic field of the light interacts with the charged particles in such a way that the wave speed decreases.  This doesn't really have anything to do with electron energy levels themselves, and just the fact that electrons are charged particles.\n\n\nI know those two descriptions sound very similar, but there's some important distinctions.  First of all, while both effects depend on frequency, absorption/re-emission involves only specific frequencies.  So if slower-than-c speeds were due to absorption/re-emission, then most light should pass through a material at exactly c, while a few specific frequencies would be slowed down.  This is not the case.\n\n\nFurthermore, the emitted light is often not the same frequency.  Have you ever seen objects that glow visibly when exposed to UV light?  They are absorbing UV photons and re-emitting in the visible range.  When light passes through glass, it is slowed down, but the color doesn't change.  (Yes, the colors might get separated as in a prism, but you aren't *changing* the wavelengths, just separating the ones that were there from the beginning.)\n\n\nFinally, the re-emitted photon has no idea which direction to go.  If it did, UV fluorescence wouldn't work (because all the re-emitted photons would continue straight into the material, instead of being emitted outwards towards your eyeball).  But light passing through glass goes through in a straight line.  (Ok yes, it bends at each interface.  But throughout the bulk it travels in straight lines.

If you could, you'd see the pendulum actually takes an infinite amount of time to get upright. This orbit is called a separatrix, as it divides the orbits where the pendulum overcomes the unstable point from those where the pendulum cannot reach it and stops before.

However, the side effects of this warrant the metaphor \"hole\". Mathematically (and it's all we can say), the matter is condensed to an infinitely small point (aka to a point).\n\nEvery object with mass has a gravity well (Moon, Earth, a microscopic drop flying away form your mouth when you cough). Since the matter concentration of a BH is so high that it takes no space, the gravity well here doesn't just conveniently stop increasing its bend once you reach the object's surface, it keeps bending until the surface of spacetime isn't horizontal or bent any more, it's vertical - but I don't know if it really reaches perfectly vertical geometry, might rather be asymptotic.\n\nAnyway, for a planet to orbit the sun, the planet has to move faster the closer to the sun it is, or it will fall in. Falling and missing is easy from afar, but you need to be really fast if you're close. A BH bends spacetime so much that an object needs to exceed the speed of light for a stable orbit close to the BH's center. Since that's an impossible speed, the object joins the point mass.\n\nLet's take a photon (-&gt; speed of light) as an example and shoot it at the BH and miss. If we aimed at a point more than 1.5 times the BH's event horizon radius, the photon will curve a little around the BH and then keep going on its path. The closer we get to the 1.5, the more likely it will get that we get hit by our own photon.\n\nAt 1.5, the photon would run around the BH indefinitely in an ideal scenario, aka never; it will only zip around the BH a half time or 3 times or a few hundred times and then either fall in or fly away. That's the \"photon sphere\". That's where an object needs to have the speed of light to orbit.\n\nBetween 1.5 and 1.0, a photon would have to aim more or less straight away from the BH to escape. Since we're shooting at the BH from far away, the photon will *definitely* fall in, assuming that there is no other interference. It might orbit a little (but less than one full orbit), then it falls in. If we hit the BH at radius 1.0 or less, we hit the event horizon which can not possibly be escaped (except via Hawking Radiation): Even if the photon were aiming straight away from the BH, it would fall towards the concentrated mass. Hence we can say that *all* paths inside the event horizon lead to the singularity.\n\nLet's look at this on location with human eyes. We fall in, feet first. Far outside the photon sphere when you look down, the BH looks like a black spot (possibly with bright events all around from gas etc. that's falling in) that bends the light coming to you from behind it like a lens around it. The closer to the photon sphere distance you get, the more the black hole becomes the lower half of all of reality that you can see, because at the photon sphere distance, you would technically see the back of your own head, so while you're getting there, the black circle grows. Now it looks as if the black hole is really a *hole* in the ground, it becomes 2D in your eyes. Once you're at photon sphere distance, exactly the upper half of what you see is the space that you're leaving behind, and the lower half is just black.\n\nAnd once you fall below photon sphere distance, the blackness is even above the center of your vision, and it's curved upwards at the left and right, and if you look up, you see that there's blackness there, too: Space itself has become a circle in the middle. Earlier, you saw a black circle (The BH.), but now you see a circle into which all of visible space has been squeezed, surrounded by the blackness of the BH. The further you fall, the more space becomes just a tiny dot in the center of the blackness. And then you reach the event horizon, and everything is black.\n\nSo, in a way the photon sphere is the portal into the black hole, but the word \"hole\" is only a metaphor.

The normal sodium amounts in our blood stream are so tightly controlled that we can know exactly what the concentration SHOULD be (0.9%). This is why saline IV bags rehydrate you. \n\nWhen saline is given, the overall purpose is to keep it in the blood stream. Water and sodium love to travel together, and they love to travel across many of the membranes in the human body. And when you have two compartments anywhere in the body with a membrane in between (that can let water and salts through) those two compartments are going to naturally want to become the SAME concentration. \n\nSo when we give normal saline, we are trying to give something that is the EXACT same as the fluids outside the blood stream so that it STAYS in the bloodstream and fills it up. If we gave a solution that was too concentrated, water would tend to get drawn into the bloodstream and out of the surrounding tissue, which could be a pretty bad thing when you consider that your brain cells might shrivel up! (yes this is a thing that can happen if you change the sodium too much too fast). Also if we give something that is too dilute (like plain ol water) then the water can shift out of the bloodstream and into the surrounding cells which in the short run can be bad because it defeats the whole purpose of giving the saline in the first place (more volume in blood stream = more blood getting to more places, albeit a little more dilute). In the long run, if we give too much dilute saline too fast then the surrounding tissues (which are now more concentrated than what we put in the blood) will suck up all that water to even out the concentration (remember, they want to be the same always) and when things suck up all that water, they swell. Again, brain cells can be particularly sensitive to this in some situations, and swelling brain cells can dies just as quick as shriveling ones. That is why normal saline is so great. \n\nIs the whole deal more complicated than this? absoloutely, most of what we eat so much food to provide energy for is keeping the concentrations of different small solutes (sodium, potassium, calcium) at certain levels on other sides of different membranes. I.e. fighting against having the same concentration on both sides. And there's more than one kind of fluid that we give that stays in the blood stream. \n\nNow in the case of sea water, we have to consider that \n1. anything we eat or drink is absorbed much much slower when considered against giving an IV which is essentially instantaneous. \n(we do absorb things very fast though)\n2. the largest factor in our regulation of sodium is our kidneys. \n\nso when you drink a large amount of salty salty water, it gets slowly absorbed, which means the sodium concentration in your bloodstream slowly goes up. Now remember that your kidneys are trying to keep as much water as possible in your blood stream at any one time (they regulate your hydration level) while also keeping the sodium within the \"safe-not messin brain cells up-levels\" (they regulate sodium and chlorine). so if your stranded in a boat, you are already dehydrated, so your body is concentrating the hell out of your urine by sucking all of the water out of it, but you cant pee straight salt crystals, so you are still loosing a fair amount of water each time. and even more when you are sweating. This means that your sodium is probably getting more concentrated in your blood just because of water loss relative to sodium loss.\n\nso when you decide to get a big gulp of that oh so salty water (at around 3.5% thats almost triple the concentration of your NORMAL blood) you have now given your kidneys a double whammy, some water that cant be used effectively because of the crazy sodium concentration. Now they are trying to get rid of sodium even harder which means getting rid of SOME water. And the biggest problem is that your dehydration level, clinically, has nothing to do with thirst, or volume of fluid in the blood stream (you can bleed out and be perfectly hydrated). ITS ALL ABOUT THE SODIUM CONCENTRATION. so you now have your body taking in way more sodium than it needs relative to water, and your kidneys really cant compensate as they were already stressed, so your sodium concentration goes up in your blood, and you are now more dehydrated and more thirsty. woof. \n\nSo remember, dehydration is all about concentration. \nVolume is related, but not the same. \nDon't drink the seawater. \nThank god for saline.

Tonicity depends on the non-penetrating molecules (ions that can't easily cross the cell membrane). Osmolarity depends on both non-penetrating and penetrating molecules.

This is often the case for those who suffer from diabetes and other kinds of diseases.\n\nSalt water is hypertonic to our cells, meaning that the concentration of sodium ions per liter is greater than the concentration of sodium ions per liter inside our cells.

The original post barely asks a question - which might have thrown you. The best implication that could be derived from the title is simply that there seems to be an association between serial killers and bed wetters. As if they knew each other, socially. \n\nThe best way I'd say it is that \"It is surprising, but a trait that serial killers seem to share is bed wetting. Is there a reason for serial killers to share this odd trait, and does it have a psychological basis?\"\n\nNow, unfortunately, we (humans, mostly) have a tendency to read what we think about, so as each person read the title and interpreted the question, they started to rewrite it. \"Well,\" some said, \"there is a psychological explanation of bed wetting, but there is also a neurological component to consider as well\", and so they initially answered part of the question they read, but responded to the unasked question, \"could it be something else, as my ignorance in this field would probably require you to expand my question to include what I might potentially not know?\".\n\nThis is all to say that the top reply says that the question is actually about the MacDonald Triad, which it may or may not be. Regardless, bed wetting is a trait. Traits are not predictive or causal. They are simply traits. Do they suggest existing behaviors or situations? Sure, they might. That depends entirely on context. Which is why the formula of the question is important.\n\nWhy are these traits common amongst serial killers? Why are these traits comorbid with others typically in those with diagnosed psychopathy?\n\nThe issue with saying that bed wetting is predictive of psychopathy is the same as it being a cause. Predictive implies a continuum that leads toward psychopathy, though not necessarily. This is as weak an argument as the causal argument, because our ignorance over the determining factors of psychopathy limits our causal analysis.\n\nTo expand, you have to recognize that bed wetting, as a trait, is symptomatic of some problems. At age 12, and identified at age 12, bed wetting could be, though not necessarily be, indicative of sexual or otherwise violent abuse. This is likely because of a strange interaction between the divisions of the autonomic nervous system, but yes, could be other factors. Now, whether or not the bed wetting is on the road towards psychopathy would have to include additional information from that moment in time, but also information about things that may or may not happen. The idea is untenable; information is key, yet difficult or near impossible to obtain.\n\nI see what you're saying, bed wetting could be predictive if it were part of the symptoms that arise as a result of other, actual causes that lead to psychopathy, whatever they are. Determining that would render the need for looking at bed wetting null and void though. You'd already be looking for the other, more obvious signs.\n\nAs it is, you draw some pretty hasty conclusions; assuming that parental abuse that is severe enough to cause bed wetting to continue up until the age of twelve is assuming that you are dealing with the same child, the same parent, the same abuse, every time. That would be treating it like a physics problem. Those are predictive, they have laws. Not all forces interact in the same way with people, unfortunately. Which is the main reason you are being down voted, I think. Statistics will show reported cases. That is a limited sample, and given within a range of cases that are all already similar, but simply not all the variations of the case. It is a weak statistic.\n\nSo, no. It is not predictive.

It is easy for adults and children to focus on the consequences of wetting and soiling eg. changing sheets/clothes, washing, rather than the reasons why it happens.\nAll children bed wet from time to time when they are sick, stressed or anxious. Children who have been sexually assaulted will often bed wet every night and sometimes more than once a night. Bedwetting can be linked to feelings and may be a result of nightmares. Extreme fear can cause loss of bladder control and may serve the purpose of waking a child from a terrifying dream.\nBedwetting can also result from feelings of helplessness when children feel a loss of ownership and power over their body when it has been used by someone more powerful than they are. Bedwetting can be a reflection of children regressing in many ways, following sexual assault, when they lose a number of skills they previously had. Children may regress to a younger state to try and get their needs met. Bedwetting and soiling may also occur because a child separates from their genital/urinary/anal areas. They may lose the ability to respond to their body cues and therefore become less able to regulate their toilet habits. Sometimes children may be scared to actually go to the toilet.

This theory suggests that sociopaths never made it past the first stage of development (Trust vs Mistrust) in infancy, and are therefore stuck in a place where they do not trust the world because severe neglect ensured that their needs were never met by their parents or caregivers. This can lead an individual to view other people as objects, not people, as they can only rely on themselves to meet their own needs. \n\nThe speaker giving the in-service provided the example of an adolescent boy who lived in a residential facility he was working in who displayed many disturbing antisocial behaviors. They tried a counterintuitive approach, not punishing him for his unacceptable behaviors, but giving him everything (within their abilities) he needed and wanted without expecting anything in return - much like you do with an infant who can only cry and occasionally throw things to let you know they have a need that is not being met. \n\nAfter some weeks or months (I can't recall specifically) of this, the boy woke up one morning and refused to get out of bed or do anything he was asked, saying \"No!\" and basically throwing a temper tantrum at further prodding.

This behavioural difference corresponds to very specific structural brain abnormalities which underpin psychopathic behaviour, such as profound deficits in empathizing with the distress of others. MRIs of psychopaths display significantly reduced grey matter volumes in the anterior rostral prefrontal cortex and temporal poles. Damage to these areas is associated with impaired empathizing with other people, poor response to fear and distress and a lack of self-conscious emotions such as guilt or embarrassment.

However, they also act to attenuate frequencies outside (I.e. below) the range of typical speech. While they may protect against long-duration stimuli (loud music), they likely help very little with sudden transients (I.e. gun shots) as their latencies are on the order of several milliseconds. The reflex also decays after a minute in ideal circumstances, so any protective quality is short lived. These reflexes are likely more protective against the levels of our own voices, which are quite loud at the point of our lips and vocal folds.\n\nIn fact, more evidence (again, I apologise for the lack of citations) suggests that the reflexes help to attenuate low-frequency maskers which, due to the macromechanics of our inner ears, often reduce the audibility of some higher-frequency speech signal.\n\nIn our lab, we frequently test a more complex reflex arc involving the brainstem and inner ear, known as the medial olivocochlear reflex, which provides additional help in improving the salience of speech when presented with competing noise.\n\nFascinating stuff. The ear is actually action-packed with little features that help to improve our perception of speech. It's always a little disheartening to see how little public knowledge there is about the whole system.\n\nEDIT: This thread is picking up steam, so I want to make a PSA. Everyone, wear hearing protection when you know you'll be exposed to loud sounds, either transient or prolonged. Buy some disposable foam plugs and learn how to **appropriately** use them. I see pediatric patients exclusively now, but I've seen many, many older patients (teenagers included) in the past who've screwed up their hearing due simply to not wanting to protect their ears. None of them have been happy about it. \n\nTake all the soft sounds in life that you love. Birds chirping, leaves rustling, wind in the car window, your loved ones whispering. Now take them away. See how much you miss them. You've seen the videos of kids crying after having their cochlear implant turned on, hearing sounds for the first time? Imagine seeing a 70-year-old retiree trying a hearing aid and suddenly hearing his wife snicker for the first time in twenty years. Feels for days.\n\nHearing's not one of those things you don't miss till it's gone. A lot of times it goes slowly; slips away without being noticed.

I'm going to write a short history of Pi in different cultures in Ancient Mathematics. I will go into less detail than some of the Mathematicians posts here, who will explain why certain things work, while I'll just mention them briefly (I also don't have room to mention the vast developments done by the Greeks, but everyone will answer those).\n\n**Mesopotamia and Egypt**\n\nThroughout most of early history, people generally used 3 as an approximation for the ratio of the circle's circumference to its diameter. An example of this can be seen, in, of all places, The First Book of Kings in the Bible. Written between the 7th Century and 3rd Century BC (*The Oxford Annotated Bible* says evidence points to around 620BC, but there is some evidence it was constantly edited up until the Persian era). The quote from Kings 7:23 is\n\n&gt;Then he made the molten sea; it was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high. A line of thirty cubits would encircle it completely.\n\nNow I don't want to get into past Theological issues with what the Bible says, and if it matters, but I would like to briefly mention one person, Rabbi Nehemiah, who lived around 150 AD, who wrote a text on geometry, the Mishnat ha-Middot, in which he argued that it was only calculated to the inner brim, and if the width of the brim itself is taken into account, it becomes much closer to the actual value.\n\nIn most mathematics the Babylonians also just use \u03c0= 3, because, as shown on the Babylonian tablets YBC 7302 and Haddad 104, the area of a circle would be calculated by them using 1/12 the square of its circumference (you notice most Babylonian calculations on Circles are solved through calculations on its circumference, this is especially prominent on Haddad 104.). However we don't want to dismiss Mesopotamian calculations of \u03c0 just yet. A Babylonian example found at 1936 on a Clay Tablet at Susa (located in Modern Iran.) which approximated \u03c0 to around 3+1/8.\n\nIn Egypt we come across similar writings. In problem 50 of the Rhind Papyrus (probably the best examples we have of Egyptian Mathematics) dating from around 1650 BC, it reads \u201cExample of a round field of diameter 9. What is the area? Take away 1/9 of the diameter; the remainder is 8. Multiply 8 times 8; it makes 64. Therefore, the area is 64.\u201d This is described by the formula A = (d \u2212 d/9)^2 which, by comparing leads to a value of \u03c0 as 256/81= 3.16049...\n\nIt does appear many of the early values of it were calculated through empirical measurements, instead of any true calculation to find it, as neither give us any more detail on why they believed it would work.\n\n**China**\n\nIn China a book was written, named *The Nine Chapters on Mathematical Art*, between the 10th and 2nd centuries BC by generations of Scholars. In it we get many formula, such as those for areas of rectangles, triangles, and the volume of parallelepipeds and pyramids. We also get some formula for the area of a circle and volume of a Sphere.\n\nIn this early Chinese Mathematics, just as in Babylon, the diameters are given as being 1/3 of the circumference, so \u03c0 is taken to be 3. The scribe who wrote this then gives 4 different ways in which the area can be calculated:\n\n1. The rule is: Half of the circumference and half of the diameter are multiplied together to give\nthe area.\n\n2. Another rule is: The circumference and the diameter are multiplied together, then the result is\ndivided by 4.\n\n3. Another rule is: The diameter is multiplied by itself. Multiply the result by 3 and then divide\nby 4.\n\n4. Another rule is: The circumference is multiplied by itself. Then divide the result by 12.\n\nThe 4th result of course being the same as the Babylonian method, however both the Babylonians and the Chinese do not explain why these rules work.\n\nChinese Mathematician Liu Hui, in the 3rd Century AD, noticed however that this value for \u03c0 must be incorrect. He noticed it was incorrect because he realised that thought the area of a circle of radius 1 would be 3, he could also find a regular dodecagon inside the circle with area 3, so the area of a circle must be larger. He proceeded to approximate this area by constructing inscribed polygons with more and more sides. He managed to approximate \u03c0 to be 3.141024, however two centuries later, using the same method Zu Chongzhi carried out further calculations and got the approximation as 3.1415926.\n\nLiu Hui also showed that even if you take \u03c0 as 3, the volume of the Sphere given would give an incorrect result.\n\n**India**\n\nThe approximation of \u03c0 to be sqrt(10) was very often used in India\n\nMany important Geometric Ideas were expressed in the Sulbasutras which were appendices to the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of  Hinduism. They are also the only knowledge of Mathematics we have from the Vedic Period. As these aren't necessarily Mathematical pieces, they assert truths but do not give any reason why, though later versions give some examples. The four major Sulbasutras, which are mathematically the most significant, are those composed by Baudhayana, Manava, Apastamba and Katyayana, though we know very little about these people. The texts are dated from around 800 BCE to 200 CE, with the oldest being a sutra attributed to Baudhayana around 800 BCE to 600 BCE. \n\nThis work contains many Mathematical results, such as the Pythagorean Theorem (though there is an idea that this came to India through Mesopotamian work) as well as some geometric properties of various shapes.\n \nLater on in the Sulbasutras however we get these two results involving circles:\n\n&gt;If it is desired to transform a square into a circle, a cord of length half the diagonal of the square is\nstretched from the center to the east, a part of it lying outside the eastern side of the square. With\none-third of the part lying outside added to the remainder of the half diagonal, the requisite circle\nis drawn\n\nand \n\n&gt;To transform a circle into a square, the diameter is divided into eight parts; one such part, after\nbeing divided into twenty-nine parts, is reduced by twenty-eight of them and further by the sixth\nof the part left less the eighth of the sixth part. [The remainder is then the side of the required\nsquare.]\n\nAs this is easier to show with pictures, I'll take some from the book A History of Mathematics by Victor J. Katz:\n\n[For the first statement](http://i.imgur.com/IjS35vi.png)\n\nIn this construction, **MN** is the radius **r** of the circle you want. If you take the side of the original square to be **s**, you get **r=((2+sqrt2)/6)s** this implies a value of \u03c0 as being 3.088311755.\n\nIn this second statement the writer wants us to take the side of the square to be equal [to](http://i.imgur.com/bsksXEj.png) of the diameter of the circle. This is the equivalent of taking \u03c0 to be 3.088326491\n\nLater on in India, the Mathematician Aryabhata (476\u2013550 AD) worked on the approximation for \u03c0. He writes \n\n&gt;\"Add four to 100, multiply by eight, and then add 62,000. By this rule the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 20,000 can be approached.\"\n\nThis implies that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is ((4 + 100) \u00d7 8 + 62000)/20000 = 62832/20000 = 3.1416. And after Aryabhata was translated into Arabic (c. 820 CE) this approximation was mentioned in Al-Khwarizmi's book on algebra.\n\n**Islam**\n\nFinally we get to the Islamic mathematicians, and I will end here because Al-Khwarizmi's (780-850AD) book on algebra, he sums up many of the different ways ancient cultures have calculated \u03c0\n\n&gt;In any circle, the product of its diameter, multiplied by three and one-seventh, will be equal to the\ncircumference. This is the rule generally followed in practical life, though it is not quite exact. The\ngeometricians have two other methods. One of them is, that you multiply the diameter by itself,\nthen by ten, and hereafter take the root of the product; the root will be the circumference. The\nother method is used by the astronomers among them. It is this, that you multiply the diameter\nby sixty-two thousand eight hundred thirty-two and then divide the product by twenty thousand.\nThe quotient is the circumference. Both methods come very nearly to the same effect. . . . The\narea of any circle will be found by multiplying half of the circumference by half of the diameter,\nsince, in every polygon of equal sides and angles, . . . the area is found by multiplying half of\nthe perimeter by half of the diameter of the middle circle that may be drawn through it. If you\nmultiply the diameter of any circle by itself, and subtract from the product one-seventh and half\nof one-seventh of the same, then the remainder is equal to the area of the circle.\n\nThe first of the approximations for \u03c0 given here is the Archimedean one, 3 +1/7 . The approximation of \u03c0 by\nsqrt(10) attributed to \u201cgeometricians,\u201d was used in India as well as early on in Greece.\n(As an interesting fact, however, it is less exact than the \u201cnot quite exact\u201d value of 3 + 1/7). The earliest\nknown occurrence of the third approximation, 3.1416, was also in India, in the work of\nAryabhata as previously stated. This is probably attributed to astronomers because of its use in the Indian astronomical works that were translated into Arabic.\n\nFeel free to ask me any more questions on the History of \u03c0", "gilded": 1, "score": 704, "created": 1426335711.0},{"body": "What was the first \"modern\" attempt at calculating the value of pi?", "gilded": 0, "score": 56, "created": 1426341396.0},{"body": "Define modern?

This has become the basis for the fastest algorithms currently used by Yasumasa Kanada (1,241,100,000,000 decimal places) and the Chudnovsky brothers (4,044,000,000 decimal places) to compute \u03c0.\t\n\nIt was the Chudnovsky algorithm, based on Ramanujan's formulas, that calculated 12.1 trillion digits in December 2013, though that record has now been beaten/", "gilded": 0, "score": 79, "created": 1426342710.0},{"body": "Of note, too, is the digit formula, which can produce arbitrary hexadecimal digits more-or-less independently without computing previous digits.", "gilded": 0, "score": 11, "created": 1426348884.0},{"body": "How do they confirm that the values are correct if no one else had calculated that many digits of pi before?", "gilded": 0, "score": 4, "created": 1426370428.0},{"body": "Depends what you mean by modern, there was either [Isaac Newton]( http://egyptonline.tripod.com/newton.htm) who reached 15 digits of pi, his approximation is used in computers today.

(Merely keeping track of increasing numbers of digits is quite far from what mathematicians care about.)\n\nThe most obvious method (approximating by polygons) already appears in Archimedes' *Measurement of the circle*, where he gave the lower bound 3.1408 and the upper bound 22/7=3.1428. Thus, although pi did not have its name yet, it could be said that pi day was already 3/14 in the 2nd century BCE. In Measurement, Archimedes uses Eudoxus' method of exhaustion to prove the lovely observation that the area of a circle of radius r and perimeter p is the same as that of a right angled triangle with short sides r and p.\n\nIt would take centuries to move past polygonal approximations, when the Indian mathematician Madhava developed his [series approximations](http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005af4_54.pdf) for trigonometric functions in the 14th century. This was 200 years ahead of the Western giants Newton, Leibniz, Taylor, and Euler.\n\nBefore Taylor series (and later faster-convergent series) took over as the preferred method of approximation, Fran\u00e7ois Viete put a new twist on the polygonal approximation idea, by expressing it as the first infinite product in [his famous formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi%C3%A8te%27s_formula). Wallis would follow suit a few decades later with his own formula.\n\nPi day could be said to have gotten its name in 1706, when William Jones introduced the Greek letter to denote the constant. The notation became widespread after Euler in his \"best-seller\" analysis textbook Introductio in analysin infinitorum.\n\nIn 1761, Johann Lambert confirmed that all the calculators through the ages had in a sense been approximating in vain, when he showed that pi is irrational. A century later, [Lindemann's 1882 result](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindemann%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem) that pi is transcendental answered once and for all the age-old question of the (im)possibility of squaring the circle.

As you can see on the survey image, the complex includes several circular features. The two largest are known as the Observatory Circle (upper left) and the Great Circle (lower center). The diameter of the Observatory Circle is approximately 1050 feet (1054 to be more precise), appears to be a common unit of measure at several other Ohio Hopewell sites.

There is a very slight error in the Great Circle's construction that allows us to know that it was constructed in two large arcs. \n\nThe implications here are that the Ohio Hopewell were able to do the geometric calculations to produce squares from circles, circles from squares, and determine the areas and circumference / perimeters of both.

And this Pi Day is even more special because 3/14/15 is even more precise of an approximation of \u03c0. Have a slice of cake to celebrate. But first, why do we praise \u03c0 so much?\n\nWhy do we think \u03c0 is so special? Is it because the digits go on forever? Because that's found in the decimal notation of every number like for instance 1/3 is 0.3333... with threes repeating infinitely in one direction (and also zeroes repeating infinitely in the other).\n\nThen, is it that the pattern of these continuing digits never repeats? Well, that's only because it's an irrational number (meaning it can't be expressed as a fraction of integers) and irrational numbers aren't at all rare, so that shouldn't make it special.\n\nThere are infinitely more irrational numbers than rational ones. The amount of typical rational numbers (conventional numbers like -2 and 176 and 1/3) despite being infinite, approach 0% of the amount of numbers on the number line. The vast majority are irrational like \u03c0 - so it's not so unique. Some that you might have seen around are Euler's number, the Golden Ratio (\u03c6) and even the square root of every positive integer (except perfect squares).\n\nSo, is \u03c0 special because of its humble origins as the simple relationship between a circle's linear dimension and its perimeter? Well, it shouldn't be because not only does this exist for practically every other shape, but it is also not the most sensible ratio between a circle's linear size and circumference. (Some examples in other shapes include the ratio between the side and diagonal of a square which is Pythagoras' Constant \u221a2 [the first number to have been proven irrational] and the diagonal over the side of a pentagon which is again the Golden Ratio \u03c6 [a far more interesting number than \u03c0] )\n\nLet me explain. We set an angle of 1 radian as travelling the same distance as the radius along the edge of a circle. Going all the way around the circumference of this circle measures a number of radians which is another irrational number called Tau (\u03c4). For the visual learners [click here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Circle_radians_tau.gif). Tau, \u03c4, is similar to \u03c0 in that it compares the circumference of a circle to its linear dimension, but \u03c4 does it better in every way. (\u03c4 is the circumference of a circle over its radius, while \u03c0 is the circumference divided by the diameter.)\n\nYou might not see why \u03c4 is so superior to \u03c0 yet, so keep celebrating \u03c0 with some cake. If you ask for a slice of cake that's \u03c0 over 8, you would think you're getting a nice large slice of an eighth of the cake. But you're not! You only get a sixteenth of the cake. The cake's not a lie, \u03c0 is and it's so unnecessarily confusing it just made you lose out on half your cake!\n\nThe best reason for why \u03c4 is better, is that 1 circle is 1 \u03c4. You don't need to multiply by two when you're converting the angle to how far you've gone around the circle nor divide by two when you're converting back - \u03c0 makes radians confusing when they don't have to be.\n\nNow if I want a half a pizza, it's half \u03c4. A quarter of a pie is a quarter \u03c4. And if you ask for an eighth \u03c4 of cake, you get an eighth of the cake. No conversion needed either way; it's a piece of cake. So yes it makes radians so much clearer for so many of us who became so lost when we were suddenly plunged into the depths of trigonometry.\n\nBeyond the basics, \u03c4 also improves formulas in more advanced mathematics. Many include \"2\u03c0\" which could easily be replace by \u03c4 . But others actually become clearer when going back to their origins. Take Euler's Identity, e^(i \u03c0) = -1 known as the most beautiful equation in mathematics and surely changing it to e^(i \u03c4/2) = -1 would be muddying the equation's elegance. Instead of course, simply putting \u03c4 in Euler's original formula leads to the even more dashing e^(i \u03c4) = 1.\n\nAnd lastly the most common formula with \u03c0 on its own is the area of a circle: \u03c0 r^2. But here again \u03c0 being only half a turn makes everything more confusing. A circle is made up of an uncountable amount of very small circles. These rings can be uncurled into a triangle with the height of the triangle being the radius of the circle and the base being its circumference. Again visual learners [click here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/TriangleFromCircle.gif/220px-TriangleFromCircle.gif). \n\nSo, the original area of a circle formula is based on the area of a triangle: base \u00d7 height / 2. With height replaced by the radius r and the circumference being \u03c4 r, it makes more sense having the formula be \u03c4 r^2 / 2. (For those who know calculus, you can also integrate \u03c4r among all the rings of the circle getting the same \u03c4 r^2 / 2.)\n\nWith \u03c0, sure in this one case the twos just happen to cancel out. But this obscures our understanding of the equation and leads us to just memorizing it instead of understanding it.\n\nSo, \u03c0 isn't all that special and isn't even the most natural and logical circle constant. Enjoy Pi Day but come June 28th (6/28) celebrate Tau Day as the superior circle constant and eat twice the pie!\n\n\u03c4-ists are not \u03c0-ous.\n\n.\n\nVideos far better than this post by Vi Hart, [showing how \u03c0 isn't special](http://youtu.be/5iUh_CSjaSw) and [showing how \u03c4 is better than \u03c0](http://youtu.be/jG7vhMMXagQ).

The astronauts (Gus Grissom, Ed White, Roger Chaffee) got into the capsule at around 1:00 p.m. to start the test, but as soon as they hooked into the air system, Gus said the air in his suit smelled like sour buttermilk so they stopped the test 20 minutes in to try to figure out what was wrong.\n\nAbout an hour and a half later, they hadn't found the cause of the smell but they decided to go ahead with the test and put the hatch on. It was a three piece monstrosity that opened internally and was quite cumbersome to get on and off; in simulated emergency escapes, they couldn't get the thing off before 90 seconds had elapsed. With the capsule sealed off, they fully pressurize the cabin to 100 percent pure oxygen at 16.7 psi.\n\nSo they're in the capsule, simulating a countdown, but stuff is still going wrong; the astronauts are moving around in their seats too much, which is setting off high oxygen flow alarms for their spacesuits. More delays. Grissom's microphone was stuck open, so the astronauts had a hell of a time communicating with Mission Control and vice versa; Grissom told the CAPCOM (Deke Slayton IIRC) \"How are we going to get to the Moon if we can't talk between three buildings?\" They stopped the countdown again at 5:40 p.m. to try to fix the mic problem.\n\nThey get going again by 6:20 and had everything up to the power transfer done, but at 6:30 there's another hold in the countdown. At 6:30:54, there's a voltage transient. Ten seconds later, Chaffee notices the fire and calls it in. Grissom pushes down White's headrest so he can start opening the hatch. By this time, the pressure in the cabin is 29 psi, which pretty much prevents any inward opening hatch from opening. 15 seconds after Chaffee calls in the fire, the hull ruptures and shoots flames out of the capsule. By this time, the three astronauts are dead. \n\nThe white room (the room immediately surrounding the capsule) is devastated and filled with smoke and noxious gases and all manner of unpleasant stuff. It took rescue workers 5 minutes to get all the hatches open and another 90 minutes to get the astronauts' bodies out.

It was identified in the early 1970s in captive desert tortoise populations, and later identified in the wild population.[24] URTD is caused by the infectious agents Mycoplasma agassizii and Mycoplasma testudineum, which are bacteria in the class Mollicutes and characterized by having no cell wall and a small genome.[27][28][29] Mycoplasma appears to be highly virulent (infectious) in some populations, while it is chronic, or even dormant in others.[30] The mechanism (whether environmental or genetic) that is responsible for this diversity is not understood. Infection is characterized by both physiological and behavioral changes: nasal and ocular discharge, palpebral edema (swelling of the upper and/or lower palpebra, or eyelid, the fleshy portion that is in contact with the tortoises eye globe) and conjunctivitis, weight loss, changes in color and elasticity of the integument, and lethargic or erratic behavior.[24][31][32][33] These pathogens are likely transmitted by contact with an infected individual. Epidemiological studies of wild desert tortoises in the western Mojave Desert from 1992 to 1995 shows a 37% increase in M. agassizii.[29] Tests were conducted on blood samples, and a positive test was determined by the presence of antibodies in the blood, defined as being seropositive.\n\n[stuff deleted]\n\nThe second study indicated that captive tortoises can be a source of disease to wild Agassiz's desert tortoise populations. \n\n[more stuff delted]\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 22, "created": 1427603986.0},{"body": "Short answer: No.\n\nLong answer: Anthroponotic disease is what you're asking about but we aren't specifically a vector for anything chiefly because we are fairly new on the scene.

A vector is an organism that serves to spread a pathogen from one species (often the reservoir species) to another species, often an arthropod like a tick or mosquito. In some vector borne diseases like malaria, the vector is an essential part of the parasites life cycle -the plasmodium parasite matures in the mosquito. This is different from a zoonotic disease which is caused by a pathogen that can jump species -originally from a reservoir species to another. You seem to be equating these two classifications when they're in fact different. Certain animals are the reservoir for influenza A (aquatic birds, chickens, wild birds, etc.), but they are not vectors.  They crap out the virus or cough it out and we in turn catch it.  Short answer: vector-borne diseases are zoonotic, but not all zoonoses are vector-borne. \n\nSo we're talking about reservoirs, among other things.

More importantly, since swine are often susceptible to both human and avian strains, the risk of antigenic shift occurring is higher. Antigenic shift is where a single individual pig is infected with multiple strains of influenza, and genome segments are shared among these different strains. This makes an opportunity for a more contagious and/or pathogenic variant to be generated. Furthermore, influenza does cause disease in these other animal species, contrary to what has been said.

When under Quarantine, the vessel would fly an off white/yellow khaki flag or sails to indicate it was under quarantine.  \n\nI've been working in the field of Quarantine in Australia for about 8 years now for both Governmental and Private Industry. As to why this wouldn't happen in an actual scenario you just need to understand human nature. There are speeding limits on our roads-because we know that excess speed increases the chance of fatalities in the event of a crash. Yet people still speed...  \n\nThe same goes for Quarantine. We have a system in Australia that has existed for over 100 years (Our main piece of Legislation- The Quarantine Act of 1908) for the arrival of passengers into Australia through our airports and seaports called *Pratique*.  \n\nPratique is a simple enough concept to understand, it states that as long as the **W.H.O** or other relevant organization hasn't declared an epidemic worthy of note, then Aircraft and Vessels may land and unload passengers and cargo without Quarantine Approval (we still check with most anyway), however it mostly relates to Sick Travellers.  \n\nIf a plane, for instance lands in Australia at an airport with a sick passenger on board, it is the Captain's or the First Officer's duty by law to announce they have passengers who are ill, so that we may assess their health and determine whether or not they are carrying a \"Quarantinable Disease\". Such diseases are Rabies, Avian Influenza, Ebola and other Viral Haemmoragic Fevers, Bubonic Plague and so on.  \n\nThey rely on the cabin crew and the honesty of passengers to declare their sickness to flight crew *this doesn't always happen*...  \n\nHowever, if an epidemic has been declared such as during the height of the Ebola epidemic of 2014 or the H1N1 epidemic of 2009, then Pratique is no longer automatically granted. Any itinerant flight or voyage to Australia is subject to massive fines and legal action if they attempt to land and unload  without prior authorization from the **Australian Quarantine Inspection Service** (AQIS as they are mostly known by, also known as DAFF biosecurity and DoA biosecurity due to Governmental changes). Passengers are required to undergo either medical surveillance and/or medical examinations on arrival into Australia and her Territories.  \n\nThe reason for this is because of the reproductive rate of the Virus or Pathogen in question, the r0. If you have an r0 of 1 then you have a low risk epidemic- One infected person will only usually infect 1 other person before either dying from the infection or their immune system recovering. An r0 of 2 however allows for exponential growth of the virus through human hosts. It doesn't take many infected people to start an epidemic and it doesn't take long either.  \n\nPeople are usually surveilled by Quarantine Authorities depending on the time of the incubation period, which determines how long they're symptomatic for and in some cases how long they're infectious for. It changes from infection to infection. It *should* work, except people are unpredictable. They're afraid of scientists, they're afraid of government intervention, they don't approve of vaccinations, etc etc etc. As long as we remain as diverse a species as we are, viruses and pathogens will always be prevalent in our society.

For the moon, that number is about 0.1, meaning that it reflects about 10% of the light. [This book](https://books.google.com/books?id=c-v7OSaxGSsC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=albedo+aluminium&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XUXTa7N79d&amp;sig=ms8D3mnC-ey6PjbtM7fPIfshSiQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AcMFVZbyF_eCsQS0yIGwAQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=albedo%20aluminium&amp;f=false) has a nice table of albedos for various building materials, including \"bright aluminum foil,\" which it lists an albedo of 0.8, or 80%. \n\nTherefore, the moon now reflects 8x more light. Depending on the moon phase, we'll receive variable amounts of light on the earth. For reference, I want to show your some numbers for the luminous flux (or lux) or various light sources. Although this sounds like what a mad scientist might call his death ray, I assure you this just means how much light we get on a given area. \n\nAnyway: \n\n    Cloudly, moonless night: 0.0001 lux\n    Full moon: 0.27\u20131.0 lux\n    Twilight: 3.4 lux\n    Full moon (with aluminum foil): 2.2-8.0 lux\n    Dim Office Building Hallway: 80 lux\n    Sunrise/Sunset: 400 lux\n    Direct sunlight: 32000\u2013100000 lux\n\nSo you'll easily be able to see at night provided there is moonlight. Since the full moon is now considerably brighter than twilight, I'd suspect the sky would take on more of a navy blue color and that we'd have fewer stars visible in the night sky. The Milky Way is already quite hard to see when there is moonlight, and with a foiled-moon it will be a sight reserved for the few moonless nights each month. \n\nEven the light from a crescent moon covered in aluminum foil is brighter than a full moon without one. Fun fact: you can actually see the dark part of the crescent moon even without aluminum wrapping. Even though the dark part is not receiving direct sunlight, it's being illuminated by sunlight reflected from the earth (in much the same way the earths get a little bit of light from the moon).

In addition to marking their positions relatively accurately, he also tried recording their brightnesses. Since they didn't really have instrumentation for measuring brightness back then, he did it all by eye, assigning the very brightest stars a magnitude of 1, and the very dimmest a magnitude of 6. It wasn't exactly precise, but the system caught on since it proved useful.\n\nWhen the 1800's rolled around and astronomers wanted to codify that old magnitude system into a more precise quantifiable system, Pogson realized you could do that fairly well if you treat the scale as logarithmic and assumed that the magnitude 1 stars were 100 times brighter than magnitude 6 stars. That means every 5 magnitudes is another factor of 100x brightness. The math then works out such that one magnitude is 100^(1/5), equal to roughly a 2.51x change in brightness. That math also means if you know the difference in magnitude between two objects is X, then their ratio of brightnesses is 100^(X/5).\n\n**TL;DR**: Because 2000 years ago Ptolemy arbitrarily decided that the difference between the brightest and dimmest stars was 5.", "gilded": 0, "score": 24, "created": 1426480605.0},{"body": "Without any human made lights, and no moon, it would be too dark to see well.

The issue is that it reflects light in many different directions, and not directly back to us. This is because regolith is a rough, heterogeneous material that ultimately causes a [diffuse reflection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_reflection). In this sense, energy is still being conserved - it's just that only a portion of it is reflecting *back towards us*.\n\nHighly reflective in the sense that you mean typically means that the material generates a [specular reflection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection) - that is, that instead of scattering light in all different directions, the distribution of light is much closer to the ideal angle of reflection.\n\nFor the moon this means that, yes, when you actually can see the reflection it could be thought of as approximately 8x brighter (assuming that the surface albedo of 0.8 is including the specular reflection as well - this is a common simplification of lighting models used in that area). The problem is that as you move away from ideal the angle of reflection the light will attenuate quickly. The math gets [a bit crazy](http://www.heldermann-verlag.de/jgg/jgg01_05/jgg0312.pdf), but we call the phenomenon [specular highlights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_highlight) because they only appear on the surface where the angle of incidence, surface normal, and scattering of light coincide such that light is reflecting back to you.\n\nA great visualization of this can be found at [this shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdfGWf) - you can click and drag the light around to get a good idea of how the position of the light in relation to the camera affects how much is reflected back to you.\n\nUnfortunately, this is about where my ability to answer breaks down: to model it correctly (while conserving energy) requires the use of multiple reflectance models and an understanding of the material properties of the surface of the moon that I simply don't have. In practical terms, objects tend to have a mix of both specular and diffuse reflections, and even these wind up being approximation of effects such as sub-surface scattering that may further change how it would appear.\n\nTHAT SAID. Someone did a visualization of what [the moon would look like if it was a giant disco ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8I25H3bnNw) that I believe is probably a pretty decent approximation.", "gilded": 0, "score": 29, "created": 1426469537.0},{"body": "But this disco ball visualization uses a much closer version of the moon.

However, the portrayal from low orbit - specifically [at about 4:30 in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=w8I25H3bnNw#t=270) shows about what a highly reflective surface in orbit would look as opposed to a diffuse one. \n\nThe difference at that point is largely one of scale and accuracy/material properties: because of the nature of specular reflections, light reflected off of a highly reflective surface is going to appear to fall off significantly less than that reflected off of a diffuse surface because it scatters less. This analogous to how a laser is able to illuminate (and appears brighter) at a much greater distance than that of an incandescent light bulb: the emitted photons of light are spread across a much smaller area, and thus do not spread as much over distance.\n\nIt is also likely that the reflection of the Earth would be significantly more prominent than it is today if the surface of the Moon was smooth enough. You can already see light reflected off of the Moon (earth shine) during certain phases, it would simply be a matter of the light being scattered less.

Here's proof:\n\nLet's say that the tea is drinkable at temperature T\u2082 (heat energy per volume), and is at temperature T\u2081 to begin with. The volumes being equal in both cases, we can refer directly to the heat energies of the beverages, i.e. the average kinetic energy. H\u2082 is drinkable, H\u2081 is what we start with.\n\nNow, in time t, the hot tea sheds off an amount of heat equal to D\u2081, and the milk-tea sheds off D\u2082. We know that heat seeps out of the hot tea more quickly, therefore for time t, D\u2081 &gt; D\u2082 . This is a kind of fundamental premise that you just have to accept, that hot things lose more of their heat energy in an equivalent time.\n\nNow, let's get back to our desired temperature. The final volume always being equal, we know that our desired energy in that volume, H\u2082, is a sum of the following: The heat energy of the tea, H\u2081, the heat energy of the milk, H\u2083, and the some amount of heat H\u2084 that was shed due to waiting for time t\u2083. To pre-empt what may be your next question, we'll allow t\u2083 to also be zero, i.e. we spend no time waiting for the tea to cool and only use milk.\n\nSince we're using the same cold milk, and the same amount, both times, H\u2083 remains an (unknown) constant.\n\nThe temperature of the final mixture is determined by this sum: H\u2081 + H\u2083 - H\u2084, and we know our desired temperature is thus attained, therefore:\n\n H\u2082 = H\u2081 + H\u2083 - H\u2084\n\nNow, we always started with the same hot tea, so H\u2081 doesn't change between methods A and B. The milk is also the same, so H\u2083 doesn't change between methods A and B. What really determines how fast we get to H\u2082 is the speed at which H\u2084 increases. H\u2084 is either D\u2081 (method A), or D\u2082 (method B). For the same t, D\u2081 &gt; D\u2082. But if they are allowed different times, t\u2081 for D\u2081, and t\u2082 for D\u2082, then D\u2081 = D\u2082 implies t\u2081 &lt; t\u2082\n\nIf H\u2084 is zero (the tea doesn't require time to cool, just adding milk brings it to the temperature we want), then t\u2081, t\u2082, D\u2081 and D\u2082 are all zero, and t\u2081 = t\u2082 .\n\nIt follows from this, that t\u2081 *is always either less than or equal to t\u2082*. Therefore:\n\nIf the tea does not require time to cool, but just adding milk is enough to bring it to the temperature we want, then methods A and B are equally fast, as both simply involve pouring milk, and no waiting time. But in every other case, method A always involves less waiting. Method B **is never faster than method A, regardless of the target temperature**.

The loss of this energy will lower the temperature of the liquid.\n\nAlso, adding the milk will perform some sort of averaging function on the tea, which will be a linear reduction in temperature.\n\nLets take half a liter of hot tea at 96^o C, and lets claim that the room is at 32 degrees, and I'll be adding in half a liter of milk at 32^o C at some point.  That will result in the temperature (above room temp) being cut in exactly half, as equal volumes of liquid are averaged.\n\nLet's also state that the half-life of the tea (k) equals 1 minute.  So every minute, the tea will drop in temperature (above room temperature) by half.\n\nOne last caveat - we're going to assume that adding milk negligibly increases the surface area, and therefore doesn't alter the rate of energy exchanged for a given temperature difference.

So that's energy, per second, per square centimeter.  *Note: loss of energy depends on surface contact,* not *volume*.\n\nThe amount of energy exchanged is a linear amount that scales with the difference in temperature between the two mediums.  So twice the temperature difference means twice the energy exchanged each second, for a given amount of surface contact.\n\nBut when you have a small amount of material that has a significant difference in temperature, like a cup of tea, the temperature of the tea will drastically change as it loses energy.  And because temperature is *energy density* in a material, a loss in temperature is linearly related to energy loss.  This is why it's an exponential decay.  Because as the liquid loses energy, it cools down, and thus the rate that it loses energy, and thus drops in temperature, goes down.\n\n*All of the above* is combined and encompassed into that single half-life time constant **k**.  Which does a good job of modeling how much time has to pass for the temperature difference between a medium and the general environment to be cut in half for a scenario with all parameters fixed apart from the temperature.\n\n**Answer to question here**\n\nBut when we add the milk, we change something else.  We change the *volume*.  Temperature can be thought of as a measurement of energy density based on the properties of the material.  For instance, water has a specific heat of 4.14 Joules/ml (or Joules/gram).  Which means it takes ~ 4 joules of energy to raise 1 gram of water 1 Kelvin/degree Celsius.  And a loss of 4 joules means the temperature of 1ml of water will have decreased by 1 degree.\n\nSo if I have a scenario where my 500ml of tea is bleeding off ~2000 Joules per second for a given temperature, the whole volume is going to be dropping in temperature by 1 degree per second.\n\n*But* if I have I have 1000ml of tea/milk mixture and otherwise the same set-up (roughly same liquid, and same surface area), then I'll still only lose ~2000 Joules per second.  Which means that for 1000ml of liquid, the temperature *will only drop by half a degree per second*.\n\nSo that's the answer.  For identical set-ups, but different volumes, the two cups of liquid will lose *energy* at the same rate, but one with twice the volume will only drop *by half the temperature* for each second.  So for a given 'k' which is the rate that my smaller cup of tea loses half its temperature over a certain amount of time, a volume twice as big can be approximated as only losing *one-quarter* of its temperature for the same amount of time.\n\n*Edit* - I see your edit, but I'm going to leave this up anyway for people that have unimaginable attention-spans.", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1427074168.0},{"body": "If you don't like calculus, you could just drop it into an excel sheet and do that calculation every second, heck you could even add a section whuch evaluated the mixing of milk after cooling and evaluate exactly how many seconds it would take to make a perfect cup of tea.", "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "created": 1427051322.0},{"body": "What about the container?
