I was just trying to show the somewhat ironic difference between one of the world's most atheist countries which was once deeply religious in its constitution (and still is, but to a much much smaller degree), and one of the world's most religious countries, which is deliberately non-religious in its constitution. Anyway, read it if you want; I cant very well just delete it now that Ive taken this long to write it :p )\n\nIt's... ironic, or something, that the founding fathers of the US went to great lengths to specifically keep religion and God out of the constitution and to keep church and state separate, while the US is now one of the most religious countries, with people just flat out denying that God isnt in the constitution.\n\nMeanwhile, my country (Norway) is today one of the more [atheist countries in the world](http://www.parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/norway.jpg) but when the constitution was written and signed in 1814, there was one section in particular that was rather heavily pro-protestantism/anti everyone else. And it's not like this was buried in \u00a7138 or something. No, this was \u00a72. Considering \u00a71 is just declaring Norway an independent monarchy, they obviously thought this shit quite important to put it in already at \u00a72:\n\n&gt; \u00a72. Den evangelisk-lutherske Religion forbliver Statens offentlige Religion. De Indvaanere, der bekjende seg til den, ere forpligtede til at opdrage sine B\u00f8rn i samme. Jesuitter og Munkeordener maae ikke taales. J\u00f8der ere fremdeles udelukkede fra Adgang til Riget.\n\nWhich translates as (sorry if my translation is a bit awkward sounding; I can write English just fine (I think?), but when it comes to translating to English from my own language, I somehow struggle a lot)\n\n&gt; \u00a72. Lutheranism shall remain the State's religion. The citizens who pledge to it (is this the right way to say it? probably not) are also obligated to raise their children the same. Jesuits and munk orders are not to be tolerated. Jews will still be denied access to the Kingdom.\n\n(In case you are wondering about the \"shall remain\" and \"still be denied\" wording, Norway was until 1814 in a \"union\" with (owned by, really) Denmark, and judging by how it is worded, thats how the law was when we were part of Denmark as well). Not quite the open and free and tolerating Norway we have today. The \"Jew section\" was removed in 1851, on the fourth attempt (it was also voted on in 1842, 1845, and 1848; all three times it was voted to keep it). For munks it was changed in 1897.\n\nThe \"Jesuit section\" is even more depressing, as it wasnt changed until 1956. It was voted on in 1897, but didnt receive the required majority (2/3 majority to change anything in the constitution). It was voted on again in 1925, but didnt even manage to get a majority at all then. The only reason it was ditched in 1956, was because Norway was ratifying the European Convention on Human Rights, and kinda had to get rid of that blemish in order to do so. *Nineteen* fifty six... after WW2. *After* Quisling had reinstated the Jew section during the war, and for which he was convicted of \"unlawful changing of the constitution\" after the war. They *still* kept the very similar law active for Jesuits for another eleven years. That boggles the mind.\n\nThe first part of \u00a72 remained the same for another 8 years, when freedom of religion was introduced. We introduced religious freedom in *1964*, and we mock America?? Even after 1964 the requirement of parents to raise their children in the Lutheran faith, if they themselves were members of the state religion, remained.\n\nIn 2012 it was changed so that we no longer have an official State religion.\n\nThe so far last revision of \u00a72 was made in 2014, and it is now as follows:\n\n&gt; Verdigrunnlaget forblir v\u00e5r kristne og humanistiske arv. Denne grunnlov skal sikre demokratiet, rettsstaten og menneskerettighetene.\n\nWhich translates as\n\n&gt; Our value foundation will remain our christian and humanistic heritage. This constitution shall secure the democracy, (apparently there is no English translation for rettsstat: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechtsstaat ), and the human rights.\n\n(the part about religious freedom was moved to \u00a716).

And while that child never had a minute of life or even coherent sentient thoughts, to their parents, they were a real person, someone they already loved.  Think of how that's all snatched away in an instant.  No closure, no respect.  Just forget that baby ever existed.\n\n12 years ago some very good friends of mine went into the hospital on their due date as her contractions got close enough.  And 30 minutes after they were there, due to a very rare complication, they lost the baby.  My friend, in the worst moment of her life, was then told she still had to go through labor.  Can you imagine that?  The insanity of all your hopes and happiness destroyed and then being told you had to endure the worst pain imaginable for the next 6-12 hours- for nothing.\n\nTheir dead child was born early in the morning, and all they wanted to do was go home.  They refused to talk to the doctors, they refused to see their family who had been called for support.\n\nThe hospital brought in a nurse who is specifically trained and called in for this.  She convinced them (almost demanded) that they spend what few minutes they had with their daughter.  She told them to dress her, to hold her and to take a few pictures.  They eventually came around, and did all that.  Possibly the hardest thing they have ever done.  It was all awful, all painful.\n\nBut they spent the time they could with their daughter.  And when the dust settled, and they went on to have two more children, they are very thankful that the nurse had them do those things.  They planned for years to have that baby, spent 9 months loving the idea of her.  And when disaster struck, and though there was not much left for them to do, *they did everything they could for her*, which was to hold her, dress her and take pictures of her.  This was their daughter, and they owed her whatever they could do for her.  And now, years later, they feel better knowing that they did those things.  Not because it did anything for a life that didn't even have a chance to breathe even one breath of air, but for themselves.  They were her parents, even if it was for only a few minutes, and they can feel proud that they honored her even in the worst moment of their lives.\n\nThey have one of those pictures on their wall.  It's morbid, the baby is splotchy and clearly dead.  But it's all they have of her- and they are glad to have it.\n\nFor as much of a shit bag as Santorum is, he loves his family.  And when that child died prematurely, they did the same thing- they took her home and spent that short time they had with her as a family.  I would have said the same thing as you had I not known these friends of mine, but through my friends' tragedy I discovered that there's more to this than just some crazy embryo loving psychos.\n\nTLDR:  there's a lot of reasons to hate Santorum, but their treatment of that lost child was really one of the most humane and beautiful things they have ever done.\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 75, "created": 1426614564.0},{"body": "Thank you for your words, your story, and your empathy.\n\nPeople can despise someone for their politics, their hypocritical stances, their choices...\n\nBut some people, once they have judged another, can no longer see them as a multidimensional person that can have real feelings and real pain.\n\nPeople can criticize a man, but don't mock about the death of an unborn child.

There are other areas that are between these two extremes, though. Hospitals? Small businesses? Huge multinational conglomerates? All of these are both private in ownership but public in service, to different degrees. Hospitals shouldn't be able to discriminate at all, because what they offer is necessary.

(I'm counting only the gospels here)", "gilded": 0, "score": 8, "created": 1427551068.0},{"body": "I thought that businesses already had the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason? I think I might have seen signs saying that in front of convenience stores.", "gilded": 0, "score": 34, "created": 1427538926.0},{"body": "This gets tricky and there are a lot of nuances.  Generally speaking there are [protected classes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_class) under federal law such as race, gender, age etc... and it is generally illegal to discriminate against these groups as a private business.  As a private business you could not refuse to serve Hispanics for instance.  There are some exceptions, I haven't looked into but for example women's shelters skirt around some gender discrimination laws by having women's only shelters (for the record I support having women's only shelters).  These protected classes were first created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and have been expanded since then.  \n\nThese anti-discrimination laws have also been interpreted to offer some protection to non-protected classes.  Generally, the courts have said that businesses can not arbitrarily discriminate against non-protected groups.  For example a business likely could not arbitrarily bar Red Sox fans from entering their business.\n\nHowever, business generally can refuse to serve anyone if they have a valid reason.  Restaurants refusing to serve someone who isn't fully clothed is fine for sanitation reasons.  Or if someone is harassing customers or employees the business can kick them out.  Additionally, you generally can discriminate against a group if there is a compelling reason.  Going back to the Red Sox fan, while generally they probably couldn't bar them under different circumstances they probably could.  Suppose Red Sox and Yankees fans in the area were notorious for getting into fights and causing problems, under this scenario they could bar anyone wearing athletic wear to try and prevent fights.\n\nThe problem is is that Sexual Orientation is not a federally protected class, meaning that it doesn't have the fully protection of the Civil Rights Act, which gives businesses more leeway in discriminating against them.  Many State and local municipalities have expanded the law so that within their jurisdiction sexual orientation is a protected class.  What the new legislation in Indiana does is says that the state or local government can not burden a person exercise of religious believe unless the government has a compelling interest.  This could overrule some local municipalities that have declared sexual orientation a protected class.  This law can not allow businesses to discriminate against people who are part of a federally protected class.  So, regardless of how devoutly someone believes women shouldn't have shoes a shoe store couldn't refuse to sell to woman.  But, since sexual orientation is not a protected class if someone believes that homosexuality is religiously immoral in Indiana they now have a much greater leeway in refusing to serve gay customers.  Since, now the government is more or less barred from intervening on behave of the gay customer.\n\nNow many states have similar laws on the books.  However, the reason Indiana's is drawing so much attention is because of the timing.  Most states created these laws in the 90s after a similar federal law.  And at the time there wasn't as prominent of a gay rights movement, and the laws weren't seen as specifically targeting gays.  However, Indiana's decision to push the law through seems heavily influenced by recent gains for gay rights.  There were several relatively high profile disputes in which religious business owner (usually bakers and florist) refused to provide services for gay weddings.  This new law would limit what gay couples could do if a business refused to serve them.\n\n**tl;dr:  Generally no businesses can not discriminate for any reason.  However, they can refuse service to anyone if they have a compelling reason.  The new law would make it easier for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians.**", "gilded": 0, "score": 106, "created": 1427541968.0},{"body": "It also gives them the same right to discriminate against the federally unprotected class of \"state reps who voted for this bill and Governor Pence.\"", "gilded": 0, "score": 13, "created": 1427545844.0},{"body": "&gt; As a private business you could not refuse to serve Hispanics for instance.\n\nAs a private business you could not refuse to serve Hispanics on the grounds that they are Hispanics.

As an exmormon living in Utah I feel like we all have maybe some hunches, but nonetheless there is no proof. It is dishonest to claim otherwise.\n\nAlso, Carl Wimmer, the author of this blog, is a former Mormon and a former legislator. He converted to some form of evangelical Christianity (not sure which, I wish I knew more), and is known for having a pretty hefty axe to grind with the Mormon church. His arguments generally are based on the idea that his insane religion is better than the predominant insane religion. He is a zealot, both religiously and politically (right wing style). He also has an axe to grind with the Utah Legislature. More importantly, he dislikes how Mormonism affects the Utah Legislature, but in ways that don't make sense (like, for example, the fact that Mormonism doesn't want to support abortion bills is a bad thing to him).\n\nMy point in talking about this is that we need to consider the source of this information. PPIs are real, but they rarely lead to excommunications. Excommunications are real, but Utah legislators are rarely, if ever, excommunicated by voting against church policies. So, at some level, there are inconsistencies in his story.\n\nMormonism is bad, and the Utah Legislature can be absurd at times. It is also heavily Mormon. Nonetheless, it doesn't do us well to be making up stuff just to make them look even worse than they normally would look.

However the United States isn't the Soviet Union, except for a couple of notable exceptions (Amtrak, the Post Office, FDIC, etc.) there aren't any public businesses.\n\n&gt; That a business can turn away gays (or anyone else due to religious objections) is problematic and a very, very slippery slope\n\nI actually am not sure I agree with this.

If they want to shoot themselves in the foot I'm not sure it's the government's job to tell them that they can't.\n\nI think it really comes down to how people's lives are being impacted by a business's decision to deny service. For instance I'm totally okay with a christian small business owner deciding not to provide flowers for a gay wedding, in the scheme of things it's not a big deal and there are tons of competitors that would love to have the business. I think it would not be okay if a hospital decided not to treat a patient because they were gay. On this topic there are a couple of key questions you need to answer:\n\n* How important are the services this business provides for the community?\n* How many competitors are there that can fill the hole left by this business?\n* How much effort is it to find an alternative business that will serve them?\n\nFor instance if a local Starbucks franchise owner decided to deny service to gays it wouldn't be a huge deal because they're in big cities there is one on pretty much every street corner. If Starbucks as company decided to deny service it'd be a huge deal because they are a huge portion of the coffee shop market and it'd be a large impact.\n\nPractically speaking gays have more money than straight people do because:\n\n* They are both men (no female pay gap problems)\n* They can't have biological kids (more disposable income)\n* They can't have unplanned pregnancy (more disposable income)\n* They are less likely to be stay at home parents (dual income)\n* They are more likely to attain higher education (able to get better jobs)\n\nSo unlike African Americans in the deep south gays are actually a pretty lucrative demographic to go after.
