The Playstation website back then would not allow you to do it online, the only way was to do it via PS3, or by contacting customer support. I called customer support about a month before my renewal date, who fully assured me the automatic renewal had been turned off. A month later, and lo and behold \u00a340 out my bank and I have a new year of PS+. I immediately contacted Sony again, and was repeatedly told that customer services were not able to cancel auto renewal over the phone, it MUST be done via the website or the console. Now a few years ago, you absolutely COULD NOT do it via the website. I even screenshotted the FAQ page that specified I had to do it via the console or customer services, but then customer services told they couldn't do it and I should use the website (I didn't actually have access to my PS3 online at that time, so I couldn't use that). Even though I'd shown them proof that the website couldn't so it and it directed me to them.\n\nSony managers were outright rude and arrogant, and refused to believe there was a problem. They refused to refund me, and similar to OP said, if I had my bank reverse the charge they would ban my account. I know a \u00a340 renewal is nothing compared to OP's problem, but the way Sony respond to these things is cartoonishly bad. I had a problem with Microsoft billing, contacted them and I was refunded immediately, they couldn't stop apologising to me when it was a mere misunderstanding, nothing they particularly messed up. It is utterly impossible to escalate any issue you have with Sony, they will not give out contact details for real complaints to anyone but their own services department and the managers there are even more condescending than the regular staff.\n\nThat whole episode really damaged my view of Sony as a company, and I now avoid Sony products and services full stop, I will not support any company that thinks it's ok to treat its customers like total shit.

The only way to access the alley is to get a big vehicle like an ambulance or Trashmaster and use it to jump over the wall. In the alley, [this is on one of the walls.](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130309153321/gtawiki/images/f/f8/644337_420569164692158_1791283427_n.jpg)\n\n* In GTA Vice City, there is a tall building in Downtown right next to another shorter building with a helipad on top which you can access. If you jump off the roof into a certain part of the taller building, you will pass right through as it has intentionally not been made solid. Inside is a small room with a chocolate egg on a pedestal saying \"Happy Easter!\"\n\n* In San Andreas, there is the OP easter egg, an information sign at a visitor centre in San Fierro. The bridge in reference is the Gant Bridge, based off the Golden Gate.\n\n* On top of one of the orange suspension arches of the Gant Bridge, there is a sign saying \"There are no easter eggs up here. Go away.\"\n\n* In GTA Liberty City Stories, if you go back to the alleyway from GTA III, the sign says \"Hello again!\" in the PSP version. In the PS2 version, it says \"You just can't get enough of this alley, can you?\"\n\n* In GTA Vice City Stories, set two years before Vice City, the Easter Egg room is there but it is under construction.\n\n* In GTA IV, you can fly a helicopter over a particular balcony on the side of the Statue of Happiness and jump out onto it. There is a door there which leads inside the statue, with signs saying \"No hidden content this way\". From there you can go inside the statue and climb up a ladder, where you will find a giant beating heart suspended in the statue by chains.\n\nHere are some more:\n\n* In GTA V in Ludendorff, you pass a bridge during the Prologue. Underneath the bridge is a frozen creek, and there is an alien underneath the ice.\n\n* In GTA III behind the ridge in Shoreside Vale, the set for the intro cutscene can be seen floating about the ocean.\n\n* Not much further north from there is the edge of the gameworld. If you fly there using the Dodo, you will see text on the radar. They are made up place names, named after developers of GTA III.\n\n* In Vice City, there is an apartment building in Ocean Beach, and one of the apartments is accessible. Inside, you can go into the bathroom which has a chainsaw weapon pickup and blood splattered all over the bath.

Epic was one of the first few companies to get into licensing 3D engine technology for games, and their product has been one of the top game development packages for more than 15 years. The list of titles that use Unreal is just staggering, at over 600 games: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unreal_Engine_games \n\n(tl;dr of that list: Unreal was used for Bioshock &amp; Bioshock Infinite, Gears of War, Borderlands, the Tom Clancy franchise, the Batman: Arkham franchise, the original Deus Ex, etc. etc. etc.)\n\n\nIt gets better: With the release of Unreal Engine 4 (aka UE4, the latest version), Epic has made it very clear that they want to focus on game developers as their customers. The workflow has improved drastically, the engine was expanded to cross-compile to pretty much every platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, IOS, XB1 and PS4.  Yeah. They've added optimizations to run better on mobile devices and began to support 2d games as well. \n\n\nEpic used to license Unreal for a 25% royalty on gross revenue, but a few years back they relaxed that to 5% for indie devs. When they released UE4, they offered it for just that royalty plus $20/month per person.\n\n\nAnd now, it doesn't even cost $20. Now the whole package is free for you and every indie dev in the world to play with until they can build something that makes money. This means more indy games at higher quality, and more students and amateurs learning the engine which will lead to more talent to make AAA games as well. \n\nGreat move on Epic's part.

Once you learn the basics of programming, just make programs that aren't super useful, but test your abilities.
