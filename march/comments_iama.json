If you \"vote\" for things without DRM, and you have a lot of others voting the same as you... then the product without DRM will take control of the market over the products with DRM.

DRM stands for Digital RIGHTS Management. To protect the rights of the creator of the product.  So iOS doesn't allowed unsigned Apps because part of the design of the iOS PRODUCT is to protect users from themselves. That is part of their product, apps are vetted by Apple to keep you secure. If you don't like it... don't use it. Go use Android. \"Vote\" with your wallet.  If nobody was buying iPhones because of DRM.... Apple would change their tune.

They hack into companies to steal super sensitive data like SIM card encryption keys which give them unlimited access to private cellular communications all over the globe. They do much more than just implement programs like PRISM to spy on users of Google and Facebook. The NSA uses the surveillance grid to prevent other countries from getting economic advantages over the US and the information extracted from [XKEYSCORE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore) can easily be used to silence, frame or blackmail anyone that objects to these illegal actions.

Amnesty, the U.S. Supreme Court held, in a 5-4 vote, that the ACLU\u2019s plaintiffs in that case lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the 2008 FISA Amendments Act\u2014the same statute the government now invokes to justify the NSA\u2019s \u201cupstream\u201d surveillance.  The Court reasoned that the plaintiffs didn\u2019t have the right to challenge the statute because they couldn\u2019t show a sufficient likelihood that their communications were being monitored.

I say this for a few reasons.  First, thanks to Snowden, we know much more about the government\u2019s surveillance practices now than we did when Clapper v. Amnesty was argued and decided.  (It was argued in the fall of 2012 and decided in February 2013, just a few months before the first Snowden revelations began to appear in the Guardian and Washington Post.)  Second, the government itself has now acknowledged and confirmed many of the key facts about the NSA\u2019s upstream surveillance.  Third, the volume of Wikimedia\u2019s communications is so incredibly large that there is simply no way the government could conduct upstream surveillance without sweeping up a substantial number of those communications.  \n\nI\u2019m sure the government will argue that Clapper v.

(It was argued in the fall of 2012 and decided in February 2013, just a few months before the first Snowden revelations began to appear in the Guardian and Washington Post.)  Second, the government itself has now acknowledged and confirmed many of the key facts about the NSA\u2019s upstream surveillance.

This was when Brian was really having some mental issues.  During the course of the conversation, I kept seeing Brian out of the corner of my eye, just kind of staring at us from different angles.  Finally, he came up to the table, bent down and whispered in my ear \u2018Hey Alice, introduce me to John Lennon.\u2019  I couldn\u2019t BELIEVE that these two men had never met!  They were virtually neck and neck in the 60\u2019s as the greatest bands on the planet, and I\u2019m SURE they must have crossed paths at some point.  But then I thought to myself, \u2018Wow, if they REALLY have never met, I\u2019m going to be the one to introduce them and become a part of rock history!\u2019  So I merely said, \u2018Brian Wilson, this is John Lennon.  John Lennon, this is Brian Wilson.\u2019  Lennon was very cordial and polite, saying things like \u2018Hello Brian, I\u2019ve always wanted to meet you.  I\u2019ve always admired your work, and Paul and I considered Pet Sounds one of the best albums ever made.\u2019  Brian thanked him and walked away, at which point Lennon went right back to his conversation like nothing had happened.  About ten minutes later, Brian came by our table again, leaned down and whispered something to Bernie, and all of a sudden, Bernie was saying \u2018Brian Wilson, this is John Lennon.  John Lennon, Brian Wilson.\u2019  Lennon was just as cordial and polite as the first time, saying essentially the same thing about always wanting to meet him.  As soon as Brian walked away, John looked at both of us and casually said in his typical Liverpudlian accent, \u2018I\u2019ve met him hundreds of times.

He took such a great amount of pleasure from everything in life, and I think that of all the characters in the show, yours is the best to emulate. Most people can't be Leslie or Ben. Not everyone can change the world, or lead others to do so. But everyone can be a Jerry Gergich. Everyone can show up, roll up their sleeves, and help. Even when they mess up, or make a fool of themselves, they can, like Larry, pick themselves up and move on. You played the most important character on the show because you showed that no matter who you relate to on the show, everyone can keep trying and trying, and that something good can come from that. That life is something to marvel at. Thanks. I hope others see your work on the show as being as uplifting as I do.\n\nFor my questions: Are there any moments that were cut involving Terry that you felt added to or expanded the character?
