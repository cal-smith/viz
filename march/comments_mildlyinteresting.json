There are several things they could have done to make them more aesthetically pleasing, less thick, etc. \n\nYou have a very strong prescription characterized by a very thin lens center that increases a lot as the lens size gets bigger (i.e., your lens is concave).  Because of this, you should always try to get the smallest, ROUNDEST frame you can tolerate.  There is a reason John Lennon wore \"John Lennon\" glasses. He was nearsighted as well and small round frames made the lenses much less thick on the sides.\n\nIf you don't like that look though and want to stick with small square frames, then they are going to grind the prescription only in the center of the lens (like they did in the picture).  The edges will be beveled thinner (like in the picture again) and will not have a prescription, **however**, ask them to polish and round-over that outside edge anyways. Adding an anti-reflective coating on that lens will keep the rounded-over edge from causing annoying reflections.  All of this will give the illusion of a thinner lens and give you less of that \"coke-bottle\" look. Done well, a polished and rounded lens looks no thicker on the edges than the frame itself.\n\nYou can also \"hide\" some of the outer lens thickness by selecting a frame with a thicker edge itself.  Plastic frames are good at doing this. A variation on this is to have a black frame, and then paint the very edges of the lens black as well to make them look like part of the frame.  Again, this is just aesthetics, it just minimizes the look of a thick lens.\n\nAnother thing you can do to increase the aesthetics is to have the entire lens coated with an anti-glare coating. It will minimize the reflections coming off the lens.\n\nFinally, there are lens materials that have a high index of refraction. That simply means that they curve light more, so you don't need as thick a lens to get the same prescription.\n\nOf course, the best way to deal with a prescription this powerful is to wear contact lenses, if you are capable to doing so. Naturally you can't keep your contacts in 24/7/365, so you should always have a pair of back-up glasses.", "gilded": 3, "score": 5128, "created": 1425765461.0},{"body": "Wow, haha.

Trivex, plastic, impact resistant, polycarbonate, transitions, polarized, Hoya, Essilor, Carl Zeiss, Sola, Younger, KB Co, X-Cel, we've got instant access to them all.\n\nWe also have an on site anti-reflection coating lab.  Hair nets, HEPA filtering, lint free lab coats, it's a crazy clean lab.  You will not see any pits or dust particles in these lenses.

Morpheus wore some in The Matrix. Their very small round size means the lens can be made as thin as possible. With your high prescription though, ask to try them out first.  Not always easy to find this type of glasses.\n\nAnother suggestion is multi-lens arrangements.  This is when you wear a more comfortable soft contact lens that only partially corrects your vision, and also prescription glasses on top of that.  Because the contacts correct a portion of your vision, the glasses don't need to be as strong a prescription.\n\nFinally, you've probably heard the term \"PD\" or \"Pupillary Distance\" before. This is the distance from the center of each of your pupils to the other.  Ask your optician what your PD is. Now, when you are shopping for glasses, look on the frame for the \"frame size\". It is usually two numbers separated by a box, [like this](http://dqqzjdqmiszdy.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/uploads/frame-size2.jpg).  Take those two frame number and add them.  You want to find a frame size that equals your PD. Why? Because that means they don't have to grind your lenses slightly \"offset\" of each other so that the lenses are in the middle of your eyes.

Absolutely not. All of that material, especially if they are actually able to get a higher index material, is going to be reflection city. It would be extremely distracting to anyone with that RX.\n\nNext, a plastic frame, no matter what, is never going to hide the thickness or severity of this RX. Myodiscs are quite apparent to even a casual observer and without a frame around 17mm thick at the edge, perfectly round and perfectly centered on this patient's PD, choice of frame type doesn't really matter. Your variant in this department is actually a good idea, less light coming in from the edge of this lens is better.\n\nHigh index may not be an option in this level of RX. Without being more handsy with these lenses, I could not speak to what material they are but there are not a ton of extra thick lens blank options out there in 1.67 or 1.74.\n\nLong story short, these look good for what they are.

See the slight greenish hue to the reflection in the first pic? Hard to tell though.

There are only a small handful of specialty labs in the country that would take on something like this, anyway, so it wasn't made by someone who didn't know what they were doing.\n\nEDIT: If OP or anyone else wishes to Google further, the technical name for the lens type done here is a myodisc.", "gilded": 0, "score": 64, "created": 1425775731.0},{"body": "Nearly every time a high myopic patient or hyperopic pt gets an edge polish, they come back and complain that they are getting too much glare and we have to rough up the sides again.

I would offer a bit of a caveat, though: some people (especially highly myopic folks, such as yourself) can have problems tolerating highly polished edges. When the edges are frosted, as yours are now, it creates an area that you cannot see through. While it is certainly less attractive, you will quickly learn to almost subconsciously ignore this unusable area of the lenses. When you polish the edges, that same area now allows light to pass more readily through, but what you see through it will be extremely distorted. It is also much more difficult to ignore. Complaints about severe nausea are not uncommon.\n\nThis decision boils down to aesthetics versus function. If the lenses are polished, they can usually be frosted fairly easily again. The reverse is often not true. There is a definite limit to how much a lens can be worked. To be honest, this can take quite a bit of time and effort in the lab (especially for those of us who care about our craftsmanship, not everyone does), and can sometimes be costly. And it is not a job everyone can handle.\n\nAll that being said, some people in your situation tolerate polished edges perfectly well. It is a completely individual thing that can be hard to tell beforehand. If you have had trouble adjusting to glasses (that were properly made and fitted) in the past, you are probably more likely to struggle. The best thing to do would be to sit down with your optician and discuss in detail what you've read here and above. They should be more than happy to discuss all of this with you. If possible, also talk to the person who does the actual lab work, if they are on site.\n\nAgain, I concur with the commenter above pretty much completely. I only offer this advice because I've been doing this for longer than i would like to admit, and I've seen this exact situation go south a number of times. I have also done more than my share of lab work in an office that focuses largely on geriatric patients, who tend to have extreme prescriptions more often than others. Best of luck, and I hope you find the best possible solution for you.\n\nSorry, one more thing: While high index (thinner and lighter) materials are available, it may be difficult or impossible to get them for an Rx as high as yours. Labs start the process of making your lenses with material called blanks. They are limited to what they can use depending on the availability of the proper blanks from large manufacturers or specialty labs. Just so you know, the basic plastic used is called CR-39. Pretty much every lens made is available in that material. The best case scenario would be if you could get any of the various materials referred to as \"high index\" plastic.

Extra light tends to come in from the edges and cause unnecessary reflections and shit. It may look good to some, but I do not think it is worth it. With your level of myopia, you should be concerned with practicality first, aesthetics second. \n\nTotally agree with the smallest, roundest frame possible. To avoid the thickness on the temporal edge of minus lenses, try to find a frame where the frame P.D. closely matches your own P.D to avoid excessive decentration. Plastic frames may help hide the thickness of your lenses.\n\nI guess that your glasses would be quite heavy from the lenses. I would suggest that you try larger sized nose pads - maybe 14-17mm. Soft silicone pads tend to be more comfortable than PVC or other harder materials. Frey and Winkler (avoid Chinese-made silicone nose pads \u2013 they are poorly moulded) make excellent \"Air Active\" type nose pads which allow air to go in and out, like a cushion. There are other silicone nose pads that have a cushioning gel in, but I haven\u2019t tried those. Alternately, try a saddle/strap nose bridge to help distribute the weight evenly on your nose. Consider nose pads to be consumables and replace them as required because some nose pads (PVC?) become harder and yellow with age.\n\nSomewhat related \u2013 I would suggest that you have a spare pair of glasses on hand in a familiar place. I presume that you rely heavily them and it might pay in the future to have a spare pair. Whenever you get a new prescription, opt to purchase a totally new pair of glasses instead of reglazing your old frames.

And his defense of *a priori* knowledge equally absurd. Mathematics and logic may be *a priori* systems of thought, but what makes them useful rather than abstract mental exercises is the ability to *apply them to our observations of reality*. That is the art of reasoning.  Without empirical observation, *a priori* systems of thought like logic and math only produce trivial solutions - things that are technically valid, but meaningless. Does a meaningless truth have the same value as a rationally constructed truth derived from empirical observation?   \n\n[Furthermore Huemer's criticisms of Rand are themselves not uncontroversial.](https://utilitynussbaumrand.wordpress.com/2006/09/27/mike-huemers-8-objections-to-rand-a-response/)\n\n&gt; I'm also curious to know why you think Rand's philosophical stuff isn't taken seriously by the vast majority of current professional philosophers if she had everything right?\n\nWell first because she called most of today's academic philosophy and the thinkers they reference hacks and frauds.

If they did then we'd be well and truly fucked. \n\nAnd the second reason is because Objectivism is utterly incompatible with postmodernism and deconstruction. Which I don't view as a bad thing.

That doesn't seem very trivial to me.  \n\n&gt;but what makes them useful  \n\nHuemer doesn't care what makes it useful. He's asking whether the ability to know something without external evidence *exists*. It seems that if you buy into that idea (like you have with math and logic) then you disagree with the Objectivists.   \n\n&gt;Does a meaningless truth have the same value as a rationally constructed truth derived from empirical observation  \n\n\"Meaningless\" in the sense you're using it isn't incompatible with \"rationally constructed.\" Furthermore, a truth derived from empirical observation isn't necessarily applicable. That said, I take it the question is which has more value, a claim which is highly unlikely to be applied or one which is likely to be. If application is something to be valued, then obviously the latter. But that's neither here nor there. The likelihood of its application doesn't at all affect the truth of a claim.  \n\nSome thoughts on the reply to Huemer:  \n\n&gt;His first objection is with her first premise: \u201cValue is agent-relative; (in the sense that) things can only be valuable for particular entities.\u201d His objection lies in the fact that he calls this a \u201cbald assertion\u201d of Rand\u2019s, since she offers no argument against those who believe in absolute value. But does she really need to do so?  \n\nWell, yes. Intuitionism as Huemer describes it in section 5.4 is a standalone theory which needs to be refuted to put Objectivism in the clear. Changing the premise to \"The [intrinsic, absolute] value *that matters* is agent-relative\" like the responder does doesn't solve the problem. In fact, it isn't even coherent. Suppose something is intrinsically valuable, but (as it's suggested is possible) an individual happens to not value it; according to this principle, because the value that matters is relevant to the individual, the intrinsically valuable thing isn't valuable. But that doesn't make sense.   \n\nAbout the attempts to save premises 6 and 7 and ethical egoism in general -- I think Huemer addresses that fairly well with the argument from Moore:\n\n&gt; Let A be an egoist, and let B be the egoist's next-door neighbor. The egoist regards his own life as an end in itself, and he says B ought to regard B's life as an end in itself. But, insofar as A is concerned only for furthering his own life, A can not, himself, treat B's life as an end in itself. A's sole value is A's life; therefore, A can value B's life, if at all, only as a means (i.e. if B's life furthers A's). Similarly, when A recommends to B that B should be an egoist, he is recommending that B should regard A as being only valuable as a means. This necessarily follows from the supposition that B should regard B's life as the sole end in itself, which is the meaning of egoism. A therefore seems to be caught in a contradiction: A holds that A's own life is an end in itself, but at the same time A thinks that no one else ought to recognize A's life as being an end in itself. In a parallel contradiction, A holds that other people are valuable only as means, but he holds that other people are correct in regarding themselves as valuable not merely as means but as ends in themselves. In other words: Each individual is correct in a belief which directly contradicts what every other individual correctly believes. A is correct to believe P, but B is correct to believe not-P. Is this not, in Moore's words, \"an absolute contradiction\"?\n\nGiven that one of the central tenets of Objectivism appears to be \"always follow reason and never think or act contrary to reason,\" is certainly seems to be.  \n\n&gt;she called most of today's academic philosophy and the thinkers they reference hacks   \n\nIf you look through the history of philosophy, you find a *lot* of people saying \"Everybody's been doing it wrong the whole time! Here's how it's actually done.\" Some of those are pretty central figures. So you can hardly blame Rand being sidelined on how reactionary she was.  \n\n&gt;Objectivism is utterly incompatible with postmodernism and deconstruction   \n\nSeeing as how the dominant tradition in American and UK philosophy is analytic, not continental, this doesn't count as much of an explanation either. \n\n \n\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "created": 1426879035.0},{"body": "&gt; If you read what follows, you can see that what he does by differentiating between meaning and sense vs. reference leads to entirely different conclusions about a priori knowledge (including logic, math, and ethics) than what he takes objectivists to maintain. That doesn't seem very trivial to me.\n\nHe's still playing head games. Of course one's faculties for reasoning and defining the meaning of objects are limited by the knowledge one has at hand. Rand argues that all rational people, when given the same information, will arrive at convergent rather than divergent conclusions because of the internal consistency of rational logic. A sound logical argument cannot produce two mutually exclusive conclusions - A is A. Huemer is basically paraphrasing Plato's cave allegory which I regard as trivial - the brain in a jar argument. One cannot think rationally if their senses cannot be trusted and logic depends upon axioms (which are either tautological definitions or basic premises that cannot be evaluated to a certainty *a priori* but must be assumed to be true in order for a logical argument to move forward). Which is why Rand defines one of her fundamental axioms as \"existence exists\". Descartes' fundamental axiom (I think, therefore I am) is similar but not identical. Descartes defines sentience as proof of one's own existence, while Rand applies the same logic to external reality. Which makes her epistemology rationalist in method, but empirical in foundation - resolving the contradiction between the two. This is why Rand uses a hierarchy of knowledge to say that all true knowledge depends upon reason, and all true reason depends upon sensory perception for reality contact. \n\nWhich addresses I believe any criticisms Huemer could make of Rand's epistemology. \n\nI'd address the rest of his criticisms, but I like to believe I have a life. \n\n&gt; Seeing as how the dominant tradition in American and UK philosophy is analytic, not continental, this doesn't count as much of an explanation either.\n\nI view the analytic vs continental divide in today's philosophy as a lame retread of rationalism vs. empiricism. The continental philosophers are hard empiricist to the point of near-mysticism, while the American style is hard rationalist to the point of brain-in-a-jar. The only way to win that game is not to play it, which is basically what Rand called for decades ago.

No way to double check them? Huemer avoids this by arguing this way:\n\n&gt; Some principles of logic might be knowable by inference - if they could be supported by reference to other principles of logic. But it couldn't be the case that all principles of logic are known by inference, because this would require circular reasoning.\n\n&gt;The principles of logic say what is and isn't a valid inference. If we didn't know the principles of logic at least implicitly, then we would not be in a position to find out anything by inference, since we wouldn't know which inferences were valid.\n\n&gt;For example, to try to infer that modus ponens is valid by using modus ponens would beg the question. To try to infer it by some other kind of inference, would just push the question to how we know that other kind of inference to be valid. And so on. If we are to avoid either circularity or infinite regress, some principles of logic must be foundational.  \n\nInstead of this, Rand opts for circularity and makes everything empirical:\n\n&gt;all true reason depends upon sensory perception for reality contact.\n\nAnd what sensory perceptions verify this claim? You can't verify the verification principle. This is what wrecked positivism. \n\n&gt;Which addresses I believe any criticisms Huemer could make of Rand's epistemology.  \n\nI can't help but disagree.
