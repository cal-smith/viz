You should bet everything on it, because that's what happened.\n\nThat is what you call an 'interpolation' and it's RAMPANT in pop songwriting. Something worked 40 years ago? It'll fucking work again today if we sell it hard enough! You write the whole song around a sample of the vibe you're going for and then you get session players to come in at the end and replay every part. In the original, there's people laughing and talking in the background of the song. It's fucking genius. Make everyone feel like they're at the party with you! Why do you think Pharrell is laughing in the background? Because when they pulled the sample, 'some of the energy was missing'. \n\nSo **yes** this happens all of the time! Why does ol' Thicke have to empty his wallet? Well for one, Marvin Gaye's son is controlling the estate. Don't fuck with that kind of a bond. If Gaye was still around, he'd probably have been singing it with him at the grammy's and we all could have spared ourselves that whole pinstriped disaster. \n\nThe second and most important reason Thicke got ruled against is that they didn't clear the rights! Interpolation (re-playing something instead of sampling) is done because it's a lot cheaper and the original artist *doesn't need to approve it*. It's treated as a cover song, which makes it easy, as anyone can cover a song without worry, and it's very easy to get a license if you want to sell it. The fact that they didn't do this was lazy as fuck and cost them in the end (as we all now know).\n\nI know first hand they didn't think Blurred Lines was going to go anywhere, and the album was just getting pushed out fairly unceremoniously. Thicke was unknown and the rest of his album was bullshit (I'm not fond of BL either, but obviously I'm in the minority), therefore no one was too concerned with Marvin Fucking Gaye getting involved. Obviously that all changed when Blurred Lines blew up, but at that point, it's cheaper to roll the dice than to fess up for no reason. You take a couple shots, some are bound to hit. \n\nThis is fairly common in most art actually. Urban Outfitters keeps a retainer of some crazy amount of money to pay artists that design their t-shirts. The problem is that the artists have to figure out that they designed a shirt for UO on their own, because they fucking stole the image off their tumblr page and pressed a billion shirts without telling them. It's cheaper for them to settle with the artists who figure it out, than to pay everyone up front, when most of those people will never know and will never be paid. Then they have the upper hand because you're either going to take the money they're offering, or go to court with your shitty phonebook lawyer against a major corporation and spend more than you'll end up getting.\n\nOkay I'm done!

Anyways, I popped it in, drove about a mile, and then I put Licensed back in. I just couldn't get into it. Put it away for like 4 years. Popped it back in in like '93 and it was all of a sudden the best album I ever heard. I was finally able to appreciate it. My discovery of trees in '93 might have played a role in that.

I think many were surprised that he can play the shit out of a guitar in a pretty \"normal\" way - he's not just good for weird music. \n\nBut, the main even with Prince, for me, is his writing and composition and arrangement. For example, [Little Red Corvette](http://www.metacafe.com/watch/10777115/prince_little_red_corvette/) - just the first 10 seconds of this song is enough to talk about for half an hour.

For one thing, many other artists were on board with what Lars did at the time, including Dr. Dre AND Neil Young.\n\nLars also wasn't being a greedy fuck when he sued Napster. His reasons behind it were very clear: Nobody should be able to decide how an artists music is distributed but them. THAT is why he sued Napster. Think of it this way: You're an artist who pays THOUSANDS of dollars to own all the publishing and distribution rights for your music. Along comes P2P and basically takes that away, you'd sue the owners responsible for that program too. If you'll also remember here's how it also began: the state of california ordered Napster to CEASE AND DESIST spreading Metallica's music around, when they didn't, Lars sued. So blame Shawn Fanning for continuing to break the law and perpetuate piracy, not Metallica's out-spoken drummer for defending his court-ordered right.\n\nAs for music sharing on the internet itself negatively impacting how much an artist makes, I'd like to remind people that album and single sales barely make up for anything when it comes to a musician's income. Money from an album sale usually goes towards paying the record company back for the money they loaned the artist to make the record, along with paying things like producers, engineers and even distributors who sell the album in their stores. At the end of it all, an artist sees a few dollars for each album sold. This is why record companies are suffering from file sharing and not artists themselves. Artists make most of their money from touring and merchandising, not album profit.\n\nMetallica in this case have just been spending more than they've been making. They filmed a grandiose concert here in Vancouver a few years ago over the span of three days that looked more like a film set and crew for Apocalypse Now than it did 4 metal guys playing a show and they also played a show in Antarctica for Coca-Cola, meaning they had to ship their gear and etc to the world's coldest continent, for ONE show for barely 80 people. They also spend too long in between albums now to really warrant longing interest in the band. The span between 2008 and now they've done hardly anything but spend huge sums of money, by comparison to that same span of time in the 80s, Metallica released nearly ALL of their classic albums which probably also cost millions less in fees to make, too.\n\nThe problem with Metallica is that they probably need an accountant who'll look at them and say NO, WE CAN'T AFFORD IT when someone suggests playing their next show on the moon for some asteroids and the moon-lander. This has nothing to do with a file-sharing fiasco that happened more than ten years ago.\n\nThat's all I'm going to say about this, because for every Metallica fan willing to properly explain things to people, there's 100 more idiots whinging about the Napster bullshit or calling them sellouts. I've been a Metallica fan since I was 10 years old and I am 30 now, I've seen them more times than I can count on one hand and have even met 2 of them, they're great guys who'd bend over backwards for all of their fans. \n\nEDIT: Reddit gold!

It presents the case as one of artist vs. illegal downloader.  I think that dichotomy is false and deliberately contrived.\n\nTo understand why, let's go back to the 80s and look at how professional music worked.  You had teeming hordes of musicians working in desperate poverty, all vying for the chance to hit it big.  You had a few mega-stars whose prosperity was so immense that it became a matter of legend on its own, completely outside their actual musical careers.  But the only people making money consistently in the business of music were the distributors.  Record labels consistently raked in billions; wildly in excess of what was paid even to the most outrageous legends of pop music at the time.  They did so by carefully crafting the marketplace to restrict popular music to a small set of artists and genres.  Stars didn't arise.  They were made.  And music wasn't selected by the listening public.  It was played on the radio according to very restrictive marketing practices.  Distributors went to great lengths to artificially restrict the supply of music, so that they could corner the market on its distribution.  Artists, on the whole, were getting screwed.  It wasn't practically possible to get by as a musician unless you became a made star.  The people who were really making money off the music industry were the distributors.  The rest had about the same long term prospects as gamblers at a casino.\n\nFast forward to today.  The technological limitations that made it possible to monopolize distribution no longer exist.  Music distributors didn't adapt to the changing business environment, and a black market for distribution developed.  What has this meant for artists?  Perhaps it's less likely to have a Michael Jackson-esque megastar in 2015 than it was in 1982.  But it's more likely to have 10,000 artists who take advantage of the changes in technology and can ply their trade by a means other than hauling amps around between clubs in the back of a VW van for pennies an hour.  My wife is one of thousands of such artists.  She is a vocalist/composer/producer who learned the trade working in the collaborative atmosphere of Soundcloud.  Over the past few years, she's transitioned almost exclusively to paid commercial work, ranging from movie and video game trailers to commercials and more.  Her career is steadily advancing, and a tipping point where she can quit her day job and commit to music full time is within sight.  Were there people like her in the 80s?  Of course there were.  But I find it difficult to believe there were quite so many.  She collaborates with hundreds of other people like her, working together on various projects, from all over the world.  In 2015, on the whole, it is far more lucrative to be a professional musician than it was in 1982.  I'm not talking about hitting it big.  I'm talking about plying a trade, the way an engineer or farmer can expect to be able to make a living plying theirs.  \n\nThe ones who are left out in this new business model are the huge music distributors.  That is why you're seeing old ladies and college students shaken down for tens of thousands of dollars.  Because an entrenched business is dying, and doing anything it can to claw at the rest of society and the economy to browbeat us into doing for it what it failed to do in the first place - to figure out how to make a dollar in the current economic and technological environment.  This isn't artist vs. listener and it never was.  The artists have figured this whole Internet thing out, and as a group seem to be doing better than ever.

In the 80s and 90s, albums became much more profitable and musicians became more savvy. They started to tap into this income stream. Also, in earlier days, bands used to tour in bare bones buses and play with just their instruments and some amplifiers.

Between the occasional death threat (and that person's conviction) and wacko, it was a pretty interesting sound board. \n\nSo, in your world \"the artist\" has absolute control over the distribution. Whether that's on CD or iTunes or like what the Wu Tang Clan did with their \"ego in a golden box\" release. \n\nWhile the music label model worked in the physical world (it's easy to lock up a physical something behind a physical lock), it's much harder (really impossible) to overcome two fundamental changes in our society.  The change of the storage of information from the physical to the virtual and expansion of technology worldwide. \n\nSnowden is a perfect example.  He took information that people really wanted to be controlled (more than Lars ever did) and was able to release it relatively easily. That's the problem with information (or misinformation) is that the virtual world has no physical barriers.  And the nature of the Internet is to make sure packets get to their end destination reliably (another disclaimer, my day job is being a telecom engineer).  Add the human element of \"someone should hear/know this\" and you have a world where everything and anything information wise can be leaked. \n\nSo we now have a world which in two decades went from an information market that was physical (and easy to control) to a virtual one that is impossible to control.

It's akin to saying \"don't look at me but look at me but only when I say so\".

I won't ever buy a Taylor Swift album, I simply don't like her music that much. However I will listen to her songs if they come up on spotify. With spotify she is getting something, without it she gets nothing. Multiply that by millions of people/listens and suddenly you are making a decent amount of money. Spotify says Swift made $2 million, Swift says it was actually $500k, ether way that is nothing to scoff at. \n\n&gt;I don't really follow the logic of why reddit is so mad over this.\n\nTwo main reasons.\n\n1. Artists equating spotify listens to direct sales. As I have previously states spotify listens does not necessarily detract from album sales. Spotify is simply another form of revenue on top of album sales, not a direct competitor. \n\n2. Hearing insanely rich people complain they are not being paid enough is annoying. They may be correct but it is still annoying to hear. Swift made $500k-2 million from spotify last year. To the average person that is an insane amount of money and they would be ecstatic, so to hear a person complain about is irritating. Especially when her net worth is already around $200 million. She is not necessarily wrong, but that doesn't make it any less annoying. \n\n\nSpotify is (on average) a net positive for artists, it brings in revenue (in Norway streaming services account for 2/3 of all music sales), decreases the rate of piracy (music piracy in Norway has dropped 82% since 2008), and introduces listeners to new artists they would have otherwise missed. I alone have purchased dozens of songs and albums from artists I found on Spotify or Pandora. \n\nSources:\n\nhttp://musically.com/2013/07/16/analysis-how-can-spotify-help-new-artists-make-a-living/\n\nhttp://time.com/3590670/spotify-calculator/", "gilded": 0, "score": 61, "created": 1426974118.0},{"body": "the fact that taylor swift only made 500k from spotify is pretty terrifying to any new/up-and-coming artist.

But it is not as if that is her only income, it is only a portion. So when you say Beach House is only making $5k from spotify that could be true, plus album sales, plus concerts, plus merchandising, plus licensing, plus other streaming services. So no spotify alone is not supporting multiple people, that would be like me trying to support myself only working 1 day a week.  \n\nSpotify and other streaming services is basically a bonus on top of their normal revenue streams. Its is bringing in money they would have never received otherwise from people that would never have bought their album or merchandise. So Taylor Swift is basically getting a $500K bonus that she would never have received otherwise. \n\nAdditionally spotify increases the listening audience for smaller/less popular artists (lest be honest the radio only plays a few popular artists). Within the last year I have found probably about 20 artists that I love on spotify/pandora. I went out and bought their music, this something that never would have happened without a streaming service. And on top of that it drastically reduces pirating. \n\nAll of this means that in the end of the day spotify is a net benefit for artists, the only augment artists can really make is that they want the benefit to be bigger (aka more money).", "gilded": 0, "score": 4, "created": 1426994020.0},{"body": "I'd like to add to that my anecdotal experience; I bought maybe one, two albums a year before Spotify, as I listened to such a high amount/variety of music that I would never be able to afford a fraction of that in legitimate copies; my mp3 collection measured 25-30k songs, easily, at times.\n\nWhen the iTunes store got big I started spending a little money, but the DRM was killing me and I hated the software. The only model that seems to work with me is Spotifys and places where you can listen to entire songs unlimited times before deciding to get a DRM-free copy (soundcloud, bandcamp etc).

My entire music collection is mostly hard/indie/classic rock with some hip-hop and just about zero Top 40. I would call it a pretty \"masculine\" collection. But, I of course have my guilty pleasures. The *Pitch Perfect* soundtrack, a handful of Kelly Clarkson, Lady Gaga or vintage Madonna. \n\nI caught a few of Taylor Swift's new songs on the radio, and damn they're catchy...enough so that I'd want to listen to them somewhat occasionally. Searched on Spotify, saw her album wasn't available, and that was that. Since the entirety of my music \"collection\" is streaming, or stuff I like so much that I physically buy it (a category to which T-Swizzle does not belong), that's the end of my listening relationship, and Taylor Swift ends up with zero of my dollars instead of less of my dollars than her label thinks she deserves.
