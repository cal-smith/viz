Homer Simpson can sue Usher.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgCo5DVX3XQ /r/simpsonsdidit how is it that I've gone through just about every single song comparison in this thread, yet I feel this is the closest example of two songs sounding exactly the same?  And its fucking hilarious.  I laugh just thinking about Usher taking that stupid, almost out of tune line and using the melody seriously in his song.    It made number one in the US and UK and elsewhere and sold millions. Life is kind of absurd. I love it.  I've been waiting for years for press or someone to ask Usher about it and hear what he has to say. And Usher can sue this goat

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6TCnh5B8-w That goat is surprisingly in tune. Oh god, [my sides](http://i.imgur.com/7PfQHen.jpg) There's a website for this - http://www.soundsjustlike.com/ [Bruno mars - treasure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPvuNsRccVw)

[Breakbot - Baby I'm yours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6okxuiiHx2w) Yea apparently Bruno Mars asked breakbot if he could cover baby im yours and breakbot declined so he just made a copy of the song and named it treasure a true artist.  I have a book titled "steal like an artist" that covers this in depth. I hope you stole that book. For artistic purposes, of course. [The Weeknd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYO77zNhWl4) did the exact same thing with [Machine Gun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00PdHIPjaWQ) by Portishead this is the one im suprised nothing came of "Bruno asked my label if he could cover Baby Im yours a few months ago and we said no. Then he recorded treasure. To be perfectly honest, Im not mad at all, if anything I am rather flattered that someone selling millions of mp3s is interested in my music.

[Link](http://justnoisetome.com/breakbot-vs-bruno-mars/)

Does Bruno have ANY original songs??

 If they're flattered that someone selling millions of mp3s is interested in their music, why didn't they let him cover the song? Because the label refused, not the actual musician  But in the quote, he said "we said no". Kinda makes me confused just like the guy you responded to. he didn't want to throw his label under the bus, is my guess. Bruno Mars has a ton of great songs but no original ones. His whole schtick is on being a brilliantly talented performer, and a pastiche master with a knack for hooks and channeling the essence of someone else's (obsolete) style. All Bruno's best songs have been throwbacks to once-popular styles associated with a certain performer or stable of performers. Compare "Locked out of Heaven" to another modern song influenced by the Police, like "Rude." They both get the Sting regatta beat down, but Bruno knows exactly how a Police song builds to the chorus, where the drum tempos would change, and so on, while "Rude" is just a modern strummy pop tune with a Police influence.

To call Mars unoriginal is one thing, but to call him untalented is another. He's a stylist, not a trendsetter. Oh man, have never heard of Baby I'm yours but yes there's no doubt. They sound very similar When I heard Uptown Funk for the first time, I literally thought it was Morris Day and the Time and wondered why i didnt remember the song from the 80's.

edit: I swear to god I didnt read your thing in the text OP. I only hear All Gold Everything by Trinidad James every time I hear, "don't believe me just watch."

Edit: Okay people, I get it, Mark Ronson paid Trinidad James. I had no clue, I wasn't even trying to compare the two, I was just saying what i associate the phrase, "don't believe me just watch," with. Not trying to say anybody owes anyone money about it. Very cool that Trinidad James was credited though so thanks for letting me know!  Yeah, and don't forget Bruno Mars:
"This one for them hood girls"
vs Trinidad James':
"This one for them hood niggas" Right, that line too! When I first heard that line I was just waiting for, Popped a molly I'm sweatin, WOO later on! The credits of the song say that it contains elements of All Gold Everything. Really? That's pretty cool, thanks for that tidbit! I may be wrong here but didn't he do it almost as homage to Morris Day and the time? I remember someone telling me that he was doing that with a lot of his tracks.
Locked out of heaven sounds like The Police, Gorilla sounds like Prince etc Mars/Ronson are absolutely "evoking" 80s pop-funk.  That's exactly the point.  Yes, Morris Day was a major example to be "referenced" but there's a long list of songs/artists that they're sourcing.

But that sort of "derivative" approach isn't a basis for claiming that Song B "copied" Song A in a way that the authors of Song A deserve any compensation.

You could create a "parody" U2 song, with its own melody, lyrics, guitar licks, etc. and everyone would say "Oh, that sounds like U2" but you wouldn't owe U2 any money. that's very possible. but I find it distracting. that's funny you mention Locked out of Heaven, because I thought it was the Police too. I am old. The police ft. Michael Jackson  Im 23 and I thought it was police. You are not old. Shoot, my mom thought it and she doesn't even speak English! 

..which I think makes it easier to hear the similarities now that I think about it.....


That being said...who cares...we enjoy both. Saw Morris day play at a casino last year. 8/10 would go again.  Every country music songwriter can now sue every other country song writer...And every blues songwriter likewise.. I-V-IV?

I made this. Well I guess anybody who's played a 12-bar blues owes money to some impoverished black man in mississippi. But if he gets all those royalties, then he won't be impoverished anymore, and can't make authentic blues. So really we're doing him a solid. "thanks fam"

[More of the same.](http://i.imgur.com/Adq17ZA.jpg) [why are these links purple?](http://i.imgur.com/t4dTXw4.png) I know exactly what I was expecting - a pic that would prove that not all country music use the I-V-IV chord progression. Maybe a chart with different chord progressions and examples of country songs that use them. Harmonic structure isn't exactly plagiarism I'm suing everybody who uses a V-vi motion! Those deceptive bastards. [Exhibit A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY8SwIvxj8o) Impressive. I don't know if that showed how similar the songs are more than they just sound good when spliced together, though. We need a video that shows how similar every mainstream country song is to every other mainstream country song. [I got you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WySgNm8qH-I) I think we have found exhibit B. Its like they found out how to be gangsta thugs without all that black skin color and profilin' an such. I think we found the bitches and money of Country songs. Reggae artists burst into flames Impossible.  There are like 4 people who write basically 100% of the country music on the radio. And I'm willing to bet they steal from and write with each other all the time. Exactly.  I sort of imagine them sitting around in a plush, million dollar room in the back of some dive bar in Nashville, smoking cigarettes and snorting cocaine:  
  
"But we did cowboy boots and patriotic ballads last month - it's played out until at least July.  We need to pivot back into glorified alcoholism and distorted steel guitar twang for the next few weeks to balance it out.  Everyone knows outlaw country is cyclical." You have no clue how accurate that is. They hang out a lot in the SESAC, ASCAP, and BMI offices, and there's less coke involved. 

I no joke met Craig Wiseman (17 number 1 tracks, mostly country) and the dude smoked cigarillos in his office the entire time.  Less is such a relative term.  Less cocaine than a Prince concert, or less cocaine than a convent? OUTLAW COUNTRY! WHOOO! This Popsicle is so cold! I'm just eating them. Geez. Is this a album cover or food porn? ...yes They do.

Source: band's producer and writer's are all published country and rock song writers for some pretty big acts. I don't think they steal, but I've heard stories from them about how a lot of prominent country acts steal from each other. 

I know for sure that they all write together though, co-writing is just a really common thing among musicians and writers.  Fantasy records sued john fogerty for plagiarizing john fogerty.. It can definitely happen Most blues riffs copyrights have expired by now. And most were created by the actual artists who played them, and pretty much no one got as screwed by the music industry as blues musicians. It also helps that borrowing riffs is very widely accepted in blues music. Everybody knows that everybody is stealing from somebody else and everybody is okay with it. Not just riffs. Most Delta Blues musicians drew from shared pool of lyrics and melodic phrases when performing. The trick was improvising and throwing together different ideas.

Which is why you can listen to two different singers doing 'St James Infirmary' and the lyrics will be almost completely different. Then you listen to different song and realise that the melody and half the lyrics are the same as the record of 'St James Infirmary' that you listened to before. This case sets a terrible precedent. There's no way it should have even went to court. A similar drum and bass groove does not constitute copyright infringement. How many songs must have the same chord progression with variations of a similar melody over top of it? It's literally how music works. Certain intervals of notes (otherwise known as scales) sound better over certain chords. Plus you can't copyright a rhythm or chord progression. The lyrics are obviously different as well, so I'm not sure on what grounds this constitutes as copyright infringement. It sadly just came down to who had the better lawyer. The saddest part is seeing the Gaye family and their lawyer acting like this is some great victory of oppression. It's not. They're just happy because they're getting paid on Marvin's dime. He was the one with talent and I highly doubt he would have even taken this to court. He would have probably wanted to sing on the song with them. What a joke. It actually wasn't based on the drum or bass but only the lead music. Any of the drum stuff was not included in the trial since it didn't hold the copyright of the original lead music for Gaye's song. Which is even more baffling since the melodies really aren't all that similar. Yeah, that's really strange. The percussion is honestly the most similar part. :/ Jury trial is the reason. Juries are notorious for not understanding the law or how they are supposed to interpret the law even when it is explained to them (especially the whole "reasonable doubt" thing). They heard the similarities and thought that it equalled plagiarism. I hate Blurred Lines but the melody doesn't sound like the Marvin Gaye song. 

Remember when Joe Satriani sued Coldplay for their big ipod anthem? The band said his case had no merit, but Satriani smartly insisted on a JURY TRIAL. Coldplay settled for an undisclosed amount (bet it was big since that song was huge and on a huge album, part of a huge tour etc) Satriani knew, via youtube mash-ups and the like that the average listener would easily see the similarities and he would win. Coldplay figured that out too and settled. Jury trial. It's pretty absurd. 

the theft of the "defining funk of cowbell accents"? C'mon.

[Pretty solid breakdown/comparison of the two songs here](http://joebennett.net/2014/02/01/did-robin-thicke-steal-a-song-from-marvin-gaye/) Honestly, I feel like 99% of this lawsuit's success has to do with the fact that no one likes Robin Thicke.

The other 1% is revenge against Pharrell for "Happy" being stuck our heads for days on end. Kelly Clarkson - ["Heartbeat Song"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YbO-yztOxA)

Jimmy Eat World - ["The Middle"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKsxPW6i3pM)

[A mashup/cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiDXwVeMxqo) of the two. Never heard the Clarkson song before.

Know *The Middle* by heart.

My brain was filling in the correct lyrics as *Heartbeat Song* went on.  I've heard Heartbeat Song a couple of times on the radio and wondered why it sounded so familiar. The Middle was my jam for like 3 years. The guy from the mashup sounds partially deaf but i cant tell if that's just masking It's his accent. Probably French or maybe Israeli? My guess would be French. 

Edit: He is indeed French. I know beyonce's song Halo sounds just like another kelly clarkson song too. Both of those songs were written by Ryan Tedder from One Republic. He copied himself. I think he sent a demo of the same initial song idea to both of them, and they ended up both wanting it, so that's how he ended up make two very similar songs.  I'm surprised Kanye West didn't sue Ryan Tedder over [Love Runs Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OWj0CiM8WU) vs. [Love Lockdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZwMX6T5Jhk). The song you're thinking of is [Kelly's "Already Gone."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0T3WAbU6tg) IIRC, the story goes that the same track was given to both Beyonce and Kelly at the same time, they both wrote different songs to it, then both tracks were released within a short time of each other. Both were written with Ryan Tedder. Already Gone was actually written first, but Halo was released first. Ryan Tedder produced and co-wrote both of those songs. Can't sue yourself. Holy shit, that's the same thing.  First thing I thought of in the intro to the Clarkson song was [Jason Mraz - I'm yours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkHTsc9PU2A).  Pitbull would be sued into oblivion.  He would be a boston terrier. The samples that he uses are "cleared", it's not plagiarism.

Or am I wrong? If they weren't he'd absolutely have shitloads of people suing him. Not everyone cares. Will I Am does it serially.  Dale I read that as the name "Dale" and was so confused  Pocket sand! SH-SH-SHHAAAAA Mr world wide Mister whorl wah  God _damn it_ I hate his face. City! City! Spanish words! City! English words and back to Spanish! City! Yeeeeeow!  I saw this comment in my inbox and thought "what the fuck was _my_ comment?"  Now it makes sense. You forgot that the last city he mentions has to be Miami Mr. 305 Arnold Palmer: get me a refreshing drink

Arnold Palmer: Mmm... its good... I just invented it. I just made this comic about that exact situation http://imgur.com/gallery/snLplqq Upvote for a fellow webcomic creator, here's one I literally just finished making: http://imgur.com/gallery/snLplqq

Hah! Only joking, I was just pretending that I created something I didn't create to parody plagiarism. It's a new type of joke I just invented. Rob Thomas could sue Rixton's "Me and My Broken Heart" for copying "Lonely No More"
Edit: I did not realize that Rixton did in fact give Rob Thomas full credit for the song They gave him a writing credit on it before even releasing it because it was such a close copy. Let's not forget the [Satriani - Coldplay debaucle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvB9Pj9Znsw). I thought they sounded far more similar than these do, and they settled out of court. They settled out of court *because* it sounded more similar. Coldplay conceded and paid.  Things only go to civil trial when both sides are adamant that they are right.  Not "right", only when they're adamant they will win. Not necessarily the same thing. IIRC, there was actual footage of Johnny Buckland actually playing *If I could fly* in the recording studio.

I'm pretty sure I'd want to avoid that going to court too. I would like to congratulate Madonna for NOT suing Lady Gaga over Born This Way.  born this way actually plagiarized a [k-pop song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpXJJ71OxAA) If im a songwriter, am I supposed to be aware of all random/foreign/obscure songs so that I don't make something similar?

Edit: Obscure is apparently the only word people can read in my comment.  weird. That's what Pied Piper is for "That's not really our logo, is it? It looks like a guy sucking a dick, and he's got another dick tucked behind his ear for later. Like a snack dick." To be fair, he had a point.

http://imgur.com/LLaiOkY No. Plagiarism requires proof of both means of access and intent. Pharell and Thicke didn't lose because their song is too much like Marvin Gaye's, they lost because they specifically admitted that they were listening to Gaye and wanted to make a song that sounded like his. I have a question: At what point does emulation cross the line to plagiarism? It's kind of blurry.  Wasn't is something similar with the Apple vs. Samsung thing? I thought I heard that they didn't sue them for making round corners, but for emails leaking that said something like "make the corners round, like on the iPhone". So basically from now on we're never going to hear artists talk about their inspirations as advised by their  lawyers.  But Pharell simply stated that Gaye was a massive influence growing up. He also stated that he did not have his music in mind when writing Blurred Lines. So it's still a crap ruling. I thought Pharell admitted that they were all pretty drunk when they wrote the song, and he doesn't remember exactly what happened.

Essentially, they lost because they had a horrible defense: "I know Robin admitted we plagiarized the song, then took that back, and I admitted to listening to the song while we were writing it, but we were actually blackout drunk, so I don't remember what exactly happened." That is a solid argument if I've ever heard one. The ol' "Sorry for partying." defense. "Sorry for party-rockin'"
FTFY. But Thicke was stupid and pretty much said that he played the song for Pharell and they immediately wrote the song afterward. This never would have flown without Thicke pretty much admitting they did it. Yes. Much like if you know four guitar chords, you can play a million generic songs. [Super relevant silliness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I) Why not link the [actual video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ) from the artist's channel? Holy shit I remember this video. I think I found it when Stumbleupon was a thing. What you guys don't Stumble anymore? I almost tripped on some pavement on the way into work this morning. [Relevant rant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7QLM) I saw a group of Cellists from the Houston Symphony playing their own concert maybe like 8 years ago and they did Pachelbels Canon. Each of the cellists played the various instruments parts with one of them being the unfortunate soul that had to play the cello part. They made a joke out of this by at one point having the guy answer the phone with his bow hand and forcing someone else from backstage to come and operate the bow for him. A bit later he had to use his left hand as well so someone else came from backstage to do the fingerings. At this point the guy is just holding the cello while two other people actually play the instrument for him.

It was pretty entertaining.

edit: dunno why I capitalized "cellists" Came looking for that... found this hidden subreddit in the reddit comments replacer extension for YouTube.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ty_WlmIKvY&amp;t=15 I pointed out how Thinking Out Loud is literally the same chord progression to friends and they claim not to hear it. It is so obvious! 

Edit: I missed used a word. People seemed to really get upset at that.  It's not the same melody, it's the same chord progression on top of the same tempo.

That said, I think it's a lot closer than Blurred Lines which was structurally very different from Got to Give it Up.   I hate rip offs...but it's GOT to be so blatant that you have say to yourself - 'well they should have paid for the sample'.

I think every Bruno Mars song could be traced to an older 70s song. And following the Gaye precedent, looks like you only need a very small similarity.  The synth pads in Uptown Funk are definitely from something else.  It's pure money grubbing - and leaving it to a jury of "peers" is a joke. 

I hate blurred lines...but am i crazy here? It's a different song...with a beat that seems inspired by Gaye - and most because it has that same cowbell sound. 



 Bruno Mars "Locked Out of Heaven" sounds suspiciously like  a Police song... I just can't pinpoint which song. Probably because it sounds like most Police songs. haha. Every time I hear the intro I'm like, Police, nice. Oh wait nope. Bruno again. Maybe you're thinking of "Message in a Bottle"?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObL3L6MRvN4

Bruno Mars does also state that The Police influenced him to write the song. I think the critical point in this case was that Robin Thicke admitted to Gayes influence. This is why I think, in the end, the verdict was granted in favor of the Gaye family.  Thicke said he loved the Gaye song "Got to Give it Up" and that they should write something similar.  Pharrell went ahead and started writing and they landed on the "Blurred Lines" arrangement.  They are similar and different in many ways but the biggest piece is, again, the fact that Thicke said he was a big fan of Gaye and that song in particular.  

My biggest problem is the standard this now sets moving forward.  Typically, copyright infringement has to be traced to one of three things: 1) a complete rip off of lyrics that were used in a different song or 2) a complete rip off of a melody or vocal line or 3) an uncleared, unlicensed sample of a master body of work.  Many of us musicians will have to be extra careful moving forward from this day forward because I don't recall any of those three being a focal point of the lawsuit, rather the "feel" of the track seemed to be the overlying issue.  It's too vague if you ask me and not identifiable enough to warrant a lawsuit imo.   Now you basically can't admit that you listen to or like anyone else's work if you're a recording artist. One thing to keep in mind. The Gaye estate threatened legal action and Thicke decided to sue. Nickelback can sue Nickelback Something similar did indeed happen. John Fogarty got sued by his former label for sounding too much like John Fogarty. They said that they owned the vibe that John produced on the first set of albums and he can't give the same vibe on future albums. The case got thrown out. Actually, the case was heard before a jury in San Francisco Federal Court where Fogerty famously played guitar as part of his defense, demonstrating how both riffs were examples of his "swamp rock" style and would naturally sound the same since they were, you know, both written by him.  

The jury agreed and came back with a verdict in Fogerty's favor.  I mean, how you not gonna hook the guy up after a free super intimate mini concert like that? 

Well played, John. Well played.  Best jury duty EVER. He also demonstrated that they were fundamentally different riffs, just reminiscent of each other due to reasons above.  Hi! 

I am a musician and I write songs for a lot of top 40 people in my spare time and I feel like I can help out here. 

The reason that Thicke got sued and had to pay is because the necessary bases weren't covered. The song was clearly inspired by Gaye's song, but there's a 'blurred line' where something goes from being 'inspired' by something to being on the darker end of 'ripped off'. 

With sampling, it's an easy line to draw, but when you're talking about sounds and grooves, it's difficult and it's entirely up to perception at that point. 

Marvin Gaye's song only hangs on the offending portion for a second at the start, but how much do you want to bet that Blurred Lines was based entirely around a sample of that until the song was finished and they got people to re-play the parts?  You should bet everything on it, because that's what happened.

That is what you call an 'interpolation' and it's RAMPANT in pop songwriting. Something worked 40 years ago? It'll fucking work again today if we sell it hard enough! You write the whole song around a sample of the vibe you're going for and then you get session players to come in at the end and replay every part. In the original, there's people laughing and talking in the background of the song. It's fucking genius. Make everyone feel like they're at the party with you! Why do you think Pharrell is laughing in the background? Because when they pulled the sample, 'some of the energy was missing'. 

So **yes** this happens all of the time! Why does ol' Thicke have to empty his wallet? Well for one, Marvin Gaye's son is controlling the estate. Don't fuck with that kind of a bond. If Gaye was still around, he'd probably have been singing it with him at the grammy's and we all could have spared ourselves that whole pinstriped disaster. 

The second and most important reason Thicke got ruled against is that they didn't clear the rights! Interpolation (re-playing something instead of sampling) is done because it's a lot cheaper and the original artist *doesn't need to approve it*. It's treated as a cover song, which makes it easy, as anyone can cover a song without worry, and it's very easy to get a license if you want to sell it. The fact that they didn't do this was lazy as fuck and cost them in the end (as we all now know).

I know first hand they didn't think Blurred Lines was going to go anywhere, and the album was just getting pushed out fairly unceremoniously. Thicke was unknown and the rest of his album was bullshit (I'm not fond of BL either, but obviously I'm in the minority), therefore no one was too concerned with Marvin Fucking Gaye getting involved. Obviously that all changed when Blurred Lines blew up, but at that point, it's cheaper to roll the dice than to fess up for no reason. You take a couple shots, some are bound to hit. 

This is fairly common in most art actually. Urban Outfitters keeps a retainer of some crazy amount of money to pay artists that design their t-shirts. The problem is that the artists have to figure out that they designed a shirt for UO on their own, because they fucking stole the image off their tumblr page and pressed a billion shirts without telling them. It's cheaper for them to settle with the artists who figure it out, than to pay everyone up front, when most of those people will never know and will never be paid. Then they have the upper hand because you're either going to take the money they're offering, or go to court with your shitty phonebook lawyer against a major corporation and spend more than you'll end up getting.

Okay I'm done! Being an artist is fucking stupid, but it's the only thing some of us are qualified to do!
 I always thought Uptown Funk sounded like West Coast Poplock:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmJXjDhpA_s


EDIT

Turns out the "So rough, so tough" line is from Zapp and Roger's "So Ruff, So Tuff." Zapp and Roger also did "More Bounce to the Ounce," which has the same guitar riff as "West Coast Poplock" and "Uptown Funk"... as well as every other funk song out there.

Not complaining. Funk is the shit. They both have cow bells.  No one can use cow bells in a song again. Poor Will Ferrel. :( Will Pharell Isn't this just a case of 'there is nothing new under the sun?' It's the same with everything films, books, stories, music. If everybody sued everytime there were similarities between creative works, people would spend so much time in court, art would cease to exist.What happened to being inspired by another's creativity? Imagine if Shakespeare had sued every new person who wrote a book or a play about two tragically doomed lovers. Or if Picasso sued every abstract artist who used lines and shapes to represent people and figures. Creativity would have died long ago.I swear we talk about how the world has gone to shit but I believe our current 'litigation culture' is responsible for a lot of what is wrong with societyTL:DR: We're gonna sue each other into the ground until nothing good is left I agree. It seems damn near impossible to come up with a song that's 100% original. There's not an infinite number of possibilities when combing notes and chords. Especially melodies that are pleasing to the masses ear holes.  Bla Fleck and the Flecktones: They can't even manage to rip their own songs off. The estate of Dizzy Gillespie can now sue every jazz soloist who has ever played because let's face it, we've all played the 'salt peanuts' riff at some point or another. First came  
Tom Petty "Mary Jane's Last Dance" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aowSGxim_O8  
Followed by  
Red Hot Chili Peppers "Dani California" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb5aq5HcS1A&amp;t=5  
And now  
The Black Keys "Little Black Submarines" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k8es2BNloE&amp;t=65
 I see the Jungle Love comparison for Uptown Funk, but also see a huge similarity with "Walk the Dinosaur" by Was (Not Was):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYKupOsaJmk First thing I thought of! Check out this mashup: [Uptown Dinosaur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4ARVjPL1Wo) my GOD yes.

I love Walk the Dinosaur and I'm also obsessed with the music video. 

But this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4ARVjPL1Wo  That's what I thought too, really I think it's just a cover/homage to a bunch of 80's funk type songs. This has been pointed out to me before. I can't unhear it holy crap. 

I think I just like Uptown Funk a little more now. Walk the Dinosaur is one of my favorite songs.  Every ragaeton song uses the same beat.  Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah-Doo... Cahdoo-cah- And regular reggae as well and Bachata, and Merengue, and Salsa. All the same shit over and over (gringo with dominican girlfriends perspective) Gringo with Boricua gf here, totally agree. lucky Lucky until you piss them off. Ain't no party like a Puerto Rican woman's rage party. Ohh so thats what Boricua means in that one song that goes "Boricua, Dominicana" And mostly produced by luny tunes Booooo ka do ka boooo ka do ka boooooo ka do ka

 Same groove not same beat All island music uses one of a small handful of "riddims", which are staple beats.  Literally 99.9% of island music takes them and plays on top of them. [EVERYTHING IS A REMIX!](https://vimeo.com/14912890)

I would implore everyone interested in matters of popular 'plagiarism' to watch this quick video. thanks for the quality link! God I love this series. Out changed the way I think about creativity, and the Star Wars and Tarantino stuff is really interesting.  I would highly highly recommend the book 'Steal like an artist'

It's very similar to the series and did a good job at flipping my perspective of what constitutes art and creativity as a whole.

Also, as trite as it feels I'd have to recommend 'The war of art' as well. This is not a new phenomenon in art and is definitely not limited to pop hits.   
"Oh, dear me, how unspeakably funny and owlishly idiotic and grotesque was that plagiarism farce! As if there was much of anything in any human utterance, oral or written, except plagiarism! The kernel, the soul  let us go further and say the substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable material of all human utterances  is plagiarism. For substantially all ideas are second-hand, consciously and unconsciously drawn from a million outside sources, and daily used by the garnerer with a pride and satisfaction born of the superstition that he originated them; whereas there is not a rag of originality about them anywhere except the little discoloration they get from his mental and moral calibre and his temperament, and which is revealed in characteristics of phrasing. When a great orator makes a great speech you are listening to ten centuries and ten thousand men  but we call it his speech, and really some exceedingly small portion of it is his. But not enough to signify. It is merely a Waterloo. It is Wellingtons battle, in some degree, and we call it his; but there are others that contributed. It takes a thousand men to invent a telegraph, or a steam engine, or a phonograph, or a telephone or any other important thing  and the last man gets the credit and we forget the others. He added his little mite  that is all he did. These object lessons should teach us that ninety-nine parts of all things that proceed from the intellect are plagiarisms, pure and simple; and the lesson ought to make us modest. But nothing can do that." - Mark Twain Stole, made up? What's the difference?
\- Krusty the Clown Ed Sheeran's "Thinking Out Loud" = Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get it On".

Same key, same chord progression, same "feel".

I'd be shocked if there isn't a settlement similar to Sam Smith/Tom Petty with songwriting credit. It's the EXACT same song.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj4UkXRlJBw Rather than going after Thicke and Pharrell, I feel like there would be more grounds here for a lawsuit. I honestly on more than one occasion have mistaken Sheeran's song for Let's Get It On. Amen Break! I know this won't be a popular opinion, but TBH? I think Thicke and Williams got shafted here. NPR did a wonderful article (I'll edit when I find the actual article) and even compiled a playlist of a descending jazz progression that's been in EVERY genre from pop to rock to jazz all the way back to a Mozart aria. That's really the beauty of music though- is picking up this clay and trying to shape it into something you've seen before and coming up with something not quite a copy but beautiful with it's own discrepancies. Even Stravinsky said "Good composers borrow, great composers steal". There's only 12 notes and a handful of ways to string them next to eachother that Westerner's ears will accept. 

All this to say, Pharrel and Thicke declined to take sheet music proficiency tests before the court during this case. These guys are pop stars, not classical composers. I think to say they or their producers systematically ripped off Gaye's music gives them way to much credit as musicians. 

And it definitely shouldn't have moved Gaye's children to tears to see this wrong righted.  The crying was ridiculous. They're were thanking god that they just got free money on their father's talent. That's the point of copyright these days: to let lazy family members and lazy companies earn forever off their predecessor's works. Same thing happened with the Marley's recently. Im not liking this precedent... I don't understand what is wrong with this. It is the artist's property like any other and family has a right to it. If my parent has a business I can sure make money off of it, why is it different here.  Because bullshit situations like this are toxic and result in the whole industry being held back.  *Everything* in music is influenced by musicians from the past.  

The families of a handful of old musicians  could sue nearly every artist from the past half century, and each of those artists themselves  would have been liable to suits from their predecessors,  and so on.  

Entire genres of music wouldn't exist if this type of ruling were the standard.  Rock, hip hop, pop, R&amp;B, country, etc.  None would have been able to survive if this type of ruling were the norm.


The idea that someone could lay claim to a chord progression, scale, rhythm or groove would be *extremely* harmful to the industry if this ruling holds up after appeals. Well, my limited understanding is this: creative works become part of the culture in which they operate and one creative idea leads to another and that idea leads to another and so on. And by creative work I mean many different things: literary, musical, scientific, etc. So the idea behind copyright is to allow the creator to profit from his/her work for a limited time at which point new uses can be made of the work (and hence new knowledge can come into existence). What we're seeing more and more today is greedy/controlling people/companies trying to extend the length of time of protection which inhibits and in some cases punishes innovation. There are certainly creative domains where this development is more important than in others, but the point remains. I'd also say that a creative property is a bit different from a physical property, in how it can be used, disposed of, and the sheer number of people who can enjoy it. It is true that art becomes a part of the culture, shaping it a bit. But doesn't it also belong to the creator first and foremost. I get that after their time may be copyright can cease to in effect but wouldn't the creator want his family to benefit from it? It is a complicated situation and it seemed like Gaye's daughter went over the top reacting to this, but imo it would have been nice if Thicke and Pharell honored Gaye in some way.  Copyright exists to give artists an incentive to create work, knowing it won't be stolen. These people aren't creating anything. Entitled, shitty children. Pharrell is more a producer than anything and is a musician as well. He knows how to read music I'm sure. The only thing he can't do is sing.  I'll give you Thicke though. Seriously, Pharrell is a fucking incredible musician to see that money comin in Wasn't Thicke suing the family first though? I thought that's where the tears were coming from. And there we see the restriction inherent in tonal, tertiary-based music. Add onto that the increasing lack of music theory education for today's pop stars and you have a recipe for rehashing.

The only solution is atonal pop songs. Did you ever find the article? I'd love to read/listen to it. This should be way higher. I'm assuming this is probably the ii - V - I progression. But chord progressions are not copyrightable, and neither are grooves or drumbeats. So I totally agree with what you're getting to! Hold on, only classical composers read music? You are absolutely right and it was also the general consensus in yesterday's thread. This thing is BULLSHIT

 Right on. Copyrights exist to encourage new art and culture, not to limit it by "protecting" estates or corporations. People should be encouraged to take inspiration and thus contribute to the legacy of the earlier artist. I don't really care about the money thing. 

I do think it's a shameless rip off. The Marvin gaye song is one of my favourites. In my opinion they didn't do enough make this a different song. Apart from the rape vibe. 

This seems like an unpopular opinion here.  Oh, good, a new artist to have that quote attributed to without evidence.

Also, since Thicke said that he went into the studio and said "I want to make a song like Marvin Gaye's "Got to Give It Up" then it seems like just maybe they borrowed directly from the song. Tom Petty &gt; Sam Smith is egregious Good call. This one was settled for a writer share: http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tom-petty-on-sam-smith-settlement-no-hard-feelings-these-things-happen-20150129 Tom Petty seemed to be a pretty good sport about the whole thing too, kudos. He has a history of being a cool dude about musical similarities. When people noticed that The Red Hot Chili Peppers' "Dani California" sounded a lot like "Mary Jane's Last Dance," he [said he didn't care.](http://www.stereogum.com/2803/tom_petty_responds_to_red_hot_chili_controversy/news/) Petty is something Tom isn't.  Eyyyyyyy! There's also [American Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5ccVWbteps) and [Last Nite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXaHy814cEA). hmmm.. I was surprised when the opening vocal to "last nite" didn't start on the Tom Petty track. lol
 Is it just that the drum beat is the same ? There's not a huge difference after that is there? "Little Black Submarine" at certain parts does as well I think he understands that people are gonna come up with music that sounds similar; it doesn't mean they're stealing, just that they wrote something that has a similar vibe. There are just certain melodies and flows in music that work better than others. So things are bound to be repeated. that's weird, Mary Jane's Last Dance is a favourite of mine but i really don't care for Dani California, or any of the new chili peppers stuff, to be honest.  i'll have to give it another listen.   Didn't he sue the Jayhawks over "Waiting for the Sun", despite the Jayhawks song coming before "Last Dance with Mary Jane"? because he stole it from these guys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUMyKcNL-Vs If I recall, they were both produced by the same dude (Rick Rubin). Which would make even more sense. I could be misremembering though. So did Jeff Lynne.  If anyone needed a 7 million dollar settlement it's tom petty after that jerk off accountant made him go bankrupt. Just don't cross him. He's like a pit bull if you fuck with him. 
Check out Peter Bogdonovich's documentary on TP. he stared down the entire record industry back in the 70's, and won.  But yet still took his 13.5% or whatever it is for royalties  I heard that Tom Petty received a Grammy for the Sam Smith song but I'm not sure if that was serious or a joke. He did. He's credited as a songwriter, along with Jeff Lynne. Yep. For the Tom Petty/Sam Smith controversy, it becomes much more clear when you examine the [sheet music](https://medium.com/world-of-music/did-sam-smith-steal-stay-with-me-from-tom-petty-d660968268df). 

However, I do think it was unintentional, because there are only so many ways to make a song in a given genre, and because its hard to determine if a tune in your head is uniquely your own or something you have heard before. It's really not. That entire song structure is just unimaginative. Tom Petty didn't invent that particular chord progression  or song structure. Sam Smith(and his writers)'s/s' only sin is being a generic-ass songwriter.  Ok, give an example of the tune played before Tom Petty then...

It's actually very distinct... V - IV - I isn't a distinct chord progression at all dude.

Hell, Sweet Home Alabama uses it. So does Werewolves of London.

That leaves Verse - Chorus - Verse - Chorus - Solo - Chorus - Chorus. Easily one of the most used song structures in all of pop music.

How about the drums? Oh what? It's just four on the floor with barely any fills for the entire song? No way...

If you can sue over this or Blurred Lines and win, that sets a dangerous precedent for art in general. Can Ridley Scott sue Valve or Bungie for Half Life or Halo? (respectively) Melody. Identical. 

No one is bugging about the chord change except you, and that isn't why it became an issue.  Plus, Tom Petty's been ripping off Roger McGuinn for 30 years, and has yet to get sued... Sam Smith nailed it... Kappa. I think he lost when he got sued and now Petty appears as a co author or something like that, isn't he? Yeah something like that , petty got songwriting credits of some kind That's what I heard In many of these examples posted here and elsewhere, I had to try to hear the similarity. I've heard "One Fine Day" and "My Sweet Lord" plenty of times, and never thought they were the same song. Same chord? Progression? OK, but not same song at all. I know the Sam Smith and Tom Petty music, and I /still/ don't think they're the same song, so to speak. 

Give me three primary colors and tell me to paint a fruit. Now have 1000 other people do that each year for 50 years and tell me how original they can stay in the end. Or you know Ben E King &gt; Sam Smith

https://youtu.be/pB-5XG-DbAA
https://youtu.be/Vbg7YoXiKn0 Man I didn't think so at all.  I feel like people have such a low tolerance for this stuff. They sound mildly similar. As I'm sure literally tens of thousands of songs sound mildly similar to one or the other.  This type of litigation is insane. Someone is going to create software (or may already) that just mines and compares songs and suggests lawsuits.  Not sure I follow - egregious how? It's a pretty clear case and Tom was very cordial about it. [deleted] I gave your comment an Aladeen-vote. 

:)


:(



:) I understand what egregious means. I don't understand your statement that Tom Petty (greater than) Sam Smith is egregrious. Or is it supposed to mean that Tom Petty is calling Sam Smith egregious?  [deleted] "That word I learned from that one episode of Madmen." Just in being a blatant copy. Yeah, a blatant copy if you speed up Smith's song and adjust the pitch and then slow down Petty and adjust the pitch and ignore the differences in the melody and style and instrumentation. Egregious and blatant are the wrong words. There are similarities, but it's not as bad a sooooo many other songs.  Dude. The melody and progression are exactly the same. You have to be deaf not to hear it. No they're not. Petty's is vi V I. Smith's is vi IV I. That sounds a lot like the distinction between Ice Ice Baby and Under Pressure. Only if you just look at the numbers. IV serves a different function in harmony than a dominant.  The Vanilla Ice thing was just an extra note added to a bass line, which doesn't actually change anything. It's still not as bad as Dani California compared to Mary Jane.  No they're not. Parts of the melody are different. Show me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkcZV97O3pw

 This link is from another comment in the same thread. Also just listen to the songs. https://medium.com/world-of-music/did-sam-smith-steal-stay-with-me-from-tom-petty-d660968268df All [your link]( https://medium.com/world-of-music/did-sam-smith-steal-stay-with-me-from-tom-petty-d660968268df) does is support how they are so similar. It's basically exactly what the blog post is about. This video shows what you're talking about:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkcZV97O3pw Holy shit even the chorus' line up. Didn't realize they were that similar.  I would argue that , tempo and key aside , the melody is the exact same and sits on the same progresssion and that is what defines a song. Tempo and key are easily switched, and its still the same tune It's very close. It's not the exact same. Petty's progression is vi V I, Smith's is vi IV I. I have to admit, I did imagine Morris Day doing his shuffle the first time I heard "Uptown Funk." Somebody get this man a mirror! I came here to say this. There's a part in the video where it almost looks like Bruno Mars is about to do it but hesitantly bows out.  [You know who's the worst?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1T2n_n9H67g?autoplay=1) Just pointing out that robin thicke and pharrell started the whole process by bringing a lawsuit against the Gaye family. Deserves more upvotes.  Pharell and Thicke pre-emptively sued Gaye's estate.  Gaye's estate was compelled to respond to protect their intellectual property rights (from what I understand anyways, IANAL).

Further, because Pharell and Thicke were the plaintiffs, the burden to prove that it was NOT copied was on them, and they failed to do this. Wait. Why would they do that? I think this ruling sets kind of a scary precedent. OP (and Pharrell, in his arguments) is absolutely right -- the two songs have audibly and significantly different chords, bass lines, structure, etc. The "feel" of the song is what's borrowed, and it's really only reminiscent -- not a true facsimile. 

I mean, there are only so many notes to play with, I think OP's question is quite valid -- you could make arguments that almost ANY song is ripped off.

In my opinion, lawsuits like this should only be reserved for cases like "My Sweet Lord"/"He's So Fine" (note: I love both songs but their similarity was rightly proved in court); music, by its character, can be somewhat derivative -- why punish that? Someone pointed out the nature of this court means the case cannot be used as precedent, legally speaking. It will probably make people seek jury trials because juries do dumb stuff all the time, like not understand that the melodies of these songs are different.
 'The testimony was perhaps most notable for the presence of Thicke, who sang and played the piano as he defended the work as original and said he was intoxicated when he gave media interviews in which he talked about Gayes influence on the works. He also said that he was mistaken when he claimed credit for writing part of the song'.


-  Robin Thicke is such a dickhead.  You're not wrong.  He tried to blame Pharrell for the whole thing.  Guess they won't be working together again anytime soon :D I thought he was distancing himself because all of his previous interviews were so damning with mentioning Gaye and his song.  He was basically saying 'all that shit I said was crap, and you should ignore it.  Pharell did all the work without any outside influence. Please don't take our money'   We saw how that worked out for him. Uhm the only the producer that is listed is Pharrell Williams, am I missing something? It has all the makings of a Pharrell beat and everything. Pharrell has a pretty distinct sound. People just love to hate on Robin Thicke. I mean, he kinda is easily hateable, but he'd be a bigger douche if he tried to claim credit for making the music himself.  Didn't he do just that before the legal accusations, then changed his story to take no credit after the fact? yeah pretty much, i read that pharrell was just being nice and gave him some credit for writing just to give him a little more public cred as an artist to make it a bigger hit.  He wrote a whole hell of a lot of songs that were popular before that one &gt;pharrell was just being nice and gave him some credit for writing just to give him a little more money

That's why you share writing credit.  Its got nothing to do with cred.  Its about cash. I'm out of the loop...why do people hate Robin Thicke?
 Because he makes Bryant gumble look like Malcolm X. I have no idea what that means No one knows what it means but it's provacative. It gets the people going. Ball so hard Well, Let's consider the people within the public sphere, and look in terms of the depth of character that various prominent individuals demonstrate. 

Bryant Gumble while a consistent figure in public media is not known for being particularly deep, or insightful - and one can only imagine that being either one of those things is not helpful to long-term media success.

Malcom X by way of comparison was someone who tried against all odds to improve himself, the lot of the African people of the United States and made serious efforts to try to challenge perceptions and simply didn't care if his views offended the establishment - his views were inherently offensive. 

Robin Thicke by comparison has what is considered by many a shallow disposition, whose crude opinions and behavior mean that he's photogenic without being tied down with an excess of talent, intelligence or moral impediments, for about 5 seconds probably found himself swimming in easy attention but was offensive for an entirely different set of reasons.

So by way of comparison 

Given Mr. Thicke's less than well considered antics, Mr. Gumble was able to look like a thoughtful and well considered voice of thundering reason by comparison, preaching moral outrage from the mount.

Meanwhile, at some point (probably) well after the fact, Mr. Thicke discovered that his wife of many years took a dim view of his very public and rampant extra-curricular activities, and so she decided to cash out her chips.

Coupled with his thematically similar musical style Mr. Gaye's estate sought reparations &amp; Mr. Thicke has been on a tailspin ever since, Mr. Gumble is there to point out any rocks he's likely to encounter along the way, and Malcom X is still dead, just like Mr. Thicke's  marriage and career. Is this what that comparison meant? I always thought it was because Wayne Brady seemed so innocent that he made Bryant Gumbel seem radical, like Malcolm X. yeah thats what it means.  I liked what he wrote and it was funny, but it was off base. Its a 'White black dude' joke. &gt; Robin Thicke by comparison has what is considered by many a shallow disposition, whose crude opinions and behavior mean that he's photogenic without being tied down with an excess of talent, intelligence or moral impediments, for about 5 seconds probably found himself swimming in easy attention but was offensive for an entirely different set of reasons.

 
This is the most ether. Mount Etherest. Stone cold. I'm Wayne Brady bitch! Is Wayne Brady gonna have to choke a bitch? [Oh shit, it's Wayne Brady, son!](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view/366927/oh-shit-it-s-wayne-brady-son-o.gif) RIVERSIDE MOTHAFUCKER! Chappelle's Show 'Training Day' skit with Wayne Brady. It's a quote at the end of the skit. It actually started with paul mooney's negrodamus skit. Wayne brady referenced it later in the skit you mentioned.  this is correct. I make Bryant Gumble look like Malcolm X, huh, motherfucker? Oh my god, Is Chappelle's Show really that old? Am I really that old? Basically he sang a 'rape'-y song and while his song was still pretty new and he was starting to get press, he said that he married his high school sweetheart and they've been married for years and how he absolutely adores her. The second the song becomes number 1 and women are throwing themselves at him, he cheats on her. Then there's this whole court case mess and the really awkward moment when everyone starts to see how much of a douche he is and no one wants to listen to him - he begins to beg for forgiveness from his ex-wife. Including, dedicating an entire album to her and having each song be about her. 

I think that's about the jist of it.  &gt; The second the song becomes number 1 and women are throwing themselves at him, he cheats on her. 

To be fair, he claimed to have an open marriage even before that (when they were still together).

He's a [chip off the old block.](http://madamenoire.com/319514/robin-thicke-opens-witnessing-dads-parade-women-ms-alabama-ms-dominican-republic-%EF%BB%BFevery-week/) We were on vacation and some pretty girl walked by. I started ogling her like a 12-year-old boy, and he said, I know shes pretty, but you stared at her and followed her across the room. What if theres a prettier girl sitting two tables away?

Youve gotta play it cool so you dont look like youre desperate, he continued." &gt; Basically he sang a 'rape'-y song and while his song was still pretty new and he was starting to get press, he said that he married his high school sweetheart and they've been married for years and how he absolutely adores her.

Blurred Lines came out around his SIXTH album I believe. He had three or four albums off of Interscope Records, a serious major label, before Blurred Lines. One of them was even produced by Pharrel during at the peak Star Trak.

I've toured with guys who snap their fingers and get laid on college radio/indie radio play. He didn't need a number one to cheat on her. He could have probably weekly for the last decade or so.  Correct me if I'm wrong but weren't they in an open marriage? I mean, if you actually think this is copyright infringement, it all should be on Pharrell. Pharrell probably wrote the song and did the beat considering his history with doing those things and Thicke's with being Thicke  I think if Thicke never mentioned this in his interview, there'd be no case here. That may be the funniest part of this whole thing. From a copyright standpoint, there would certainly still be a case--it just wouldn't be nearly as persuasive. He also mentioned Beatlejuice as a huge influence on his fashion.

Spelling Edit: Beateljuice.  "In an interview with GQ magazine, shortly after the release of Blurred Lines, Thicke explained the songs provenance, saying: [Producer] Pharrell [Williams] and I were in the studio and I told him that one of my favourite songs of all time was Marvin Gayes Got to Give It Up. I was like, Damn, we should make something like that, something with that groove. Then he started playing a little something and we literally wrote the song in about a half hour and recorded it." Well that sure ended well for them....... I mean... we wouldn't be talking about him right now if it wasn't a super popular song and made him a name people know other than being the son of Alan Thicke.

Sure he didn't get all the money on it now, but in the future, it will pay off for him I'm sure. lol. Betelgeuse Betelgeuse Betelgeuse  He appears when you say this, but he's all fucked up.  That's what happens when stars get too big. Tragic. Well done with spelling the character's name correctly. Betelgeuse is the name of the character (as well as the star in Orion), and Beetlejuice is the name of the movie.  My work here is done now i must return to my home planet.

*Knife vs face died while returning to his home planet*
 Beetlejuice. Beetlejuice. Beetlejuice. It's showtime. Let's get to twerk. NICE FUCKIN' MODEL!

*honk honk* Talk about getting blasted. [This](http://youtu.be/afUPJOg7uRk) explains everything. [deleted] master_swaggins how do you know  the Thicke's Because there are only 47 people in Canada and Alan Thicke is six of them. [deleted] I have met Robin at a party when he was with Paula. They were both really cool but kept bumming cigarettes off of me. I'm a menthol whore. I believe this guy I dislike Robin Thicke and love Marvin Gaye, but I don't like these lawsuits. Artists have been borrowing from each other since the dawn of time. Especially when greedy family which have nothing to do with the original music are the ones who do the suing  But dude did you read the articles the family was chained by this song, and only by winning a lawsuit were they freed.  I had to laugh at that... fucking someone out of a few million just because you're related to someone who actually did something with your life DOES NOT make you fucking Martin Luther King... Ironic that you use MLK as an example, because his family is an even bigger bunch of copyright trolls, completely milking his estate for all it's worth. Sickening.  [deleted] This is extremely depressing Actually that's not the family. Steven Spielberg owns the speeches. THEY BELONG IN A MUSEUM I would have left them the same and used that argument in court when they came. Likely he would lose, but it would be worth it to publicly show just how bad it can be. "she" [Ava DuVernay](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1148550/?ref_=ttfc_fc_dr1)  seriously. That was such a fucking joke Couldn't they just throw a sock on them? Didn't Thicke and Pharrell preemptively sue Marvin Gaye's people and then that's when they counter-sued? Kinda sounds like Thicke and Pharrell knew what they were doing and were prepared for legal action.  [deleted] It's a common legal tactic to seek a declaratory judgment in order to dismiss any claims of infringement at the outset. With that said, it is not a presumption of any belief of wrong-doing (especially when you consider it is almost always in response to contact of some sort from the opposing party).  edit I WAS WRONG: http://www.tmz.com/videos/0_53spjn0j/

EVERYTHING BELOW IS WRONG:

I don't even hear that much similarity.  This is NOTHING compared to what Pee Diddly did back in the 90s and 2000s.  Or Vanilla Ice.

Plus, read this fucking bullshit:

Right now, I feel free, Marvin Gayes daughter, Nona Gaye, said after the verdict. Free from  Pharrell Williams and Robin Thickes chains and what they tried to keep on us and the lies that were told.

*really*?  **REALLY**?  Feel free?  Bitch you try working at McDonald's for minimum wage and get a real job, then you feel free. "Pee Diddly" paid for all those samples. Vanilla Ice on the other hand, did not. And he got sued and lost.  Still vanilla ice's was a direct rip, unlike blurred lines. I'm not a fan of Thicke, but I think it's sorta bull that this lawsuit went through.  Yeah whatever keep your facts out of my righteousness train, nerdo-lyptus. I don't think I've ever seen anyone on reddit just be flat-out wrong and turn it into upvotes. You're even insulting the guy with correct information, and upvotes! Either you have a Hitler-esque grasp on misinformed charisma, or being right doesn't count as much as saying what people want to agree with.

Imma go with the first one. Stay away from me you brainwashing psychopath. Yeah, I just listened to both. They've got the same stylistic vibe, but how many damn songs can you say that about? More than a few, which is why I think this is ridiculous. 

I say this as a musician. I hate that people are allowed to sue for this sort of thing.

If any song that sounds vaguely similar to another  is allowed to sue for plagiarism then eventually we'll run out of new music. Pee Pee Diddly...

...Doodly. She was seriously crying in that verdict. That interview after the verdict really infuriated the shit out of me

Edit here you go. Couldn't agree with you more http://youtu.be/ctM515BeaA8 I posted to this above, but I thought I'd put it here in response to your comment as well:

With regards to the "feeling free" portion of your comment, I'd like to point out that IP cases are often deceptively emotional for the parties involved. While the public perception is that they are about the money (which they often are to a large degree), you can't discount the emotional investment people have in these cases.
Think of it like this. Your father invested his life to his art, creating some of the most meaningful music the world has ever known. Then after he is long dead, a new unlikeable artist makes an offensive song which you genuinely believes unlawfully copies your father's work. The artist then all but admits to ripping off the song before backtracking, saying he was drunk on Vicodin, and that he wasn't influenced by your father's work at all. What's more, the song made millions of dollars. Wouldn't you be pissed? Wouldn't you be upset that someone is (in your view) tarnishing your father's legacy and not even giving credit where credit is owed? Damn, I wasn't pissed before, but after reading that I'm off to the pitchfork depository. Being influenced by an artist is not a crime.  But wasn't the rights explicitly passed on to that family when Gaye died in 1984? Isn't that the reason they can sue? Yes, that's the reason.  I saw the daughter actually crying about "justice being served" and all this bullshit.  It's not like Pharrell killed your father, whose fortune you've already inherited.  Donate the $7mil to a worthy cause, fuck that family.

Edit: Honestly had no idea the grandfather killed the father, or that anyone killed him for that matter!  I haven't followed this story closely, I just think "Blurred Lines" sounds different enough from Gaye's hit and that this is a slippery slope for the music industry.  That grandfather is a dick too. I'd cry too if I got $7 million for doing nothing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I Wow these guys are great https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7QLM

Which funny enough seems borrowed from this. Spoiler: Pachelbel's first name is, in fact, Johann. They're missing Alanis Morissette's Head Over Feet, We Can Be Heroes, and Katy Perry's Fireworks  

EDIT:  Also "Don't  you forget about me" I was sitting here thinking I wonder what that middle guy plays, then he ripped out his Kazoo and I just sort of sat there, stunned.

My brother loves these guys, they're quite...awesome... You want to start reading about why copyright on these sort of works were intended to expire after a while... This, *exactly* this.  Despite how much of a douche you think these guys are, **this how art works**.  You probably know it as "inspiration", but copyright law is such a huge sloshing cesspool of horseshit that it enables situations like this, determined by overpaid legal jagoffs who know fuck-all about music or even art in general, because *durrrrr i heers a cowwwbellll!* That's my distinctive cowbell sound and I demand compensation. Finally, the courts do something to further Gaye rights. 

Edit: Wow, thank you to whoever sent me gold. Never expected it from such an off the cuff comment. Say luh vee say the old folks, goes to show you never can tell. I wonder how many talk shows are going to use a similar line tonight.

~~Over/under 2~~ Over/Under 1.5

thx to /u/confused_collective for the correction  Nah man, you gotta make it an odd number like in football spreads. 

New over/under is 1.5

Edit:Ya'll are correct. Non-whole number 1.5 isn't an odd number. I think you mean a non-integer.  Finally, someone is being rational. Get real. I dunno. I have 1.5 testicles. I think that's pretty odd. *this guy* ()  () () ()   __

 Not sure what this monstrosity is supposed to be, but I like it. To me it looks like a cat jumping out of an explosion while duel wielding pistols. Double foam-fingers http://i.imgur.com/TkUbD3y.gif "Both sides agree with an accounting statement that attributes $16,675,690 in profits for "Blurred Lines," which was the biggest hit of 2013. According to testimony, $5,658,214 went to Thicke, $5,153,457 was given to Williams and $704,774 came to T.I. The record companies (Interscope, UMG Distribution and Star Trak) took home the rest, with an executive at Universal Music testifying that overhead costs on the creation of "Blurred Lines" accounted for $6.9 million." Hummmmmm 7 million dollars of studio time. I guess they've been recording for a few decades straight. It's like they count the cost of the entire building and equipment in with the cost of the song.  The price of a couple lowly sound mixers, a years salary, comes to about 200k-ish?  A couple people might be in charge of the album artwork.  Would take about a month of time with meetings and having the right people finalize the plans.  They probably pay a third-party to create the CD.  It would only take a person a few hours to get the songs on all the pay-per-track sites which is where most of the business comes from these days.  It shouldn't take that long for the business side of things to happen and then these business people would also be working on multiple projects at once and not be devoting all their time to one album.  

Definitely an inflated estimate. I wouldn't say inflated estimate. It's probably spot on. The thing is though out of that ~7 mil around 6.5+ just went to a few execs as bonuses and the rest was production costs.  What label did for the song is promote it, push it to radio stations/tv pretty much everywhere you would go you would hear that song. It didn't get popular on it's own. Record companies make songs popular. 

That's why whatever you think of his music Macklemore's success is so amazing.  While Mackemore was on an indy label, they brought in the big guns to market his music. 

http://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-SEB-79504 Now on to "Uptown Funk"  Oh the James Brown estate should be all over that. James Brown, Stevie Wonder, fuck it throw every soul and funk artist into a lawsuit against that song too and then watch people be outraged because they actually *like* that song.  Honestly don't see enough similarity to the songs to warrant plagiarism. The percussion sounds similar but Blurred Lines has a pretty different melody and chord progression. Sounds like the style could have inspired Blurred Lines, but I don't see much similarity beyond that. 

Here's a comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziz9HW2ZmmY  I think one of the issue was Thicke talking about how he wanted to make a song like Got to Give It Up in an interview with GQ and that's how they wrote the song. 

http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2013/05/robin-thicke-interview-blurred-lines-music-video-collaborating-with-2-chainz-and-kendrick-lamar-mercy.html I agree as well... I feel like the jury was probably influenced by how  badly Robin Thicke defended himself... 

I'd say that it's definitely similar, but it's a different song. The tempo, key signature, and chord progression as well as the bass line - which is what drives the song - are all different... 

People have been borrowing from artists for decades... And while I don't like that they didn't give Marvin Gaye ANY credit for the song, I don't like the implications of the lawsuit on other artists' work.... It's just kind of sad to me...   I think the jury was also influenced by Thicke himself, he's portrayed as a bit of a bastard in the media.

I don't know if he IS a bastard, I'm just saying he's portrayed as one in the stories about him. Wow, that's plagiarism? Even though 90% of the sound is different? Maybe you could claim percussion similarities, but I don't think you could claim that the bass line is what defines the song. If that was true, every reggaeton and polka song would be considered plagiarism I agree. Percussion is almost the same (edit: the SOUND of the percussion... sorry about that mixups!) but the bass-line is  definitely different. There is a huge difference in dynamics in the song, the melody is different. There's a walk-down in the Thicke song that isn't in the Marvin Gaye song, and huge chord and melody differences in the Marvin Gaye song that aren't in the Robin Thicke song. 

The numerous chord changes are what makes the Marvin Gaye song so dynamic and awesome! It's far more musical. The Bass-line is interesting, melodic, and funky. There's a rhythm similarity between these two songs, and the talking is definitely influenced by Marvin Gaye's song, but I think that's it - and I don't believe it's fair to call that plagiarism 


EDIT Apparently, there are other Marvin Gaye songs (one, in particular..) that are similar what Thicke has "written".. I'm very surprised the Gaye family hasn't gone after him for those songs as well... 

It's really only the first one in this video that is obvious stealing. The rest are meh http://www.tmz.com/videos/0_53spjn0j/ (courtesy of /u/defeatedbird) If they start down this path of enforcement of copyright, then there are millions of songs out there that have used similar percussion parts to many other songs. 

 Definitely a slippery slope. The music industry has so many problems as is, having to worry your beat is too similar to another's seems a bit much.   Even the bassline is completely different! Blurred lines changes way more. I'd never heard the Marvin Gaye song so I listened to it and kept waiting for something that definitely grabbed my attention that sounded similar. The ONLY thing that is similar is the stupid cowbell/contraption. Is a cowbell + tempo fucking copyrighted now? Every musical piece ever written takes inspiration from other musical pieces.  even the cowbell is only somewhat similar. thicke's song is rapid, while gaye's got skips between. Those are two very different songs. i don't see the problem here. Judges are pretty harsh on plagiarism. Here in Belgium, Madonna was convicted in 2005 of plagiarism for her single [Frozen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_(Madonna_song). The judge convicted her because 4 bars of her single sounded remarkably like a single by a local singer, Salvatore Acquaviva. The song was banned from the radio for several years until the verdict was overturned in 2014. And that's total bullshit. Art builds upon previous art. Rap can outright pull a complete sample from another song and create something new and interesting.  And that's without mentioning mutual discovery, it could be entirely coincidental, just because two things are similar doesnt imply that they have any connection, it might be inferred, but without evidence otherwise its completely asinine to assume its copied. Not too popular on here, but this is basically what happened with "Brave" by Sara Barielles (sp?) and "Roar" by Katy Perry. And they basically laughed it off and said art is funny like that sometimes. But when rapper or electronic artists use a sample they pay a fee to the original artist " [Today, most mainstream acts obtain prior authorization to use samples, a process known as "clearing" \(gaining permission to use the sample and, usually, paying an up-front fee and/or a cut of the royalties to the original artist\). Independent bands, lacking the funds and legal assistance to clear samples, are at a disadvantage - unless they seek the services of a professional sample replay company or producer.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_surrounding_music_sampling#Legal_issues_in_practice) " 

 [For example Aretha Franklin and Lauryn Hill were credited as composer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_College_Dropout#Personnel) for Kanye West's album the college dropout.   Kanye sampled their music and 
they certainly received money Sampling issues are a big part of why the mixtape format has become so popular in hip-hop. If you release the record for free, you don't have to get permission for the samples because you haven't made any money off of them.  Boy if Blurred Lines is plagiarizing, we're in some deep shit. Can't wait to get sued by Def Leppard for writing a hair metal song, or by 600 house producers for having my BPM at 128. Oh, dear God!  I have made trance songs at 140! I'm screwed! 140? I'd be more worried about the trap producers than the trance producers. This is an awful verdict. Every artist has at least one or two songs that is inspired by or a homage to a musical idol. Now that the Gaye family got paid, it's open season. They didn't get anything yet.  Appeals will go for years, probably. Hopefully. Though Thicke is a dickhead (I've had the displeasure of serving him at my bar before he got famous). 

I feel like family of Marvin Gaye should be ashamed of themselves.

People will do **anything** to gain more currency. Trying to milk money from the achievements of a deceased relative is extremely shameful. These people don't deserve the money they're taking in the name of Marvin.

The songs sound nothing alike either. [deleted] His own dad killed him right? [deleted] From the wiki it seems like he defending his mom during a fight, and his dad shot him in the chest twice with a gun Marvin bought him to defend himself from intruders.
 The most wtf part

"Gaye's father pleaded no contest to a voluntary manslaughter charge and was sentenced to probation."

...? How? His father was a staunch religious man and didn't agree with Marvin's lifestyle, more specifically, his lyrics pertaining to carnal desires.  Sex is bad, but murder is fine I guess. Yep, shot him twice.  I'd love to hear what made Thicke such a dickhead.  Really interested in why Thicke was such a dickhead when you met him. If I were Ed Sheeran, I would be really nervous right now. First time I heard it, I wasn't paying attention and thought it was "Let's Get It On." I wouldn't be. Ed Sheeran/Marvin Gaye are using one of the most basic chord progressions of all time. You can find this shit in Mozart. If you can copyright I-I6-IV-V, then we should just stop all music composition. why? Yep: http://youtu.be/RxZjVZKVN7k
Edit: Skip to around 4:40 when he goes into lets get it on.   This is fucking ridiculous. I'm a big Marvin Gaye fan and when I heard "Blurred Lines" I thought "Cool there is a popular song that kinda sounds like a Marvin Gaye inspired song". Maybe some fucking kids might realize they like Marvin Gaye or get turned on to soul music. I never thought it sounded like a rip off.

I got news for you. Just about EVERYTHING has been done. art builds on art. art is inspired by other art.

This is a fucking joke. I am so sick of humans. It's funny. If stuff like this happened to genres of music like metal then the genre wouldn't exist. Reggae would be a big one. pretty much every genre wouldn't exist Exactly.
We stand on the shoulders of giants.
We can't be except for what was.
This is copyright taken to absurdity This disappoints me. As a trained musician, and someone who also aspires to become a composer, I think this sets a bad example for future creativity in music. I've listened to both songs, and while they may share a similar groove and maybe even a chord progression here and there, both songs are thematically and melodically different enough to not even come close to plagarism. If you were to transcribe both songs and put their sheet music together, I am sure you would be looking at two separate pieces. What this says to me is that even if a song is inspired by another, without even matching the original in theme or arrangement, you can be found liable for plagiarism. But artists and musicians have been borrowing and referencing each other for decades. Remember the iconic bassline Michael Jackson composed for Billie Jean? Turns out he copied the groove from Hall &amp; Oats' "I Can't Go For That". Michael even apologized to Darrell Hall while they were working on the recording for "We Are The World", and Darrell said that he himself lifted it from somwhere else, saying "It's something we all do".

I'm no fan of Thicke, but I believe in the freedom of creativity and inspiration. For him and Pharrell to have to pay for something that started out with good intentions is sickening.  You can protect a melody not a chord progression. Playing a song in the style of another artist isn't stealing their song. 

Did they steal the melody? Did they copy verbatim any parts of the song? No and no. It's a money grab and that's it.

Bass line and cowbell with vocal samples in it, here's my chance to get some money out of it.  [deleted] It's weird that this is a problem, yet this isn't: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY8SwIvxj8o You can copyright style now? The two songs have completely different chord progressions. Next time just call it a parody if your work is going to be derivative in any way at all and avoid being in an actionable position from the start. Right now, I feel free, Marvin Gayes daughter, Nona Gaye, said after the verdict. Roughly translated "I get paid off the success of my father and don't have to do shit for work other than sue people". Don't get me wrong, I hate robin thicke, but screw that entitled spoiled crybaby. T.I. got off for being a gangster!  I really have thin patience for most of these lawsuits.  Eventually lawyers are going to be using software to analyze any new hit song to make sure that it has no similarities to an older song.  "Won't back down" vs "Stay with me" also, those two songs have practically nothing alike other than that they both repeat a slow triplet vocal twice.  Music is music, and all the great artists have borrowed and copied ideas from others.  As long as there is more difference than similarity, we don't need to be setting these kinds of precedents. I completely agree. It says in the article that they were comparing bass lines....it's actually much harder to even hear the bass line in Blurred lines as opposed to Gaye's. The vocals of the song really differentiate it enough. I don't think many people are confused and I really don't know how this would affect Gaye's property when most people didn't make any correlation to his song.

Versus "Ice Ice Baby" which really copied such an iconic sound and melody and really did confuse people thinking he was sampling the Queen song. In that case, I can easily see why Queen would have a right to protect confusing something associated with them with something they may not approve of.

I think there needs to be more spirit of the law rather than letter of the law, especially when it comes to music AND software for that matter. There's only so many configurations you can make after billions have already been created. There's bound to be overlap. Every time I heard "Ice Ice Baby," I thought it was going to be the Queen song. Then I thought it was a sample. Then he goes out and says "They are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT," and I'm like "Bull CRAP!"

These feel like 2 different songs. Marvin Gaye's bassline is different, too! I don't really like the implications of a lawsuit like this... I don't particularly like Robin Thicke for deflecting blame and not giving Marvin Gaye ANY credit, though....  I also prefer Marvin Gaye too anything Williams and Thicke has ever put out (i don't particularly care for either of them...) But this lawsuit is just.... depressing... Not giving Gaye credit for inspiration was strictly so the prosecution couldn't use those quotes of praise as evidence against him. It's obvious bullshit, but I don't blame him for it. 

Him saying Pharrell made the music is obvious to anyone who's familiar with Pharrell. It'd be even more fucked up if he tried claiming credit for a Pharrell beat. 
 Pharrell: "Ok, no problem"

Robin: "FUCK FUCK FUCK, DADDDDD" Having listened to both songs, I actually think it's sort of bullshit both ways.  Blurred Lines is inspired by Got to Give It Up, but it's more remixed than Vanilla Ice's blantant rip-off with one a note differenc.  Moreover, there are so many songs that have the same baseline beat, it really seems moronic to draw the line there.  

It's like making a soup, and telling someone that they can't use the same ingredients as themself.  Changing the amount of each ingredient, and the overall implementation, changes the soup.  Admittedly, not one of my better analogies, but it's late and I have to say something since this verdict feels wrong.  I don't think Pharrell or Robin Thicke deserve this bad press, and I feel like the Marvin Gaye family are being greedy.  I feel like Pharrell &amp; Robin Thicke shouldn't be penalized for being inspired.  Everything that is art comes from some sort of inspriation, even avant garde is inspired out of the act to capture the uninspired.

Anyhow, here is a video of the two songs together: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziz9HW2ZmmY

Not matter your opinion, I wish you a good night &amp; a safe tomorrow.  Ciao friends The family of the guy that wrote the 12 bar blues are licking their lips.
 You know what, her daughter is really saying she feels like they have been in "chains"


GTFO here I guess you could say that Thicke and Pharrell thought the lines of copyright infringement were a bit... unclear This is pretty ridiculous, as someone who composes and records a lot of music I just feel like this is wholly unfair. You cannot call plagiarism when somebody writes music of the same style, or rhythmic pattern, or even chord progression. God knows how many songs we have all heard using C Am F G or C G Am F.

Nothing about the melody is similar and the chord progression is different. The rhythm section is pretty similar. Seriously? Is B.B. King going to sue every blues artist that ever existed past him for using the same format?  They just don't sound the same to me, my mum always listened to Marvin Gaye, and so I know his music well. It never occurred to me that blurred lines was copying, even after the 5,000 times I heard it on the radio. Musicians and audiophiles hear the differences, and chalk it up (rightfully usually IMO) to influence, as everything is derivative to a degree. But drop it on a strategically chosen dumbed down jury, after hitting them with mind numbing long hours of techno-jargon from the same sharks, and they are gonna hear what they hear and it'll be "as the same". What do you expect? Most people in a crowd couldn't identify a bass line if the SVT8x10 rig fell on them, yet we let them decide on very subtle differences, of which they really aren't qualified, except in the end to say hey, "it sounds kinda the same to me". 
Moral: If your song hits it big, it better not be derivative (subconsciously or not), because the bulls-eye is on your back. Is this going to set an important precedent for future songs?? No. Might it inspire similar lawsuits? Yes. OK but can this lawyer then sue any other lawyers who are inspired by this lawyer's lawsuits?  I mean technically this lawyer should at least be made a legal partner, right? BREAKING: Led Zeppelin has been sued for enough money to create a time machine to go back to the late 1960's and imprison them for life as young men.

This lawsuit was RIDICULOUS. I can't believe Gaye's family won. Kurt Cobain talked openly about how "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was an attempt to rip off the Pixies, and he wasn't sued by the Pixies, because it was a general genre of music. 

If whatever "Blurred Lines" is was a genre (Loose Funk?) it would be fine, many genre songs sound alike. But all of a sudden because it's not a defined genre vaguely similar songs are infringing on each other?

Terrible decision. I mean if it was Marvin Gaye suing I'd understand but this seems like a greedy family looking for money. All music is borrowed from past artists If Marvin Gaye would sue, why not his family on behalf of him? If my dad was a great artist and someone ripped off his hard work to pass as their own, why shouldn't i be able to sue him? Doesn't have to be just about the money, but the principle of it as well. Nobody ripped anyone off, this sounds sound as similar as when some someone tells you you look like a celebrity, maybe the eyes looks the same but 90% of the face is different. Maybe the tones are the same, but the melody is way off.. I guess the court thought different. Just because the court made the decision, doesn't mean it was the right one Will they have to pay it themselves or will their record company pay it from song profit? This is really going to eat into Pharell's 2015 hat budget.  In my opinion this is getting out of hand.

If you cant throw back when writing music in 2015 it is going to eventually get to the point where artists are intimidated to release music in fear of having some type of harmonic similarities. The truth is all music is built on Innovation, influence, and coincidence. 

While some cases are clearly overtly similar, this is and continues to set a precedent that will surely result in stifling creativity.

Melodies should not be allowed to be copyrighted. There are only so many possibilities.

If we are going to beat up artists for deliberately or accidentally writing similar melodies or using similar rythms, than we might as well start beating painters up for their brush stroke styles and colour choices.

I dont know. Its a stupid process and I am tired of seeing people looking for ways to make money after they are no longer relevant.

Music is supposed to be fun, creative, and if we cant pay tribute to old styles then the future of art is doomed. I feel like the only one here who doesn't hate Blurred Lines just because Thicke is a douche If it helps, I hate it because it's a shitty, badly written and plain boring song? I agree. It's also overrated and overplayed. I don't either. I hate Blurred Lines because the lyrics are tasteless. No.  I'm with you.  I hate hearing this song, and thinking, "Hey, one of my favorites", and it turns out to be Blurred Lines or that crap Kid Rock sings. For the sake of the industry please tell me they can appeal this verdict?  notice how its always only the biggest, hugest hits that get these damn lawsuits? The rolling stones sued the verve for bittersweet symphony, tom petty sued sam smith for stay with me, and now this. basically whenever a huge song comes out, people who own the rights to a shit-ton of songs start going through their catalogue and go "hmmm which one of these sounds similar to this huge hit?"...what amazes me is that the courts actually side with these dickheads The Verve sampled the rolling stones piece, which is a lot different than composing then recording something that sounds vaguely similar to one of the 100 million songs that have been written in human history. They made it a totally different song in the end, but they definitely infringed copyright. IIRC, the verve sampled a different song, but the stones had won a lawsuit over a similarity with THAT song and thus owned that sample. I'm just pissed that the Stones took EVERYTHING that song ever made.    well yeah, it wouldn't be worth it to sue if they weren't going to get $7.2M from it.  I'm pretty sure my comment about the Verve is gonna be buried so I'm upping this.  This isn't a new concept at all.  The music industry is savage and people will fight for what they think is theirs, like they always have. one of those songs had a sample from the original artist in it and the other one is obviously the same melody in the chorus.

This is a song that sounds "kind of like it"

 The verve also had to give Jagger a writing credit and gave up all rights and future royalties to the song. Admittedly they did rerecord a direct sample and admitted to it but this blurred lines song is as similar imo and thicke admitted his Marvin Gaye influence... Because I believe you get a % of profits.  If someone makes $10k off a song, and lawyers fees are $20k, would you attempt to litigate when success isn't even guaranteed? Why would you sue people with no money? Did Kid Rock get sued for blatantly ripping off "take the money and warewolves of Alabama"? He should have. I've got to believe he got permission there. Right? I'm sure he did, but he should be sued for taking a good song and making it shitty. You're not wrong, and you don't seem like an asshole. Most of the time artists will pay for the rights to use other peoples material. If you try to be sneaky and slip one by you might be a copyright criminal. Pachelbel's family could have a hay day with this ruling! youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7QLM Ok, besides the fact that they threw that sort of Pharrell's legacy without any real reason to do so is one thing.  But what kills me is Gaye's daughter is giving the interview and crying....and wearing all black!! Like really?! Did somebody just die, or did she feel so close to death being tied to the "chains" of Pharrell and Robin Thicke, that black was the only appropriate color to visual depict her torture?  Please! What a joke...
 Correction, it should be "Gaye's rights". Does this mean that Ed Sheeran is next? His Thinking Out Loud song, kind of, really sounds like Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On.. can anyone explain to me how bruno mars isn't in hot water with "Treasure" sounding just like Breakbot's "Baby I'm yours" Lol, copyright law is fucking retarded. Is there anything in the melody that is similar?
I thought you coudlnt make a claim just based on a beat or whatever.

Might as well have Hendrix' estate sue Pearl Jam for Yellow Ledbetter because the feel and guitar is kind of Hendrix-y.


hell might as well have Metallica sue for a song going from E-F as was joked in an Onion article a while ago I'm sorry but this is fucking stupid. I will admit that they sound similar but the melodies and the lyrics are completely different. I respect that the family of Marvin Gaye were just trying to preserve Marvin's music but the whole bit about "The chains being released" or whatever was a bit over kill. It honestly makes it sound like they were just trying to get money. RIP all 12 &amp; 8 bar blues. Consequences will never be the same. Just waiting for the Fat Albert company to get in on this. Hey hey hey. Thought the same thing when i first heard the song. Cosby has a stronger case then Gayes estate. This is Marvin Gaye's son...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3omJVlG5e-Q Oh man. I just watched that whole thing. Why did I just watch that whole thing? I'm impressed with how well he can sing like he's autotuned. That's talent.

Yisss. I stay up all night, I go to sleep watching Dragnet  Never sleep alone because Jimmy is the magnet. I'M SO ROPE  They call me Mr. Roper When the troubles arise You know I'm the cool coper List of Certified Diamond Albums.  I was surprised by some of them.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA_certification#RIAA_Diamond_certifications Outkast being on there is a bit deceptive.

They sold 5.5 million copies of their record, but it was a double album so that's 11 million units sold.

Same with Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti: 8 million sold = 16 million units. Not sure about any others.

Edit: The Wall, Billy Joel's Greatest Hits, Garth Brooks Double Live all sold over 10 million copies but The White Album wouldn't be Diamond if only individual copies were counted, surprisingly. All Eyez On Me (2Pac) and Life After Death (Notorious B.I.G.) are double-counted double albums too. Tupac's Greatest Hits, too.

So if we only count copies, the Beasties are joining Eminem and MC Hammer! 

Not sure what that means, but it means something... It means ~~you can't~~ only a small amount of people can touch this. Congratulations to Garth Brooks. I'm not a fan of the genre but goddamn, he rivals the Beatles and Led Zeppelin for diamond albums. Crazy.   Chris Gaines must be jealous.  That's it! Now you have to listen to the hidden bonus track, too! Oh I hope its a ballad It's crazy how little I see Garth Brooks brought up in discussions/articles about 90s music. He was by far the biggest act of the decade. I think he's getting somewhat lost on people who were born around the time of his dominance, and I think that may be partially due to him not being on things like iTunes. He often got forgotten when he was out of the spotlight for a while, but he really was absolutely dominant in the 90s. I was definitely born early enough to recall that Garth Brooks was some kind of major force in music at the time, but I'm honestly shocked to see just how well he performed. I think the big reason it's so easy to forget/ignore this is that he's a country artist - he never really had any big crossover hits. His strongest performance on the Hot 100 was one single as Chris Gaines. 

I think the big thing here is that people forget that country music is still a strong enough force to sell *a lot* of records.
 You may be shocked to learn that Toby Keith earned about $65 MILLION last year.  I live in *Virginia*, and I have a hard time finding people who will admit to liking Toby Keith. I like his music, and I am not sure why.  Country music is, for some reason, super lucrative. I find it interesting that George Straight has sold a tons of albums but not a ton of a single album. Sure he has multi-platinum albums but not any more than 10 times platinum (according to the list). He has more platinum albums than Garth Brooks and is only surpassed by the Beatles and Elvis. Garth Brooks has sold more records in America than anyone.

More than Elvis.

More than The Beatles.

More than Michael Jackson.

More than anyone. I didn't really have any surprise until I saw the Backstreet Boys and Nsync on that list. Then I was reminded of how big they were when I was a kid. It's crazy how fast they went from dominating the music industry to being ridiculed by it.  Imagine my surprise when I saw Creed on the list. I'm aware they were popular back then, but I never realized they were *that* popular. Whoa I totally missed creed. I hate creed because of my coworker that would blare that one cd with MAH SACKERFEISS on it all day every day.  It's intense listening to "with arms wide open" and knowing Scott stapp is fucking mental now  Wait what?

&gt;In November 2014, Stapp's wife Jaclyn, filed for divorce.[44] Later that month, Stapp posted a video to Facebook in which he revealed that he is homeless and facing poverty.

Oh. Well. Did u read more of it though? Apparently his son stated his father is back on drugs, I think Meth or some crazy shit. Also Scott stapp thinks he's working for the CIA and he needs to assassinate Obama or something like that. He printed out documents from the internet, believing they are official CIA files, shoved them in a backpack, then rode off shirtless on a bicycle. 

With arms wide oppeeenn *Shaka, when the walls fell.* Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. Darmok on the ocean I feel so bad for the guy. I saw him perform at the MN State Fair last year and he was really great to the crowd. Very high energy and worked hard. Also helped that his voice *is* Creed so it was pretty much like hearing them play. I liked that song when it first came out. I'm so lame :( fuck that man. own it. everyone liked it.  no one is so refined that they dont like some shit that is "bad". i sing along if i hear it.  That's also partly why Eminem is so famous.  Candy pop music was HUGE after the Spice Girls came out then some corny white boy came out of no where with motherfucking Dr. Dre saying the craziest shit I ever heard anyone ever say in my life.

 Y'all act like you never seen a white person before  99% of my life I was lied to.  That sums it up pretty well. Seriously, 2000 has *five* diamond albums, and right before the massive letdown from people no longer purchasing albums.  and only 5 in the last 15 years. Well yeah, the older albums have had 30-40 years to sell more units.   Well albums from 30 years ago have had more time to sell than albums from the past 15 years so it only makes sense that there aren't as many... Man people Love Shania Twain The 90s were huge for Canadian women- Shania, Alanis, Celine. (Not to mention Sarah McLachlan and k.d. lang.) I saw her earlier this year, my wife dragged me to see her. Energetic show, and she is still _hot as fuck_. No shit!  Three albums gone diamond.  No other female artist can claim that with the exception of maybe Celine Dion.  She only has two that are her albums, but the Titanic soundtrack is on the list too and it would be ignorant to not think that she was the reason why that went Diamond.   I think it's kinda funny that Jay-Z isn't on there. So many platinum albums and always reps "The Roc" and the diamond shape hand sign but hasn't hit the level of Pac, Biggie, Eminem, and now the Beastie Boys.

EDIT: I believe I have been misinterpreted. I like Jay-Z. I understand he will go down as one of the greats. I know how well his albums have sold. I just thought it humorous that Jay-Z is all about 'The Diamond' but none of his albums have earned 'Diamond' status. Eminem, Pac, Biggie, and The Beastie Boys aren't all about diamonds but they have that status. Damn, Led Zeppelin has 5 of them, that's pretty crazy  The Beatles have 6. It's pretty crazy to think how big both of these bands must have been in their prime. Biggest band of the 60s and biggest band of the 70s Diamond certification counts number of units sold, not copies sold. A unit is one disc, so a double album counts as 2 units. The White Album didn't sell 10 million copies, which is somewhat amazing, but is on the list with 19 million units sold.

If you only counted copies sold, the Beatles only have Abbey Road and Sgt. Peppers with over 10 million. Zeppelin would have 3. Adele's the most impressive- 11x platinum in the file-sharing age. And in less than 4 years or so.  That's the crazy thing; i'm not surprised at Zeppelin, Floyd, or the Beatles. Their music is still played and appreciated so they've been cumulatively still selling the same album for 40 years. Adele comes out of no where in less than 4 years and makes Diamond and does so, as /u/biff_pow pointed out, in the age of file-sharing. Kudos to her! Not only that, but I can't think of many female artists who can reach that level of sales without being half-naked in every music video and performance.  I'm not trying to dismiss anyone who uses sex to increase marketability, but just saying it's awesome that Adele can sell her music based solely on the music itself.


^I ^tried ^my ^best ^not ^to ^sound ^like ^a ^jerk ^with ^making ^this ^observation.


Edit: Downvote if you wish, but name another female vocalist that got recognized strictly off talent.  I'll wait.

Edit2: &gt; 11x platinum in the file-sharing age Kenny G *Breathless* is straight fire. No surprise there. he was so breathless because he took so many deep puffs into his bronze warrior whistler horn. Hootie and the Blowfish what What is interesting is seeing the change in music purchasing tastes only one album over the last ten years has hit diamond. The way we way buy music has made this statistic an anachronism. Albums from 30 years ago have had much more time to sell than albums from 5 years ago so it only makes sense that there aren't as many.

But yeah the music industry has shifted totally. Boston? 

17x platinum? 

I mean, I loved the Foreplay &gt; Long Time transition as much as any other 14 year old on Long Island, but my God. Hootie and the Blowfish is between Hotel California and Dark Side of the Moon. "You and me, we come from different worlds..." You can't overstate how present that album was in 1995.  Every single song on that album became a hit, I can't name any other album that can say that. Zeppelin IV maybe? The answer you're looking for is Thriller. Which I can support. Or Teenage Dream. Which I can't. 

But still - 17 million sales for Boston????? I know, its not nearly enough. Yeah, you've got to think about **all** the hit songs you've heard from Boston or MJ and realize the bulk of them are from one single album (actually, I guess two from MJ, Thriller and Bad).

Teenage Dream?  Really?  Damn, she's a juggernaut That album (Teenage Dream) had 7 singles, all of which were Top 10, 6 of which were Top 4, and 5 of which were #1. The last single, *The One That Got Away*, was released 1 year and 5 months after the first (*California Gurls*).  The 5 #1 singles spent a total of 19 weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. I ctrl+F'd Boston. 

People don't remember just how big that album was, it was the start of the arena-rock that Journey and Cheap Trick and all those other bands that followed, which then morphed into 80s rock. It was the begining of really corporate polished rock. You could say it was like a hammered nail in making rock and roll the 'mainstream' music. 

Every single song on that album is amazing. There is always at least 1 track on an album that is sub par, that just doesn't hold up and you don't want to listen to. Boston (and IMO Siamese Dream) are the only albums that do that.  Siamese Dream while beloved doesn't have the constant radio play to back that comparison. Robert Paulson went 14x platinum!? His name is Robert Paulson. Be aware that some of these are double-albums, and the RIAA counts each disc towards certification.  (I'm looking at you, Smashing Pumpkins)
 Well double albums in the 90's were often double the price, so i'd say that's fair So recent that the article hasn't been updated yet to reflect the certification?

*Waits for somebody else to do it...* I had no idea meatloaf was that popular. You took the words right out of my mouth Must've been while he was... um... nevermind. I'm surprised how many of these albums I have...and unfortunately, they're not ones I'm proud to admit to owning. Paul revere beat still bangs  I said howdy he said hi. All of those bass hits are in reverse. It took me years to figure out how they did that.  It's actually the whole beat, not just the bass hits And I think there's an interview with the Beastie Boys somewhere where they say that it was Run DMC's idea to do that. I'll try to find a source.  I though I read that it was an accident, but they liked it so they kept it.  Found a source. Conflicting reports:

http://www.beastiemania.com/songspotlight/show.php?s=paulrevere&amp;band=b  [here it is "forward"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aksJolQxk_M) Lookin for a girl. 
I ran into a guy. 
His name is MCA,
I said howdy he said hi. 

R.I.P. Amen to that! So you wanna hear a cool MCA story? 

In 1998 I worked for the printing company that produced the book for their Sounds of Science set that originally was packaged like [this] (https://images.search.yahoo.com/images/view;_ylt=AwrB8o.WuglVvz0ApSCJzbkF;_ylu=X3oDMTIzanJuaDBtBHNlYwNzcgRzbGsDaW1nBG9pZAM3OWE0ZmM0NWJjMWJjNTFkODNlZDMyZjE2ZjI4OWE3OARncG9zAzc0BGl0A2Jpbmc-?.origin=&amp;back=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fyhs%2Fsearch%3Fp%3Dsounds%2Bof%2Bscience%2Bbeastie%2Bboys%2Boriginal%2Bpackaging%26n%3D60%26ei%3DUTF-8%26fr%3Dyhs-mozilla-001%26fr2%3Dsb-top-images.search.yahoo.com%26hsimp%3Dyhs-001%26hspart%3Dmozilla%26nost%3D1%26tab%3Dorganic%26ri%3D74&amp;w=640&amp;h=480&amp;imgurl=www.timebomb.co.jp%2Frareimg%2F222201371146pm3b_1.jpg&amp;rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.timebomb.co.jp%2Fprod%2Frdatail%2F41039.html&amp;size=91.0KB&amp;name=Anthology%3A+The+%3Cb%3ESounds%3C%2Fb%3E+%3Cb%3EOf+Science%3C%2Fb%3E&amp;p=sounds+of+science+beastie+boys+original+packaging&amp;oid=79a4fc45bc1bc51d83ed32f16f289a78&amp;fr2=sb-top-images.search.yahoo.com&amp;fr=yhs-mozilla-001&amp;tt=Anthology%3A+The+%3Cb%3ESounds%3C%2Fb%3E+%3Cb%3EOf+Science%3C%2Fb%3E&amp;b=61&amp;ni=120&amp;no=74&amp;ts=&amp;tab=organic&amp;sigr=11h4pdv6u&amp;sigb=16oe7bjg4&amp;sigi=11hmv34et&amp;sigt=11e6k4a36&amp;sign=11e6k4a36&amp;.crumb=IRbuBmQeleL&amp;fr=yhs-mozilla-001&amp;fr2=sb-top-images.search.yahoo.com&amp;hsimp=yhs-001&amp;hspart=mozilla). (It was later released with CDs instead of albums.) 

The company printed a fair amount of work by Annie Leibovitz and Richard Avedon; beautiful coffee-table art/photography books, so it wasn't unusual for celebrities to come in from time to time for press checks. It was great to have the opportunity to have a part in the final product, I loved it. (I was in prepress, doing color corrections &amp; other Photoshop work to get it ready to print, btw.)

Anyway, when I found out MCA was going to be coming in for the press checks, I didn't know whether to shit or go blind, I was so excited. The sales rep who handled these accounts would do all of the wining and dining of the clients, since sometimes the job would be on press for several days. This would always include at least one visit to a ridiculously high-priced restaurant on the oceanfront.

Well, the night came for the fancy-pants dinner, and instead of being a sloon and taking advantage of the situation, MCA had the sales rep use the money he would have spent on the dinner and drinks and go to a local roadside lobster shack. 

They did that, bought all of the lobsters from the shop owner, drove down the coast a bit and set them free!!! Seriously, this really happened and it still chokes me up even after all these years. Needless to say, I was heartbroken when he passed, he was a super cool dude.
 In before some "lobster expert" comes and tells you how all those lobsters immediately died violent deaths upon being released from captivity No they didn't. They went on to live productive, fulfilling lives and will be waiting for me at the rainbow bridge when I die. Sorry to be that guy, but I can tell from your comment &amp; your previous posts that you have early onset Magglebergson's syndrome.

You likely have days to live but as you will perceive time slowing down &amp; your brain degrades, you will think you have something of a life lasting tens of years... Yep, I was a huge, HUGE fan of Adam Yauch.  One hell of an artist and one of those true shining stars.

A short note of how cool he was.  The first time I met him was during the Lollapalooza Tour right after they had released Ill Communication.  A friend of mine worked at Grand Royal for him and landed us a few backstage passes so we headed out early to catch early acts and generally hang out and take advantage of the complimentaries.

Anyway, we are walking around behind the main stage and hear a bit of cheering and decide to see whats up.  Turning the corner we are greeted with a pickup game of basketball with a little half-court set up.  On the court is a 3 on 3 with MCA, Mike D, Mike Nishita...and 3 Buddhist Monks in full robes.  Turns out these were the Namgyal Monks, the personal monks of the Dalai Lama who were partly sponsored by the Beasties to tour with them.  

It was just awesome to see Adam and the others doing post ups and playing b-ball with these serene guys who were laughing and doing pretty well for guys in large, flowing robes.  It's one of those moments you wish was captured on film as it was a true meeting of culture  and fun. Cool story. He was Good people! For those wondering about the other 8, I was able to verify just 7:

* 2Pac  Greatest Hits (death Row, 1998) 
* 2Pac  All Eyez On Me (death Row, 1996) 
* Eminem  The Eminem Show (Aftermath, 2002)
* Eminem  The Marshall Mathers LP (Aftermath\Interscope 2000)
* The Notorious B.I.G.  Life After death  (Bad Boy, 1997)
* MC Hammer  Please Hammer Dont Hurt Em (Capitol, 1990)
* OutKast  Speakerboxxx/The Love Below (LaFace, 2003)
 Life After Death, All Eyez On Me, and Tupac's greatest hits are all double discs and only sold ~5 million counted twice. (And all 3 only sold like crazy after they died, martyrdom can revise history a little)

Outkast's double disc sold ~10 mil and counted for 20 in total sales. 

Both of Eminem's sold 10 mil as back to back releases

Edit: as it's been pointed out to me, Tupac's all eyez on me was unfairly grouped in the martyrdom thing. It almost went diamond before he died. I'm leaving it though as it's ironically a comment about revisionist history.  All Ayes On Me was approaching 5 million before Pac died, that shit was huge.  All eyez on Me was platinum within two weeks and was over 4 million sold by the time he died only a few months after its release. It was one of the biggest albums of the year while Pac was alive.

It is YOU making up a revisionist history when it comes to that particular album. All of those are double albums except for Eminem's 2 and MC Hammer's. So really there are only 3.

EDIT: One of Eminem's lines from early in his career is "You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album." This references that each time a double album is sold it counts as two copies.  Double albums count if they have more than 100 minutes of material, which is pretty much all of them. "Now my name is MCA, I've got a license to kill / I think you know what time it is..." It's time to get ill. Now what do we have here? An outlaw and his beer. I run this land, you understand I make myself clear. We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin. Could any other group could put on a show where they easily flow between rapping, rocking hard, playing hardcore punk, and jazzy instrumentals, with so much style and humor? Their humor is why I love them they were three dudes who were there to have a good time. Doing what they loved.  It's a great album but Paul's Boutique will always have my heart  This is the best Beastie album in my opinion.

quick story ... I was 14 when this came out. I remember riding my bike to Musicland the summer this came out. It was like 3 miles from my home. I had my boombox attached to my handle bars with small bungies. It played tapes and took 8 D batteries which it ate in about 4 hours. So I ride there, playing licensed to ill the whole time. Grab a Paul's tape from the store and put it in my boombox. I was so excited. I mowed like 3 lawns to get the money to buy that tape and the batteries for the boombox. I had already seen the Hey Ladies video, so I knew that song. Anyways, I popped it in, drove about a mile, and then I put Licensed back in. I just couldn't get into it. Put it away for like 4 years. Popped it back in in like '93 and it was all of a sudden the best album I ever heard. I was finally able to appreciate it. My discovery of trees in '93 might have played a role in that. It has not left my rotation since.

Boombox, tape, Musicland, 8 D batteries .... sigh. I'm getting old.

Doin' 120 plowing over mailboxes
 Radar detector to tell me where the cops is Spend another night at the Motel 6
It's five dollars extra to get the porno flicks Paul's Boutique is rad, Licensed to Ill is rad, but Ill Communication is a fucking masterpiece. Agreed, so many great tracks on Ill Communication. The one with Q-Tip is dope as heck Phone is ringing-- -Oh my god.  Get it together! Shit... if it's gonna be that kinda party, Imma stick my dick in the mashed potatos. I always loved this "rhyme"

"I eat the fuckin' pineapple now &amp; laters

Listen to me now, don't listen to me later

Fuck it 'cause I know I didn't make it fuckin' rhyme for real

But, yo technically I'm as hard as steel"
 So Q-tip, whatcha on the mic for? Nobody giving love to Check Your Head in here.  Mmmmm... it does go well with the chicken.  Delicious again Peter.   My first beasty album and still a favorite. I'd say it's tied with Paul's Boutique for me. But hey are just different so it's hard to compare. Well if it's gonna be THAT kind of party, I'm gonna stick my dick in the mashed potatoes!  Origin of that sound clip

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smrJ7459pj0 Its all about Hello Nasty for me Check Your Head, Ill Communication, Hello Nasty, License to Ill, Paul's Boutique - love them all, but their last album, Hot Sauce Committee Part Two is JUST AS GOOD, IF NOT BETTER!! How prolific of artists they are when you got people arguing that which of FIVE albums they've released is the best. I love how no one is mentioning "to the five boroughs".

Edit: to clarify a bit, i'll admit it is my least favorite of their albums, but people in the thread haven't been mentioning it in their tallies when saying how many albums they've made, i found it funny. Or the mix up CHECK YOUR HEAD!! Gonna co-sign that Hot Sauce has been on constant rotation since release, it's the perfect blend of old school and new school hip-hop.  
  
"Pass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision. I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitchin'."  &gt;but their last album, Hot Sauce Committee Part Two is JUST AS GOOD, IF NOT BETTER!!

Agreed! Loved them since I saw them with Run-DMC back in the day but Hot Sauce is probably my favorite of all of their stuff.  Go by the name of the King Adrock ^rock

Super educated, I'm smarter than Spock ^Spock Every time you hear me you will agree

Ain't no brotha like the K I D D I'm gonna have to say that Paul's Boutique is my favorite. Paul's Boutique is, hands down, my favorite Beastie album of all time.  

So many great songs, but listening to the album as a whole with the flow from song to song elevates the album to a whole 'nother level.  Was hoping they would actually have some sort of special "brass" status. Life after death but no ready to die? Who would buy life after death without buying ready to die first??? Puff &amp; Mase's 1997 fan base Can't stop won't stop uhuh uhuh aka literally me no shame Cause he was more popular on life after death and his death played a big part in the sales.  Of course he was but shit how do you hear everyday struggle on the radio and not buy that album? Every song on ready to die was ridiculous. Life after death was great but it had a lot of filler material. Ready to Die is so much better as an album.  Ready to die is ridiculously good. I have listened to that album more times than I can count. Unbelievable, Everyday Struggle, Me and My Bitch, Gimme the Loot, Suicidal Thoughts. You can list the whole damn album.  Roughly the same amount of people bought Ready to Die as Life after Death. It's just that the later is a double cd and they count for twice as many sales. About 5 million were sold of each. RIP MCA. Our manager's crazy, he always smokes dust!

Hes got his own room at the back of the bus! Girls with boyfriends are the kind I like

I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike I said, what's the time? It's time to get ill, I believe. I'll go check.  TIME TO GET ALE! not to get finicky, but it's "time to *buy* ale" Sorry.

IT'S TIME TO BUY ALE. But I'm chiller with the Miller cold coolin' at the bar
 I can drink a quart of Monkey and still stand still
 What's the time? 11:53 The beastie boys were a straight up crappy punk band before Licensed came out. Dirty NY style punk with short 1-2 minute songs. Who doesn't like a little crappy punk, right? 

If you have never heard it, check out Some Old Bullshit. You can also hear their experiments with samples and such on there. It sorta compiles some previous releases. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Some_Old_Bullshit Sample song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTtQ-uTf1uo

Another one where you can hear some punk is Aglio e Olio. This was a later release. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aglio_e_Olio_(EP) sample song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEdNFj1hzvo

If you want to hear some more of this stuff, check out Polly Wog Stew form 1982 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polly_Wog_Stew If you are still with me, Cooky Puss EP was their first attempt at hip hop in like 1983 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooky_Puss

Are you still with me? If so, I also want to share one of my favorite Beastie Boys songs. I love it because it so bad. They do even try to be good on this track. It always makes me laugh and the video is also hilarious. Check out Netty's Girl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5g79zfjdts

Edit: Beastie Boys getting pissed at Joan Rivers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5UaUqH19-Y I've never listened to their old punk stuff. I believe David Letterman said one night on his show when they performed..something along the lines of: I liked you better when you were punk.  
  
Thanks for the links. [deleted] That now makes who [Adam married](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Hanna) more interesting. Always a punk at heart? Hehe, egg raid on mojo is a good song. Mojo is a bouncer who worked at a club they used to go to. Apparently the guy was a dick so they'd egg him and run away. Netty's Girl is probably one of my favorite songs by them.. because it's just so bad.  That and [Country Mike's Country Delight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6a0xJqrVTU).  Santana 15x for Supernatural surprises me ... 50 cent not being on the list for GRODT is surprising too. I've heard him say he went diamond plenty of times and he's the kind of guy that would get called out on that if he was bullshiting... Double R. foots the bill most definitely  
I drink Brass Monkey and I rock well  
I got a Castle in Brooklyn that's where I dwell Now, here's a little story I got to tell
about 3 bad brothers you know so well 
It started way back in history
With Adrock, MCA, and me Mike D!

This was the first album I ever owned and glad to see this long term recognition.

 Fun fact. The letters and numbers on the plane, when read backwards, spell out "Eat me."
 RIP MCA It's the first album I ever bought.   This was the hot, fresh sound of 1987, my parents hated it, and I was 11 years old of awesomeness.  Did you ask your mom "Please?", but she still said "No!"? That's ill  How did this not happen earlier?!  I had to buy this thing like 4 times from middleschool through college.... A lotta BEER, lotta GIRLS, and a lot of CURSIN' - 


.22 Automatic on my person.

Rip MCA. It's time to get ill!  Three of the nine are from shady records Beastie boys are the shit. They are the one group I've listened to growing up and not changing my attitude towards. GoodMusic.  Sure as hell took a while. That shit came our in junior high.  It's a shame Adam couldn't see this :( When I was a kid we had one cassette tape, a black one with a masking tape label. One one side was Beastie Boys and on the other RUN DMC. We wore that tape out. WHATS THE TIME!?!?!?!? Glasgow concert, crazy shit man...I'm 49, but watching this makes me feel like I wanna steal a car and run over some old ladies https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJYfOGb3sKw ITT: People who know Beastie Boys lyrics or are capable of googling them. License to Ill is a good album minus a few annoying songs (Girls, Hold it Now). It's also their only album that has that old Def Jam sound plus that classic Beasties look. Paul's Boutique was definitely a more creative and diverse album. I can see how it's a lot of people's favorite specially since it had been slept on for a long time after its release. Check Your Head was my favorite though. It's just a mixture of different influences that was naturally happening at that time. East coast golden era rap (Pass the Mic), straight up punk (Time For Living), live instruments and rap (Grattitude), and the beginning of  MCA's (RIP Adam Yauch) trippy message of spiritual peace (Something's Got To Give). Their first EP was Polly Wog Stew, in 1982. A Hardcore Punk album. "Egg raid on Mojo."  Still think Paul's Boutique is their masterpiece. Eatme They should find the person that bought the actual 10millionth record. .. That would be difficult. The first tape I ever bought. The first tape I ever copied  This album still has constant rotation in my car  Well deserved. It's a classic. I also know many lyrics from this album. Michael Diamond status achieved long ago Prince is such a weird dude that I'm totally willing to accept that "leave the world" doesn't mean dying. 

Like, Prince just has a rocket ship to wherever and he's ready to go at any time when he's sick of dealing with the rest of us. [Just like the Little Prince](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/007/0/1/the_little_prince_by_fauna93-d4llnsy.jpg) I'm not too familiar with Prince, but he definitely has this other worldly quality to him. It is almost like an alien race decided to compete in our music industry with their best guy and nearly won, but something is just slightly askew. On another planet or in another dimension he would be the biggest star ever but here it just doesn't quite work.  Prince is on my 'If there was an Alien trying to blend in on earth, but not quite getting it right' list along with Dennis Rodman. Dennis Rodman actually played himself as an alien in the American TV show Third Rock from the Sun, even going so far as to cite his cross-dressing as an alien behavior.  He's also referenced in Men in Black as being from another planet: 

 **Elle**: Hey, Jay! Zed called. The high consulate from Solaxiant 9 wants floor seats for the next Bulls game.

**Jay**: All right, let's put in a call to Dennis Rodman. He's from that planet.

**Elle**: Rodman? You're kidding.

**Jay**: Nope.

**Elle**: Not much of a disguise. Wait. Their names aren't "L" and "J"? Wikipedia lists J as Agent J (also called Jay, or just J). The same for L and K. So looks like any of them are fine.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_J I could barely focus on the sentences. I always assumed it was a single letter. I think Bjork could be on this list. Nah, Bjork is just good old fashioned Scandinavian crazy. It's like recording cabin fever. You're trapped inside for weeks. All of a sudden the person you're in there with starts telling you everything is music, banging on shit, and belting out broken English at the top of her lungs.  Dennis Rodman is just a relatively bright and very manic depressive guy with world-class athletic ability. Like Mike Tyson but more creative.

Crazy, yes, but in an earthly way.  Then how did he go to North Korea and return home? Illuminade. Is that Illuminati lemonade?  When life gives you Illuminati... Because Kim Jong-Un fucking loves basketball. Of course he would allow Dennis to come in and hang out in his palace, and then there's too much of a spotlight to hold onto him for any reason. Maybe, but don't even tell me you'd be surprised if you saw the headline "Kim Jong Un Keeping Rodman In NK Basketball Museum" 

Subheadline: "Obama: 'What can you do?'"  Obama's a Bulls fan... I have a feeling he'd do something drastic. Maybe fill a Seals team with guys from Chicago and send them on some unsanctioned mission.

*"I'm not sending you on this assignment because I'm the President. I'm sending you on this assignment because Dennis won us three fucking rings."* That team wasn't even fair. I mean, it already wasn't fair with Jordan and Pippen, but the fact they got one of the best defensive players at the time for such an (understandable) discount? They could have just sent the Bulls to the Olympics that summer, and it would have felt like a vacation for them. plus that steve kerr magic &gt; almost like an alien race decided to compete in our music industry with their best guy and nearly won

it was definitely close, but the other guys sent michael jackson Right? Such suspicious phrasing. Maybe they know something we don't...  Some say he's already left. And you'll be able to view none of it on Youtube. True dat.  I play in a Prince cover band and I made some live recordings for the band members to hear so they could get a sense of what needed to improve.  They were up on SoundCloud for a few months before SoundCloud took them down citing copyright issues.  They collectively had about 200 listens for all 10 or so songs.

So yeah....don't even try to post your own renditions of his music anywhere.  Dude invests alot of time "protecting" his music.  Still love him though. It seems sad, making all that art for no one.  The Chicago Blackhawks used to have an insane owner who refused to televise home games, in order to increase ticket sales or something stupid. It was only in the 2000s that a new owner brought them out of the 19th century. I can't imagine having to deal with that as a young fan myself. And it's ironic considering that with them and Prince their popularity (aka $) would (and did for the Blackhawks) increase after liberation.  The problem is Prince isn't that popular anymore. Part of it is he's arguably crazy and kinda out of his mind, and another is due to the new generation coming in having no clue who he is because the main place they consume content is blacklisted by him basically. This is incredibly sad because of how good his stuff is, but it's hard to feel bad since he put himself here by shunning the new ways we consume content.

Bob Dylan called it over 50 years ago with The Times They Are Changin. If you don't adapt, the world keeps going without you. He'll always have a following because of how good some of his stuff is, but to stay relevant you need to keep bringing in new people and that's basically not possible for him right now for people below maybe 30.

**edit** Wow I sure pissed off a lot of Prince fans.  &gt;  another is due to the new generation coming in having no clue who he is

That's the price he pays for betting on the new power generation.... I can honestly say I don't think I've ever heard anything prince has made before,  guess  this is why. So, you don't know what it sounds like... when doves cry? I wish I could look up this reference in the places I primarily consume content  Don't worry brah, I've got you.

You see, it's a reference to the lyrics in the song that gTHIS COMMENT IS NOT AVAILABLE IN YOUR COUNTRY DUE TO A COPYRIGHT CLAIM BY WARNER MUSIC, INC.

:\

SORRY  I hate that :/  emoticon on Youtube that displays when they have pulled a video. Its as if its to say "aaaah sorry, we think it sucks tooo" Nope, not Warners. It's Prince's own [NPG Music Publishing](http://www.npgmusicpublishing.com/) that does all the complaining. 

You posted a short video on Instagram of yourself singing a couple of lines of a Prince song? Expect a DMCA takedown.

UPDATE: Here's [the Instagram post](https://instagram.com/p/uHW7RXSU27/) of the guy who received the takedown notice. Lemme quote him:

&gt; Years ago, I paid $175 to see a surprise show in DC in a small theatre. Worth every penny. Prince plays guitar like he is making love to it. And he is quite the performer, obviously. Without mincing words, he totally kicked ass. And that was my Prince memory, and story.
&gt;
&gt; Until now.
&gt;
&gt; Now my story is, One time I sang a Prince song for a few seconds online, and was immediately contacted by his attorneys, because my fifteen second performance of When Doves Cry was too awesome to be ignored and immediately destroyed.

That DMCA complaint came from NPG Records, because these days Prince has the master rights to his WB-era catalogue thanks to his April 2014 deal. Note that this deal also forced him to exclusively license that catalogue to WB for an unknown amount of years, so really not much has changed. He's making reference to when Milhouse (Of Springfield) met Milhouse (Of Shellbyville). Maybe he's just like his father, too bold? Naw, he's just like his mother. She's never satisfied.  Why do we scream at each other? Well, let's take a quick look. A lot of young people kind of woke up to Prince when this performance video made the rounds a few years ago - [Prince playing a guitar solo for "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" at a Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SFNW5F8K9Y#t=3m15s). I think many were surprised that he can play the shit out of a guitar in a pretty "normal" way - he's not just good for weird music. 

But, the main even with Prince, for me, is his writing and composition and arrangement. For example, [Little Red Corvette](http://www.metacafe.com/watch/10777115/prince_little_red_corvette/) - just the first 10 seconds of this song is enough to talk about for half an hour. The vibe he sets up, that opening line (how great is that!?), the the dynamics, the changes in his vocal style for different lines, the metaphors, the arrangement giving extra weight to certain things - there's a lot there. Anyone who's tried to write a pop song can tell you that they wish they could write a "Little Red Corvette."

In terms of hook, he's top tier, of all time. Obviously 1999, When Doves Cry, et al., but there are songs like [Raspberry Beret](http://www.metacafe.com/watch/8305118/prince_raspberry_beret/), that have an undeniable theme - I don't mean theme like you may be thinking - I'm talking musical theme, where when you hear it, your brain knows the whole song. The best non-Prince example of this is Peter Gabriel's "Sledgehammer" - when you hear the first 2 seconds of that song, you know what song it is, who's song it is, and your brain autoplays the whole song just from that one spark of recall. Prince is THE MASTER of "theme." 

You hear one second of "Kiss," and you know what - and who you're listening to.

I recommend buying a Prince greatest hits album if you're a music fan of any stripe. There is a lot in there that's applicable to any genre. 
 His early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Purple Rain came out in '84, I think he really came into his own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Peter Gabriel, but I think Prince has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. If you only ever listen to ONE Prince song you ought to listen to Purple Rain-and I don't just mean the single (if you can find it). http://antiquiet.com/music/2010/05/prince-purple-rain-1983-video/

This is the first time he ever performed it live. Nobody had ever heard it. It's long but the story behind it is cool (least I think so) and it's one of the greatest rock songs ever (IMO). Purple Rain (and Prince) went on to help redefine pop music. Even if you only watch it for music history's sake you should check it out while you can.  But if you listen to TWO Prince songs you should listen to [Batdance](http://en.musicplayon.com/play?v=478997).  Because really, what the fuck? What if I listen to Two Princes instead? That's pretty much the same. There was an album years ago called Stairways To Heaven which was covers of...you guessed it Stairway To Heaven. Prince submitted a version but according to the liner notes they left it off because it made the original seem pass. They claim Weird Al's version did as well. What I wouldn't give to hear those two covers. Well he has got pretty much everything he's got out on Spotify, so he is accepting some of the new ways. My best friend and I are 25 and we still listen to his old music and recent releases. We would both attend a show in a heartbeat. I'm 25 too, and everything I know about Prince has been told to me by Kevin Smith and Dave Chappelle. Game.  Blouses. "computer blue" "Shoot the J! SHOOT IT!"  Why don't you purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka?  Bill Wirtz (aforementioned Blackhawks 'insane owner') decided not to televise home games because, according to him, it was unfair to the season ticket holders, and so he would only grant the televisation if the game sold out (mirroring the despised NFL blackout rule). He did, briefly, appear to show his magnanimity when he implemented a 'pay-per-view' system for home games, called *HawkVision*, which the fans largely considered a direct insult.

These policies, combined with his habit of refusing to spend a modicum of money on acquiring talented players for the team (or holding onto the good ones that the team itself drafted) resulted in very few home games being broadcast, and a diminishing number of fans attending the games in person, and lead to a virtual boycott of the franchise by the fans. His policies earned him the distinction of *'Worst Owner in Professional Sports'* from ESPN.

Things turned around completely when his son, Rocky, took over the franchise shortly before Bill's death in 2007, and [the rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Stanley_Cup_Finals), as they say, [is history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Stanley_Cup_Finals). The ppv offer is insulting as fuck because the local taxpayers usually pay for a vast majority of infrastructure related to the stadium, etc.

When i hear friends talk about that NFL rule it doesn't make me want to buy tickets, it makes me not want to care about football.  This is only tangentially related but basically along the same lines that the NFL is extremely profitable and I don't get why the government spends time protecting them. Specifically, my dad ordered a football jersey online from a random website. He got a letter from homeland security that his package was confiscated because it contained an unauthorized NFL jersey. I get why knockoff jerseys are illegal but I do wish homeland security had better things to do than confiscate single jersey packages and write threatening letters on behalf of the nfl That lead to the Chicago Wolves (AHL) often having better attendance than the Blackhawks for awhile, didn't it? It did, yeah. There were some organized groups that would attend Wolves games in hopes of outselling the Blackhawks as a protest. They succeeded a number of times. That's the entire MLB's line of reasoning for local blackouts.  You know that most of what musicians write, even the very famous, is just crap you will never hear?

Many musicians continually write, every day. In every case, you will only hear a fraction of it. 

When i say crap...

Im sure princes worst songs are beyond most writers. But still, compared to his best stuff, its bound to be crap in comparison. 

Diluting the pool to release it. 

He undoubtedly does not release this stuff, simply because he thinks its not up to snuff.

I have studied this somewhat and most accomplished songwriters often have made maybe 500 songs or more and usually you will only hear about 2-30% of that material. 

For good reason. Like a sculptor needs to practice, so does a songwriter. 

They always save these songs though, since sometimes they are just missing some element that they hope will come to them later.

F.e michael jackson. There was this song he wrote, never released, that he used the bones of to make another song, never released, but he used parts of That song to make the final version, a completely different song really, just had a few melodies from the first version and a few bits from the second version. 

The first version was ok, the second good and the last and final one , was a massive hit and fantastic.

That is how it usually seems to work. I agree.  Prince has crazy high standards for his music and his musicians.  If he thought those tracks were good and he had a chance to release them, he would.  Since he hasn't, I'm sure most of them aren't that great. Back in the 80s and 90s, there was practically an entire subculture of folks who found unreleased material of his and sold / shared it. You'd walk into small record stores and the owner would say, "You like Prince?  Come in the back...." and there would be triple plastic covered vinyl. It was fantastic.

He used to produce two-three full albums a year but only release one of them because he didn't like the other stuff.  I figured they must have been bad, but then I got my hands on The Black Album (before he eventually released it many, many, many years later). HE HID BOB GEORGE FROM US? HOW COULD HE DO THAT?! LOWER YOUR STANDARDS, PRINCE!

On the other hand, when he was on the outs with Warner Bros and they released a bunch of his held-back stuff, I thought: Well, never mind.  I didn't need to listen to Come. Not in Prince's case. That's why it;s unique and the BBC done a documentry on it. The stuff in his vault is stronger than a lot of what he officially released. Seriously, I'm a big Prince fan and when you listen to bootlegs and leaked songs from his vault it really makes you question his sanity on terms of selecting what he releases and what he keeps to himself. His best work remains in his basement.  I remember being on a message board some years ago when someone said that they had an unreleased John Fogerty album called "Hoodoo." I asked for a download link excitedly because, hey, it's John Forgerty; why did he ever scrap an album? Well, turns out that it was, in fact, disappointingly  crappy. It happens. Better to trim down on what you release and put out only your top tier work.  Yep though in the internet era - so many unreleased tracks and mixes end up leaked. Us or him?  We play shows and get a great response, plus we play for ourselves a few times a week.  We're not upset about having those recordings taken down (it's almost like, "Hey - Prince noticed us!") -- lots of people appreciate our versions of his art and we get plenty of chances to share it.  

He certainly also reaches a lot of people even if his music doesn't reach all the people it could if he would just ease up a bit.   I'm sorry, I didn't mean you. I guess I'm just talking about the amount left unheard by so many who would (probably) love it. It seems like there are a lot of lonely songs out there.  Keep in mind, a lot of this is crazy "I'm rich and successful as fuck and eccentric and can do wtfever I want so lets try this weird thing today" stuff, by most accounts.  I'm sure there are some incredible gems in there, but I'd imagine a lot of it is unlistenable and is simply recorded and held on to because Prince is.. Well, Prince. You can still buy it in the normal ways. If he doesn't want to put it up for free or somewhere where get gets paid an infintesimally small amount for thousands of people to enjoy it in a cheap way then he doesn't have to. At the end of the day he's the one who made it and gets to control his art. Not at you personally but reddit has a huge amount of people who just feel entitled to everything without a care about the artist and that isn't sustainable.  And he actually puts stuff on spotify. Just because everyone apparently now uses a video platform like youtube for music? Means it's not up legally? Redditors dont care about the work of others. Must be free and usable in conjunction with adblock or else you are an artist of the 19th century I know a lot of people who have worked with Prince and by all accounts he seems to be kind of a narcissistic jerk who is obsessive about "protecting his property." Not to say he isn't extremely talented or that he doesn't deserve to be where he is just seems like a crazy dude. I'm pretty sure this all came out of the huge problems that he ran into with his record company shafting him. That is, after all, why he became "the artist formerly known as" for a bit - the record company owned his persona. Seriously, the Kevin Smith story seems obligatory here for anyone even beginning to understand him. 

I actually wish there were a Kevin Smith story for all off-beat artists like MJ.  Bless all the people itt who sincerely believe that they've never heard a Prince song. he's on spotify though No doubt.  [Kevin Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZZomOd9BeY) has a great story about Prince - part of it he talks about how there are full length/full production music videos Prince has made that never see the light of day. "Ya, price just has this vault, where he puts stuff in that never sees the light of day" I haven't seen the video in awhile, but when I heard that shit I just lost it. Like he just does that shit, for reasons no fucking person on earth knows.  Because he thinks they aren't up to his standard of excellence. My guess is they are up to his standards. But regular people aren't.  Like real shit. We are talking about the guy who tried to change his name to shape.... A shape.... Not hating, but a fucking shape. I seriously doubt that his thought process is a simple as, "I don't think this is good enough." I mean add on to the whole name shape thing, he puts it in a fucking vault... So he obviously wants to keep them safe.... Hahaha, I'm dying over here trying to explain that prince having a vault that he just stores shit in is not normal human behavior. Prince is a pretty weird guy. I got curious a while back, with all the name changes, and decided to look up his birth name. Turns out it really is Prince. Prince Roger Nelson. The fun part is, his father was John Lewis Nelson, a musician whose stage name was Prince Roger.

His name is literally his father's stage name. That's gotta start you out at a pretty weird place. Actually, his name is Prince Rogers Nelson, named after the Prince Rogers Trio that his dad, John Nelson, played in for many years. I'm not really a Prince fan... but just FYI I'm pretty sure he did that "shape" thing just to make life more difficult for his record company, because at the time he was going through a dispute with them. Walking around with "SLAVE" written on his face was a big tip-off he wasn't happy with the label. Well apparently there are full length music videos. Who produces full length music videos for songs they don't think are up to par? And if the videos themselves are subpar, why not just release the song? Hey, come on now.

Maybe he records full length albums and makes full music videos the same way I make stupid ass vines no one will ever watch.

Everyone needs a hobby. Just because we can't comprehend the measure and scope of his (to us) abnormal hobby doesn't make it less legit.

We all have time to pass. &gt; Like he just does that shit, for reasons no fucking person on earth knows.

Because he doesn't want to be Ryan Adams is why "Prince has been living in Prince world for quite some time now." That was damn interesting. Did not expect the full 31 minutes to be the answer to the question. In his special "Too Fat for Forty" he spends something like an hour on a response. I'm *still* watching Kevin Smith ~~movies~~ **Q&amp;A's** from 3+ hours ago. That video made me realize how great of a story teller Kevin Smith is. All 4 hours of *An Evening With Kevin Smith* is amazing. His Superman story is even better than this one. I enjoyed listening to a guy talking about an anal fissure for 15 minutes... thats how great a story teller he is. "A fucking *spider* shows up!" 'money was spent...'
 &gt; He would ride around listening to his unreleased music

Awesome.  That was my favorite line in the article.  Hell yeah I'm an independent musician and I'm not as cool as prince but I do that all the time at full volume, hoping to subconsciously seed pedestrians' brains with hype for when I release in the future &gt;.&lt; It's something that was also said about Jimi Hendrix. The problem is, unreleased material is unreleased for a reason: it's subpar...  Hendrix stuff was basically outtakes. Prince literally records albums, has a listening party for them, and then stores them in "the vault". He records music videos for the songs on the albums and they go into the vault too. It's crazy.  Here's Kevin Smith talking about making a documentary for Prince. It's a bit long but a good story. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LhcParuzpc this is really interesting, thanks for sharing! Wow. 99% of everything I know about Prince I learned from Kevin Smith within the last hour. That guy should make more movies about his just talking. Telling stories and shit. The podcast is not enough anymore, and I'm saying that as a keen listener. I think this is kinda cool... saving something for his fans. It's like a Funk Bank. Either Prince will lock it up tight behind lawyers or destroy it all. Otherwise his estate will likely release all of it after Prince dies. No doubt Prince has thought of this already, which is interesting because you'd have to wonder whether he wants the world to have it after he's gone. Or, he's one of those people that actually believes that you only truly die when your name is spoken for the last time, and he's left careful instructions to slowly dole this material out after he's gone to perpetuate his legacy.  Then he stores the people who heard the album in a vault, like a Pharaoh.  Well a lot of the Prince stuff is unusual stuff, musical experimentation. The fuck sang as a woman for a record. That's like lady gaga trying to do a Barry White album. Lady Gaga actually does/did have a male persona, but i'm not sure if she released any music as 'him' Jo Calderone!

 A lot of people would disagree with you on Nirvana's "You Know You're Right" which sat in the vaults for 10 years. Then a leak forced them to actually commercially release the thing after radio stations continued to play the leaked mp3. 
 That wasn't unreleased in the sense of "Oh, let's not put this song in the album". Kurt just happened to die before they got to release that song, and they didn't publish it for years partly because Courtney Love and the band's remaining members were in a disagreement over how to proceed afair. No, Prince is manic and obsessive about it.  He produces entire studio albums and doesn't release them. I don't think it was subpar, it was just very unfinished.  Like Jimi is only 20% of it.  Maybe he wrote the lyrics, maybe he laid down one riff.  And then his estate gets other people to fill in the majority of the song and they call it a Jimi Hendrix song.  Bruce Springsteen had a couple decades worth of unreleased music that he then released in 1998.  4 discs worth and the majority of it is great, it just didn't perfectly fit on the albums he was making so it sat.  In some cases you can really get a new sense for what he was thinking about at the time from these outtakes, like musical experiments.  For instance you can hear a punk influence on some Clash-y sounding tracks from The River era.  

Prince is all over the place as a writer and I'm sure there's at least some interesting experiments with him too.  But I'm hoping that there's more catchy-as-shit pop gems like Little Red Corvette or Let's Go Crazy out there. 

 It seems that people don't understand what it takes to make an album. You can't just lob 12 songs together and call it a day.

The making of an album, like breaking up, is hard to do and takes ages longer than it might seem. You gotta kick off with a killer, to grab attention. Then you got to take it up a notch, but you don't wanna blow your wad, so then you got to cool it off a notch. There are a lot of rules.

It's a subtle art. A delicate thing. I thought those were the rules for a mix tape? It may be subpar to you, but many die-hard fans would appreciate listening to his unreleased music. that's the truth. artists are especially hard on their own songs, there are stories out there where a band/artist didn't think a certain song was good enough and yet it turned out to be a big hit for them.  Smoke on the Water comes to mind. Well its kind of a stretch to come up with a song about someone burning down a casino with a flair gun during a frank zappa concert unless it happened for real. Now all you need is to add the most iconic guitar riff of all time. flare gun. Totally different. But I really like the idea of a flair gun. Flair gun sounds like something from Saints Row IV.  Smoke on the Water is about a Zappa concert? Yeah it pretty much tells the story about recording the album or atleast part of it. They had enough material for the album but that fire started at a Zappa concert resulted in one more song.

&gt;We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline

The place they were recording

&gt; To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time

Recording the album with a mobile studio in about 2 weeks.

&gt; Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around

Referencing the live show the band went to.

&gt; But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

When suddenly someone got a stupid idea and destroyed the building in the middle of the show. 

&gt; Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

This should be pretty self explanatory by now since the town is located by Lake Geneva. The rest of the song take up other parts about the recording as being forced to switching recording location and so on. In other words Smoke On The Water was never intended to be on the album but due to "some stupid with a flare gun" at a Zappa concert we ended up with that classic song. Also Sweet Child of Mine, although I think the band was split on whether or not it would be any good. IIRC it was Slash that absolutely hated that song, the rest of the band I couldn't tell you.  Slash lost out on that one, obviously. Fun fact, the riff was something Slash came up as a string skipping exercise. And I believe Izzy or Axl heard it and made a song our of it. "How Soon Is Now" easily the Smiths' biggest hit, was originally a B-side of the 1984 single "William, It Was Really Nothing". I totally agree. my brother used to manage bands and by far the best one kept themselves down. he had secured a record contract for them where they controlled the music completely.  They ended up in the studio for months recording phenomenal stuff.  Everyone was excited including the label but the lead singer/song writer refused to let any of it go to mastering.  He never thought it was good enough and they were kicked off the label and my brother dropped them because they wanted to be big but refused to release anything and would skip gigs because ''it wasnt the right environment'. last i heard they do jam gigs in coffee shops in austin under a different name. i still have their demos though, badass stuff. Yeah, you're gonna have to uhh... provide some context.

Namely sound files, specifically streamed ones. Sail - AWOL Nation - was like a one-off; the singer said, it's fine, cause it aint that good....major hit.  I don't know any other song by them, and it is a great song. You should listen to Kill Your Heroes. It's amazing.  Exactly I listen to shitty ass sublime recordings all the time, horrible quality. Bradley has beautiful stuff recordings through fucking phone messages. They also have tons of professional recordings that may never be released. It makes me really sad. I would pay large amounts of money for that stuff, like more than i would for Wu Tangs new album. And love the Wu. Billy corgan is no better. There's cds and cds of his unreleased stuff. Hell, he made a 25 minute collage of some of them! I mean I can't speak on what the stuff sounds like, but prince just puts shit away. For like reason that can only be understood by prince.... Like you know, when he tried to change his name in to a shape. That guy is stashing videos, and music, and I don't know candy bars. Point is, it's prince, if your looking to understand the reasons for his actions, you might as well look for a squirrel in the Atlantic ocean.  I think the reason he changed his name to a shape was to get out of a recording contract. By changing his name to a shape he could still release his own music. When the terms of the contract expired he changed his name back to Prince. Someone correct me if I'm wrong? Ya Im not saying he didn't have his reasons. I think the record company said they owned his name, so he did it as a big fuck you.... But let's be real... It was shape. That has to be the single most weird and awesome reaction to anything, ever. That's like if a basketball player didn't like what one of the refs called. And while still on the court let all the air out of it and then threw it in the refs face.  It was actually really clever.  Everyone had to refer to him as "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince" because how do you pronounce a fucking shape.  It kept the name Prince firmly in people's minds until the contract expired and he could reclaim his name under the terms of the contract.  If he'd renamed himself "Kontwika" or "Jeff" it would never have worked. Seriously, I've tried it, and getting the acorn on the hook is not an easy task. http://i.imgur.com/jshacaU.jpg Pretty sure the same thing is true of Neil Young, however, that's a staggering amount of stuff.

To think people in the next century could hear new Prince albums is difficult to process, sort of like how they will hear that Wu-Tang album and we ~~haven't yet~~ won't. No one can make money distributing the new Wu Tang for 88 years. It can be given away for free if/when the new owner wants to. So no vinyl or cd no iTunes no spotify. At least not for profit.  Someone get that man a torrent client! "Leave the world".. Prince has to go now. His home planet needs him. He has entire full-length movies shot, edited, mastered and ready for duplication and distribution that will, in the words of his one-time personal assistant, "Never see the light of day".  Sometimes he just decides at the eleventh hour that something isn't working and walks away.  There's a Q&amp;A with his former manager and ex-bandmates somewhere on YouTube, where they talk about his near-bankruptcy in the late 1980's and early 1990's, after he emulated his hero James Brown in more than just dance moves.  There's musicians, engineers, producers and record company executives right around the world still owed thousands if not millions of dollars, because they took him at his word and didn't sign any formal contracts; they were simply in awe of the chance to work with the guy, and didn't do the ABC's.  

But for all the stories about how basically cruel and unthinking he can be, there's also the times when you can see why people just want to be around him.  One former drummer of his talks about the time he was ordered to drive up to Paisley Park at 3am with no warning.  When he got there, Prince had already burned out one drummer, and was going through the entire Stevie Wonder back-catalogue in sequence.  Prince was on bass, Stevie Wonder was on keys, Sheila E was on percussion, and the only two people in the audience were Salma Hayek and Joni Mitchell.  

Now that's a gig! I fucking love Prince.  Hate all you want, the man is a genius.  And wasn't the whole "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince" drama a jab at  record companies?  Apparently, whoever he was previously signed to wouldn't let him use his own name so that was his way of fucking with them.. He had signed a contract under the name "Prince." However, the label kept wanting him to make a certain type of music. To release what he wanted to make, he changed his stage name to that symbol. The media called him that because the symbol has no pronunciation. Cool,  thanks for clarification.   From this [link](https://rockhall.com/inductees/prince/bio/)

"He was thereafter referred to (at his own suggestion) as 'The Artist Formerly Known as Prince' or simply 'The Artist.'" Good old TAFKAP. Going to see him play at his studio in Paisley Park as we speak. I love when he plays these spur of the moment shows.  How are these shows announced?   The one in Manchester had a sign put up two weeks on advanced. People came from all around Europe, queued for over a week and he only let the first 10 people in  Wait what? He played a gig for ten people? Prince does as Prince does. Last year Prince was rumored to play in Brussels where his crew was spotted carrying flight cases and whatnot inside a concert hall. We were closeby so we decided to go check it out. There were about 200 people waiting outside. After a couple of hours someone came out to announce that Prince would not be playing there that night but he would play the next night.

The next day the news and social media were all over it. Princed did 3 concerts in one night. People were standing in line half a day and payed 100 euros to get in to one of the one-hour shows. I guess the days when he used to do free surprise shows and played for hours are long gone. I have a ton of respect for Prince because he's a fantastic live performer. I don't really like a lot of his music, and the guy is weird as fuck, but he's a great performer... and he's also seemingly very good to his fans. I had a friend who saw him a few years ago and he apparently played a three-and-a-half hour show or something like that - he went off and came back for encore after encore because people just kept cheering.

It's just a shame that his intense relationship with the internet keeps people from *watching* a lot of those awesome live performances. Damn. I live ten minutes away and have missed every single one of these.  Get ready for a late night.  Went to a few if these over a decade ago and he didn't go on till very late.   Doesn't he have a disease that has a simple cure, yet he refuses treatment because of his religious beliefs?  Boneitis http://i.imgur.com/jgeTwOn.gif It's the only thing he regrets. He does have some kind of health issue, and as a Jehovah's Witness (seriously) he will not get blood transfusions or donated organs.  There may also be other medical restrictions that he follows.  At one point some years ago he was kind of hobbling around with a cane but he does seem to be better now.

Someone please correct me if I have mischaracterized either Prince or the JWs.  

P.S. Prince is the shit regardless of how batshit he is. Dude's a Witness and you're right. Which strikes me as odd what with the blatant third eye imagery he's used lately.  Haha, yeah really.  Seems like whatever Prince does, he does it his way. Just because he is a Jehovah's Witness doesn't mean other Jehovah's Witnesses can't tell that he is obviously one crazy dude.  Also JW's don't get blood transfusions but most are willing to accept organ transplants. He's got the funk. http://henpantha.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/0-the-mighty-boosh-s02e05-thefunk.jpg That rumor has been around for years. If youve seen Prince dance in those years you know his hips are just fine. Source? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_%28musician%29#Personal_life

Relevent section:

&gt; Prince became a member of Jehovah's Witnesses in 2001 following a two-year-long debate with friend and fellow Jehovah's Witness, musician Larry Graham.

&gt; Prince has reportedly needed double-hip-replacement surgery since 2005 but won't undergo the operation unless it is a bloodless surgery because Jehovah's Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions.[131] 

&gt; However, when Prince was interviewed in 2010, journalist Peter Willis said he believed the rumors of Prince needing double hip surgery to be unfounded and untrue as Prince appeared to be agile.

So all in all, he may need surgery but take what you hear with a grain of salt unless it's from Prince himself. Would that allow for his own blood to be put back into him?  You could make the case that it's not really a "transfusion" in that case. when you say 'leave the world' it sounds like he's gonna board an Elven ship and pass out of the Sphere of Middle-Earth into Valinor. [Viper](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5gQB07Vco4zBCUNbf8SBx4) has enough material for one song a day until the next millennium. WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT
 One day i sat down and and listened to his complete discography,by day i mean full week You're a fucking mad man. [Seems like some coward here](https://a1-images.myspacecdn.com/images03/35/4bf72d381de84320a32ab243bea604ba/600x600.jpg) [doesn't even smoke crack.](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/7BO4J0Zreug/maxresdefault.jpg) It took a few listens, but once I got past the obvious bizarre nature of his music, I really started to enjoy its woozy, chilled-out, weird thug kinda vibe. If you hit him up on twitter, he'll give you his personal number. He'll later try to sell you on his real estate business (not even joking.) Nonetheless, nice guy; although I have this strange feeling that he might be slightly mentally handicapped.  I smell a conspiracy brewing. I can hear the gears of his music label execs turning now. Suddenly Prince dies in a gang shooting. The label then gets a hold of all his unreleased material and starts churning out albums and raking in all the profits without having to pay royalties to Prince. Sound familiar? (hint: Tupac) I need another hint. Hint: The Artist Formerly Alive as Tupac. Makaveli  If Prince ever leaves this world, it's because his home planet is in trouble and needs his assistance. There is a 30 minute version of "I Would Die 4 U" that should be considered as a whole album.  I love the way this quote was phrased. It's like Prince might take off in a spaceship at his leisure. 

*And I really wouldn't be surprised if that's exactly what he did.* I love Prince but most unreleased music is unreleased for a reason. And really, his *released* stuff in the past twenty years isn't really worth listening to, compared to his first fifteen. They said the same thing about Michael Jackson; he left hundreds of songs so albums would be coming out for years to come. Just about all of them turned out to be demos. Prince doesn't do demos. There are numerous completely finished songs that have leaked and barely any demos. We've got the demo of "Kiss" for instance, and I don't immediately recall any other. Let's not forget: mere days after finishing the Purple Rain Tour, Prince went into a recording studio, set down at the drum set, told Susan Rogers to hit record and played the drum track of the first four songs of Parade IN ONE GO. No click track or anything. He already had the songs in his mind, and simply recorded them from scratch there and then. Then he recorded the rest of the parts (bass, guitar, etc.). That's what you hear on that record: that very recording. Susan says you can occasionally even hear his "jewelry". Jesus. I didn't know that, that's gangster as fuck. We can no longer use the upstairs restroom at Low End Theory after Prince stopped by to take a piss there. True Story. I imagine a lot of artists who've been around for decades will have a huge collection of stuff that's never made it onto an album. Though just because it's recorded doesn't mean it's any good or even worthy of a posthumous release.  Prince's case is significantly different.  It's not random jam sessions or doodles on a note pad.  He supposedly has hundreds of fully produced music videos, with actors and other artists.  That's just stuff he decided was worth making a video for.  Imaging how much fully produced music he has and how many random jam sessions he has.  He apparently has a lot of unreleased documentary footage too. At the record company meeting

On their hands, a dead star

And oh, the plans they weave

And oh, the sickening greed

At the record company party

The sycophantic slags all say

"I knew him first, and I knew him well..." Once you start writing music, it goes a lot like writing words in kindergarten. You learn to express yourself with basic shapes, gain skill at it, and pretty soon, you could describe the sunset as viewed from your backporch and have it sound almost beautiful. Though, even the best writers have difficulty forcing that beauty out and onto paper, on command. And so, among writers of any sort, a large portion of their work is really only suitable for those who wish to learn about the life of the writer, not those looking to simply enjoy quality writing. They condense the good, package it for sale, try to sell it, and it's much the same with music. 

My 'discography' lasts about 3 hours, back to back, but still, even though I made them/love the songs, I can tell that over 90% of it is banal, rehashed shit-sundays. 

My whole musical existence, over 10 years writing, and it all boils down into one album I can be proud of, and hours of "meh, I guess I wouldn't turn it off if I had to get up to reach the button".

I bet if you asked Prince why he doesn't make the charts anymore, when he has so many songs in backlog, he would say "because those songs suck". From a creating standpoint I can see what you mean, but from a troubleshooting standpoint I don't see a pile of fails here. When an artist has amassed a "backlog" its time to go over it again objectively. Put yourself in your audience's shoes. How can you make it something ppl won't want to turn off? 

You got early drafts. You may feel they are chiseled in stone but sound is malleable. Work with what you got. Star Trek fan-fic with Captain Kirk grooving to the new Prince posthumous album. The idea is mine. I am doing it.  I would probably pay to read that tbh Man is a genius and doesn't get enough credit in my book. A surprising amount of people know nothing about him. That being said, I trust his ear and decision on what to release (and what to hold back). He's developed in so many interesting ways I'd assume most of the stuff is purely experimental, practice, or learning oriented in nature. Prince is the fucking MAN! I don't know why there's a lot of haters coming out the woodwork here but he is a genius. Say what you want but the man can play piano and guitar and just about anything else like a champ. He is a genius.  That's why the Republicans hate him and want him to die.  That is the way of their kind. to me..a musician able to play all instruments does not make him "the man". And if he is supposed to be a genius, he has to prove it first. he just puts it all in a vault inside prince-world It's like a visual artist. They may have created paintings that have sold for small fortunes, but for every painting there are *hundreds* of sketches, doodles, rough drafts, and notebooks left in their wake. 

The same goes for a musician. If you're the kind of person who writes music constantly, the space it requires adds up. I knew a guy who had recorded about 100 cassette demo tapes by the time he was 21. A lot of it sucked, but hey, the dude was driven &amp; lived music.

That being said, I would probably keep my bad stuff in my vault. Prince left this world a long time ago. Kevin smith spoke about a project he worked on, which went on the vault.  Buckethead definitely has the most material of any artist I've ever seen. He releases like 10 full length albums a year Denis Taaffe has 195+ albums out. If you count Pearl Jam's live Official bootlegs, I think they only have 260 of those. Buckethead has released 118 albums JUSt since April of 2013, and he's had hundreds before that. 151 according to Wikipedia. Buckethead has released 118 albums JUSt since April of 2013, and he's had hundreds before that. there are alot of prolific writers in rock...one of them, Robert Pollard of Guided by Voices once quipped: "I can write 5 songs while taking a shit, and 3 of them might even be good"...prolific does always translate to good.... The new prince album is out! "30 years of tuning the E string plus assorted noodling" And most of it will be utterly uninteresting. 

Have you listened to anything he released in the past 20 years? At best it's mediocre, but the vast majority is instantly forgettable and some of it is amongst the worst he's ever recorded ("Purple &amp; Gold", the whole of Kamasutra,...).

There is some unreleased gold, plenty of it from approx. 1981-1988. But I'd venture that we've already heard most of it through bootlegs. If you listen to the BBC documentary this article references, the people interviewed only mention songs that have been available on bootleg for more than a quarter of a century ("Moonbeam Levels", "In All My Dreams",...). Sure, there's still a bunch of unreleased stuff we only know about, that hasn't been leaked, but that is mostly alternate versions (e.g. a version of Parade with all of the orchestra parts Clare Fischer composed).

The "live box set" Alan Leeds mentioned? That one already exists on bootleg, with at least one soundboard recording for each Prince tour of the 1980s. We even have soundboard recordings of several magnificent aftershows (Holland 1988), birthday gigs (7 June 1984), even the gig where Purple Rain was recorded. Hell, there's even a full video of that gig circulating. We've also got soundboard audio of interesting rehearsals.

Mere days ago almost three dozen outtakes leaked, most of them in better quality than ever before (though plenty of them fading out after two minutes, so presumably these are "samples" for an upcoming bootleg release). These include a near pristine version of the full-length "Computer Blue" (a magnificent seven-plus trip) and several previously unheard outtakes from 1982 that we have only had descriptions of for 20+ years.

Fans would happily pay Prince for these things, even if we already have them. Instead we get lawsuits. And thus online Prince fandom is reduced to one outdated forum-site (prince.org) and an underground network that circulates bootlegs. And that underground network is also attacked so often it has been reduced to mostly rubble. I dunno.  Although he obviously had his "Golden Era" and even I stopped listening to him for a while at the end of the 90s, I find most of his modern releases are .. "decent".  As in .. 1 - 3 good songs and the rest "meh".  Which is pretty much consistent with any average artist for me.

And the fact is that he still can surprise with with a killer track once in a while.  I can't say the same about a lot of artists 35 years into their career. I've never been a big fan, can't really name more than a half dozen songs before I start running out of stuff I like. I've tried listening to his "best albums" but don't really see what's all that special about them and why he's worshipped so much.

\_()_/ yeah its been spotty but Musicology was an excellent album. The Rainbow Children was also really odd/enjoyable. His One Nite Alone/Live at the Alladin in Las Vegas stuff was fucking fantastic. His latest album was decent, but admittedly not his best stuff. I need to find these bootlegs you mentioned. Do you think maybe Prince is just quietly releasing material here and there as bootlegs? how does this stuff get leaked? Prince historian here - feel free to ask me anything about the vault of unreleased music. A few hundred songs from it have bootlegged over the years, and much of it is absolutely stellar stuff. I don't know where this idea about songs not coming out due to being "subpar" came from - that may be the case with others, but it's definitely not the case with Prince. Some unreleased songs are up there with his very best work.  Can you provide some track/bootleg titles as an example?  Sure. Some of my favorite unreleased tracks include "Electric Intercourse" which  is Purple Rain era - last year in Birmingham he performed this for the first time since 1983, I was there in the front row and my jaw hit the floor! Another favorite is "Extraloveable" which was done in the "1999" sessions. Due to overwhelming fan demand he eventually rerecorded and released a version of this a couple of years ago, but the original has that youthful exuberance and bite to it, plus the awesome drum machines and synths he used back then :) 

Last week a previously unheard track from 1982 leaked called "If It'll Make You Happy" which we fans are currently losing our shit over, it's in a new wave / pop reggae ish style and is a really great song. Another track called "Jealous Girl" also leaked last week - an uptempo funk track that was offered to The Bangles at the same time he gave them "Manic Monday" and is awesome!

A track called " Cosmic Day" has been something of a holy grail for a lot of fans including myself, since a short clip of it leaked a few years ago. The clip only contained the first verse and chorus. Recently, a longer edit that includes the second verse leaked but the full track has yet to surface. It's a very polarising track - a rock track that features incredibly high pitched up vocals. Most Prince songs where he pitched up his vocals, he usually had sang at his natural pitch, but this track was sang in falsetto and THEN pitched up, so it sounds quite crazy and weird in a cool way which suits the subject matter. From what I've seen fans either adore this song, or really don't like it at all. I love it. 

Another awesome track is "Lust U Always" from the 1981 sessions for "Controversy"..... There's a great song called "Lisa" from the 1980 Dirty Mind sessions where he's singing to his keyboard player at the time, Lisa Coleman (of Wendy &amp; Lisa). 

There's so many, but these are just a few of my personal faves from the vault.  That's not shit. Buckethead has released, not written, released 120+ albums since April of 2013. Buckethead is the man but most of his albums are basically him practicing. And of the same style. Zappa and R Stevie Moore's prolificacy(?) are far more impressive imo. I agree some of his music could be described as improv, but even the more rigorously structured/composed works alone make up a phenomenal output rate. And he does stuff in a very wide variety of styles - especially if you include his work as DeathCubeK, his collaborations and soundtrack work.


 His current works are all proper albums. Every once in a while he'll get pretty experimental, but most of his stuff is structured and composed properly. And the amazing thing is that they're pretty listenable...at least the 2 or 3 that I've heard. 

It's incomprehensible to me what Buckethead's life must be like. Making albums is essentially his 9-to-5 gig, and there's no way he could be making (much) money off them.  His albums are always on the best sellers of Bandcamp under Rock music. He can't be doing bad though.  I bet things like clinics and appearances keep him pretty busy and keep money flowing. Who? Guitarist who plays wearing a KFC bucket on his head and whips out nunchucks at live shows. Legend has it he was raised by chickens in a chicken coop... or lives in a coop with chickens... I forget exactly but I'm pretty sure he's ~~batshit~~ chickenshit insane.  [Lived in a coop, raised in a cage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8p3zsOMcP4). the difference here is quality I love prince's music, I think he's a hugely underrated guitarist too. I just wish he wasn't such a douchebag...is that too much to ask? If an alien put on a human disguise you couldn't blame him for not acting right.  he's rated 33rd by Rolling Stone... not really under-rated I think he should be higher than that honestly. But I think I meant underrated in that most people - I believe - don't really think of him as some amazing guitarist. I wasn't aware of his ability until I saw him play at that George Harrison tribute, the guy killed it. Right? And I'll bet that almost every one ahead of him on the list is just a fuckin' full-time guitar player, not a multi-instrumentalist who spends most of his time in the production studio Best thing about some Prince albums is how it says, "Written, produced, and performed by Prince" or something like that. Put Prince in a studio alone, and Sign o' the Times comes out. Name one pereon above him who isnt a multi-instrumentalist. I think the big difference is vocals.  Prince is a fantastic singer, and obviously became known as a "voice and look" before any of his other skills.

It's one thing to be a "guitarist/bassist/banjo/keys/drums/baliphone" kind of guy.  That is not *so* uncommon.  What is uncommon is to combine virtuoso guitar with amazing lead vocals and "frontman quality". 

I think it's possible that there has never been anyone else in the history of music who kills it with guitar and _amazing vocals that just can't be copied_ like Prince.

(And then there is the whole dancing thing hiding over here on the side of the discussion which we shall not even discuss.)

Can anyone else think of an artist that is as virtuoso on guitar and vox? John fruscinate Devin Townsend; and he's a top-class producer too. Good call.  I had forgotten about Townsend (I remember when he hooked up with Vai, but I was never a fan of the super-hard stuff so I kind of lost track of him afterwards.)   I just checked out some of his other stuff and you are right, the guy is a major talent.

I think DT is even a better "shredder" compared to Prince.  _But_ .. I humbly suggest that Prince's vocal work is on different level.  Those intricate old-school r+b vocal runs just don't even come up in the repertoire of modern heavy vocalists Hmm. His vocal work is more than just heavy growls, he's got a big set of pop pipes on him too. Check some of the stuff off Epicloud for example. You may still be right though; I don't know the R&amp;B style quite so well so I can't judge them evenly. Yeah I caught some of that, and I was well impressed.  I remember him being very "extreme" and agressive, but I checked some of the live stuff and I was well impressed with his consistency and quality of his vocals.  The lower and mid-rangey stuff as well as the screams, wails, and growls.  I think he might have the best live technique for that style that I have seen. I mean a full-time multi-instrumentalist, not simply somebody who is capable of playing more than one instrument.  Hugely underrated guitarist? On what planet? Well, the younger generation knows jackshit about him, which would include the fact that he plays guitar.

I'm 20, for context. Before I learned about Prince's guitar playing on /r/guitar or something (specifically, him doing an amazing solo for While My Guitar Gently Weeps), I always thought of him as a weird, gay, crazy, less successful version of Michael Jackson. The image I had of him was of women's clothes and hip gyrating, not the image of purple guitar solos in the rain that I should have if Prince didn't hate the Internet. Gay? No..been married twice, has been linked to some of the hottest chicks that ever lived, he's just..eccentric. I've seen him live 4 times, he wore the paint off the guitars and piano. I know, *now*. But in high school, never having heard any of Prince's music and only knowing of him through cultural osmosis? That's what he seemed like at 14. Earth.  I've been playing 32 years, all the players I ever jammed with loved the guy. He is underrated in the eyes of the general populace. The general populace doesn't give a shit about guitar playing. Is there something in particular you could tell us? he destroyed a guy's very rare guitar during one of the late night talk shows. he had borrowed the guitar from the guitar player of the sit in band. For those curious:

&gt; According to Death and Taxes, the ax was a loaner from house band guitarist Captain Kirk Douglas. After eyeing it during rehearsal, Prince asked to borrow it for the live show and because Prince gets what Prince wants, Douglas obliged.

&gt; The rest is history. The Purple One went to town on his 1979 sex jam "Bambi," ending the song by throwing off the guitar and letting it crash onto the stage.

&gt; [...]

&gt; What's worse is that Douglas reportedly asked Prince to sign the guitar, but the Sign O' the Times star refused, prompting the following tweet from the Roots member:

From [here](http://www.spin.com/articles/prince-smashed-someone-elses-guitar-fallon/). Like that one time he sued some mom because she posted a video of her baby doing baby stuff on YouTube and one of his songs was playing on the radio in the background? For his movie Under The Cherry Moon, he refused to kiss one of the actresses because she had had a baby.  Finding that out made me realise, yep, he's a douche...

He also tried to close down several of his biggest fansites for no real reason (and not long after he'd gone on a huge publicity blitz with the superbowl performance, new album, phone deal etc, pretty hypocritical). Yes.  Who cares?  His shit is dope, that's all you need. I mean, it may not be good, but it's there. It's his goal to write a song a day till he dies. He's been at it for decades. Call it 1990. Probably earlier. 

25 yearsx365=9125 Potential Songs in the vault. An average of 12 songs per album gets us 760 Potential Albums in the vault.

It doesn't even matter if all the numbers are off by half. It would STILL make the headline plausible. Prince is a fucking machine. &gt; It's his goal to write a song a day till he dies.

Which is just BS. There's plenty of documentation and the reality is he often revisits songs over the year. Plus: you can't do that when you're touring. There's very little evidence of him being this busy constantly. Just recently he released a cover of "What If" that he recorded two plus years ago. I don't see why he'd drag out a two year old recording of a cover if he'd done so much original material recently. I don't get it, he just wore a suit... I don't get it either. She says he looks too much like her husband, and then calls him creepy and disgusting. Is it just me, or does she have some feelings to work out? I think she was just looking for an angle and went a bit too far.  She's going to shit when she watches Reservoir Dogs. I don't know what you're talking about this guy is bland and unoriginal. Her husband on the other hand invented this style he was the first man to put on a suit and comb his hair. This is what bothers me. Doesn't anyone know this husband invented suits back in the 1700s in the Victorian era?  *ahem* 1800s That Queen Vic, greedy bitch living for 200 years... [deleted] did you catch the person who called her cleopatra?  It was Stan Walker, one of the other judges. It was something like " but you're copying Cleopatra..." Better keep her away from Janelle Monae too - might cause too many brain cells to burn out in frustration  Don't forget Robert Palmer...

Oh wait, he was 'first..." Frank Sinatra might disagree.  Yeah that's what I'm assuming here.

Obviously she's too stupid to figure out she went wayyyy too far...but I'm assuming they train the judges to some degree to make sure they say controversial remarks to keep things interesting. It sounded like she was just coming up with whatever mean thing she could think of to say, sadly "you look like my husband" was all she had and then she just kept going with it not actually putting any thought into what she was saying.


I think Simon Cowell was a pro at it, he was able to say mean shit, but he never just berated the person for one thing. This chick coulda just said "are you trying to copy my husband?" and left it, moved on and called his singing bad or something. She could fit the "mean" judge ticket and not make herself look like a piece of shit. &gt;obviously she's too stupid.

You could have just stopped there.

You're spot on about Cowell. He gave *constructive* criticism. He was never a cunt just for the sake of being a cunt. "Quite frankly, you suck" is *technically* constructive, I guess At least he would be talking about their signing, not their appearance. Well, when he say room for constructive criticism, then he applied that.   Guy was in the business of spotting talent, for more than a decade before the show, so even that was just honesty. The argument she was making... badly... was that anyone who would slick their hair back and wear a suit to audition in front of a singer who slicks their hair back and wears a suit is an unoriginal person, and that it is disgusting that they would do something like that...

It's stupid, because that's the white person's go-to "I wanna look good" look. It was around long before her husband, and will be around long after. Shit, don't even need to be white. I do the same exact thing and I have brown skin. There is only so much a guy can do with short hair.  And a suit. and her husband is right there and they're not dressed alike at all. And her husband goes of to say how he looks like he would kill all of the audience and cut them up, like the American Psycho guy... I guess he was just getting that from his own personal desires? But that's how I dress at work :( You disgust me. frist of all how **dare** yo u Serial killer! Like wearing people's faces as masks, do you? You make me physically sick. Well I didn't say what I did for my job I'm embarrassed to be in this thread with you  Do you not have any value or respect for originality??

You're a laughing stock!

It's cheesy!

It's disgusting!

EDIT: STOCK. NOT STALK. STALK. I FUCKING GET IT A laughing stalk? Like anthropomorphic celery? [deleted] Oh come on, her likeness to the Hamburgler is uncanny.  http://cheezburger.com/6415927808

http://www.styleite.com/news/16-times-natalia-kills-respected-creative-integrity-and-intellectual-property/ The article says you might remember him as a graduate of Wellington High School, but he didn't graduate. He left school when he was 16. It said graduate and inventor of suits so I think it was a stab at him being neither. Not that long. The corn rows are making a classy come back baby &gt;She says he looks too much like her husband, and then calls him creepy and disgusting.                                 

Which I find hilarious because like a minute later, her husband is talking about murdering people and cutting off their faces.  And how original was her own look. And her husband invented the suit and hairstyle? They are both disgusting creatures. I'm also disappointed that the other 2 judges didn't say anything at the time. They did after the pair was sacked, but not during.  The other female judge defended the contestant right after, saying he looked better in a suit than the husband The other female judge was/is Mel Blatt from Uk girl band All Saints I missed that bit. Good for her!

I've never wanted to reach through a TV screen so much and just bang their heads together.  they just stare at the two of them while they dig their own graves, pretty hilarious.  Imagine how popular they'd be now if at the time they both fully ripped into those vile cocksuckers. 

Does anyone know if the pair has issued an apology or statement? I'm not sure about the husband, but I know Natalia put out a tweet saying she appreciates all her fans for knowing she likes to speak her opinion and then linked one of her shit music videos.  ... which now has 20k dislikes, and is still rapidly spiralling downward. Hah. Good. She and her husband deserve everything happening to them. What they did was completely over the top and unnecessarily cruel. The guy was on the verge of tears. Show some common decency for fucks sake. What makes it worse is that Joe Irvine had spoken about having depression and being bullied and he had a heartbreaking bit where he talked about how he "never felt good enough". And then she does this. And throughout her tirade, despite her vitriol, all he has to say is "Thank you Natalia, you're beautiful".

He deserves to dress like a gentleman far more than her horrid husband. Mel, the other female judge, was on the radio the next morning saying that due to the audience yelling she could't actually really hear everything being said - and that if she had she would have jumped in.

 Melanie (the other female judge) called Natalia a "twat" over Twitter. As soon as she starts saying he's copying her husband, Stan Walker says "but don't you copy Cleopatra?" Lightning-fast wit. [The husband](http://i.imgur.com/j3aEBJa.png) is not creepy at all.

Edit: The wife is totally taking [someone](http://i.imgur.com/VnGGhtz.jpg) else style as well. The wife looks like a goth Dora. He reminds me of [the human Ken doll.](http://assets-s3.usmagazine.com/uploads/assets/articles/72346-human-ken-doll-justin-jedlica-five-things-to-know/1397671856_rexusa_1235589cc_-justin--jedlica-ken-doll-zoom.jpg) I was gonna say Toby, [the guy who got plastic surgery, trying to look like Justin Bieber](http://justin-bieber-music.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Toby-SHeldon-My-Strange-Addiction-to-Justin-Bieber.jpg) I like this one: http://i.imgur.com/B0xfiOk.png Thank you for this invaluable input, the second comparison was truly great.  She does, but did you hear the shit her husband said? Something about him being a serial killer that would wear people's skin? They're a perfect match. I don't get it either *either*, the contestant looks more like the host than the crazy chick's husband on the bench. And... why am i even worrying about it, I don't know.... Her husband (soon to be ex-husband now) invented the wearing of suits, as well as the combing of hair.  She's going to shit herself when she finds out about elvis. Life was rough for us all before her husband came along.

Thank God for whatshernames husband And don't those shows usually have a stylist who dresses the contestants anyway? I think she was going for "edgy" but came off "cunt". Right, just a suit...  Like you didn't notice they both slicked their hair back??  I can't even.... Even the host was wearing a suit with his hair slicked back too.. I was like what the literal fuck is going on here?
 It's almost as if they have hair stylists who do the hair of everyone on the show. Stepped too far over the "edge" of "controversial" "meanness".  Even having viewed this clip of blatant controversy-mongering leaves me feeling violated.

These two got fired for making the breakdown of the illusion that these shows are in any way real too obviously self-evident.  not for being "too mean". "Finger Quotes" Okay, so maybe I *don't* "bathe regularly"! This is just baiting people for the sake of controversy. If you have controversy you have people paying attention to your show, people paying attention to your show=$$$ Up until a point. When the social media response starts to snowball, the [sponsors take note](http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/67416944/sponsors-slate-x-factors-natalia-kills-and-willy-moon) &amp; start to make noises about the situation, the producers realise there are even more $$$ at stake. Then they pull the plug on their 'angle' ASAP I was actually shocked to learn that the X factor is still running, this whole thing could be just what they need. On the bright side, she won't have to be "embarrassed to be here" anymore. I really hope the network told her they're embarrassed to be there with her. Career killer move. I still don't understand how people like this ever 'make it'...? They actually haven't "made it", their own music never broke top 20 in the country that they're presenting for. 
Half of us had/ have no idea who the fuck they are.  She's british and had to fly all the way to NZ to be a judge in a song  contest tv show there. No disrepect to the Kiwis, but that speaks a lot about "how far" she went career-wise. You know I was just talking to a friend about this last night.  How it's weird to think about rich celebrities who are assholes to people behind counters or on the street.  

Like, to me it seems like it takes more effort for me to try to be a dick in a situation.  Being nice seems like so much less work.  

But it made me wonder if for some people it's the opposite, it takes them more effort to not be a dick.  Eventually when they stop concentrating the douche just slips out and they can't even help it. thats a cool way to think about it. However, I really see people enjoy it. They feel empowered, because most wont push back, but they're just waiting for the one person to give them a reason to make scenes or create conflict. these people are addicted to it.  I'm that guy who must actively censor myself. I hate being an asshole and I'm hoping if I do this long enough it'll just be second nature... I want everyone to like me. Even just a little.. One of her popular (I use that word relatively) songs is a blatant, almost word-for-word rip off of *Rich Girl* by Hall &amp; Oates.  So much for being "an artist who respects creative integrity and intellectual property". It's usually the fakes who try and call people out for being fake. The liars who always think people are lying. People project themselves on others. Hilarious when the presenter joins him on stage with slicked back hair and a suit. http://i.imgur.com/CBtumNg.png The look on the Host's face is literally "This bitch..." "Glad I didn't go with the black tie" That's exactly what they said in the article.

&gt;"...when the host comes out to join a beleaguered Joe and is in the same exact outfit with the same slicked back hair." No, they were just copying /u/Dr_Crocochoc Absolutely disgusting. The writer might start wearing /u/Dr_Crocochoc 's skin and start stabbing people. I love how he handled it, just smiled back as the crowd boo'd at that woman.  He handled it really well. I would have cried like a bitch knowing everyone in the audience was watching and the people watching national tv He looked like he was welling up a little bit(and who could blame him?).  He should have let it flow, sympathy votes could win you a show like that. I would have called her a cunt. I'm pretty sure he didn't even style himself. Like, there are stylists for that. The whole thing makes no sense at all. 
 He was wearing rain boots at his audition... He put a suit on because of the type of music he was singing. Those hosts are just mean people who get off by putting others down.  How **DARE** you come in here wearing a suit when singing a piece that could be in any James Bond film. 

Fuck you for looking the part. I  mean seriously, if anything he was dressed the part of Michael Bubl, a man known for wearing suits and slicking back his hair, also much more famous than whoever the fuck that bitch's husband is. 




 &gt;Actually, you look better than her husband.

Justice. I wanted to hear someone tell her how her husband must've stolen from every guy who's ever wore a suit, tie, and slicked back hair. So is her husband copying every other crooner style singer before him? And is she copying GaGa/Madonna/fuckin Cleopatra? I hope those two never are allowed air time again.  When she starts with her tirade, Stan Walker immediately says "but don't you copy Cleopatra!?" He even went to say they're stupid and that he's glad to see them get sacked from the show. At least one of those judges is a smart person.  Yeah Stan Walker is a nice guy and he is humble. Not like these two twats who think everything is about them. My mate from Queensland used to work with Stan at the mens clothing store, man 2 man. He told me that he is such a nice and humble guy and is still in contact with him after all these years. 
 The other lady disagreed with her "Actually actually actually" and she went on to call her a twat on twitter.  I'd say Natalia and Willy were the only idiots on the show. Also, I'd like to point out that the husband is wearing all black. That's NEVER been done before by an artist.

Oh wait, except for that one guy.....God what was his name? Everyone? I think it's everyone. Actually took a few pages of searching on youtube. But here is his full performance.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyrN-twMTQE

I thought it was pretty good. Not great. But I have major respect for anyone going on stage to do this.

Bonus edit: his audition. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-gAtIb0AXY Even better! The kid's a crooner!

Slicked back hair and a dapper suit is pretty much the uniform. What the actual hell was that Egyptian looking lady's problem? She's calling him disgusting and unoriginal for dressing like her husband, but how the hell is he supposed to know what her husband looks like? And it's not like he was dressing in an unusual way that was 100% unique to her husband, that's a pretty basic male style, both the hair and the suit. It's a classic, not something that her husband invented. 
Props to the man for keeping his head up and not giving a fuck, and props to the other judge (Mel, I think?) for supporting him. Dude's got balls for singing on a stage, and ripping him apart for something he did unintentionally is just plain wrong, those people deserved to be fired.  I like how she keeps saying she's embarrassed to be up there having to judge him.

Lucky for her, she wont have to worry about that anymore.  God damn, watching that video I'm glad her ass got fired. How could you be so pretentious and narcissistic to 

1.) think everyone knows and adores your husband and pays attention to his clothes

2.) say you're personally offended and disgusted by him. 

I got happy with the other girl judge defended him.   For context, here is a performance by the male judge who was a dick to the guy.  It was on /r/cringe today: https://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/2z7gzu/willy_moons_horrendous_and_derivative/ Hadn't heard the song before, so I looked it up to see if he wrote it ( he did.)
Here is the wikipedia article on it.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeah_Yeah_%28Willy_Moon_song%29

&gt;"Yeah Yeah" is a song by New Zealand-born musician, singer and producer Willy Moon, who is highly regarded as the only man that has ever worn a suit. The song peaked to number 26 on the UK Singles Chart and 18 in the US on the Billboard Rock Chart.
 It looks like someone from /r/cringe made that ninja edit: https://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/2z48b5/x_factor_nz_natalia_kills_and_willy_moon_bully/cpfqn80 Apparently this video is blocked in my country of New Zealand...

EDIT: I mean the first video of the performance. I have NO fucking clue who those two are, but I'm glad they got fired. They just roasted the guy for no reason.  It wasn't even a roast. Usually a roast is in good humor, this was just a hostile attack on a stylish guy who's enjoying himself. It's despicable and I'm glad the two were fired as well.  I don't know who was more pathetic. The troll wearing the Cleopatra wig, or the "i'm too cool" lame ass husband who thinks he invented a style that has been around for 75 years. They seem like the most miserable people to be around.  To be fair, it was his wife that thinks he invented the style.  He's just obsessed with serial killers.
 Or maybe just The Killers, because Brandon Flowers was wearing her husbands "style" 10 years ago Good, it was unneeded. Everyone things they have to be Simon x 100 Simon was mean, but he didn't just attack people based in their looks (which in this case weren't even odd. I actually thought the guy looked good).  I think Simon was just genuinely a bit of a douche so his nastiness came off as a natural part of his personality and not particularly vicious or personal. He wasn't trying to be mean, he was just a bit of an arrogant dick. Plus being an actual A&amp;R guy, his criticisms were usually founded in a deep understanding of the industry and what "works" when it comes to pop stars. If he said you sounded or looked shit, he was most likely correct (in as much as you can be correct about subjective things).

However when other people try to emulate that persona but really don't have the credentials to back it up, they come across like they're just trying to be as mean for the sake of it which makes you look like a fucking asshole. Add to that most of them are just hack starlets (or complete nobodies) who really have no more awareness of the industry than the contestants they're critiquing, and they really just come across like gigantic shit heads. Yeah there's a big difference between harsh perfectionist honesty that doesn't try to protect feelings, and being stupid mean. And Simon's criticism was usually grounded in the candidates vocal performance rather than what they were wearing...  I can remember a few times when his criticisms were based on appearance, but even then it was usually less "I think you're ugly" and more "Look, I hate to say it, but in this industry image is just as important as musical ability. If you want to succeed, you need to put more effort into your appearance." Which is still pretty dickish, but again, it's more of a "harsh reality" dickishness than an "I'm an asshole" dickishness Especially considering this fifth-rate Lady Gaga tribute act hasn't had the kind of success or knowledge of the industry that Simon had. Simon, for the most part, had criticism of what mattered. He said nothing that actual music critics wouldn't say in their reviews of artists or performances. This chick just went on a tirade.  I worked for a record label many years ago, Simon was working there too and I saw him most days. Was always very nice. You could tell he had an arrogance and sometimes too much honesty, but was very polite and sincere to everyone.  Simon was probably the most legitimate talent scout sitting at the table. Not just a guy who gets to party in clubs and hear bands/artists, but someone who sits and dredges through piles of music sent to him by every kid who thinks they are special. Randy and Paula quit American Idol when they got tired of it; Simon was tired of scouting before season 1. 

People like that aren't mean, they are efficient. They are brutal and honest, with no compassion or empathy filters, because it's the fastest way to weed out the untalented. He was actually a talent scout. That was his job before Idol. It's a specific skill and being good at other aspects of the music industry doesn't make you a good talent scout.

I mean whether you like Paula Abdul or Randy Jackson or Jennifer Lopez or whoever the fuck else they have on those shows now, being a good singer or producer doesn't mean you're able to spot talent or understand what sells, or what can be made to sell. Yeah, he looked pretty damn good and that's coming from a guy. Even if she did feel that way there's no reason to drag it out in ridicule like she did. Good thing she got cut That's the thing. Simon was mean but he wasn't stupid and he was usually right. This woman is just being a bitch to be a bitch on illogical and absurd reasoning. Yeah that guy looked so awful that she was reminded of her *husband* Watch the context. She wasn't saying he looked awful. She thought him copying her husband's look was awful and disgusting because it makes him unoriginal. 

Like wtf, its a suit and slicked back hair. Everyone does that shit.  The whole thing felt so damn ridiculous.  I thought it was (semi) staged, like "listen up kid, we're gonna slam you with silly shit to add some crowd pleasing controversy to the show... Nothing personal, alright?" [Guess they didn't get the "nothing personal" memo] Listen up judges.  We're going to have you two insult this poor nervous guy on stage, bring him to the edge of tears, have the entire audience boo at you for the entire time, and have the other judges mock you.  One of them will publically call you a twat on twitter a day later and most people will agree.  We're also going to fire you.

Good luck with your life in show business.

Who would agree to that? They should have used a  Ricky Bobby "With all due respect" then you can say whatever you want. this kills Natalia Know what drives me so nuts about this? She's sitting there attacking someone for what she perceives to be a blatant rip-off of her husband.....

.....when the video for her husband's biggest hit 'YEAH YEAH' is a **BLATANT RIPOFF** of a video that has made the rounds on reddit quite a bit; 'Prisencolinensinainciusol'

[HIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaWXA5e0YTQ)

[vs THE ORIGINAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcUi6UEQh00&amp;t=122)

God the frustrating irony.

**EDIT**

Holy shit....for what it's worth, I just listened to his other hit ['Railroad Track'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF479nQ-s8E)....how is that not a blatant ripoff of the hook in Kanye's ['Jesus Walks'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g)!?!?? It's identical.

Has this guy ever done anything original in his life?!

**EDIT EDIT** Just wanted to point out that I'm aware Kanye 'sampled' from an existing track on a gospel album there, and that someone sampling a sample isn't a new thing. But at least Kanye was sampling something obscure. This Willy douche is taking a US #11 top hit from 10 years ago, which is still totally relevant, and riding it's coattails. It's just poor form. why isn't this higher up. the fuck. The original is...so so much better.

wtf F

...oh wait. nvm. No respects for her. Ctrl Z I'm sorry who the fuck are these people and what makes them think they can talk to others like that? A couple of random wannabe's.  Now a couple of random has-been's. She seems like she was trying to be controversial and "edgy", but just comes across as a stupid try hard bitch. I wish there was less publicity about them because I feel like they're feeding off it.  I don't get it. Why would anyone want to look like her husband in the first place? He looks like butthead and even the name sounds like he belongs to a family of backwood, toothless, rednecks...Willy Moon, cracks me up. As someone pointed out in the other thread, his name literally means *dick butt.* [Ed Sheeran has shown support for the guy that auditioned.](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/ed-sheeran-tweets-positive-advice-to-joe-irvine-after-x-factor-new-zealand-contestant-bullied-live-on-air-by-natalia-kills-10111535.html) Good guy ed.

https://youtu.be/vO0J6seoXBE?t=19s Are these judges famous people? 

 Here is a video of the male judge performing.  It was on /r/cringe earlier today: https://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/2z7gzu/willy_moons_horrendous_and_derivative/ &gt; Are these judges people?

FTFY The female judge (Mel) that stuck up for the guy was in [All Saints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints_%28group%29). So she was famous in the UK during the '90s... I know this was a joke but I'd say Natalia Kills and Dick Butt were brought on the show because of having *some* international success (Willy with a itunes commercial using his song, Natalia getting some recognition in the UK) - they're New Zealand born, but hardly any New Zealanders had heard of them.

Stan Walker, I'm not sure if may people outside of NZ or Australia would have heard of, but he's a kiwi that won Australian Idol quite a while ago - really good performer in the sort of [niche New Zealand market] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYEqq8bBP0I), absolute sweetheart. 

Melanie Blatt is from [All Saints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPXqkjpXZ_k), if you're looking for a blast from the past.  Best part is when the host comes back out, and he is dressed exactly like the contestant. Absolute fucking twat and moron, you can even see her husband become uncomfortable and thinking ''Goddamit you're pushing it too far you sound like a fucking moron'' Considering the husband judge said that the contestant looked like he was going to steal someone's face and murder the audience... nah, he probably wasn't upset by his wife's equally stupid choice of words. I don't really get why you'd have a husband and wife on your judging panel anyway.  They're not likely to vote against each other.

&gt;* Perfectionist (2011) [Highest charting in Canada (36) &amp; US (Dance Albums, 6)]
* Trouble (2013) [Highest charting in US (70)]

&gt;Singles (Primary &amp; Featured) - 

&gt;* Don't Play Nice [Highest charting in UK (11); Did not chart in NZ]
* Mirrors [Highest charting in Austria (7); Did not chart in NZ]
* Free [Highest charting in Austria (4); Did not chart in NZ]
* Champagne Showers [Highest charting in Austria (9); Did not chart in NZ]
* Saturday Night [Only charted in NZ (23)]

In summary, her music has virtually no commercial relevance in New Zealand. The territory where she has been most successful (Austria) is largely irrelevant when compared to other territories in terms of music purchased/listened to (e.g., USA, UK, Australia, Canada).

She may have been "embarrassed" to be viewing the contestant in the video, but *he* should be embarrassed about being harshly critiqued by someone who is not at all relevant to the industry he's trying to break into. Well, not so much anymore considering that most who have heard about the bullying are rallying behind him.

Natalia got what she deserved. Frankly, she deserved it much earlier than this incident. &gt; It opened with sales of 6,000 copies, almost half of Perfectionist 's total sold copies, and left the chart the following week.

I've seen local Boston bands sell more copies burning the cds and printing the artwork themselves.  Just how deep IS the Xfactor judge pool, because I'm thinking I have a shot.

Jesus, It's like the Beer Vendors at Baseball Stadiums giving criticism to the people at tryout.

 Its kind of amusing to see how the fickle crowd has turned on her. She will no longer have any fans. Those who were unaware of her true nature have abandoned her. The few who may not really care will abandon her as well out of fear of being labeled as her supporters. Without her fans she is nothing. She is not famous or rich enough to remain relevant after such a blow, so after this she will fade into obscurity. It is very interesting to see how much power a crowd can have over one person's fate in society. We hope. I thought she fail at irony/sarcasm, but she keep going, and going and going. What the heck was that?  This is such a shame. As someone who really fucking liked both her debut album and newest album, it really sucks to find out she is a huge really mean and horrible cunt.  And even looking at her twitter her response is just as infuriating. 

Such a sad sad shame that someone that cunty could make music that I really enjoy  Who the hell is she? Just deleted Willy Moon's album from my library. Feels good, man. I wonder if she said the same thing to the host back stage? Who the hell are these two people? What an over-the-top diatribe. He's wearing a basic suit-and-tie, not even particularly similar to her husband's suit. He's also better-looking than her husband. And wasn't this supposed to be a singing competition? Based off how he takes getting completely demoralized, I can tell this is not the first time this man has been stepped on in his life. It's sad to think that kind people like this are berated by people whose lives hold no integrity. You've gotta have one hell of an ego to think you can monopolize the look af a suit and clean cut hair. A look that's been around since the fucking 1850s. In the beginning there were talent show judges. Some were a tiny bit abrasive, some were nice

The abrasive ones got more attention and fame

Other judges observed that being insulting and obnoxious was the key to fame

Little by little, the level of meanness has been ramping up

Eventually, the public will grow tired of mean judges, and the shows will die

..life is a sine wave..nothing continues in one direction forever

 The voice doesn't have any mean judges. They are all really big stars that are super humble. I love music shows where the judges have the experience and can help construct the careers of the contestants. The was the brilliant marketing with the Voice. Well that and weird roaring chairs. By giving the judges a personal stake in the singers they pick success they came off more supporting than just trying to find a way to swipe at poor less talented people on national TV.  [Link](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/31902517) to reputable news outlet for those who care.  I honestly hope this story doesn't blow up, these two individuals don't deserve even a shred of fame from this. Was the Rat Pack copying him when he wasn't even fucking alive? Meanwhile, she looks like a dollar store Lady GaGa.  Anyone who looks like a budget Hannah Snowdon while sounding like she stole Lady Gaga's musical offcuts has no right to be bitching about originality. I was running the VIP bar at a festival in 2013 and everyone was awesome Seasick Steve was super friendly with all the staff and sat outside playing guitar with everyone, Coco and the Butterfields were just about the nicest people I've ever met and would pick us up tobacco and booze when they drove into the city, and so many more lovely down to earth artists. AND THEN there was Willy Moon who spent the entire time turning his nose up at everyone, standing outside his private tent staring and pouting and basically separated himself from all the fun that everyone else was having just so that he could create some faux mysterious allure that no one gave a shit about but him. 
One of the female artists was nice enough to leave me her guitar to play during the day, invite me to jam with everyone and have a drink with me once all acts where finished. 
TL/DR: Worked at festival, all other artists where kind and awesome, but he was a poser cunt  And how is that cunt original? Her Facebook likes are going down.
Link : http://i.imgur.com/ZTnz940.jpg?1 Natalia is kill That's the number of new likes, not the total number of likes. She got a huge spike of new likes on the 15th, when this happened. See how it says up ~700%? GOOD. She's a cunt. The graph shows the number of new likes, not total likes. She got a huge spike of new likes. [Archived link](https://archive.today/2KSPK) for those who do not want to support Gawker. I never cared for Gawker. Then I saw [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-avakrRUaU) and I decided I would never visit the site. Dunno if she even works there anymore, but if that's the type of flippant, conceited people that work for that website... I don't want to ever visit it. 

Especially the portion from 1:15-1:38

Anyways, seeing where the link was from, I didn't click. Thanks for the archived link. 

 I love how Gawker has a shifting definition of private/public and celebrities have piles of money...

I am sure Gawker really supported The fappening... oh wait they didn't... maybe they draw the line at nudity.

I suppose then that would expend to Hogans leaked sex tape.

http://i.imgur.com/CQ5qgvu.jpg

Oh it doesn't... now that strange. It's almost as if they Taylor their own views around advertising. I just watched that interview for the first time. Wow... Her behaviour was childish, inappropriate and her "arguments" were contradictory and incoherent. How can she be an editor? I didn't get the impression she has good grammar. 

 I heard about this story second hand at work today and I thought the dude was going to be deformed or fat or mutilated or something, but he's literally just a generic looking white guy in a suit this is the dumbest shit in the world. What the hell? Am I missing something here? The guy is wearing a suit and tie like many of the other male contestants I'm sure. What else was he supposed to wear? So his hair might be similar but the woman looks like she could be Dora the Explorer's mom so what's her problem? 

Kudos to the blonde judge though. That contestant looked like he was about to cry. No one deserves that. Melanie Blatt. *Actually.* That dude took it pretty well though. There's no way I could maintain composure in the face of two people as openly insane as those two.  Did anybody else see that she tagged a picture of Uma Thurman as herself on [Instagram?](https://instagram.com/p/0P_PKVQjQO/?taken-by=nataliakills) I don't even understand - he's wearing a suit and slicked back hair, the most widely-worn formal men's look for 70 years... Is the couple aware that Frank Sinatra was not, in fact, copying Moon? In case anybody wants to know the contestants name is Joe Irvin      Lets turn some attention to how he handled her insults .

Edit. Changed name  Joe* You're right I'm sorry guys  It's okay man, everyone makes mistakes sometimes. Don't worry about it. ...you mean Joe Irvine? Seriously, what a guy. I would have wanted to spit in her mouth. for a second i thought you were flirting with 'too soon' line, but to your serious point i agree. and he took it like a boss too... How could someone be so rude and so hateful... Glad they lost their jobs wont even let the man wear a suit. How self centered are those two? I love how the host comes out, hair slicked back, and a suit. Looks exactly like her husband and Joe. They must be both copying her husband.  TV Talent shows are heinous. A modern day freak show, which then become a show about crushing people's dreams.

Why do people watch it? It's a weird circle where people watch it because it's on TV, and it's on TV because people watch it. People who will never achieve fame and fortune feel better about it when they can view firsthand the knowledge that there are other people who also won't achieve fame and fortune, plus getting to watch people get publicly humiliated.  I think it is hilarious as fuck that so many people in the entertainment industry today think that they are artists. They work in the performing arts, but they don't write their own songs, they don't create their own dance moves for the stage, fuck you lip sync on stage, you are a goddamn marionette. I'm not going to take away from the fact that people like what they do so I guess they are good at being puppets for the industry, but how about we not mix them up with people who are actual artists.  And if you call those artists out on that, then people berate you because 'that's your opinion that they arent true artists'. Maybe we just need to change the definition of artists to people who do more than 5% of the work that goes in to the 'work of art'. Of course, with that definition then those who put up shit stained underwear are still artists(true thing, look it up). Well, it is their shit. Glad she's gone from X Factor. How many people watch that? Everyone I know watches The Voice. This is the NZ version. Melanie Blatt (one of the other judges) tweeted: "Ive tried to keep my cool and stay professional but really @nataliakills ? Sorry love , you're a twat"

Its likely that they're horrid people off the show too. I hope it means both their "careers" are over. People that think it's OK to act like that deserve a swift kick in the crotch. I'm imagining those two morons in their home, trying to muster what limited communicative resources they have to try and justify to each other what they said to that poor man. It makes me sad This is so terrible. It's funny because she has absolutely no talent and not myself nor anyone I know even knows who her husband is so obviously he's not so famous as to have his name on that look - the look that like a couple other commenters have mentioned is the put together look of almost any grown man. 

She needs to get over herself and stop being in the public eye because she is a shameful component of modern day society. She shouldn't even BE a component of society. I'm glad that the other judge at least stood up for the contestant. Natalia kills.. What a stupid bitch. It is hilarious that they are so narcissistic that they think someone wearing a suit with slicked hair is copying them - someone NO ONE has ever heard of..... I had to google him and his songs...and he is *terrible*. *Really terrible*.  Why does anyone care what this self absorbed princess thinks about anything? I don't understand why such atrocious people are held on pedestals. It would appear that they aren't.  I think we're all making fun of them. We may all be making fun of them with the understanding that they are incredibly terrible people. But the the majority must think something of them, why else would they be on television? Apparently, they aren't anymore. I think she is a little brain damaged. But how can she slap? And she's a gaga wannabe Gaga is a Die Antwoord wannabe. It's the circle of entertainment. 

(edit: added "a")  die antwoord is so fucking cool. i love watching them and i don't even love all of their songs. keep it weird, i only ask that there be a point/message. See you at Coachella 

 Yaaay! Want to collaborate on something? I'll be playing in New York on the 24th of April, are you gonna be around ? I'll definitely try to be there. God damn MKBHD so smooth. Hey look its that YouTube video maker Marque Brownlee!!! Shhhh you'll scare him off ITS HAPPENING Can I make the Artwork? Please please please I didn't know you produce EDM MKB.  You continue to impress us. Drones with mau5, maybe some other niche(soon to be mainstream) tech? 
 Hey Hugo, been a big fan since your remix of The Island by Pendulum. 
Was wondering, it's been a while since you released Pop Culture, have you ever thought of doing a Pop Culture 2 with new songs you are into? Thanks for doing the AMA, love the new stuff you've been putting out and can't wait for the album. Actually one of the first things I decided after Pop Culture took off was to NOT do Pop Culture 2.
I was really worried about the video defining my carreer and being stuck in some sort of YouTube gimmick, so I decided to move on.

I still love it and play it live, and i'm amazed by how much it connected with people though, but I really wanted to focus on my own original music.
It's been a few years now though, so maybe someday. So much more respect after this response. Reminds me a lot of Baauer's response to Harlem Shake blowing up.  I can respect that, but I'm sure your fans would love a pop culture 2 once you feel established as more than a YouTube gimmick. Squirtle, Charmander, or Bulbasaur? Salamche  For those who don't know it's Charmander in french.
 Bless you. I used your music as an ice breaker to meet my current girlfriend, thanks bro!  Coool ! What's the story ? Her music was bleeding through her headphones while she was studying and I recognized it as edm. I got her attention and dropped technicolor on her, she loved it. That got us talking and I asked her to lunch.  That was a little under a year ago and we've been together ever since!  Smooth bro "yo is that EDM?" yo let me listen to them dank beetz Yo, lemme slap some shit you might like real quick gurl Some comments are funny "Do you know anything about techno?" Neat. Hey Hugo! I don't have a question, But I just wanted the chance to say so many thank you's for the phenomenal album as well as everything you've worked on/released and so on, been a fan for 4+ or so years already and I can't wait to see what you've got coming in the many years ahead! &lt;3 thankyouthankyouthankyou &lt;3 Big fan of you Madeon! New album is amazing and haven't felt this way about an album since Worlds last year.
Speaking of Worlds, I have seen on Twitter and through photos that you and Porter are fans of each other. Any chance we could see a collaboration in the near future of you two? I imagine many fans such as myself would flip out :D. Anyways, thanks for your time and enjoy reddit! Porter and I have been talking more often recently, about music in general. Would love to do something someday. HHHNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGG Hype?

Edit: I think it derailed, guys. :c HYPE. [All aboard!!!!](http://i.imgur.com/AIA5s6G.jpg) Dude. Please make it happen. You two are my among my top electronic musicians and I would be super excited for a collab between you both. they've already collab'ed before.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkKMBjxyPk8

yes this is them.  porter = ekowraith (eko) and madeon = deamon (under his wayne mont alias, which was a pisstake on dj tht and other template producers).  this was made in 2010 afaik. But just imagine the combo of their styles now... post Worlds Porter and post Adventure Madeon. That's the stuff of dreams, man. I'm on public transportation right now and that is the only reason I didn't burst into pterodactyl screeches upon reading that Hugo Robinson?!
Porter Leclercq?!
Hypehypehype  they already did collab, but it was back in their happy hardcore/hands up days...would love to see a more recent collab combining some of their more recent sounds!

the old collab:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkKMBjxyPk8 [deleted] Lol you're on the wrong account. Now your answers won't be highlighted.

Fyi everyone, this is his legit account that he has done AMA's on in /r/edmproduction Who would you like to collaborate with? I think Madeon/Phantogram would be legit. That song may already exist. IS THIS THE REAL LIFE OR IS THIS FANTASY OHHHH SHIT!!!! wanna hear! HWAT Nice! Thanks for the reply.  *What.* Alright Hugo, explain [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/yPJTTs0.jpg) [deleted] [And this one](http://www.bastwood.com/projects/aphex_face/venetian_snares_look.png) I assume that's where Madeon got the idea. Neat. http://youtu.be/Hm3JodBR-vs  *That's pretty neat.* You can tell it's neat because of the way it is. Of all places, this is the last one I'd expect to find a neature walk reference Wow, what song is that? Innocence I think The first half is at the end of Innocence, the second half is at the beginning of Pixel Empire. ignoring the question?? Illuminati confirmed From Innocence to Pixel Empire. I'm curious, how did you made that? What program is this? Looks like Adobe Audition. For those wondering what the symbol is, it is the [cover of the album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_%28Madeon_album%29) the songs are on. either just a soudscape signature or some kind of a marker to skip through songs on a trackless album? I wanna say Adventure is absolutely incredible

1.) Which songs are you singing on on Adventure?

2.) Who's doing the vocals on 'OK'?

3.) Can you reveal anything about what your live show's going to be like?!

Thanks! 1) Beings, Zephyr, Home

2) Charli XCX is the female vocal chops and Ed Drewett does the main "OK" line

3) Yes ! I'm really looking forward to that, it's what I've been working on lately. It's all Madeon music, with brand new live versions of many songs (old and new). I tried to completely remove my mind from the "live" perspective when making the album, so when I started working on the show I wanted to bring back some of that visceral, harder, collective energy that wasn't explored a lot on the album, while still staying true to it. I'm working on a lot of ways to interact with the music in ways that I find meaningful (changing the chord progression of a song on the fly for example), improvisation is my favorite part of shows. Hell yeah, I'm coming to see you in Philly I think. Really looking forward to it  Hey, Hugo,

If you ever want some free male vocals to chop up, meowing, or something: http://soundcloud.com/saneyarn

Considering you literally have a plethora of options at your fingertips, this feels pointless, but I think you're pretty stellar.

Hi5!

Sean You sound fantastic Thanks, man. :) And thus a [career](https://www.soundcloud.com/masterisk) was launched Please use this guy. +1 damn fine. I would definitely listen to a track with you and Madeon, brother.  I think you have that distinctive electronica voice. This turned into an awesome boost in confidence. Thank you! Chase this with everything you've got, dude. He likes it. Make sure this happens! You play live? You sound amazing, remind me very much of Kenna which is a huge compliment. I'd love to see a show sometime!! I wish I played live more.
Ever since I moved to Austin my only gig has been the occasional invite to an EDM show. Love it, though! Holy shit, are you Apollo's Child?? Dude I loved your music back then! I think I still follow you on Twitter. I remember getting really hooked to Masquerade of Aspersions when I was in my late high school years. Thanks for keeping it up! Yup! Back when I was 16. Oh, MySpace. Haha... well, good to see you again! Damn dude that's awesome  Madeon, i've loved every song you realeased since i stumbled across your Soundcloud when it only had a few songs on it (Shuriken, For You, and the Alphabeat remix).  It quickly became my favorite music and i was fortunate to see you with Porter Robinson in NYC a few years ago.  Anyway...


What was the most difficult part of being so young when success started to happen for you?  Was it hard to manage a schedule with touring and being a kid?  Any interesting things about that time of your life? I started touring properly when I was 17 and by that point I had left school completely, so it was a smooth transition.

I made sure to come back home as frequently as possible and to see my friends. I'm lucky to have friends I've known forever that do not really care that much about the Madeon side of things. I really enjoy having that distance when i'm home. [Nathan Barnatt's dance to your Pop Culture Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxPbgnO81sQ) is the best thing on youtube, and is how I found your music.  Are you friends with him? Any plans to collab in the future? This is like the Half-Life 3 of music I wish he would answer this! I've watched that video like 500 times. I know it's linked on Madeons channel, so I know he has at least seen it and liked it enough to link it on his channel. I would also agree it's the best thing on YouTube. As an aside, it appears Avicii stole Nathan's concept, and used it for the levels video. Nathans video came out like three months before the Levels video.  A tad late to the party.  [Here](http://youtu.be/B496Qv0CuOQ) is a version that uses clips from the music videos the sound clips are from. Challenge: write a coherent sentence using as many titles off your album as possible. Go! Hmm, OK, you know that feeling when you're on your own in your garden back home having a nap, and your little brother comes up and starts talking nonsense, you pay no mind, because he's still young and full of innocence, you just let the gentle zephyr breeze serenade you as you stare up, it's still daytime yet la lune is already visible in the sky, how wonderful is it that human beings managed to walk its ground, your brother removes you from your thoughts and insists he wants to play some old school game with isometric graphics called Pixel Empire like you promised, this is your only way out now so you emerge from your slumber and follow him into the house to play. You know what? You're my favorite person ever. That is all. &gt; graphics called Pixel Empire like

You could call the game 'Pixel Empire Imperium' to add another one! 
 [Did you know that your music is popular among minecraft PvPers? ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAzsolKHJfc)

 Haaaa I heard there's a whole inside joke about Finale in the Minecraft community but never quite understood what's going on.
Can somebody explain please ?! 
Madeon Finale has been popular in civcraft ever since it was used in a very-highly publicised video of a battle between some prominent players on the server.  

Here's the original video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAzsolKHJfc 

A little over 2 years ago, The /r/civcraft server (a community focussed on politics and city-building) was invaded by players from /r/hcfactions (a community focussed on hardcore, high-skill combat and player vs player (PvP) battles). This was a very prominent event in the history of the civcraft server because the invading players from HCFactions basically conquered the whole civcraft server and imprisoned almost the entire population. They left after a while - mainly out of boredom, because they only play for the thrill of PvP action and there was no one left to fight - but civcraft would never be the same again.

In that video two players from the HCFactions - ApacheBlitz and RussianRoulette -  defeat some of the top players of the civcraft community - Exultant (who was a moderator on the civcraft server and subreddit), Xtraneous, and servererror404 - in a 2v3 battle.

A lot of people saw the video, and it was generally considered a very entertaining/exciting fight. Everyone loved the music used and it became iconic of that famous fight. 

To this day people often quote bits from that song and use it in videos of their own. A load of parodies were made as well


Here's the original reddit thread about the battle: https://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/158ky7/video_of_last_nights_battle/

Here's a sort of 1year anniversary thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1te18c/its_a_world_world_world_1_year_anniversary/

Aaaand a 2 year anniversary thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/2q1761/2_years_ago_today_this_video_was_uploaded_and/


# 
The title of the original video is "Slaying Ancaps with RussianRoulette" (note: "Ancaps" is short for "Anarcho-Capitalists."
The Ancaps were the dominant sort of "faction" on the server when HCFactions invaded, and were highly associated with one of the main resistance groups called the "World Police")

As you can see here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/search?q=Slaying+with&amp;restrict_sr=on

there were plenty of spin-offs based on the video for a long time after. I'm not sure, but what I do know is that /r/civcraft  the server I play on was invaded by PvPers from another server.  People then made a bunch of videos of the battles with Finale as the soundtrack.

I don't know if that is the origin of the the Finale inside joke, but that is the first time I became aware of it.

Anyway, you might get a better answer if you ask /r/civcraft about it, I'm sure they would be happy to answer and might be better informed that I am. Hi Hugo! I made a reddit just for this, I'm so excited that you're here :) 

* What is your favorite city/country in Europe to visit and/or play in?
* What's your favorite thing about Nantes, and your least favorite thing? Did the intimate, small town setting have a significant effect on what inspired you growing up, or were your influences largely found in the outside world through the Internet? 
* Do you have a recommendation for a single author or book to start with if one were just getting into magic for the first time? It fascinates me, but finding a starting point out of all the available material is daunting. 
* Do you think we'll see Icarus and Asteria again once their trilogy concludes, or will they be contained within Adventure so you can move on to a new world for your second album? As you can tell, I'm a little attached to them. :)
* Which would you rather live without forever: red bull, or baguettes?
* How many instruments can you play? Would you ever write/perform in any other genre outside of EDM, for fun or in a professional capacity?
* If you could perform any one Beatles song with all four original members (either in a hologram situation or upon the invention of a time machine), what song would you choose? 
* If you could do a whole album of just covers of one band in tribute, which band would you choose to cover (other than the Beatles)?

Have a lovely AMA!! 2) It's not really a small town, a few hundred thousand people live here ! But i'm definitely from a generation that is culturally more defined by the internet than the geographical environement.

3) "The Expert at the Card Table" is a classic from the early 20th Century that is still relevant.

6) I can play piano/keyboard and a little bit of guitar. I wish I could play guitar properly though.

7) Can I cheat and say the Abbey Road medley counts as one song ? Just want to make the moment last as long as possible.

8) Maybe ELO The fact that you just said ELO blew my mind and made me love you that much more. Holy shit yes. hey bro, were you one of the smart kids at school and do you need to be super smart to be able to create god-tier music? I completely failed school. I didn't even graduate middle school. No, school failed you Madeon. Hi, I am zeroxephon, a slightly over weight American.  I like your music, please make more.  I'm gonna assume that's your actual surname cause it sounds really cool. What is your favourite VST and why is it Sausage Fattener? I do use it from time to time ! how fat do you usually make your beats? 100% fatness sick Madeon are you ever gonna collab with Porter? Cuz that song would break the internet Holy shit wait this album is so good thank youuuu! Hey Madeon, been a big fan for a very long time :)

1. ~~What was it like going from a normal guy messing around on a Launchpad to an electronic legend, and what was your inspiration if any?~~

2. Who's your best friend in the business?

3. Apart from electronic music what else have you created/liked to listen to?

Thanks, always a pleasure to hear your music. ^ ^ 2) Porter, Anton, Dillon Francis come to mind. I've met so many cool people by making music.
3) I'm a huge Beatles fan, I probably listen to the Beatles more than I listen to electronic music in general. just out of curiosity, did you ever consider remixing older songs?     Tell me whose side you're on Lucy, 
    Tell me whose side you're on Lucy,
    Lucy in the sky with diamonds!
    You're on, you're on. Salut Hugo!

Pour mettre fin au longue speculation. 

Etais tu Daemon sur JVC ou pas? MADEON REPONDS STP *Translation*:

Hi Hugo.

To put an end to the speculation.

Were you Daemon on JVC or not? Assuming that everyone in the world knows what JVC is otherwise I think this translation might not be that useful.
JVC is the acronym for jeuxvideo.com a well-known french video game website on wich you can find the biggest french message board. C'est quoi JVC ? Jeuxvideo.com

Apparement on a trac ses debuts sur le forum. Il avait poster un remix, le fameux remix Meuporg

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwiCLnlJeco Oh wow j'espre qu'il va rpondre haha! C'est le fun de savoir le VRAI dbut d'un artiste comme Madeon.. Et j'avais aussi entendu dire qu'il avait un nickname Daemon...  Je suis venu seulement pour connatre la rponse  cette question ! Son pseudal c'tait Da_Daemon et c'tait il y a 3-4 ans je crois. Some of your music has been a big part of my life. Thank you. thank you Hi Madeon, I've been a fan of yours since your Pop Culture mashup and I've been in love with your tracks ever since. Thank you so much for doing another AMA!

1) What was the hardest obstacle that you came across when producing your tracks for Adventure? 

2) Do you have any advice for someone who's working on becoming a music producer like you?

P.S. - Will you be having any remix/mashup competitions in the future? I've been making a mashup of your album for fun, and again, all of your songs that I've heard are incredible. Again, thanks for the AMA and the music! [You might enjoy this](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/186kli/im_madeon_lets_talk_production/) Since you're currently under under 21, what happens you do gigs in the states? Do you drink/Are drinks provided for you? I don't drink and I can't stick around in the venue after the show. I saw you play in Philly this past Halloween. In the moment of awesomeness that was you playing You're On, my girlfriend turned and told me she loved me for the first time. I reciprocated. We're still together and madly in love. Thank you for such a wonderful memory Madeon!

Also, favorite music blog of yours? HypeM? Dancing Astronaut?  Awesome, thanks for sharing. I just wanna say that, like a ton of people here, you are a huge inspiration to me!! I remember finding "For You" and being hooked ever since. In the very beginning, you gave away free downloads of your music, but enough people know your talent now to buy from you. Would you recommend taking the route of giving it away for free in the beginning, or do you wish you had done it differently?

Also thank you for touring in North America, pleeeease come back soon again!! It is such a crowded music scene that being heard is definitely more valuable than selling a couple of mp3s in the early stages. Are you considering doing any halftime/downtempo tracks that lean toward the quickly rising world of future bass? If you did a collab with Wave Racer it might just be the coolest thing to ever hit EDM. Call it compl-trap-tro Most songs on Adventure are between 70 and 100 bpm.
Check out the second half of "Pixel Empire", it has a 50bpm section you may like. Bonjour Hugo, you're my inspiration.


1- Which VST do you use for the vocal effects? 


2- What inspired you to make this album?


3- Do you use Slicex for vocal chopping?


4- The vocals on Beings and Zephyr are yours?


Thanks for all, this is the best album I've heard ever. 1) iZotope Nectar, Guitar Rig are the biggest ones
2) I feel like albums are really good at capturing eras. I wanted to make it to have a record of who I was at that age and start a chronology of my musical (and personal) evolution.
3) No I do chops in the playlist
4) Yes
Thank you very much. Madeon, Why is your show in seattle 21+ despite you not being 21? 

Sincerely, 

A heartbroken 18 year old I'm sorry and have made a point of making as many all ages or 18+ shows as possible. I'm not in control of that unfortunately, it's down to the venue. Hey madeon! long time fan, got some production q's:

* 1 - You mentioned in a previous interview regarding the "madeon wall of sound" that you start to look for increasingly small spaces between sounds.  Does that mean you have a lot of elements bandpassed heavily to fit within small frequency ranges or do you looked for/make sounds that have low harmonic content to begin with (ie sounds that are mostly just the fundamental frequency)?

* 2 - with projects as complex as yours tend to get, how do you stay organized given how open ended FL's playlist is? and more importantly, how do you manage your cpu usage?

* 3 - Is most of your sidechaining all manual volume automation or do you still use some degree of plugin sidechaining?

* 4 - When you say you use a lot of ghost notes where a sound is being routed to a number different tracks, each processed differently, what kind of processing do you do exactly? Is it something like split band processing where you separately process the highs, mids, and lows?

much love and many thanks! I hate that I can never think of any questions when AMAs come up.  

I just wanted to tell you that you have been one of my main sources of inspiration for music ever since I started producing. Thank you so much and I love you! Thank you! Hey Madeon, first off I just want to say that Adventure is pure beauty at it's finest. I was never really a huge fan of you (even though I did enjoy your music when I did hear it) until I heard Imperium and after that I was completely hooked and I haven't stopped constantly listening to you since. My question really isn't a question, but more of asking you to elaborate on something, when you were in the mind state of giving up, how did you get out of it? Also do you have any tips to young, aspiring producers like you were once to help get out of the "giving up, and everything I'm doing is useless" phase?

Also insert (which will probably be the most repeated thing in this AMA) statement about how you should collab with Porter here. You learn to accept the ups and down of the creative process I guess. I just realized stopping making music was not an option for me, it's completely necessary to my life and identity. Hey Hugo!

Loving the album, I've been a fan since Pop Culture and it's amazing to see how far your sound has come since those days.

I'm seeing you live in London soon - anything you can tell us about the live show? Are you keeping the Launchpads? Are you singing live?

Did you see the rumours about a joint live show between you and Porter recently? Would you ever consider doing something like that? Can you make it happen? ;) Hey Madeon, big fan of your music, really like the album.1. What software/instruments do you use to make your music ? Just curious, I've found that lots of artists that I like use ableton/FL studio.2. When did you first start making music, and what inspired you to do it ?3. What advice would you give to anyone trying to start music-making or learning ?Thanks for the AMA, and I really enjoy your music. 1) FL Studio

2) I started making music in march 2005, almost exactly ten years ago. I watched a documentary about Daft Punk as they were releasing Human After All and was fascinated by the unique sounds and the visual world they were creating.
I went on my parent's computer and downloaded some audio freeware. I had no idea how to make synth noises so I just recorded my voice and applied as many effects as possible.

3) Patience ! It takes time for your creation skills to catch up to the standard you're able to observe in other songs. It's effortful but it's important to keep it fun along the way. &gt;I just recorded my voice and applied as many effects as possible.Holy crap you just gave me the most creative of ideas.Thank you for answering! I've been screwing around in FL studio (demo) and have been getting better every day. Your music is great, hopefully you will make more in the future! Madeon. I have one favor to ask of you. PLEASE come to Paradiso.  Hey Madeon, what do you consider your best song?, other redditors can answer too Right now Pay No Mind How did you manage to make that song with Mark Foster? And how was it working with him? I adore Foster the People and have listened to your song with him ten times already It was awesome ! We were signed by the same A&amp;R in the US (hey Isaac !) so I had met him a couple of times before.
We spent a few days in LA, in this very small, very cozy studio working on music. I decided not to prepare anything and to just start from scratch with him.
We ended up celebrating my birthday in the studio. French singer Soko was there and we started recording a punk song with the instruments laying around in the studio. Nathan Barnett actually introduce me to your music (specifically the Que Veux Tu Remix video he did) and each song just blew my mind.  Anyway I was wondering if you have any intentions working with him directly? Thanks for letting me take a photo with you last year at Surrender!

Are you going to be a resident in Las Vegas again after the tour? I didn't commit to anything yet this year.
Living in France, having to fly all the way to the west coast and back so many times a year was getting exhausting, but I enjoyed the shows so i'm not ruling it out. I saw you live in Las Vegas a few months ago, at Surrender in the Encore. Loved your performance, how do you prepare for shows like that? The club wasn't so big, and I think it felt a bit more 'intimate' than huge concert halls. Las Vegas tends to have more of a tourist crowd, I try to make sure I play some iconic sing along songs that I love to keep everyone engaged.
I improvise as much as possible in Vegas though because I play there so often I want each show to be unique. Hey Hugo, I love your work. Loving Imperium off of the new album. I am 16 years old and want to start making electronic music. I fool around with FL studio sometimes, but I have no musical experience at all. Could you offer me some tips on how to start? I do DJ sometimes too. Keep on playing with FL Studio ! Look at the tracks in the "Cool Stuff" folder and study them to understand how to make a song with FL Studio. Hey Hugo!! I've been IN LOVE with your music for years now and I'm going to your New York show in April so I'm excited!!! I hope you decide to come to New York more often :) 

How was it being a part of the EDM world at such a young age when it's so associated with drugs and drinking?

I can't wait to see you!   I really haven't seen much drug or excessive drinking in my years touring. I'm sure it exists but the people I've interacted with over the years have been clean and serious, the crowd definitely goes wilder than the artists. So, why Madeon? What made you pick that as a name? A few reasons but I knew I wanted a made up word because that way I control its meaning.
I get to define and redefine what "Madeon" evokes which is cool. 
Hi Madeon. Im really enjoying the album.

1. Listening to the album I feel I can hear can hear inspiration from FEZ's soundtrack particularly in the intro. Did this inspire you and what were your other main inspirations for the album?
2. I know you are a fan of CAPSULE what did you think of CAPSULE's latest album Wave Runner and do you listen to any other Nakata produced music like Perfume for example. Also what are your favourite Nakata produced songs? 
3.  Apart from Sonic Adventure 2 what are your favourite games? Thank you !

1) I love FEZ, in fact I licensed a small sample from the FEZ OST in the track Pixel Empire.

2) I love Nakata, in fact, if all goes well there should be a Nakata remix of one of my songs very soon.
More! More! More! is my favorite Nakata-produced album. Dream Fighter may be my favorite song though. Oh and Fashion Monster !

3) Zelda Wind Waker, OOT, Mario Sunshine, Phoenix Wright On a related note: have you ever remixed a track from one of those games, or would you be willing to?

I'd love to see a 'Song of Storms' remix from you. do you listen to Muse? Yes ! Been a fan since I was a kid.
I met Matthew a couple of years ago actually, I produced an alternate version of "Panic Station" for them.

Psycho is dope. Hey Madeon, love your music! Hoping to see a show of yours sometime soon

-Do you master your own music? If so, what is all on your master channel?

-What are your favorite vst plugins?

-Were you nervous about singing on your own songs! 1) Yes. iZotope Ozone, Fabfilter Pro-L, sometime Oxford Dynamic, Parametric EQ2 (not in that order of course).

2) U-he Diva

3) No because I had been back home, completely off tour, for a few weeks by that point, and I had completely forgotten anyone would listen to that music. It felt exactly like it did when I started out, making music for myself. It became nerve-wracking when I realized I was putting out those songs ! Hey Madeon, I'm a huge fan! I've recently become really intrigued in making electronic music, and I was wondering if you'd be able to give any tips to a beginner like me? :D Get the FL Studio demo and play around with it ! Check out the "Cool Stuff" folder, it's songs other people made you can study to learn the basics.

It's frustrating at first because you can't quite express what you have in mind right away, but if you keep at it you'll progress, it's fun ! What has your favourite song to create been? What are you listening to currently? What do you think of Front Nationale?


Thanks for doing this AMA! :D "OK" on the new album was really fun and pleasant to make. I had the idea and it all come together very naturally and easily.

Front Nationale is utterly despicable. Horrible stuff. Top 3 Sample Packs? GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have my own sample pack series, exclusivey for my own use, I spend a lot of time making them. My answer would therefore be :
Madeon Production Kit 1, MPK2, MPK3 Hey Madeon, boxers or briefs? Boxer How many launchpads have you ever used at the same time? 3 My dad, 51, and I both dig the new album! 

How hilarious is Dillon Francis in person? Awesome.

Dillon is super cool, funny and smart.
He did cancel remixes on me TWICE by now though. :( I work for CBS-TV in Chicago. Can we hang out and do a story on you when you're in town? JARoss@Cbs.com  Reach out to my manager : marco @ manajamma dot com Hey Hugo, looking forward to adventure! Could you explain your live setup (when using your launchpads &amp; k2)? How do you select your tracks and what exactly is happening in ableton? I use a software called Bome's Midi Translator Pro which enables you to program macros interfacing with Ableton and Mac OS.

So for example i'll press a button on the K2 and a series of action will automatically occur (the mouse will move to the browser, click and hold a song, drag it into the relevant spot in the playlist, release the click, move the mouse back where it was, all in a tenth of a second).

I spent a lot of time working on that in the summer of 2012. My approach was to imagine my ideal, dream DJing setup, and use those tools to get software behaviors as close as possible to what I wanted, so I could do a lot of interactions very quickly, from the controllers, without touching the mouse. When you get temporarily burnt out from working/touring what do you like to do?

 Play some games while watching shows I like in the background. (Big 30 Rock and Community fan) Hey Hugo I'm from nantes, at the externat! you may know that your former school organise a party for the "terminales" at the end of the school year! It's a fu**ing crazy idea i just got but, would you agree to come to this party, DJing for one night? This would be awesome! Thanks

--&gt;Haha, would be crazy.

----&gt; REALLY???? Are you really considering it? :D Would you really do it? :) Hi Hugo, big fan of your music and your a big inspiration to me.

1) Now that your album is finished, what will you be up to for the time being? (Chill out, more touring, new projects??)

2) Any thoughts on collaborating with Lady Gaga again? The tracks you did for Artpop were amazing.

Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA, and I'm happy for your success. You are a wonderful artist.  1) Working on the new show at the moment, going on tour in April !

2) I would love to, I think i've matured as a musician making this album, I would approach that collaboration differently. It's up to her though of course. What is your favorite color? 

and could you give a shoutout to my friend ''tacha'' pls? Turquoise

What's up Tacha yo ! Thanks a lot madeon, keep being awesome bro
 Hey Hugo
I'm from nantes, at the externat! 
you may know that your former school organise a party for the "terminales" at the end of the school year!
It's a fu**ing crazy idea i just got but, would you agree to come to this party, DJing for one night?
This would be awesome!
Thanks Haha, would be crazy. REALLY???? Are you really considering it? :D
Would you really do it? :) Hey Hugo,

Thanks for doing the AMA!

1. Was it difficult to produce the vocals for "Home" because you knew how sad you were when you recorded them?
2. What is your favorite thing about the album "Abbey Road" (music nerd thing or otherwise)?
3.  Because of all the songs you fit into your minimix for Annie Mac, I'm curious: do you think of songs as instruments?
4. Without getting too personal, did you and blazers have a mutual breakup?  Or was it pretty emotionally traumatizing?

Thanks! 1) I was mostly anxious about the vocal performance, there definitely is an answering machine phenomenom when working with your own vocals.

2) I love how elegantly it concludes their carreer. It gives closure to the Beatles. Having the last song on your last album be called "The End", with such an iconic final lyric is perfect. Hey Hugo,

1) You explained to me in an email once about your live setup and I was wondering whether you could explain any of the changes you've made to your new live show?

2) Will you ever be releasing Monarch, Komon, Ubelkeit, Song2? 

3) Would you ever consider showing us the project files you use? Both fl studio and your ableton live projects would be cool to study!

Thanks :D Would you post the email you got from him? http://imgur.com/ilnbScx

Hope that helps! Thanks a lot man! No worries! I've been trying to replicate what Hugo described through ableton and bomes for a few months and I'm not even close! He truly is a genius.  Madeon, saw you for the first time having not heard of you when you opened for Gaga in Minneapolis. Been a huge fan ever since.  I love when you incorporate The Killers into your mix.  Glad you decided to come back to Minneapolis this year! Already got my tickets.

I suppose a question, what has your favorite venue to perform at been so far, and why? See you there !

Le Grand Palais in Paris comes to mind, it's majestic. It's not really a concert venue at all so it has its downsides (quiet sound system etc), but the view makes up for it. Hey Madeon, I absolutely love Venus and MJH on ARTPOP and was wondering if you will be collaborating more with Lady Gaga for her next album Madeon! I love your music man, I've been a fan for years! You're the reason I started making music... As soon as I saw your pop culture video I went out and bought a launchpad and spent hours every day messing with it haha.


I know that you started producing when you were very young, but how did you balance school and music? I'm still in highschool and this can be very discouraging to me and really makes me lose interest fast. I'd like some tips if you have any.


Plus:

-Do you have any tips for a beginner? Practices I should be doing? (In FL or ableton)

-Do you have any interest in analog synths or modulation, or are you primarily digital?



Thanks man! As a 28 year-old just beginning to learn production, I can't help but look at your age and feel incredibly envious of what you've achieved at such a young age, not to mention your high level of musical maturity. That being said, is it too late for me? Knowing what you know now, what would you have done to accelerate your learning? Also, see you in Toronto!! I was lucky to find something I was passionate about very early in life, but it's absolutely never too late.

I'm not really sure how to accelerate learning, it took me five years to get to a point where I thought my music was getting ok ! Thanks for the quick and awesome response, M. You've got some amazing decades ahead of you. Looking forward to what's next. I'm 25 and fairly new myself, don't let that stop you man. You got this.

ps, I'm so stoked for May 8th! Thanks dude! Keep it up yourself. Giza is pretty dope. I'm from Egypt and I'd like to think that this is what my ancestors would be rocking to if they only had speakers that could handle it. aha rocking out hieroglyphic style. Thank you so much dude! Send your stuff my way, would love to hear it! Soon!! I'm still flailing at this point but I think I'll have something showable in the near future. I need to be braver and start finishing projects! I've been playing guitar for awhile so I feel like I'm overly harsh of what I've been producing, something I'm way less skilled at (not that I'm any good at guitar). I keep killing songs before they have a chance to grow, which is not cool. But yeah man I will definitely hit you up when the time comes, and hopefully will see you on the 8th! Yeah I hear ya, it can be tough. The harshest critic is ourselves, just have to give it a chance to grow.

We'll meet on the 8th for sure! Gonna be a sweet time! Hey Hugo, I'm a huge fan! I went to an audio engineering school and I used a couple of your tracks as a mastering reference. I appreciate and love all the work you have done and all the joy and experiences you have given me. I have a two part question. Do you mix and master your own tracks? If so (or not) how did you (or another engineer) achieve the really high -5 to -6dbfs peaks and RMS around -8 or -7dbfs without sacrificing clarity in the frequency spectrum of your tracks?  I mix and master my tracks.
Are you thinking of a song in particular ? I feel like my engineering style is quite different between say Icarus and Pay No Mind.

A lot of it comes down the sonic aesthetic of the song. Icarus is clipping hard, but it fits the style. You wouldn't be able to be as harsh on soft ballad. To try to clarify /u/BraxxenAudio's question - it's pretty well known that your songs regularly have 40, 50, 60 very active tracks, and you fit them all together without frequency masking or phasing. Is this due to vicious EQing or extremely precise track volume automation? Your song, Technicolor, in particular\. It starts off really soft, ballad like. Once the kick drum and bass comes in it punches me in the chest every time. I'm a really big Passion Pit fan, and now I'm a fan of you. How'd you meet him first?  We were both signed by the same A&amp;R in the US, so I asked for his email address and we started talking.

I still haven't actually met him ! It's the only collaboration on the album I haven't done in person. Hi! Big fan. 

I saw you play in Austin, TX, about 2 years ago. I had an amazing time: very small/intimate venue (albeit laughable for an artist who was already very well known by that point) on the second floor of some rando bar, 40-60 people max in attendance. I'm wondering if that's maybe why Austin (and Texas for that matter) isn't on the itinerary for this year's tour. 

Also - itching for a Madeon/Cashmere Cat collab. 

Thanks!! That was during SXSW right ? I did a lot of cool small shows that year and had a lot of fun.

I definitely want to come back to the cities i've missed during that tour later. You should! Also touring Mexico maybe? :c Actually it wasn't! (Performing at small venues during sxsw is pretty typical, so I def wouldn't have been as surprised.) The show I'm talking about took place on Jan, 2013 at Haven. 

Either way, I'll just write it off as a stroke of luck! : ) what is your favorite brand of cookies?

how many white t shirts and black jackets do you own? 

are you immortal? I have 50+ white t shirt and at least 15 black jackets. oh God. this is happening. thanks for answering! the times we have talked its for things I really love (the killers and now fashion) so i am quite happy. &lt;3  I forget which movie but it was when Jason Newsted was with the band. They show him storing sandwiches from the concession stand. Meanwhile Lars,Kirk, and James rip on him for being cheap.  Doesn't surprise me. 

[clip](https://youtu.be/_aIWYonhoIY) "We'll see who's laughing last" "Once again, the conservative, sandwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor" You didnt even refrigerate it you spineless lobster Jason definately had the last laugh.  He was a member of Metallica during their most profitable years.  He left on his own terms and with his integrity intact.

He also seems to be financially savvy and no longer has to play endless concerts like his former bandmates. Not to mention Flotsam and Jetsam as well as his solo project Newstead, which fucking rocks! That said Echobrain, which is what he left Metallica to do, fucking sucks. I forgot about Echobrain about 30 seconds after I heard Echobrain. ... ironically, it didn't resonate.... Oh man Flotsam and Jetsam is awesome! They are not broke personally, their "band account"  so to speak has not been profitable recently.  They continue to tour to support the people who work for their band.  Haha that is rich. Wow, " i got plans for those millions"  " we'll see who's laughing last"  "and it aint for fuckin sandwiches"

think of that line all the time. I subscribe to r/frugal sheerly out of hope that some random point will stick and finally help me stop wasting my money... but I just found it right here My husband gets so much shit from coworkers for bringing lunch every day. He just tells them that once your stomach is full you don't even think about the food anymore so why spend $15-$20 per day on lunch. There are health benefits from not eating at restaurants every day too.  Honestly, the only reason I don't pack lunch is I'm too lazy to pack lunch. And Jason's miserly plans paid off, because he referred to his stash in post-Metallica interviews as "squillions". Actually he said that in 2013 referring to the amount of money it would take for him to rejoin the band.  Full quote:

"If it was like that again and the money was crazy, then I would consider it. But it would be only for that thing and it would be absolutely delegated. It would have to be these 30 shows in these 45 days for this squillion dollars. But it has to be that." A year and a half in the life of metallica; part 2 Apparently Jason Newsted is from my hometown. I was not expecting to learn that from a video about sandwiches. Walnut Creek!

But really leaving the east bay was one of the best choices I've made.  Cue Lars insisting its all because of piracy. They gotta make a fuckin album once in a while to get pirated. Ulrekt "Those table scrap pilfering grabasses!" GRABASSES BAAAAAD Newsted is dope  As bass player or as a person? As a sandwich artist. Investing his squillions in Subway franchises.  Both They still are worth hundreds of millions each, its Metallica as an enterprise that losing money Enter taxman. Creeping Debt Fade to broke Sad but true Napster of Puppets Bill 'Em All  Loan

Coca cola paid them to go to antartica. Walmart paid Pitbull to go to Alaska. I will pay Bieber to go back to Canada.  Dude. 

This is METALLICA.

$32M is not them "going broke". That's them having the first non-profitable period of their career.  How in the hell do they spend $32M making a movie that is basically concert footage that they charged fans for?  Going by the article "period" = 5 years, which seems pretty substantial.
 Fight Finance With Finance Was it the Lou Reed album?

I bet it was the Lou Reed album. I AM THE TABLE!

Seriously, James, what the fuck. /r/squaredcircle 's favorite metallica jams I didn't know it was a real song, I thought it was some funny audio clip they had for Botchamania. It's not quite table. Tablet. But it sounds like table. 

 I'm not familiar with this.  Care to fill me in?
 Yeah no, just forget about this, your life will be better for it. It's honestly so god awful I thought it was originally a joke http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lulu_%28Lou_Reed_and_Metallica_album%29 &gt;If the Red Hot Chili Peppers acoustically covered the 12 worst Primus songs for Starbucks, it would still be (slightly) better than this. Primus at its worst still ain't half bad. Yeah because Primus sucks I had forgotten about it until now.  What album? I don't recall such a thing ever happening _ You're better off not knowing, trust me. I like both things separately but when combined they're awful. Like running while wanking.  Wait you don't like jogging off? Whats not to like? The wind in your hair and your cock in your hand What an abomination that was. Junior dad was one of the most beautiful Metallica songs ever written.  Oh yeah, you notice they didn't mention that in the article? That's clearly what it is.

I mean, Metallica is cool. Lou Reed was fucking awesome. Together? It's like they put motor oil on a peanut butter sandwich. Did. Not. Compute.

And then that Lords of Summer song? Gah!

Anyone looking for some SERIOUS thrash, click here, and you're welcome:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHBrA8L7UH8 Hit the Lights...on the way out. We're trying to save money here. Back to making a poor man's lunch meat sandwich- just a piece of lunch meat you eat off your hand (remember Behind the Music?) Loser's lunch: baloney on hand...  Good that's what helped inspire some of their best albums. Well that and a shit ton of alcohol. Alcoholica!  disastrous decisions, like hiring two biographers. They'll be fine once they release 'The Back In Black Album'. Then they'll surprise us all with 30 AC/DC covers. I'll be unpopular in this thread, but I'd buy that album in a damn heartbeat. Say what you will about the guys, they can cover the shit out of a song.  Metallica covering AC/DC would be my blackout night soundtrack. I'd like to see them do a complete album of songs from The Monkees. The article misses a MAJOR fucking point:

A couple of years back Metallica (as per their contract with their record company at the time) regained the entire rights to their back catalog (this was around about the time their music went up on spotify... that fact is not a coincidence).

Trust me, they're doing fine. Yup. Plus this article also came from Ultimate-Guitar. Which creates misleading article titles and doesn't always put all the facts on the table. They stir up controversy all the time. 

I work in the music industry, Metallica pulls in close to 4 million per show on average ~~just from ticket sales alone~~ ^(see edit). Say for example they do a 60 date international tour, that's 240 million, even after manager fees (probably 10% of gross profits), booking agent fees(another 5ish%) travel, etc, they walk away with big bucks. Add in publishing money, royalties, sponsorships and public appearances and they still walk away with multiple millions. And this doesn't count what they've invested money in. So yeah I wouldn't worry too much about their financial situations. 

This thread, like most Metallica threads, turned back to Napster being the sort of "end is nigh!" situation, it wasn't.  As far as their recent music catalog goes, even their "bad" albums made more than most (stressing the word most) international metal band's albums. I wouldn't worry about Metallica's finances.

edit: crossed out false info, they make an average gross of $4 million per show I'll be honest, I still love a lot of their older music, but it's hard for me to have sympathy for them; mainly due to Lars Ulrich. Imo that guy cost them many fans, and in turn $$. I stopped buying their albums and going to their shows when they started suing their fans for downloading their songs. Seemed hypocritical for a band who got their notoriety from fans bootlegging tapes and recording shows. Fuck them. Haven't intentionally listened to any of their stuff since the black album.  That's what I'm saying...who the fuck does that? He (Lars) had some points that made sense, but what didn't make sense was the way they were gouging the shit out of music back then because they could. Some bands recognized this and changed with the times. Lars cried like a bitch, sued fans and refused to change.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peKqsdyhtoE fuck this takes me back https://youtu.be/Af0wXeN6_FY

 First time I saw that, I about shit myself with laughter when he started crawling all over James Hetfield. As I watched this funny clip I scrolled down on the YouTube app.  Other choices were "Master of Puppets full album" and "Ride the Lightning full album". He pretty much publicly stated the music industry's stance on digital music at the time. Instead of changing with the times and using this possible new revenue stream, sue the shit out of anyone who dares look at it. The reason for this is that record labels cannot monopolize internet distribution. They weren't trying to stop piracy. They were trying to throw a wrench in internet distro becoming a viable channel.  [Here's an interesting debate between Lars &amp; Chuck D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OIqtHBbDWA). 

Two interesting points I took away 1) Chuck D was right in saying that the power gets taken out of the Labels. 2) Lars at one point described basically iTunes and that Napster could have been them.  There was no point that Napster could have been iTunes.  iTunes only became what it was through the iPod becoming ubiquitous.  It took Apple throwing their weight about *a lot* and arranging circumstances to make sure that basically everyone using an iPod or running a Mac had it for iTunes to capture the market like it has, it's not just a case of "the right software with great marketing". While this is true, there is probably no iTunes without a Napster first...it scared the labels shitless when it happened and made them realize they needed a digital solution sooner than later. To be clear, iTunes the media player predates the iTunes Store. I remember on one of their earlier VHS tapes (forget which one), the beginning of the tape shows them walking into a convenience store and stealing a case of beer.  Fast forward some years, the Napster shit went down, I lost all respect for them.  Yeah, I downloaded their songs, when I was a broke-ass teen and couldn't afford $15-20 CDs.  Then when I actually had money I bought the albums I had previously downloaded out of respect for the artists I enjoy.  But not Metallica.  Fucking hypocrites. Sounds like the beginning of Cliff 'em All. The only Metallica DVD worth buying. Hahah, you're right, that's the one!
https://youtu.be/FLezYQWwqdE?t=35s [Such are the times](https://i.imgur.com/zTtcKfE.jpg).  Yup. I was a die hard fan in college. After the Lars whining, I lost all respect. I simply cannot listen to a Metallica song without seeing Lars in my head. Lars made Metallica look like a bunch of pussy cry babies which is the antithesis of the power image they're supposed to project. Breaking point for me was when they openly made fun of Layne Staley's (Alice in Chains) debilitating drug addiction. Layne would wear extra shirts and pairs of pants to cover up his slow death. His six foot frame weighed eighty pounds when he died.

Truly one of the greatest singers of all time who loved everyone and put an amazing amount of emotion into his music. To come out of recluse for his fans and be snickered at by children is horrible. Layne put himself through his own personal hell with his addiction, but he was still a great person who was down to earth and compassionate. Are you guys talking about the piracy thing or were there other things he bitched about? I was a huge fan in the 80's, but after the Black Album, I kind of lost interest in their newer stuff and stopped following them. I still loved the shit out of the first four or five records, though, and the worst thing I would have said about them in the 90's was that they just weren't writing songs like they used to (a matter of taste, I understand, but that was - and still is - my opinion).  
  
Point is, I never would have said "I hate Metallica" back then, only, "I used to love Metallica".  
  
Then the Napster thing happened, and I still said, "OK, I disagree with a lot of Lars' points, but I kind of agree with him in principle. They could lose money on this." Then he just wouldn't shut up about it, and I started to read more about the future of the music industry, and I started to read more about the past and present of the music industry, and the more I learned, the more I began to disagree with him. I began to really dislike him.  
  
Then they sued their fans and, well, yeah, fuck Metallica. I'll listen to *Ride the Lightning* all day, but I like to just pretend they broke up in '91 or '92. It's the piracy thing~~, but specifically for me (and probably a lot of other people), them suing their fans.  I don't have any time for an artist that thinks filing lawsuits on their fans is a good idea.  Them whining about their status as starving artists while suing kids and grandmothers didn't exactly come off as iconic/hard 'rock and roll' behavior, either~~. Me too, cut to death magnetic after the debacle. Music industry using music industry techniques to absolutely mangle the mastering and prove how disconnected they are. They're signing their own death certs here and aren't keeping current. The way that's phrased makes them sound like a business. Which reminds of that metalocalypse joke about the band having the 7th largest economy in the world.  ultimateguitar is such a fucking garbage heap of a site. First line of the article: "They're one of the biggest selling times". What?

Metallica will be just fine. They're about to rerelease their whole catalog remastered for the first time. Their archive is absolutely ripe for it, too. That will be huge. And then the new album, and then tours.

They are a corporation. Corporations run profits and ride out losses. That doesn't mean they are broke, it means they've had some downcycles. They have more than enough resources to easily make up for this blip. What they should have done is what iron maiden does and some other power metal bands do: Find out where their music is being downloaded from and tour there. Theres a huge market for metal in brazil. Big bands like this can still make bank off concerts. I go see all the bands i like as long as they come through my city. Children of bodom, the aristocrats, dimmu borgir, unearth, in flames, people under the stairs, alestorm, protest the hero, within the ruins, necrophagist, animals as leaders etc etc. yeah i download their some albums (might buy some too) but i also pay for their shows and buy their merch because i like them and owe it to them and love live music.  Yeah but there is a massive difference between maiden and Metallica live. I've seen metalica 3 times and now wouldn't cross the road to see them. Maiden on the other hand, holy shit, their live show is unreal! &gt; I wouldn't cross the road to see them  

...But I'd run to the hills to see Maiden! Man, Bruce is still such an energetic and acrobatic performer for his age, and he still kills it vocally every time I've seen them. I hope he gets healthy again; I want that man to live forever. Bruce looses his mind on stage. Last time I saw them was a Wacken a couple of years ago and he did not stop moving! I really hope Bruce Dickinson can recover fully and get back on stage. Best show I've been to.  There's nothing quite like seeing Iron Maiden at an outdoor festival. Saw them at the first installment of Heavy MTL, and it was the greatest show I've ever attended. them going to brazil would shut the city/country down. that would be huuuge. they could do a three night stay and walk with millions easy. Wait, they don't tour Brazil? I assumed they toured basically every country once in a while. Where's your crown, King Nothing?!! So I met Lars on Saturday. I work at a movie theater in San Francisco and he came to watch a movie with his girlfriend. He walks up to the cafe with his girlfriend and start looking at the ice cream. I walk up to them and ask if they want ice cream while my other coworker is making his gf a coffee drink. 

Me: "would you guys like some ice cream?"
Lars: "no thank you but it looks good"
Lars gf: "yea it looks all gooey and delicious"
Me: "haha yea it's pretty gooey"
Lars: "have you ever stuck ur hand in the ice cream and just mushed it around?"
Me: "hahaha no never"
Lars: "really? What about grabbed some ice cream and mushed it all over your face?"
Me: "what?? No. Sounds like a good idea since it's hot but no, we can't do that"
Lars: "what?? Who's gonna tell? Her?" (He points at my coworker)
Me: "hahah true. By the way, big fan"
Lars: "oh thank you. Really appreciate it"

Co worker hands them their drink 

Me: "you guys have a good nite"
Lars: "thanks. You too"

I turn to my coworker
Me: "i don't even like Metallica"

True story  Whoa, you better get out of here with that Lars being a cool guy talk. This is /r/Music, not /r/Metallica. I met Lars during one of their shows here in Vancouver several years ago. He drew a very detailed and accurate map on a wall in a hallway with a permanent marker of where Metallica had been touring and the shows they did prior to the one I was at. 

2 things I learned about that: the man has a very good memory. And he likes to goof around. Hardly the douchebag everyone says he is. Drawing on a wall with permanent marker is kinda a douchebag thing to do tho.  It was at a performance venue. In Vancouver. Bet you anything nobody has ever even tried to clean it off. They'd still be in the black if it weren't for all those kids downloading albums of Nappster.  Then they could have had the 40000 gallon sharktank instead of the 38000 gallon sharttank. A 38000 gallon sharttank sounds horrifying That's a lot of shit. [Still think its not a big deal?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af0wXeN6_FY) And gotten it gold plated instead of just plain old glass. Guys,  lets get one thing straight.  While Metallica the corporation might be having money challenges, Metallica the people are still wealthy beyond our wildest dreams.  If you think any member of that band is worried about money,  you're crazy.  There's only one [man](http://imgur.com/0zZJ2Mo) who can fix this. The fact that there probably will never be a Dethalbum IV is fucking depressing.  I'd trade everything Metallica has done in the past fifteen years for another one of those.  Dethalbum III was honestly one of the best metal albums I've ever listened to. Well, there would've been. Brendan wanted to do at least another season and adult swim told him to fuck off with that and  wrap it up in part 2 of Doomstar. So yeah.  Hes also sadly unemployed at the moment. :( let's get Jon Taffer in here to help them. Dunno if bar expertise translates here, but I'd like to see him go toe-to-toe with Lars. TAX FRAUD. IMPRISONING ME. ALL THAT I SEE, ABSOLUTE RED INK. 
TAKEN MY CARS, TAKEN MY LAMPS, LEFT ME WITH A LIFE IN 
DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBT! http://i.imgur.com/mwKWJvj.jpg They own the rights to their songs, if they re-master ..AJFA with some goddamn bass and re-release it people might spend money.  And how about touring the U.S. once in a while? Meanwhile, Mustaine is doing pretty well for himself. And this goes out to my old band...here's foreclosure of a dream! The Menza years were the best of Megadeth.  He probably doesn't have a pair of biographers walking around with him. Even if they have lost money since 2010, I'd think they would have had enough from the previous 30 years... Time for one of those vegas residency deals. For all the people who was turned off by Metallica suing Napster, you will appreciate what Iron Maiden did.

Iron Maiden paid a company to find out who/where was doing most of the illegal downloading. Apparently it was South America. What did they do?They scheduled a tour in South America and have made a killing. 

Now THAT, is smart business. This is hilarious. James Hetfield probably has 32 mil in the cushions of his car.  This explains why they were at BlizzCon this year. I shelled out real money and bought And Justice For All just last week. Kirk, James, et al, this week coffee is on me! You guys just might have to share it. Great musicians, but they do indeed make some awful decisions. I remember them trying to flog merchandise at a festival, where the merchant had told us they had set ridiculous rates; a vest top, with a little thunder bolt on it .... almost 90. I couldn't believe it. I asked what justified the price. They just repeated the above. They looked pretty embarrassed.  I just hope this doesn't lead to churning out a 2 bit album and having to tour for 4 years just to recover... 


I mean, I really like Metallica. I've been a fan since I was 12 years old and am now 25 going on 26.


I know they've had some hiccups in the past but I really think what they've done for the world of mainstream heavy metal and all the artists today who were inspired by them was one of the best things that could of ever happened. 

But I really don't want to see them suffer another failure and have to live it down...  ITT: Something Metallica did in 2000 magically made them lose money in 2015.
 Talks about Metallica, brings up the ol Napster incident. Classic! Lars was buying and selling 10's of millions of dollars in art in the some kind of monster "biography". Maybe "Metallica" as a organization is struggling, but I doubt the guys are.   Playing that show in Antarctica probable wasn't the best move was it lads "Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahhahaha" - Dave Mustaine How the hell did they spend 32 million making Through the Never? it is a filmed concert with shots of a kid running through the streets of New York.  Is.....is that a serious question? Have you been on the streets of NY? It doesn't look like an apocalyptic wasteland (most of the time), that is something they had to spend money on to make happen. And that "kid" is an established actor who I'm sure didn't work for free. Not to mention the concert footage was all Imax. I think people bringing up Napster still in all this is really absurd. For one thing, many other artists were on board with what Lars did at the time, including Dr. Dre AND Neil Young.

Lars also wasn't being a greedy fuck when he sued Napster. His reasons behind it were very clear: Nobody should be able to decide how an artists music is distributed but them. THAT is why he sued Napster. Think of it this way: You're an artist who pays THOUSANDS of dollars to own all the publishing and distribution rights for your music. Along comes P2P and basically takes that away, you'd sue the owners responsible for that program too. If you'll also remember here's how it also began: the state of california ordered Napster to CEASE AND DESIST spreading Metallica's music around, when they didn't, Lars sued. So blame Shawn Fanning for continuing to break the law and perpetuate piracy, not Metallica's out-spoken drummer for defending his court-ordered right.

As for music sharing on the internet itself negatively impacting how much an artist makes, I'd like to remind people that album and single sales barely make up for anything when it comes to a musician's income. Money from an album sale usually goes towards paying the record company back for the money they loaned the artist to make the record, along with paying things like producers, engineers and even distributors who sell the album in their stores. At the end of it all, an artist sees a few dollars for each album sold. This is why record companies are suffering from file sharing and not artists themselves. Artists make most of their money from touring and merchandising, not album profit.

Metallica in this case have just been spending more than they've been making. They filmed a grandiose concert here in Vancouver a few years ago over the span of three days that looked more like a film set and crew for Apocalypse Now than it did 4 metal guys playing a show and they also played a show in Antarctica for Coca-Cola, meaning they had to ship their gear and etc to the world's coldest continent, for ONE show for barely 80 people. They also spend too long in between albums now to really warrant longing interest in the band. The span between 2008 and now they've done hardly anything but spend huge sums of money, by comparison to that same span of time in the 80s, Metallica released nearly ALL of their classic albums which probably also cost millions less in fees to make, too.

The problem with Metallica is that they probably need an accountant who'll look at them and say NO, WE CAN'T AFFORD IT when someone suggests playing their next show on the moon for some asteroids and the moon-lander. This has nothing to do with a file-sharing fiasco that happened more than ten years ago.

That's all I'm going to say about this, because for every Metallica fan willing to properly explain things to people, there's 100 more idiots whinging about the Napster bullshit or calling them sellouts. I've been a Metallica fan since I was 10 years old and I am 30 now, I've seen them more times than I can count on one hand and have even met 2 of them, they're great guys who'd bend over backwards for all of their fans. 

EDIT: Reddit gold! You could make a dark man blush! Thank you sir or ma'am! Trying to talk sensibly about piracy on Reddit is like trying to talk about moderate use of drugs to Keith Richards. I've been downvoted to hell for pointing out that piracy is actually wrong. The music industry may be bullshit, but that doesn't mean artists shouldn't be compensated for their work. Producing high quality albums is expensive. I feel that most piracy is low quality media that is a preview of their material. 

Just like it was early in Metallica's career with audio cassettes.




 &gt; I've been downvoted to hell for pointing out that piracy is actually wrong.

This only recently became a debate.  Until a few years ago I'd never seen anyone on the internet seriously argue against it. Yet many in the music, film, and tv industry are millionaires. And not just the higher up execs. The artists too. Call me crazy, but I don't think actors and musicians (or the executives of these industries) should be collecting paychecks in the millions.

The only way to beat piracy is to lower prices and make it easier to buy things than to pirate them. (Aka Netflix and spotify). Piracy is the turning point that is hopefully shifting the three major media based parts of the entertainment industry (film, television, music) to a better more consumer focused business model, and also spurring greater and better quality creativity.

I'll fully agree piracy is wrong, it is theft, and it's down right bloody obvious. But when I look at the 300+ albums I brought as a teenager with my first ever pay cheques I always think how many tracks are there that are pure crap, sheer filler, every band is guilty of it phoning in a few tracks to make an album length recording. 

Also on a purely personal note Metallica made St Anger and they damn well owe me that money back, or at least one free pirated album! Piracy is the way people fight back against $20 CDs and a shitty distribution model.  Piracy is the way we forced the industry into selling individual songs on iTunes. If it weren't for music piracy in the 90s, legal music downloads would have been delayed by years if not decades. Keith did moderate the drugs, this is why he is still touring and playing while people 1/5th of his age are dying to World of Warcraft. drug addicts play WoW? wow, just wow. So you're saying we need to flush our computers out with software from other computers in Switzerland, so that we can talk a lot more bollocks about piracy?

I'm up for that.

(In reference to the urban legend that mass Swiss blood transfusions is what allowed Keith Richards to survive the massive amount of drugs he's done) It's not sensible in the slightest. Just because a business model existed does not mean it is protected for eternity. That time was rife with piracy because the landscape was shifting but the fat cats thought they were entitled to continue as it was. &gt; the fat cats thought they were entitled to continue as it was

There's sure a lot of entitlement around this issue, that's for sure.

"But I *deserve* to download that album *for free* because I'm a *true fan* who's *always supported* this band. You *corporate fat cats* wouldn't understand. It's really about the *musiiiiic* man."
 Nope. Never said anything of the sort. I stole because there was not a better option in my eyes at the time. I was also like 20 years old. Doesn't mean it was ok, but on the other hand had paid models that are now flourishing existed then, I wouldn't have done it. I think a lot of people are pointing to the napster situation not necessarily as the main money loser, but more so as the beginning of the end. It was a rocky fall from grace starting at that point. It wasn't great PR and Lars, especially, didn't handle it in the most professional way, but as a musician I see their reasoning. People were pissed at them and use it as an excuse to hate on them to this day even though that was over 15 years ago. But if an artist doesn't, rightfully so, make money off of his creation, is that right? It's easy to hate on the big ones in that case because they were millionaires already, but think about all of the lesser known musicians who would have had a much harder time because some asshole bought their album and is sharing it to whoever wants it for free. Any band that has come up since then has had to bust its ass even harder than these guys did. Nowadays, they have to hit the road harder and spread themselves thin from trying to make up for the kind of profit that once came from selling albums. 

People hate on them now out of a grudge they carry from the Napster controversy. They use it as a character attack because they think it was all about greed. It wasn't. An artist should be paid for their product. Pure and simple. Metallica made a series of poor financial decisions over the years and it's caught up to them. This has nothing to do with the Napster controversy. They spent more than they made and didn't invest well. If I can add to what you said here, the whole Metallica\Lars vs Napster was initially about controlling material that wasn't supposed to be released yet.  Unfinished demo versions of *I Disappear* were floating around and the lawsuits came about only after Lars asked fans to respect the band's request of not sharing the demos.


It's also worth noting that the band has always welcomed bootleg recordings of their live shows, and he said at some point in all this that they don't care if Napster is used to share live shows and rare recordings.


I can't defend everything Lars said and did about it, but I can imagine how frustrating it is to ask fans -- individuals you've had a positive relationship with for nearly two decades (at the time) -- to be reasonable, and in return, being told to fuck off.


What I don't get is how unanimously everyone turned on Lars for standing by what he believes in.  We may not all agree with his choices in handling the Napster situation, but in my book, he still holds a shred of integrity for not giving up even when he knew it would likely be an incredibly unfavorable outcome. Those other artists did not gain their popularity in the first place by encouraging bootleg tapes and illegal sharing of their music.  Metallica did.  While other artists were on board (and continue to be), none were quite as hypocritical as Metallica. So what, you don't stay on Kickstarter forever.  If I recall, they were upset because a demo version of I Disappear leaked on Napster. Those bootlegs were from live shows. It's understandable for an artist to get upset when their unfinished product is leaked. I don't think it's quite as hypocritical as people would like to think. I think the original intention of going after Napster was fine. However, it was wrong to seek millions from otherwise loyal fans. Because that was the early 80's, they couldn't just upload their shit onto the internet like they can now. The Dead (or The Other Ones, depending on the year) will send C&amp;D orders for people sharing Dicks Picks online. There's no band in history that's been more dependent on sharing live music.  There's comes a point however, when you become well known and your fanbase expands to where you don't need people bootlegging your shows and expect them to actually start paying. 

The free exposure/bootleg model is great for up and comers, but it doesn't make you a hypocrite for not wanting to remain that way forever, especially when you've made a name for yourself.  That point, in this instance, is called "hypocrisy". Saying something is ok when it benefits you then saying it's wrong when it doesn't is the very essence of hypocrisy. I guess it makes me a hypocrite for not wanting to work at McDonald's after I got a job as a teacher. No, but you'd be a hypocrite if you became a teacher and then said people who work at McDonald's are bad, and used your teaching money to make sure no one else ever worked at McDonald's again. Is Lars preventing other bands from giving away their music (or doing with it whatever they see fit), or is he just protecting and controlling HIS music, so that he may sell it or give it away when he wants? Lars used to encourage people to steal music. You can call it his music if you like, but others, like the recording industry who have invested in Lars with the expectation of a profit, would beg to differ. So far, Lars says it's ok to steal music.

Things change, and it is no longer to Lars' benefit to have people steal his music. So Lars says, "Stealing music is bad".

Lars is a hypocrite. So what you're saying is that it's perfectly fine to advocate something while you're poor but opposing it once it made you rich? Nope. Anybody is free to distribute their music as they see fit. There are great sites like Bandcamp that allow for this. 

However, you cannot be so ignorant as to see how this isn't so black and white. It makes business sense that once your name is out there and you've brought in all those ears, to charge for your music, or at least fans to start paying to support the artist. It's immoral and intellectually dishonest to use the bootleg tape arguement when your downloading a Metallica or Beatles record. They don't need you to get the word out anymore. So you are saying that illegally bootlegging is only okay for artists that aren't famous. And once people are rich and famous, you should pay them?

In fact, you are saying it is immoral to not pay rich people. But it's morally fine to not pay poor people. I don't know if you're being this dense on purpose. 

It should be up to the artist! If the artist wants their music out there for free, then that's their choice, and the same if they want to charge. It should all be up to the artist. It's about having control over your work.

I can completely see why a young artist would make their work free, or charge for it. It's up to them. I don't advocate theft, unless the artist does, in which case it isn't really theft. You are aware that the artist in this case sold his rights to a music label before encouraging everyone else to bootleg it, right? They also have most of their music videos on youtube to watch for free along with many of their live concerts. They just want the fans to see the content provided by them, in the context that they meant it in. They are at the point where they are doing this for the fans, just watch one of their international shows and see how many more fans they have outside of the US.  &gt;You are aware that the artist in this case sold his rights to a music label before encouraging everyone else to bootleg it, right?

They encouraged people to tape shows. As far as I'm aware that's the extent of it. Do you have a citation where Metallica encouraged people to bootleg and spread around their studio albums?  But the rights to recordings of their shows had been sold off. Yes, it does.  I think artists should be paid.  But to do a fundamental cultural 180 after you've hit it big is, in a word, shitty. I don't think any band who wants to be successful/financially viable plans on playing clubs their whole life and giving away their music. The plan is to get to the next level, and that next level is selling your music to make a living. You know, the more I think about it, the more I realize that the dichotomy in thinking about the problem of "piracy" is a red herring.  It presents the case as one of artist vs. illegal downloader.  I think that dichotomy is false and deliberately contrived.

To understand why, let's go back to the 80s and look at how professional music worked.  You had teeming hordes of musicians working in desperate poverty, all vying for the chance to hit it big.  You had a few mega-stars whose prosperity was so immense that it became a matter of legend on its own, completely outside their actual musical careers.  But the only people making money consistently in the business of music were the distributors.  Record labels consistently raked in billions; wildly in excess of what was paid even to the most outrageous legends of pop music at the time.  They did so by carefully crafting the marketplace to restrict popular music to a small set of artists and genres.  Stars didn't arise.  They were made.  And music wasn't selected by the listening public.  It was played on the radio according to very restrictive marketing practices.  Distributors went to great lengths to artificially restrict the supply of music, so that they could corner the market on its distribution.  Artists, on the whole, were getting screwed.  It wasn't practically possible to get by as a musician unless you became a made star.  The people who were really making money off the music industry were the distributors.  The rest had about the same long term prospects as gamblers at a casino.

Fast forward to today.  The technological limitations that made it possible to monopolize distribution no longer exist.  Music distributors didn't adapt to the changing business environment, and a black market for distribution developed.  What has this meant for artists?  Perhaps it's less likely to have a Michael Jackson-esque megastar in 2015 than it was in 1982.  But it's more likely to have 10,000 artists who take advantage of the changes in technology and can ply their trade by a means other than hauling amps around between clubs in the back of a VW van for pennies an hour.  My wife is one of thousands of such artists.  She is a vocalist/composer/producer who learned the trade working in the collaborative atmosphere of Soundcloud.  Over the past few years, she's transitioned almost exclusively to paid commercial work, ranging from movie and video game trailers to commercials and more.  Her career is steadily advancing, and a tipping point where she can quit her day job and commit to music full time is within sight.  Were there people like her in the 80s?  Of course there were.  But I find it difficult to believe there were quite so many.  She collaborates with hundreds of other people like her, working together on various projects, from all over the world.  In 2015, on the whole, it is far more lucrative to be a professional musician than it was in 1982.  I'm not talking about hitting it big.  I'm talking about plying a trade, the way an engineer or farmer can expect to be able to make a living plying theirs.  

The ones who are left out in this new business model are the huge music distributors.  That is why you're seeing old ladies and college students shaken down for tens of thousands of dollars.  Because an entrenched business is dying, and doing anything it can to claw at the rest of society and the economy to browbeat us into doing for it what it failed to do in the first place - to figure out how to make a dollar in the current economic and technological environment.  This isn't artist vs. listener and it never was.  The artists have figured this whole Internet thing out, and as a group seem to be doing better than ever.  This is about a dying industry throwing all the power and leverage it has into turning back the clock to a time when its services were relevant. I think you make a fantastic point. Big distributers need to die off and the business ought to take place directly between the artist and the consumer. This would solve a lot of the problems artists and fans share. I really liked the way you put that. That puts in more in perspective for a lot of people I think. It's not like every poor teenage fan suddenly stopped being poor teenagers when Metallica's fan count reached a certain number.   This is true. 'Hit the lights' made it's way around California via mixtape. It's how all the the thrash bands planted their seeds in the early 80's &amp; Metallica had no problem back then. Back then they were just trying to be heard, unlike today, when many people consider them the Beatles of hard rock &amp; heavy metal.  Those other artists probably didn't completely sell out and start producing shit within a three year span.  But in that case, it was the artist, Metallica, agreeing to bootlegging, etc. That is the point - THEY were making decisions about how they wanted their artistic property distributed.  They were in control then, and they as producers of the product, wanted to maintain control.  People should be thankful that they got the product free earlier rather than bitching about having to rightly have to pay for it later. bitching about having to pay for it != protesting an entire social policy movement to hobble the Internet + media devices, and the extortion of fortunes from old ladies and college students. Wow, that sounds like socialist sloganeering.  Don't make this into a crusade. It's simple - some people create a product and others can choose to pay for it if they want it or if they can afford it.  Why do people put such a different value on purchasing music and movies than they do for anything else? The elderly and college students can't buy new homes and Cadillacs either so should they steal them as well?   And that sounds like Libertarian hyperbole.  If you don't want a crusade, I recommend lowering the torch from the strawman you've set up on that altar there.  I'm suggesting it may be a good idea for Cadillac not to sue little old ladies and college students because some new technology rendered their business model obsolete.

&gt;Why do people put such a different value on purchasing music and movies than they do for anything else?

Ah yes.  The "you wouldn't download a car" trope.  If you don't understand the difference between physical and intellectual property, then this conversation is pointless.  An item's value is what the market says it is, not what the controller of supply decides it is. Sorry, your quasi-intellectual horseshit doesn't change the fact that regardless of what kind of property it is, it's not yours to steal. This is simple ethics and logic.     Using the "market" price of stolen goods as some sort of benchmark is absolutely ridiculous.  If someone thinks that it's ethical or moral to download stuff for free when THEY KNOW that through honest retail channels it is not free, then they are stupid, and in this case, morally-challenged people and they may get sued.  Tough for them.  Not about money?

[Directly from Lars Ulrich's AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wl9ic/hey_its_lars_from_metallica_ama/cf330ko) True, but I think the Napster thing was a turning point. Whether you agree with Lars' response or not, it definitely changed their public image.

Then again, there are tons or turning points. You could say it all started going downhill after Cliff died, or when Bob Rock took over as producer, or after the Black album when they started waiting 5+ years to put out new material, or when Jason Newsted left. 

I think the problem is, they just got old and tired. Their albums take 5+ years because the creative juices aren't there anymore. The first five albums burned them out, especially the Black Album. Once they started taking multi-year hiatuses they didn't stop. Death Magnetic was a valiant effort to return to their peak years, but to be perfectly honest, it doesn't hold a candle to their 80's material. 

They were different people back then. They were poor, angry, overworked, and depressed and now they're millionaires. I don't care how dedicated to your musical integrity you are; being rich and successful changes you. It's not because they're bad people or they're talentless, it's just what happens to people who get old. I love Led Zeppelin but I couldn't give two shits about whatever projects Jimmy Page and Robert Plant are doing now. Nothing they do is as good as what they've already done. That's just how it works with everybody. 

Metallica had a lot of shit to say in the 80's that resonated with a lot of people. But time went on, and now they're at the point where they've said everything they had to say, but they're still on up stage, either repeating themselves or rambling about nothing. This perfectly encapsulates whats wrong with Metallica. After watching "cliff em all" with a buddy one night, we concluded that Metallica never sold out or got worse, they just... got old. Everybody really hassled Metallica for experiementing and "progressing" with Load/ReLoad. But progressing or evolving your sound is a not in of itself a bad thing. The problem is, you have a band that really honed themselves to sound like *X*, but now they're trying to sound like *Y*, and they just plain *don't do a very good job* at sounding like *Y*. 

If Avenged Sevenfold had put out *Load*, it would have had much more artistic esteem placed on it. I would love to listen to their version of King Nothing or even Ronnie. But Metallica just doesn't do those songs very well. They tried too hard to sound like the bands they like to listen to as opposed to sounding like themselves. Lars was clearly in the right, but it was a huge mistake to be the face of the anti-piracy movement.  Lars should have let the music companies and their lawyers be the heavy here. This should be the only comment in this thread also do not read anything below this as it's a a bunch of people talking out their assholes. I mostly agree with you. It used to be that bands made their money touring , not on album sales. That was because in the early days (60s and 70s) record companies, agents, managers, etc basically swindled bands and their only source of income was touring. In the 80s and 90s, albums became much more profitable and musicians became more savvy. They started to tap into this income stream. Also, in earlier days, bands used to tour in bare bones buses and play with just their instruments and some amplifiers. As time went on they started having elaborate stage shows and some started flying from show to show. I remember in the late 90s reading about how some big bands were LOSING money on tour. 
Fast forward to now and the entire paradigm has changed. Record sales are down, but concert ticket prices are up. Bands are making money by touring again and some are cutting out the record companies all together and selling or giving away their music online. People buy singles on iTunes, not albums. 
I think Metallica got caught in the middle of a massive shift in how the music industry operates and had a hard time adapting. They sued because they weren't sure what else to do. Remember, these guys are the same age as many of your (redditors) parents.  They were also somewhat isolated to what was going on in the Information Age so it crept up and blindsided them. 
Anyway, my $.02. Loved their music since 1983. I am in my 50s and they are still my favorite band. I think they are all dickheads though, so it's hard to have much sympathy.  Lars: I see. No problem.

James: No, not just in space. Inside space.

Lars: OK.

James: In the heaviest, deepest, most brutal part.

Lars: All right.

&gt; Gentlemen. The problem with Metallica is that they probably need an accountant who'll look at them and say NO, WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.  I may have a solution. We're now in touch with the deep space record label producer that Metallica will use on the moon.  His name is Rick "Magic Ears" Rubin and he's a real piece of work.  Tax evasion; disfigured a co-worker at an office party, melted her face with acid; soliciting prostitution; drugs. He's looking at a 25-year sentence. He'll do anything we want.

&gt; Excellent.

&gt; And he'll be our man on the inside.

&gt; We'll contact him once the moon record is complete and get a full report.

&gt; A report? Now's the time to take out Metallica once and for all. They're just sitting there on the moon.  We could make it look like a space accident.

&gt; No! It is too soon.

&gt; We must watch them.

Double Edit: How could I miss this gem.  

James: Now shut up and listen to this, dick.  This is metal.  For asteroids.

Kirk: Asteroids don'ts gots no good metals to listens to. Bullshit.  It was about cash. Pure and simple.  Lars had to keep paying for his growing art collection. 

I get the whole "artistic integrity" but seriously, the point of a band is to make songs so people can hear them.  If you don't want people to hear your music except on your terms, buy everyone a pair of headphones and strip search everyone before the show. And still don't be surprised when your music is leaked. 

The whole "we need a million to record an album" is simple ego and bullshit in today's digital world. They could buy a damn studio, hire a couple of engineers, and record whatever the fuck they want whenever they want.   God forbid anyone wants to make money off of their art.  I remember in 2000, Radiohead's Kid A was leaked on Napster. The band shrugged it off. The week after the release, they were No. 1 on Billboard. Thats a bit entitled isn't it? I mean when did he lose the right to make money for his work?

Yeah, the point of recording music is to let the fans hear it, but not for free...by that logic, everything should be free.  Not saying that either.  What I am saying is to be smart about technology and not be clueless to what happens in the world.   I just think that if I'd have made it that big, making such a big stink about the millions *more* you could have if people weren't pirating your music...I am unable to find much empathy there. It goes well beyond that. Napster was leaking an unfinished DEMO of I Disappear at the time. Fuck him for wanting fans to hear the final product first, yeah?  &gt; I get the whole "artistic integrity" but seriously, the point of a band is to make songs so people can hear them.

You're totally right.  Any artist who doesn't give their art away for free is a flaming hypocrite who doesn't get what the point of a band is.

Thanks for taking a stand for true art. Nope.  Not at all. What I am saying (and most smart bands have realized) is that it's not the "art" that makes your lifestyle but how you can control the physical aspects of it.  

You might not be able to control mp3s getting out, but you can get them on iTunes where people might by your music. The old model would have you schlepping cd's from a car trunk after a show. Now you can throw your warez on YouTube and get a million people seeing your art.  Which is better for your art (since you are doing this for your art...)? 50 people at a show or some kid in rural Afghanistan loving what you did and sharing with his buddies?

The smart musicians use the Internet as a tool to gauge where their fans are, who wants their music, and then delivers appropriately. Being a musician sucks ass and it's an industry where the vast majority of people do it out of love and not for a living. The two choices are "go pro and suffer" or "stay amateur and do it longer". I chose the latter and while I definitely didn't have the chops for the pro world, making the latter choice allowed me to stay in it longer.

 Why shouldn't it be about cash - it's how they make their living and who the fuck are you to decide how much money they make from it. How are you so entitled that you think you should be able to steal someone's intellectual property? You're stealing somebody's life's' work. It's like me walking into whatever job you do, ripping off your work and not paying you...then having the BALLS to wine and call you a baby when you complain.  &gt;but seriously, the point of a band is to make songs so people can hear them.

*But seriously, the point of a restaurant is to make food for people to eat...*

*But seriously, the point of an automaker is to make cars for people to drive...*

Blah blah blah shitty argument ad infinitum...

The *"point"* of a professional band is the same as **any other business.** Produce a product to be sold. Since every other business gets to do this "on their own terms" I see no reason why professional musicians should be excluded. Selling the products of your own labor on your own terms is the very basis of the market system/capitalism.
 It's not the terms, it's being clueless in your market and what your customers can do and will do.

The major labels thought no one would buy mp3s after Napster.  iTunes Store proved them different. &gt;The major labels thought no one would buy mp3s after Napster.

(citation needed) it's hard not to hate people like you. especially as a musician. you have no idea what you're fucking talking about, but you're nonetheless ANGRY and PASSIONATE and assertive about a completely ignorant position.

it's like saying to steven spielberg, "quit fucking whining about million dollar production budgets, just use your camera phone and click record." you obviously have no idea the kind of costs necessary to make a Black Album or anything close to it, so why even say anything? Thanks but I am a musician. Not pro, but enough to know the creative aspects, the business models, and the Ego and bullshit that go into the process. So let's begin. 

Disclaimer: I helped run metallicasucks.com in its heyday.  Between the occasional death threat (and that person's conviction) and wacko, it was a pretty interesting sound board. 

So, in your world "the artist" has absolute control over the distribution. Whether that's on CD or iTunes or like what the Wu Tang Clan did with their "ego in a golden box" release. 

While the music label model worked in the physical world (it's easy to lock up a physical something behind a physical lock), it's much harder (really impossible) to overcome two fundamental changes in our society.  The change of the storage of information from the physical to the virtual and expansion of technology worldwide. 

Snowden is a perfect example.  He took information that people really wanted to be controlled (more than Lars ever did) and was able to release it relatively easily. That's the problem with information (or misinformation) is that the virtual world has no physical barriers.  And the nature of the Internet is to make sure packets get to their end destination reliably (another disclaimer, my day job is being a telecom engineer).  Add the human element of "someone should hear/know this" and you have a world where everything and anything information wise can be leaked. 

So we now have a world which in two decades went from an information market that was physical (and easy to control) to a virtual one that is impossible to control.  And you want to somehow find a method to change all of this to control its distribution because "you are the artist"?

What you (and I, and everyone else) are creating is information. Whether it's a song, or a post at stupid in the morning, these bytes that I'm typing away at at 05:00 EDT (thanks insomnia...always happens prior to a cold) are no longer in my control once I hit enter. It's akin to saying "don't look at me but look at me but only when I say so". Once I hit enter (or sooner than that since everything is accessible in the digital world), I can't stop the message from being copied/mocked/printed/used in semaphore.  

The world has changed (for the better) since the physical barriers of information control are falling to the wayside.  This is a good thing. I'm sorry that your business model didn't hold up to what you thought it would. And while you might not have the chops or desire to stay pro (I definitely didn't) the tools available now are beyond what we had in recording studios just two decades ago (hmm...similar timeframes). :-) there are two concepts. the way things are, and the way things should be different. there are many parallel universes we could easily have found ourselves in had human decisions been just a little different, and we still have that power to shape the future. "well...i can get this for free pretty easily and that's the way it is" is only half the discussion. the way things "ought" to be always has to be discussed. 

there's also a big difference between the way things are and the way things HAVE to be. there is no rule in the universe that says the world we live in is the natural, optimal equilibrium. there is so much room for new systems, new methods, new policies, new business models. i don't think CDs are coming back, i never said that. i don't think the old models still works, i never said that. but principles of art and human rights don't change. when systems become contrary to principles, we need to look for ways to reconcile them. artists should have the right to create and profit from their art with protections in place for their creative rights. just like businesses should have the right to sell their product without protections from being ripped off. these are long established principles that are not necessarily dependent on technology. the application of them changes, the laws need to adapt, but the principles don't. No problem, let's adapt the laws to ensure artists are protected.

That means every piece of information needs to be documented as far as ownership. Do you own every piece of software on your machine?  What about your laptop?  Maybe you infringed on someone's IP by copying slightly more than "fair use" guidelines would allow.  Who does the accounting of this?  A centralized governmental system?  OUtsource to various private firms?  Have you ever tried to manage software on a enterprise scale?  Now imagine pushing that to the general public.

How do you manage disputes?  The court system?  Arbitration?  You think things are messed up now (especially with DMCA disputes).  Now lets take that to the next level...

Here's the thing....
Suing your customers tends to piss them off.
Treating everyone like criminals tends to piss everyone off.
Treating everyone like criminals tends to make them act like criminals.

The problem isn't who owns the material, it's the idea that once you put something out on the internet that you can control what happens every step of the way.   Lars didn't put anything out on the internet. You're being obtuse, and throwing thorny-sounding issues around to try and shut down the discussion because it's "too hard". Lars didn't sue his fans. There are absolutely changes that could be made, both in the marketplace and legally, to improve the system for artists. I can safely say that without having to solve every arbitrary logistical detail you make up. Lmao "especially as a musician." Time to give up music kiddo. Not going anywhere with that attitude. That concert in Vancouver was the filming of Through the Never, a movie/music video.  It was an interesting experiment, though I'm not sure that it was a profitable one. I will only disagree the point regarding the time between albums. Other groups like Tool have had huge breaks between releases, and they still get bought. Hell, it's been nearly a decade since 10,000 days was released, and their fans have gone apeshit about rumors of them being in the studio. I will concede that some Tool fans are more like a Cult of Maynard, though. So Metallica isn't Dethklok? Oh bravo!!!!! Yes, there are legitimate ethical reasons to say piracy hurts the copyright owner's right to decide what and how and where they want to distribute what they own.... and it's also their right to choose to give it away if they have the sense to see when that too is appropriate.

However, and I think you're already pointing to this:  Metallica are largely to blame for their own financial mismanagement and piracy is really just a canard... the real problem is that they didn't have the sense to negotiate better terms on their recording contract, tried to get out of it many years ago and failed, and touring is a chore for them because so much of what they've done for so many years involved masking Lars' screwups with engineering trickery....

They were really angry at Elektra, and at one point claimed to have had a verbal agreement with Elektra's Senior VP which never materialized once he left and they couldn't escape their contract so they had to fulfill their obligations and deal with the hand they were dealt ...

As a recording artist or artists, you have to really learn to manage your funds properly and not get into the endless pit of advance pooling, and they didn't and it's as simple as that. Death Magnetic was their last album for Warner Brothers. Which they switched to years ago, they are now free of any binding contracts. 

 Yes, I was mostly talking about what got Lars up in a bind about Napsster back in the 90s when they were still with WEA.  But they're basically self-financing... and given their past financial mismanagement I think this will be the nail in their coffin as it is for a lot of bands that arent prepared for that level of responsibility with zero guidance.

The problem is that they didn't embrace the internet when they should have and now everyone that would be their bread and butter is too soured by them... that and they cannot produce a decent sounding album if their life depended on it (and now it does, because touring is a chore for a drummer who couldn't hold a steady beat if you hit him in the head with a metronome).  Death Magnetic was utterly awful. Not to mention the whole impetus for Metallica fighting back against P2P was him hearing "I Disappear" on the radio before they had even finished recording the final version of the song. If I were an artist and someone gave everyone a copy of my half finished piece for free, I'd be pissed too.  Dr. Dre hasn't released anything to boycott.
 Except his headphones, which statistically are the second WORST pair of headphones on the market. Go ahead and google this if you don't believe me.  Wow. How did I forget his headphones? There goes my Detox joke. I bet the knockoff Beats at the flea market are better than the real ones. I have never had a chance to listen to anything with them though, but I trust how bad you say they suck.  "make a dark man blush" 

Ah, the elusive black Metallica fan. I'm glad to have met you even only so briefly.  THANK YOU. From one realistic person to another. Hahaha, I love how you justify Metallica suing. Ridiculous. I come from a family of musicians. Several of us have produced albums, spent thousands upon thousands on studio time, probably hundreds of thousands on equipment over the years. Etc. etc. But I remember when Napster came out (and this is when I was still in highschool), I was downloading the shit out of music. My Dad was awestruck at the ease of getting his music out there. He kept telling me how he would have killed for an app like that when he was younger and touring and recording with his bands (one of the ones he quit went on to be real big too, he had to quit because he couldn't tour because of us kids). The only people who were ever being hurt by the digital movement were the fat-cats. The bands who were already famous and the big labels who were losing money on sales. The small bands, or the bands trying to get their first albums out - Napster wasn't hurting shit.

So sorry, but no, most bands that spent tens of thousands of dollars producing an album would not have sued napster. It's the greedy millionaires who could calculate their lost revenue as percentages of millions who were the ones real butthurt about it. Oh no, I can't afford my gold-plated shark tank :_( QQ, Give me a break. This comment gave me some faith in common sense back, thank you :) 30 year old Metallica fans unite!  Form of: Milkshake! nice try, Lars Yea but it was fucking Lars, who even before this whole Napster drama was an annoying prick.  well if they couldn't afford to play their own shows then they should have stopped playing them.  Piracy aside, If you can't pay to do something then don't do it.  When most fans say they sold out/stopped being good after the black album you have to stop and think about how that came out almost a quarter century ago, that's a long time for any band to have that stigma of being sell outs/past their prime. 

Add on top of that the whole Napster thing almost 15 years ago (not saying positive or negative) and see how many people again stopped listening to or buying their music because of perceived greediness and being out of touch with their fans. 

You add people not liking them as fanatically anymore and how they're now hemorrhaging money dethklok style and of course they are going to be in the red.

Doesn't really come as a surprise when they haven't come out with a new studio album in almost 7 years (unless you count whatever LuLu was and that's a whole other pile of them shitting on fans, calling critics basement dwellers)

Looks like some point soon they will either file bankruptcy or just fade from the public eye and retire with some dignity. If neither of those things maybe they will scale it back and start playing shows/making decisions that won't send them to the poor house. [deleted] I can't find any proof that they sued their fans, just Napster.  I didn't look very hard though. Source? &gt;Christ dude, that's a hell of a lot of historical revisionism

Oh the irony...

&gt;Metallica sued their --fans--for doing what was then the modern equivalent of taping a song off the radio. Period. The End. Full stop.

Metallica **never** sued their fans. Period. The End. Full stop.

Stop spreading bullshit. [deleted] He didn't say that they made no money from album sales. 

And it's good you wouldn't sue, but considering this was the early 2000's and streaming music wasn't a thing yet, there was literally no other way to make money from album sales besides physical copies at that point. Did you bother to read WHY he sued Napster, or are you just quoting things I said when its convenient for you? [deleted] Except it's not mainly about piracy. The only reason Metallica got so popular was because they encouraged people to spread bootlegs of their shows. It was really important for them to get their music out there and then they turned around and started suing the fans once they wanted more money.

Then you have the younger generation like mine. I was around 13 at the time of Napster. At the time we didn't have much money so Napster was amazing for us to discover music without putting money on a album that might or might not be good. We still bought CDs because there were no portable MP3 players at the time but thanks to Napster we knew which ones to buy or not buy. We didn't know it was illegal but it did help us build higher quality CD collections. Once they started to sue fans and shut down Napster everyone I knew who were fans turned their backs at them forever. Even to this day most of them still hate Metallica with a passion. A few of them are even in touring bands today. Metallica planted that seed and it was over for them. Yeah, they got exposure originally because of bootlegs. Bootlegs that they expressly wanted spread around to get their name out there. Which goes right back to Lars' ultimate point of it being the artist's decision how their music is distributed. If they want it put out for free, fine. If they want it sold for ludicrous prices nobody will ever pay, fine.  The amount of bull-headedness and bias against Metallica here is off the charts. Thanks for being on the fringe. Hopefully one day people will come around. Good morning, Lars! &gt; His reasons behind it were very clear: Nobody should be able to decide how an artists music is distributed but them.

Doesn't that seem ridiculous to you yet, in the age of mashups and memes?

We are awash with free and cheap culture, and that is a good thing. Shawn Fanning is a hero. He made the world we live in.

 &gt; Nobody should be able to decide how an artists music is distributed but them.

Sure they should be able to decide how their music is sold, but we're not selling it. We're sharing it. a painter doesn't get to take my photo of his painting off of my facebook wall. 

Edit: And I understand how people can look at napster as a distribution tool, but it really wasn't and didn't intend to be. It was a p2p file sharing service. Napster wasn't distributing anything, I was. If people were gathering in the park and duplicating copyrighted poems to give to people, you wouldn't call the city a distributor. That's the power of the people, we don't need the corporations to open the door and guard the gate for us. Back then all we needed was a guy with some investors, and now all we need is a guy with a torrent tracker. 

Metallica went after the little people, the fans. Me and theoretically you. That was the greedy part. Suing napster might have been his legal right, but extorting thousands from every kid they could find with a cable modem was sinister. The letters, the lawsuits with teams of lawyers, in order to make an example out of 14 year old Johnny... It was jaw-droppingly stupid and did nothing to further his goal.  I didn't get kicked off Napster for Neil Young or Dr. Dre albums though. Sorry, you lose my respect, you lose my support. Quit being a bitch apologist. Thanks for this. It's basically "Napster blah blah" and "Lars is a dick" in *every* Metallica thread, anywhere. 

Metallica isn't really a band any more, it's a business and the band members aren't calling the shots - and they haven't been for a very, very long time. The one thing that showed that very clearly was an interview with Jason from a while back.

I still enjoy their music, though. Fortunately, I can separate that from all the business bullshit. I think this story is actually proof of the opposite, that Metallica isn't a business, it's a band. Well obviously it is a business in some capacity, they turn over an insane amount of money, but if they were being completely controlled by business mentality you think they'd be losing money? Instead it looks more like guys in a band out of control with their money, doing way too many random-ass projects instead of doing an album tour cycle. They wanted to make a film, because they were like why the fuck not? They wanted to play in Antarctica, because why the fuck not? They wanted to make a weird album with Lou Reed that obviously no one's going to get, because why the fuck not, we can fund it right? That to me sounds like the opposite of being controlled by a business mentality. Well, you know, someone could have talked them into doing all those random-ass projects... Sure, but my point is, those don't really seem like the kind of projects that come from someone who knows what they're doing in terms of business decisions. It doesn't take a whole lot to realise none of those projects were gonna make much money. Lulu might've been profitable, if it hadn't been so weird. The Antarctica thing was just for notoriety. Through the Never was probably really expensive to make, IIRC they partially funded that one out of pocket. This seems a lot more like the kind of shit I would want to do if I was in the biggest metal band in the world for 20-odd years and was getting a little bored of album-tour-rinse-repeat. I think you're right in that respect.

The business-part of my response was partly aimed at the fact that Metallica isn't just about four guys and a small crew in a tour bus any more. They have a huge organization with people surrounding them, all dependent on the band to provide them with an income. 

They'll have to tour until their arms fall off, so to speak, because of all those people and they know they have that responsibility. Nonsense. It is really quite simple. The old way of doing business in the industry is dead. Metallica turned fans into enemies instead of waiting for the landscape to develop. We moved to subscription based unlimited music, but they would rather bankrupt the people who would support them.

I pirated everything in that era and now that there is a reasonable content delivery method I pay and support them. Lars was looking for alimony and it was disgusting. Well, according to celebrity net worth,  Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield are worth about 175 million dollars each.     
Robert Trujillo is worth about 15 million dollars and Kirk Hammett is worth about 70 million dollars.     
(who knows where the numbers come from though)     

Maybe it's Metallica Inc. that is in the red?
 They need to take that red and make it fade to black... Can't be their online merchandise shop -- last time I checked they were still charging $99 for shipping and handling a poster. maybe they can hook up with the singer of creed and put together some sort of candlelit, canned corn and porridge dinner.  Maybe Lars can sell one of his gold plated shark tanks. I will tell you why this is nothing exciting: What did they do since 2010 to make money? Well they tour around 24/7 but that is all... Their last album came out in 2008 so they wont make too much money from that. But their costs? 32 Million for that movie, it was a project they had the idea for a long time, and of course that couldnt make any profit. Then they made their own Orion festival 2 times which isnt cheap either. No wonder they are in the red... This is rubbish. There is absolutely no way that they are in the red The corporate entity *Metallica* can be running at a loss in recent years, while the individual members could still have tons of cash saved away. Exactly.

Not going to be seeing any of them collecting unemployment benefits any time soon They are "now". Yeah if their accounts haven't been squirreling away their cash from the black album, then they are idiots.  Accordingly? I think he combined allegedly and reportedly...accordingly is not right though. Accordingly to you! Accordingly is definitely a word....just not the one he was looking for. I'm laughing too hard at this. Sometimes you see shit like this on Reddit and realize that large swathes of the population, even the relatively computer savvy reddit users, are just fucking uneducated. or maybe they had a brain fart and the resulting typo is indicative of that rather than deep-seated aggressive stupidity. Bullshit. They dumb as fuck obviously. Not allowed any errors in life.  what said! My boss calls me a dumbfuck every time he deposits my paycheck. There are people on reddit with another first language you know. why is this asshole upvoted? You made three unfounded assumptions that ultimately result in a logical fallacy, and you want to talk about people potentially being uneducated?  Eh, using a computer often doesn't make one savvy. I would consider Reddit users on par with those that use twitter or instagram. possibly english is not the OP's primary language I'm confused because I keep hearing that happy by Pharrell Williams was the most popular song on Spotify and was the most played song as well and that had only brought in less than $5,000 in profits. How is it possible that Kendrick is pulling in more than that? That story was about plays of Happy on Pandora, not Spotify.
Story: http://fusion.net/story/33442/pharrell-made-less-than-3000-from-43-million-pandora-streams-of-happy/ Isn't Pandora random while users on Spotify can choose what songs/albums they listen to? Pandora could have just easily bumped up the number of plays and stations it was played on. Just a thought. Yes, you're correct, which is a key point in why artists *can't pull their music off of pandora* and that likely plays a role in the tiny amount of profit they see from pandora plays. There are laws and regulations governing radio stations which mean artists don't get a choice in which station plays their songs, so long as it's widely available. Pandora, being a "radio station" is governed by these same laws, but spotify, being a "music steaming service" is not. mmm i love steamed music It's a much healthier option. **L A W Y E R E D** Well you could have a Pharrell station that would play Happy, and I'm sure you could have a station of highly popular songs. You can also refine your personal stations to your liking. I wouldn't be surprised if there was some part of Pandora's system that would make Happy be played even more often though like you are suggesting. It's rigged man. RIGGED!!@! Rigamortis The difference is that's Pharrell himself rather than the label and everyone else that is getting paid off of it. Plus I think that was actually less that $3k off of Pandora streams, and that was only the songwriter royalties that were being talked about. That's not the only revenue stream that he has in that case. Regardless, this article isn't talking about everyone else who is getting paid, they're assuming Kendrick is making everything off of these streams.

Edit: Just to clarify some of the additional revenue streams, since Pandora is a non-interactive digital streaming service, any plays on there would generate digital performance royalties that would be payed out through SoundExchange. 45% of those royalties go directly to the featured performer (Pharrell), so right off the bat he'd be making about the same as his songwriting royalties there. This is the earnings off more than one song 900,000/5,000 = 180.  180 = 90 x 2. Kendrick was a 90s Kid but had 2 personalities. Illuminati confirmed.  Only 90s kids will get this.  while that's correct math, it doesn't mean anything It means you would need 180 songs as popular as Happy on Spotify to make 900,000 dollars... or 17 songs on a different site with different payout rates What does that have to do with how many royalties Kendrick supposedly got from Spotify? None of this has anything to do with anything else.  Kendrick put 17 songs on Spotify and made over $900,000 or whatever.  Pharrell put one song on Pandora and made less than $3,000, and that number is from songwriter royalties only. A check he received long after the release of 1 song for 1 time period of streaming...  Did Kendrick Lamar actually make this money himself, or did his record company make this much money? I feel like this title is a bit disingenuous, it's like saying that a particular artist got every single dollar from every sale of their album. That's not the case, this money is going to change hands many times before the artist sees it, and it will likely be much less.

Also, this is all dependent on whether they used Spotify's royalty calculator correctly. Yeah, I'm sure there are a good few people on Kendrick's roll that need to be paid too, musicians and backing singers and so on. I remember reading something Beck said (and granted Beck is probably not making anywhere near as much as Kendrick) that the money he makes from Spotify is barely enough to pay his band. I don't think Spotify is as profitable as it might seem.  Presumably, the musicians and backing singers were all works-for-hire, and would be paid a flat fee to do the recordings. They don't receive royalties, just the one time payment at the beginning. Yeah, that's been pretty standard since the beginning of hired musicians Right, that's why I'm making that assumption there's not a shot in hell that any musician or backup singer is making any royalties. absolutely never. the people who will see some of this money are the songwriters, publishers, kendrick's record company, and kendrick. the money will be severely diluted by the record company alone before it goes to him. Some artists don't allow spotify to stream their music because they don't make shit. Radiohead and Taylor Swift come to mind. Never thought I'd put those two in the same sentence.  Radiohead has a bunch of music on spotify. Maybe you're thinking of the Beatles? Oh, you know what? I think I'm thinking about Thom Yorke's solo stuff. Unless I'm wrong about that too...in which case don't listen to me.  Thom Yorke pulled Atoms For Peace from Spotify, and I think the only Radiohead album not on there is In Rainbows. reason being in rainbows isn't owned by a record company their previous records were done under contract with capitol, and the band doesn't get to decide if its on spotify or not (because the record company owns those recordings not radiohead). In Rainbows and their most recent record, Id venture to guess, are both not on the service because Thom yorke and nigel godrich abhor it. This. Not sure how $36k would feel to an artist after seeing the first sum. This dick ain't free!

Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton that made you rich, now my dick ain't free June for vinyl? Nooooo!  Really that long? Fuck.  This. King Kunta did it again  King Kunta put me in a body bag. :) [**I DON'T WANT YOU MONKEY MOUTH MOTHERFUCKERS SITTING IN MY THRONE AGAIN**](http://i.imgur.com/9g3A80t.jpg) I GOTTA BONE TA PICK I have never been a massive vinyl fan, but I feel like this type of album is perfect for a vinyl release. Why? I'm not /u/NBP3, but the album has a retro sound that draws a lot of influence from jazz and funk, so owning it on vinyl would fit in to the somewhat 'classic' feel of the album. Also, it's an album that exists as one cohesive project and doesn't really have any 'single' type songs. So it's an album where you would actually want to put it on and hear it from start to finish, which makes it well-suited to the vinyl format where you're listening to it at home in its entirety. well said The vinyl crackle at the beginning of the album put it on my mind too. Except for the three times you'll have to get up to flip sides Because he likes it.   Hell yeah im stoked for the vinyl. I just started my hip hop collection and I want this one like mad Haha that line is stuck in my head now. 900k isn't cool.  You know what's cool? 9 billion? You better lawyer up asshole, because I'm not coming back for 30% I'M COMING BACK FOR EVERYTHING. 900 billion ICE COOL ALRIGHTALRIGHTALRIGHTALRIGHTALRIGHTALRIGHT I'm cooler than a polar bear's toe nails Seam Parker played by Justin timberlake You? More than Taylor Swift She can sell albums without spotify. Its worth it to protest their rates. 

I dont really follow the logic of why reddit is so mad over this. If you can massively sell albums without spotify, why would any artist ever do it? Well Spotify deters people from pirating music. Before I started using Spotify I pirated all the music on my phone. I love Spotify though and no longer pirate music because of it. Except the albums they don't stream, such as De La Soul's albums.  Don't get me wrong I absolutely adore having Premium but when I want to listen to an album and it's not available on their service its a given that I'll pirate it. Yeah, Spotify is missing a few of my favorites, like Acid Rap.  Acid Rap is still a free mixtape right? Yeah, they just took off Flying Lotus's 1983, so now I'm stuck with YouTube until I decide to buy the album, which will be soon. 

And Don't get me started on Tokimonstas Midnight Menu being absent... Why not just buy them? I feel as though most Taylor Swift fans aren't the type to pirate music to begin with

edit: alright fellas I get it. i purposely put "most" in there because it obviously isn't true for all of you. can we stop pretending we're special now? Really?  I'm guessing &lt;18yo girls are her demo and when I was that age I'd choose free over paid every single time.   My nephew straight up rips audio from youtube rather than buy a single track. Everyone i know who listens to taylor swift couldn't pirate if they wanted too. This is it. It's not that people who are 18 are the listeners. It's that her demographic generally consists of people who can't even connect a printer to a PC. It's mostly high school girls who listen to top 40 charts and have their parents' credit card linked to iTunes. Most people struggle to connect to printers, FUCK PRINTERS. As someone who considers himself extremely competent with tech, FUCK PRINTERS. Most ass backwards, shoddy interface, fragile pieces of garbage tech I've ever used. I'm not totally technologically handicapped I've built a PC, ran Linux a few times, jail broken a few things and I still can't get anywhere with the printers my family gets.  Dude... I was just telling a coworker that I can't believe that with all our advanced technology our printers continue to be the most difficult thing to operate. Its insane. Like wtf? It MUST be a conspiracy.  I work in IT, I fucking hate hearing about broken printers. I think you're vastly underestimating the popularity of Taylor Swift.  You seriously don't think high school girls don't know how to download music? Not in 2015 man Times have changed. Things like Limewire and what not put that stuff at the forefront for a while. Now, a lot of kid's main computing devices are their phones or tablets. I have a 15 year old niece and she tells me that there are a couple of people in her class that know how to get music for free but they're all kind of weird. Despite more kids being comfortable with technology compared to 20 years ago, fewer of them are actually competent when it comes to technology. There used to be a barrier to access the it came to using computers and if you didn't have a certain level of competence then you simply could use one. Modern UIs have taken all the heavy lifting out of being a user. Even people that have an aptitude simply don't bother since they don't have to. 

Why bother learning about torrents and trackers, possibly having to open and forward ports on your router and/or firewall, make sure that the client you use isn't blacklisted on the trackers you are using and a half dozen other factors. Much easier to open iTunes, search for the song you like and click buy. 

Gen x/y are the most technically adept generation and that is not going to change because there is no reason for it to change. Millennials and future generations will have their share of computer scientists and some of them will be more brilliant than those who came before but , as a whole, they will mostly be simple users with no idea what goes on under the hood.  Seriously, this. It's kind of weird to hear people talk about how great it is that kids are growing up with technology, but the problem is that we dumbed technology down so hardcore that even toddlers can use an iPad. They don't understand technology, so much as they understand "press button x, get y result." It's basically magic as far as most of them are concerned. Shit, even large swathes of X/Y genners are largely computer illiterate, in that they probably couldnt put one together by themselves and wouldn't feel comfortable changing something like a system setting or altering a registry value in windows. 

It's great that more people are accepting of technology, instead of fearing it, but because we keep trying to make it as idiot-proof as possible, idiots are going to continue to be the target demographic. Not literal idiots, but people who really have no time, patience, or desire understand any of the deeper fundamentals of computing aside from touch driven interfaces with user controls a literal baby could understand.  [deleted] I find printers pretty ridiculous to be fair. I'd rather write something out by hand than print a lot of the time. Or I'll go to the library and use theirs rather my own because that fucking thing hates me.  That's a fucking load of assumptions for a musical preference

It's not: you like Taylor Swift? You suck at technology and computers! Doesn't really matter, in almost every class there is that one guy that can get you all the music you want, if you give him a USB-Drive.  Yeah, because if there's anything we know it's that high schoolers are the least tech savvy bunch out there and have never heard of this thing called *torrenting*. That's why no one in high school torrented in the 90's!

*/sarcasm* Yeah but in the 90s if you wanted to do *anything* on the Internet you had to work for it.  This created a generation of kids who cut their teeth pirating stuff on FTP ratio servers and the like.

And no one torrented in the 90s, because Bittorrent wasn't released until 2001. I don't think the average kid in the 90s was doing all that. It's always been a subculture and there's certainly a subculture of kids who are interested in computers now. oh well, we had kazaa, napster... :x Taylor Swift fans, not teenagers. Oh yeah, compared to us geniuses who know how to goolge "how to pirate" and spend 5 minutes.

Pirating today is nothing more than downloading a program, going on a site, pressing download and waiting. Everyone who wants to can learn to do it in way less than an hour. everyone knows how to pirate music since ipods. if they don't they know someone. Just cause her fanbase is largely female doesnt mean they don't know how to use a computer or the internet People on reddit not thinking their special and the source of everything great and original? Fat chance. They act like the bitch ain't go platinum.  You can call me the black beard of t swift albums Taylor Swift sold like 8 million albums. She didn't suffer from Pirating at all. &gt;If you can massively sell albums without spotify, why would any artist ever do it?

Because something is better than nothing, and most times spotify listens does not equate to album sales. I won't ever buy a Taylor Swift album, I simply don't like her music that much. However I will listen to her songs if they come up on spotify. With spotify she is getting something, without it she gets nothing. Multiply that by millions of people/listens and suddenly you are making a decent amount of money. Spotify says Swift made $2 million, Swift says it was actually $500k, ether way that is nothing to scoff at. 

&gt;I don't really follow the logic of why reddit is so mad over this.

Two main reasons.

1. Artists equating spotify listens to direct sales. As I have previously states spotify listens does not necessarily detract from album sales. Spotify is simply another form of revenue on top of album sales, not a direct competitor. 

2. Hearing insanely rich people complain they are not being paid enough is annoying. They may be correct but it is still annoying to hear. Swift made $500k-2 million from spotify last year. To the average person that is an insane amount of money and they would be ecstatic, so to hear a person complain about is irritating. Especially when her net worth is already around $200 million. She is not necessarily wrong, but that doesn't make it any less annoying. 


Spotify is (on average) a net positive for artists, it brings in revenue (in Norway streaming services account for 2/3 of all music sales), decreases the rate of piracy (music piracy in Norway has dropped 82% since 2008), and introduces listeners to new artists they would have otherwise missed. I alone have purchased dozens of songs and albums from artists I found on Spotify or Pandora.

http://time.com/3590670/spotify-calculator/ the fact that taylor swift only made 500k from spotify is pretty terrifying to any new/up-and-coming artist. She's undoubtedly one of the top 5 biggest artists in the world. 500k is fucking nothing for someone of her level Now think about a band like Beach House They have to be making like 5k a year from Spotify And that's supposed to support multiple people (because they're a band, not a pop-star).

Then you can understand why T-swift scoffs at 500k. Because its a pathetically low amount of money for one of the biggest artists in the world (and therefore probably one of the most streamed artists on spottily) to make per year. Yes, compared to her yearly income ($65 million) Taylor Swift $500K is relatively small. But it is not as if that is her only income, it is only a portion. So when you say Beach House is only making $5k from spotify that could be true, plus album sales, plus concerts, plus merchandising, plus licensing, plus other streaming services. So no spotify alone is not supporting multiple people, that would be like me trying to support myself only working 1 day a week.  

Spotify and other streaming services is basically a bonus on top of their normal revenue streams. Its is bringing in money they would have never received otherwise from people that would never have bought their album or merchandise. So Taylor Swift is basically getting a $500K bonus that she would never have received otherwise. 

Additionally spotify increases the listening audience for smaller/less popular artists (lest be honest the radio only plays a few popular artists). Within the last year I have found probably about 20 artists that I love on spotify/pandora. I went out and bought their music, this something that never would have happened without a streaming service. And on top of that it drastically reduces pirating. 

All of this means that in the end of the day spotify is a net benefit for artists, the only augment artists can really make is that they want the benefit to be bigger (aka more money). I'd like to add to that my anecdotal experience; I bought maybe one, two albums a year before Spotify, as I listened to such a high amount/variety of music that I would never be able to afford a fraction of that in legitimate copies; my mp3 collection measured 25-30k songs, easily, at times.

When the iTunes store got big I started spending a little money, but the DRM was killing me and I hated the software. The only model that seems to work with me is Spotifys and places where you can listen to entire songs unlimited times before deciding to get a DRM-free copy (soundcloud, bandcamp etc). Nowadays, the only albums I pirate are those not available on Spotify or otherwise available without DRM at a reasonable price.

I'd stop pirating audiobooks too, if it weren't for Audible forcing DRM on publishers/authors; seriously, Amazon, let them decide for themselves. Apple removed DRM from the store. What about authors who are fine with DRM? Do you psy for their books? Do you buy physical copies? Or do you steal their content? &gt; I won't ever buy a Taylor Swift album, I simply don't like her music that much. However I will listen to her songs if they come up on spotify.

Hear, hear. She's probably one of the artists that this applies to more than anyone. My entire music collection is mostly hard/indie/classic rock with some hip-hop and just about zero Top 40. I would call it a pretty "masculine" collection. But, I of course have my guilty pleasures. The *Pitch Perfect* soundtrack, a handful of Kelly Clarkson, Lady Gaga or vintage Madonna. 

I caught a few of Taylor Swift's new songs on the radio, and damn they're catchy...enough so that I'd want to listen to them somewhat occasionally. Searched on Spotify, saw her album wasn't available, and that was that. Since the entirety of my music "collection" is streaming, or stuff I like so much that I physically buy it (a category to which T-Swizzle does not belong), that's the end of my listening relationship, and Taylor Swift ends up with zero of my dollars instead of less of my dollars than her label thinks she deserves.
