We show up to the event at 8pm and proceed to start taking down as soon as the gates are closed.  There were about 225 tents total, 3 stages, 400 tables, 500 chairs, tons of miscellaneous cooking equipment (Fridges, freezers, deep fryers, grills), and about 175 55-gallon water barrels. \n\nThere was also a portable carnival set-up at the far end of the festival.  The people that bring the portable rides are notorious for being late to pick-ups and having extended timelines. \n\nAnyways, we knew that this job would take a LONG time to take down, even with 6 trucks and 15 workers.  We worked straight through the night and eventually the sun started to come up, just as we were loading the last of our trucks.  The supervisor with our crew was a very cool guy and told us all to take a break as soon as we got out last truck loaded.  Most of the guys went to the diner that was just down the block.  But I took one of the pickup trucks and drove up and down the block with another worker to ensure that we had picked up all of our equipment.  \n\nWhen we got to the end of the festival, we noticed that the carnival ride guys has just showed up to start taking down their equipment.  We decided to walk over to the guys and ask for a turn on the rides.  Sure enough, one of the guys told us that he was going to have to wait another hour for the rest of his crew to show up, so he gave us free rides on EVERY. SINGLE. RIDE.

This is done by a process called [photolithography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography).\n\nThe other is called surface micromachining, where thin layers of the fabrication material (mostly silicon, I believe) are piled on top of the substrate to create the shape, and other bits are etched in. \n\nEtching is done using processes like [photolithography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography), among others - using a surface material that changes its properties to be soluble on being exposed to light. If the light is applied in a shape, you can make that shape be soluble; that can be dissolved in something called a developer, leaving the inverse of that shape in the material. That masking material then protects the silicon below in that exact shape from whatever actual etching process you use: nitric acid is an example.\n\nThe specific service that they use for both is called [PolyMUMPs](http://www.memscap.com/products/mumps/polymumps).\n\nEdit: the site seems to have been hugged to death, so the relevant content:\n\n&gt; **PolyMUMPs**\n\n&gt; ...\n \n&gt; Many universities use the service today as a way to teach beginning MEMS design at the undergraduate level, using PolyMUMPs as the \"example\" process. In this environment, classes will study MUMPs\u00ae during the semester then submit a design and get chips back in time for the end of the semester. Another use for PolyMUMPs is as a benchmarking tool for software models and statistical studies, where theories are validated with measured data from actual, fabricated chips. PolyMUMPs chips also serve as a standard building block for larger scale systems, where the MEMS chip is only one piece of the overall system. PolyMUMPs' well-understood properties and predictable outcomes are advantageously leveraged to make MEMS the \"black box\" fixed-component.\n&gt; \n&gt; **About The Process**\n\n&gt; PolyMUMPs is a three-layer polysilicon surface and bulk micromachining process, with 2 sacrificial layers and one metal layer. Eight mask levels create 7 physical layers. The minimum feature size in PolyMUMPs is 2um. Devices that can be made in PolyMUMPs include: Acoustics(microphones), Sensors, Accelerometers, Micro-fluidics, and Display Technologies.\n\n***\n\n[Here's a GIF](http://i.imgur.com/xYhP37O.gifv) of it being used; I also [posted](/r/gifs/comments/2xl4or/this_is_a_nanoinjector_a_microscopic_machine/) it to /r/gifs.\n\n[Here's a video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djH8AM2diyE)!", "gilded": 1, "score": 3396, "created": 1425228273.0},{"body": "Is there an ELI5 version?", "gilded": 0, "score": 538, "created": 1425234058.0},{"body": "Essentially, they make the machine by cutting into a silicon wafer and etching out the shapes needed, or they add lots of little structural silicon layers and etch the shapes into those.\n\nThe etching is done using processes like [photolithography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography), among others - using a special surface material which becomes dissolve-able in something called a developer when it is exposed to light.

In the video this shape is a hole. It's called \"Anchor\" because if you don't draw anything for this layer, the next layers will just fall off the surface at the end.\n\nPoly 1: More structural material.\n\nPOLY1: Again, you provide a 2D drawing for this step as well, this time it's used to etch away shapes off the Poly1 layer. In the video this is a simple rectangle.\n\n2nd Oxide: Another sacrificial layer. \n\nPOLY1_POLY2_VIA: Another 2D drawing, this one etches away only the 2nd Oxide layer.

This is done by a process called [photolithography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography).\n\nThe other is called surface micromachining, where thin layers of the fabrication material (mostly silicon, I believe) are piled on top of the substrate to create the shape, and other bits are etched in. \n\nEtching is done using processes like [photolithography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography), among others - using a surface material that changes its properties to be soluble on being exposed to light. If the light is applied in a shape, you can make that shape be soluble; that can be dissolved in something called a developer, leaving the inverse of that shape in the material. That masking material then protects the silicon below in that exact shape from whatever actual etching process you use: nitric acid is an example.\n\nThe specific service that they use for both is called [PolyMUMPs](http://www.memscap.com/products/mumps/polymumps).\n\nEdit: the site seems to have been hugged to death, so the relevant content:\n\n&gt; **PolyMUMPs**\n\n&gt; ...\n \n&gt; Many universities use the service today as a way to teach beginning MEMS design at the undergraduate level, using PolyMUMPs as the \"example\" process. In this environment, classes will study MUMPs\u00ae during the semester then submit a design and get chips back in time for the end of the semester. Another use for PolyMUMPs is as a benchmarking tool for software models and statistical studies, where theories are validated with measured data from actual, fabricated chips. PolyMUMPs chips also serve as a standard building block for larger scale systems, where the MEMS chip is only one piece of the overall system. PolyMUMPs' well-understood properties and predictable outcomes are advantageously leveraged to make MEMS the \"black box\" fixed-component.\n&gt; \n&gt; **About The Process**\n\n&gt; PolyMUMPs is a three-layer polysilicon surface and bulk micromachining process, with 2 sacrificial layers and one metal layer. Eight mask levels create 7 physical layers. The minimum feature size in PolyMUMPs is 2um.

This method uses a hollow needle to pump a DNA-filled liquid into an egg cell nucleus, but that extra fluid causes the cell to swell and die 40 percent of the time.\n\nNow a multidisciplinary team of Brigham Young University scientists has developed a way to significantly reduce cell death when introducing DNA into egg cells. The researchers have created a microscopic lance that delivers DNA to the cells through electrical forces.\n\n\"Because DNA is naturally negatively charged, it is attracted to the outside of the lance using positive voltage,\" said Brian Jensen, BYU professor of mechanical engineering. \"Once we insert the lance into a cell, we simply reverse the polarity of the electrical force and the lance releases the DNA.\"\n\nBecause the lance is 10 times smaller and no extra fluid is used, the cells undergo significantly less stress compared to microinjection, and thus, have a higher survival rate. The researchers describe their \"metamorphic nanoinjection\" process in an article published today by Review of Scientific Instruments.\n\nCurrently the BYU researchers, which include microbiology professor Sandra Burnett and mechanical engineering professor Larry Howell, are using the technique to inject DNA into mouse zygotes (single-cell embryos consisting of a fertilized egg).\n\n\"The microinjection technology hasn't really changed over the last 40-50 years since it was invented,\" Burnett said. \"Not having to force liquid into the nuclei by shifting to a lance is a huge advantage. It not only increases the survival rate, but it also causes less damage for future development.\"\n\nIn research published in Transgenic Research, the team found that 77.6% of nanoinjected mouse zygotes proceeded to the two-cell stage of development as compared to 54.7% for microinjected zygotes.\n\nA major reason for creating transgenic animals is to research genetic or infectious diseases. By modifying the genes of a mouse to carry a human disease, researchers can generate data with insights into future treatments and therapies for those illnesses.\n\nOne of the BYU team's most significant findings is that it's possible to use the electrical forces to get DNA into the nucleus of a cell without aiming the lance into the pronucleus (the cellular structure containing the cell's DNA). This may mean that injections can be performed in animals with cloudy or opaque embryos.\n\n\"Such animals, including many interesting larger ones like pigs, would be attractive for a variety of transgenic technologies,\" Jensen said. \"We believe nanoinjection may open new fields of discovery in these animals.\"\n\nJensen said more efficient injections should also reduce the cost to create transgenic animals. Jensen's research is funded in part by the $400,000 awarded to him in 2011 through a National Science Foundation CAREER Award.\n\nQuentin Aten, a former PhD student at BYU now with Nexus Spine, LLC, served as the lead author on the research published in Review of Scientific Instruments.", "gilded": 0, "score": 6, "created": 1425238698.0},{"body": "150,000 years of human history and I am lucky enough to be alive during this time of scientific progress.

Hence their use of the incendiary device (which they clearly and fully described in their write-up) in the only test run that produced a fire. \n\nOf course any car would go explode on impact if there was an incendiary device attached to it set to go off at that point, but this is a fact that destroys the sensationalism of the story.\n\nBut it's better to think Ford is a murderous company than see the truth of the matter.", "gilded": 0, "score": 195, "created": 1426950403.0},{"body": "Thank you for this.
