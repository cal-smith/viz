[short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBdw60KWVVQ) [Inconsiderate bastard. I'm trying to internet here.](http://imgur.com/78jJTOz) It's kind of like that here. During earthquakes, we just get out of bed if something falls of a shelf. Cats and dogs are even more hardcore... they usually sleep through the whole event.  In Costa Rica, everyone is used to the tremors. So much so, one day it came by especially strong. The type of earthquake that would have the chandelier rocking, the wooden chairs clacking against the floor, the whole nine.

 Well, I'm taking a shit, when I see that the toilet paper falls on the ground and starts vibrating. Then the cabinets open and shampoos fall. 

 I only visit my country once a year or two. I had forgotten how an earthquake is a regular part of life there. 

So for a millisecond, my initial thought is, "fuck, this toilet paper is possessed. Poltergeist is haunting this bathroom is about to fuck my shit up." 

Finally, sense knocks into my head, I understand it's an earthquake and I get some sort of flashback to Japan 2012, which is irrelevant because I wasn't in Japan in 2012, well actually ever. 

At this point I fear my impending doom. 

I get up, pull my boxers and proceed to panic in the living room. My cousin is nonchalantly reading a book on the love seat. My uncle slurping up noodles. The furniture is looking like it's having a seizure. 
Everyone is chill, and I'm in my boxers, with shitty cheeks, ready to evacuate. 

EDIT: Thanks for the gold,!! I swear I won't let it get to my head, peasants. 
&amp; Thanks to /u/clownshoes69 I really appreciate that you liked my experience.  I get that. I've been to San Jose quite a lot during the last 4 years, and like clockwork, there is some small earthquake the day I arrive or the day I'm leaving. 

(I've been working for INS on it's trauma hospital)

BTW, I'm sorry about your bathroom experience! You know... shit happens.   Woah you must have some crazy experiences in that! Sometimes my stomach turns just looking at the local newspapers. 

Edit: Small world, didn't notice this was OP. Depending on the magnitude of the eruption this could send some waves to Puntarenas and most of the pacific coast.  Nope.. this volcano is inland, and Punta Arenas is about 1000 miles further south. Well, you've got a "Puntarenas" in Costa Rica as well. :) Yeah, usually when something happens in that zone of south america, our puntarenas feels it a couple hours later because if the current.  &gt;  I get some sort of flashback to Japan 2012, which is irrelevant because I wasn't in Japan in 2012

Best part. And double irrelevant because the big tsunami-triggering earthquake was in 2011. Since I live in Okinawa, I was obviously too far away to feel the quake. I was taking a shower and all of a sudden I heard the announcement speakers going crazy. It was unuasual because they normally don't put out announcements that early in the afternoon. Soon after alarms started sounding. Almost like a tornado siren. Apparently a tsunami warning was in effect. I dried myself off, went down stairs and turmed on the TV. I was not prepared for what I was about to watch over the next hour or so. Surreal, that's how I would describe it.  I just barely felt it in Gifu (thought I had vertigo despite sitting down), then right as my class of 5-year-olds starts the flood of alarms and emails from the weather service started coming in on my phone. Despite all that and showing my students the incoming maps of the earthquake's range, I, too, was not prepared for the TV coverage I watched when I got home a few hours later. Surreal is the perfect way to describe it. When that happened I was in my room just doing my things, then suddenly my mom calls me over and shows me the TV. I actually got chills I fucking loved your story. &gt; ready to evacuate. 

The ole double blow Sounds like most of the evacuation already took place. &gt; I get some sort of flashback to Japan 2012, which is irrelevant because I wasn't in Japan in 2012, well actually ever.

Best part. Reminds me of when I was in Lima-Peru in 2007 during the 3 minute 7.9 Richter's scale earthquake, I was doing my homework and it started, I was like "meh it'll stop" but it didn't it just got stronger so I went downstairs only to see the cars jumping around the garage and the floors were like waves.

The next day I found out my cousin was taking a shower during this whole event... He got out of it and put his shirt as pants and left the house in some state of mild panic. I'd have love to see him running like that haha. &gt; shirt as pants

So he put his legs through the shirt sleeves and ran outside?  I'd love to see that too, hilarious. Yeah, hahahahahaa. Makes sense. You gotta do something, can't be facing imminent death AND have your dick flopping in the wind. Priorities.  In Philly, when the DC quake happened in 2012 I was playing on my Xbox and my TV began shaking back and forth (its a flatscreen) and I start screaming earthquake telling my brother to get down stairs all whilst still on the mic. After it settled down my pals on the mic told me the next time I am having an earthquake, just mute my mic. 0 fucks were given that day by my friends.
EDIT: 2011 NOT 2012 I AM FORGETFUL OF YEARS "Goddamnit, I understand you're having a 6.7 earthquake but your lagging dude c'mon." I remember that. I was sitting on my porch and my chair started gently swaying back and forth. It was devastating.

2/10 would not shake like a Polaroid picture again.  Love the story. My Dad would tell me about his experience with earthquakes in El Salvador. Your story reminded me of how one time there, they got such bad tremors that he fell out of bed, broke his nose, and had a jar fall on top of him. Not the best wakeup call at two in the morning.  Hahaha thanks for that mental image! [ps the big earthquake/tsunami was 2011 in Japan, not 2012](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami) makes your post more funny though No problem! perfect experience to share. 

And see that, I was having a flashback to a country I've never visited to a year nothing happened. Clearly, my mind was blank lol.  You were already evacuating tho Well shit. &gt; I get some sort of flashback to Japan 2012, which is irrelevant because I wasn't in Japan in 2012, well actually never.

My favorite part &gt;Poltergeist is haunting this bathroom is about to fuck my **shit** up.

FIFY WTF... How do you deal with volcanoes then?

Potentially immediate danger? We kind of not build too close to them.  someone was smart enough not to repeat history... rip Pompeii  (sigh...)

F Ha, pussy... "live dangerously! Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius!" No ragrets We're real smart about that up here in Seattle. Seattle's problem is more being right on top of a fault line and next door to another, compounded with being right on top of Puget Sound and next door to the Pacific Ocean.  Well, at least there won't be lava. There will be lots of mud and debris. I used to live in Santiago. Definitley remember the frequent temblores. Good to hear from a Chileno. Cuidate po. This picture reminded me of a dream I had several months ago that I didn't remember until seeing this. There was a comet coming for Earth and valiantly decided I needed to make sure everyone on the internet knew what was happening.

Actually I think I just played Star Wars Battlefront II online (RIP) and had a casual conversation with someone, asking about how he was going to spend his final moments. We both played until the Earth was destroyed.

It was a good dream, thanks for stimulating my memory! And here we are, realizing we're still waiting for SWBF3. I think the lava in the picture reminds me of a basketball player who has just nailed a game-winning three-pointer. 

And who is also on fire, of course... [OP's reaction to said volcano judging by his comments ITT.](http://i.imgur.com/8qvLsPe.png) Kind of... [This one](http://static.diario.latercera.com/201206/1550676.jpg) a few years ago kicked up some adrenaline.  That's weird, this just looks like your standard "End of Days, Repent for Your Sins" apocalypse (Looks out the window)

"HONEEEEY! Where's the Bible?"
 "What?"

"Where is the bible!?"

"I...uh...put it away?"

"Where?"

"Why do you need to know?"

"I *need* it!"

"Uh uh! Don't you think about doing no praying do! We've been planning this evening for two months!"

Just immediately came to mind based off your comment. You tell me where my bible is woman! We are talking about the greater god! "Greater good!? I am your *wife*! I'm the greatest *good* you are EVER going to get!" That's incredible! Then Thor goes flying by in his chariot kicking some giant ass. "Honey never mind; I wasn't really into Catholicism anyway."  Honeeeyyy,  where's my viking helmet and battle axe? I have a date with Valhalla.  I read the last line in Robbaz's voice. For the corgies! Haha,  love that dude.  Gah-lori-hos!  If yoo ever see a norvegian, backing up in his caravan?
Facking run. Haha, well done on spelling out his accent so well.  HOONNEEEEYYY! WHERE IS MY SUPER-SUIT?? or Vegeta overdoing it. [AHAHA! J-JUST SMOKE AND MIRRORS, YOU SEE?](https://dreager1.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/agh.jpg) Kakarot! KAKA-CARROT-CAKE! The cool thing is that the connection almost certainly has  anthropological origins. Think in the context of people witnessing that shit before we knew much about volcanoes! Something you may have heard about in legends, but only was witnessed every few generations.  All of a sudden the mountain you've looked at every day FUCKING STARTS ON FIRE AND EXPLODES.  At every eruption, there are lightning storms because of the friction between the volcanic ash create a static charge and I ducks lightning. So it's very likely the one you captured also harbour lightning. That is a great picture though!

edit: I have no idea what I was trying to say.  &gt;I ducks lightening 

Your reflexes are legendary.

Edit: stupid auto correct is stupid. How very Alanis. It's times like these I wish I could upvote twice. You can duck lightning to avoid being zapped? Good to know.  Conducts? Nope. Time to move. Goddamn, yall need to quit trying to go super saiyan  Trying? Looks like at least one person succeeded.

EDIT: Wait... is /u/schmick from namek? Will /u/shmick be able to go super saiyan in time to save Chile? Will Volcanoe Buu plunge the world into eternal darkness? Will this volcanoe still be erupting 2 seasons from now? Find out on the next episode of Dragon Ball Z Perfeeeect.  Dude. That's pretty fuckin metal. It is eeh? neat! That....looks.....terrifying....  [Now bring the ring!](http://i.imgur.com/5aavqRu.jpg) looks like /r/photoshopbattles is leaking. One of the few types of leakages I approve of. What about anal? Anal leakage gets 2 thumbs down. That's too bad, when you could solve the problem with one thumb up. fuck i love the transient humor of reddit. who you callin a transient Now skeeter they ain't hurtin nobody.

I know, lens flares are bright as hell. https://i.imgur.com/VOnSfMC.jpg Animation of the eruption process. These guys got to upgrade the webcams.

**UPDATE**: We've [got video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwGWZB6gXoQ).  The music that played for the video sounds like something out if a Pokemon game. Excellent choice! It was 3am... the news network sound guy must have played the first thing he found.  That's the most generic news music I've ever heard. BreakingNews.wav Is there a genre for this type of music? I kind of want to listen to it all day now. Actually there is, well sort of. I'm not sure if there's a specific "genre" per se, but there's plenty of "generic news music" available  on stock audio sites. It's often listed under *"News &amp; Current Events"*.

Also, there's a ton of it on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_1HSeBAwm0). Thank you my blessed angel! Couldn't agree more.  Yea its like, victory music for Mario Kart or something. Like we're cheering it on as it awakes from its slumber and destroys everything. I want nothing more than for someone to actually recognize this song from something. ash and magmar guy are fighting in the volcano! Holy shit I climbed that sucker! From the looks of it that mountain blows. I think the cameras are actually decent, but they don't look like they are good at low light conditions.  Once it erupts, more light, much better resolution.

And just Wow.. Are there a bunch of people at risk from this?  It looks like there have been warnings for a while. No one at risk. Evacuation of the nearest town ended a few minutes ago. 

320x240 resolution, with one pic taken every 120s... and most of the pictures don't reach the server.

The animation I made it using a script I wrote to capture, resize, stack and label the pics from the emergency office's website.  good job.   is this one of those 'regular' volcanoes with loose internals? like a taco bell volcano? or is it one of those volcanoes that has liquid stuff near the exit but might also be cooking a big solid bowl-buster that will rip the sides off in a massively explosive ejaculation of flaming chunky lava? Are you dead? yep. Can I have your stuff? Sure. It's in the crater. Help yourself.  Brb need to get fire res pots &gt;Brb need to get Goron Tunic. 

ftfy Sorry to hear you died.  R.I.P., dude! Thanks Reddit.... I have been - and always shall be - your friend. If only you could hear the kind words we're saying about you in your memory. Goodnight, sweet prince. Remember.  But seriously, shouldn't you get the hell out of there?

Edit: uhhh....nevermind.  Looking at one of your comments &amp; pictures further down tells me you've seen worse.  Carry on. It's calm now. People are going back to their homes.

Sensor network on the mountain show that the bulge (pressure) is now low. It's safe to go back... for now. That's pretty scary. Was it loud? What sort of procedures take place when something like that happens? Do sirens go off? Are you supposed to evacuate to a certain place? * Loud: yes
* Procedure: All chileans practice emergency procedures as part of living here. 
* Sirens: Yes, they should go off... but they didn't this time. The guy who had to charge the battery had **just one job**.
* Evacuation: part of the procedure. People started evacuating even before the police begun the evacuation.  [Volcano eruptions are loud.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5UecbuYw8) Lava is rather slow, is the smoke column that gets you... [deleted] What's it feel like to be a ghost? It's nothing cold.... quite nice.  Even that near the volcano?  Louder now, Louder now I upvote dead people You made me laugh... thanks!  Man, I posted almost the same pic. Also from Chile. Here, I found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROxKaPgfkYA) Nice Vid!!!  holy fuck that's awesome in the strictest sense of the word. Yeah! I kind of enjoy watching the power of the elements. It reminds you that you are living on a rock that floats in space... and you are part of this science-fiction story, that is actually not much fiction. and travelling about 66,000mph around a giant ball of fire thats 1,300,000 times bigger than our chunk of rock and may one day swallow us up... Never forget... [the galaxy song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buqtdpuZxvk) Yayy, Galaxy Song.  That's what my wife and I used for our first dance at our wedding.  Also, we have lyrics from it engraved on the inside of our wedding bands. Sweet! This gave me the brilliant idea, Minecraft should have volcanoes.  True. It does, with mods. Any idea what kind of eruption it is, or what they expect the damage to be? My knowledge of volcanos is the 10 minutes I spent reading about them in my Geology lab last week. It's a discontinuous strombolian eruption. Mostly gas and some incandescent projectiles and lava flows. No pyroclastic flows.  Op is very informative! A connoisseur of volcanoes :P Holy shit that's stunning. Impressive ehh?

Check out [this one](http://static.betazeta.com/www.veoverde.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/a_uno_026004-1-550x349.jpg).
It was a few years ago a few hundred miles down south Cordn del Caulle.  Volcanic thunder is righteous.  Is the one you posted to start this topic your photo?  It's a great photo given how dark it must be out there, even with a chunk of the earth basically blowing up a few miles away. Nope, the picture is not mine. My bet is that is a 8s exposure, F2-3 ISO80. Sounds about right, if you find a higher res image, post it up, I'd love to make it my new background! I will. In the meanwhile, have [this one](http://static.diario.latercera.com/201206/1550676.jpg). 

It's an eruption of the Cordn del Caulle a few years ago.

Oops... double post. Derp! [You're all right, OP](http://i.imgur.com/zR284NK.jpg) Gee, thanks. I try to assume that when someone writes, he/she expects an answer. Just doing the best I can.  You're doing better than most, plus your pic is totally badass! Keep up the good work, OP. That is insane.  Wait am I seeing this on Reddit before I am hearing about it on the news?  Holy crap I need to get off of here NOW.  And you need to get out of there NOW! Will we ever hear from this guy again? yeah... I've been in 2 major earthquakes 8.3 and 8.8. We got about 400 active volcanos also, so this is just something that happens once in a while. I'm expecting some ground shaking tonight... these stuff comes in pairs.  You guys get earthquakes like that all the time though.

Chileans make us Californians look like pussies. lots of things make californians look like pussies From California, can confirm. Full of pussy. Or Dick, w.e floats your boat.  Rebuttle! &gt;Chileans make us Californians look like pussies.

Right? I'm sitting here thinking about how I nearly pissed when we had that 5.0 last year meanwhile OPs been through the apocalypse like a half dozen times. You know, I'm Chilean and I live in Japan, you may expect me to have been in a lot of big earthquakes... But not, missed the Chilean 8.8 one, I was in Japan, and also missed the Japanese 9.0, I was in Chile. My biggest earthquake was a crappy 7.6 in the North of Chile, where I grew up... I guess I am lucky :).   I think you've been watching to much dante's peak.  *OP* definitely knows how to volcano.  ...and earthquake and tsunami... I just love Chile. Sounds like Chile is the Australia of South America.  Sort of like the upside-down California. Good fruit, good surf, plenty of earthquakes. But with more volcanoes and slightly more Spanish speakers.  But, only slightly more. Actually I just checked the California census as of 2011 and California has over 35 million Spanish speakers, which is over double the entire population of Chile. I had no idea. I have some family staying in Pucn and they're just sleeping through the eruption. 

I stayed in Pucn a couple of years ago and the volcano is really close. The Chileans are either brave or just plain crazy.  We? Brave?... nah... must be the other thing.  We're just "weones" *Aweonaos I went to Chile once. I got laughed at for freaking out over an earthquake, while everyone resumed what they where doing. I was a noob! It happens. We get about 2 per month in the capital (Santiago), but they barely move the pictures on the wall. Anything below 5.8Richter is not strong enough to get us out of bed.  [deleted] burp? 

more like shart The technical term is 'earthjaculation'. That's crazy! We were on top of that bad boy on our last trip there. Peeking right into the lava-mouth! https://www.dropbox.com/s/1p5kgn31du8km7t/Chile_225.JPG?dl=0 What did you throw in there tourist! Confess right now! You dropped some Mentos in there didn't you?! DIDN'T YOU!!! Morgoth is pleased. Just a Balrog doing a swipe session on Tinder. That's like... *the* most clich looking volcano eruption I've ever seen. Pompeii motherfuckers, never forget.  &gt;And then came a sound.  
Distant first, it grew into castrophany so immense it could be heard   far away in space.  
There were no screams. There was no time.  
The mountain called Monkey had spoken.  
There was only fire.  
And then, nothing.   This sub needs some love:

http://www.reddit.com/r/volcanoes and the hills are alive with the sound of magmaaaaa throw the ring in, Frodo That is so cool. I actually lived in Pucon in 2012. I summited it twice, once on a split board. I skied up one side, then snowboarded down the other to a beautiful hot springs (Thermas Geometricas)

I'm sad I'm not there now to see this.

http://imgur.com/a/kvKSv Whoa.  I was just watching Lord of the Rings then I come on here and see this.  Chat later, off to Helm's Deep.  Well if I was anywhere near that volcano, I wouldn't be Chile.

I saw McCain eat like 3 boxes of crickets once. I don't blame him. They are delicious.  No, they're lizards. Lizard here. I can confirm. Debatable  THE SNOWBALL DIDNT MELT GUYS

THIS CLEARLY SHOWS THAT GLOBAL WARMING IS NON-EXISTANT *slips*

WHO THE FUCK SPILLED WATER HERE?!?! sorry, the us gov't is leaking bullshit again  They know it too. They just pretend they don't to appease their corporate donors. Yawn... Do they doubt global warming or just human caused global warming?  Apparently.


You know the unique little place the US is. They doubt climate change, evolution, metric system, celsius... all which is common knowledge everywhere else in the planet. And Jebus, you forgot Jebus.

EDIT: I'm not promoting it, I just mean that the US has a large number of Christian fundamentalists.
 Depends on how loose your definition of "people" is. I have some people in my family so right wing, they make nixon look like a communist. Every fucking time it snows, they use it as "proof" against global warming/climate change. I've given up on them. Technically volcanoes contribute to global *cooling*. what does global warming have to do with volcanoes? Volcanoes are hot and part of the globe

edit - if you can't tell, this is a joke. I know volcanoes are only hot when they erupt. Stay safe op. This makes me so strangely happy :) There's nothing like seeing three grown ass working men channel their inner child Hopefully they never spell their name wrong, wait a minute, are you that guy?

I knew I recognized his name, but I couldn't remember where from. A lot happens in a week on Reddit. That was only a week ago?! I like hearing this a lot more than "That was *already* a week ago?!"

 Life is short and realizing how fast it goes by can be depressing.  (~week ago~) Can anyone link this to me? I keep seeing this joke but I missed the thread. We do this all the time at work we're college students working at an elementary school part-time. After we all mowed the school playground and picked up the trash we ended up taking breaks or playing whatever ball or toys left behind (dodgeball, handball, and playing catch) one time we got caught by the Principal of the school and made us put them away and back to whatever is left to do. 

 :(  You should help that principal get the stick out of his/her ass. Since you're famous on here and I see you a lot, and you're top reply to my comment, I feel like we're friends now I'm pretty sure they're garbage men, not ass workers.

Maybe both? I smiled immediately  The truck reads, "project zero trash". Looks like they're just doing their job.  I once broke both of my arms trying to go fully around the swing set when I was 12. This was before mythbusters existed and proved that to be completely idiotic. Hopefully these trash masters faired better. &gt; I once broke both of my arms...

Buddy, don't ever share this story on reddit again. My brother broke both of his wrists. Mum had to put garbage bags over his casts so he could have a bath. One of his friends wrote 'how will you wank now?' in big black texta on one of the casts. Mum just smiled and winked. *[Mum just smiled and winked](http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2013/02/06/2f/63/June-Shannon-600-400.jpg) Fuck you, I was eating. *Mum just smiled and wanked.

&gt; will you wank now?

I dunno where I was going with this... I get it. It seems you tried to reconstruct the mom, broken arm masturbation sex story. My mom never sucked and/or fucked me; but I *did* piss my pants when I broke both my arms and the nurse had a good laugh at it &gt; My mom never sucked and/or fucked me

Probably the strangest start to a sentence I've read today. Yeah, whose mom doesn't suck and/or fuck them? at least you had a mom. I was raised by a single dad when I broke both my arms. :\ (   ) ( o  o) Ah, well thanks for clearing that up then! You're the guy who misspelled his own username, no? :/ [Now I'll never forget.] (http://i.gyazo.com/a581f8ede6a84a45586a5441c7237b30.png) I too use RES to remind me of these things... i color code mine too. Red tags are bad news. Usually use it to locally call out people doing blatant and inappropriate self promotion. Green is for people worth noting, like people who misspell their own names. LMAO U ACTUALLY ARE THAT GUY Yep.

Now the dude gets karma like Obama gets votes.

It is said jstrydor	is nearing retirement and will never publish a second book. half your comment history is now :/

Keep up the good work. You're the new /u/Warlizard! Who needs /u/Warlizard anyways. you're foolish if you think Reddit can get by without /u/warlizard I am Reddit. You're like /u/Warlizard. You've even developed your own emoticon face response to the question. yeah, jstrdyor I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep. Have some chocolate. I hear it makes you live forever. **CHOOOCOLAAATE** This is my favorite reference of all time Not as bad, but I had my legs up in the swing, in an M like shape, with my feet hooked around the back of the chains. I tried to jump off, but since my legs were wrapped around I just hung from the swing with my face dragging through the dirt. 
&gt;I just hung from the swing with my face dragging through the dirt.

Don't feel bad. Builds character.

 &gt;completely idiotic

It's only idiotic [if you don't pull it off.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP7IBUWdeZg) My palms are sweating just watching that. Mom's spaghetti.  My palms got sweaty when he started going over the horizontal line, until I understood it was metal bars and not chains. Still pretty bad ass though. That doesn't count... That swing is on rigid arms, not chains or ropes. It's really not even that impressive...

I'm super fun at parties... Thats all I could think while I was watching it, that and that guy is crazy. Still doesn't count though  I would not want the first full circle to be backwards... That is a rigid swing. They use them in circuses and stuff all the time to do 360s. This is cool, but it's a lot different from a normal swing I watched this entire thing cheering him on and getting increasingly anxious as he got *so close* to flipping.  My cousin broke both his arms trying to imitate Michael Jordan's free throw line dunk on a nerf hoop. Cousin caught air, then caught the corner of his mattress and ate shit.  &gt; broke both of my arms

NO STOP DON'T SAY THAT. I'm not even going to click show child comments. I am so sick of this joke. No joke. This actually happened. I hate reddit circlejerks as much as the next guy, but this actually happened. 25 year old here:

would love to swing again without my feet hitting the floor. Stand on the seat, try and swing all the way around. That's how adults do it. 2spooky4me I'm 22 and I would love to just do childish shit all the time without having to worry about it looking weird.

I would love to skip everywhere. It makes me happy and it's a good workout.  I always thought they should make playgrounds for adults When no one is around at home, I'll skip between rooms or do a fast little run like something is chasing me.   I then grin and do a kids giggle.   I'm 35 and it's still fun to do. I pretty much always run up the stairs in my house Wrap the chains. Another benefit of being short :) The only benefit of being short Don't forget: Best cereals at eye level  That's a bit of a stretch to find something positive about being short. It's a lot of a stretch to be tall. They market honey bunches of oats to kids these days? All those uncomfortable love seats serve as perfectly fine couches for short people to sleep on. Either make it go over so its shorter on the other side (not a great way, but works), if you have the cash, go and buy two heavy duty carabiners and find a set the has big chain links.  Bam, swing to whatever height you need. I'm from Bogot, Colombia, and this happened in my city. :)  Same, wondered if it was Bogota from the City's shield on the truck, then noticed the benches, bins and signs are the ones that are standard here saw the shield on the truck and then I knew right away! :)
 Sumerc. No me joda chino! And here I was trying to guess which latin american country it came from... I ruled Mexico out because garbage trucks don't have that logo here, but I *knew* it was from a latin country. yo de hecho alcanc a pensar que esta foto haba sido tomada AL LADO de mi edificio. Pero luego me d cuenta de que es una foto junto a cualquiera de los miles de edificios que tiene esta ciudad. Igual, reconoc toda la escena inmediatamente y alcanc a pensar que estaba en /r/colombia en vez de la frontpage Revista semana en tres das: " La foto de Bogot que causa sensacin en las redes" this comment and the one above it made me very happy to learn that I can still read Spanish :) Colombia tierra querida &lt;3 da risa que en reddit lo celebran y en Colombia lo critican hasta en los noticieros.  I need to visit your city sometime soon. I was in Medellin and Pereira a few years ago and had a chance to fly out to Bogota but everyone told me that it was cold and no fun. I apparently was lied to.  Bogot is Colombia's melting pot; there's everything here. So claiming *anything* about it is at the same time an honest truth and a dirty lie. Just come here and enjoy our perpetual turmoil Yea nice to see our city in the frontpage Whaaaat, I would have never known. My parents lived there before they immigrated, it's a beautiful place  Why am I only seeing Luigis? Because they are. I like to think that this is more than just a few garbagemen taking a break at the swing set. I like to believe that this is about 3 friends who grew up together and who have known each other their whole lives. Everyday they take the same route and everyday they pass this swingset and everyday one of the workers trembles in fear. His friends take notice one day and ask him what's wrong. "I'm afraid of swings" he responds. "Why" his friend asks, "did you have an accident while you were young?" "No!" he exclaimed, "I just don't like how they're all swingy and shit, aint nobody got no business going that high on no damn swing". So one day they all stopped at the swingset much to their friends dismay and the friendsgathered around and agreed to overcome their friends fear... together! I like to think that this picture was taken at the very moment their fearful friend mustered up enough courage to take his feet off the ground for the first time as his friends yelled, "look how high I can go!". 

Did that happen? probably not. 
Was there any point to that story? Nope!
 But did you read it? Well, only *you* can answer that question! Oh! I remember you, you're the guy that misspelled his username in the Obama post. :/ You might be that guy, but look at how much useful karma you've gained with your shame! 16 fuck-tons, to be exact Dude you're like famous now. You're one of those guys now. I notice your name everywhere now.

With a username like that I bet you're pretty careful every time you type it aren't you? i like your story  I reddit. Goddamnit they are parked right in the middle of the fucking road though I always try to do this when I pass by a park. A guy I was dating told me to get off of the swing and that I was too old for that. That was awhile ago. We are no longer dating.  Fuck that guy, I would just swing along too. THANK YOU!  That is for sure a dumpable (is that a word?) offense for sure Its like a real life Banksy painting  OMG, BOGOTA in the front page!!! Lo hicimos, reddit (?

Editado: Gracias por el oro, amable extrao! I know!!!  :)  who would have guessed they will make it this far! Well when you put up with trash all the time you have to keep your good nature somehow.  33 year old here. Two young kids. I love the swings more than they do! For me it will never get old. Only you will, :). Yep, I'll be the 80 year old embarrassing my great grand kids at the park, weeeeeeee! Hey you're that guy who commented on that guy's comment who did that thing, and you can't remember how many a's are in your name, right? ["Men at work"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100135/) is the quintessential garbage man movie.   This looks like something that would happen in the Sims.  :D The world would be a better place if more people took 5 minutes out of their lives to act like a kid again. I wonder if the two guys who swing the highest get to sit up front and the loser has to ride the handle on the back. luigi's sons, disgruntled that their father was always off helping his brother chase princesses, sought a different line of blue collar work. I love this so much. This reminds me of my grandma. The garbage men often took breaks when they got to her house because she would always come out to chat and give them bags of home made cookies and jugs of ice water.  I really wish that was taken with better gear Weeeeeeeeeee wonderful photo We all grow up too fast Enjoy the little things. Please... This is such a cute picture! Especially because everything is color coordinated! it's actually ridiculous that people are bothered by the fact that people that handled trash are touching outdoor swing sets...seriously, do you really not know that children are walking petri dishes? Let these guys have some fun. Way to get some nice guys fired! Let's exchange PMs? A little tit for tat, if you will? Do you understand how breaks work? If it is within reason and the time allowed, the employer will (or at least should) not give a fuck. It's not 1905, it's *your* time. Oh Colombian garbagemen. I hope you were this peaceful and happy all day. No jungle gym, no merry-go-round, no slides, no teeter-totters, just three swings... That's the worst playground ever! Swings that can accommodate grown men? Awesome. Looks more like a park. I wonder if this like the park leslie knope is trying to build

Ps I'm barely on season 2 I can count on one hand the number of times I've cried in my adult life. One of them was during the final episode. 

 [HAIL HYDRA!](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4b/440px-HydraOrganization_Head.jpg) I still love getting on a swing and I'm 51. There is an inner child in all of us and I simply enjoy bringing it out on a swing. Seems to be Bogota, Colombia http://www.bogotabasuracero.com Being a garbage man was the best job I ever had (until my current one). Spent all day outside, being paid pretty well, working with friends, and moving / lifting heavy things (so I ended up in pretty good shape at the time).

Only thing that sucked was if it rained on Monday followed by two or three really hot days before trash day. This is cool, great to see people feeling young again, but would probably get them fired if the boss sees this. Boss, don't do it, instead go out there and swing too.  You know how I know I'm an adult? Not because I'm 35, but because I got on a swing a few months ago and I got motion sickness. Yes, that's right, fucking motion sickness. gotta love my country :3 [Garbage day!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7gIpuIVE3k) They're just airing out. That's so priceless.  This was taken in Bogota, Colombia and it is awesome Hell, they cleaned it, they should be able to play on it without judgement! I've been depressed all day and somehow this has made me really happy in a poignant way. something about seeing adults break loose and play with no pretenses makes me really happy. Even people with non desirable jobs are human [deleted] Thank you for the source, I could not find the name of the photographer or the original link.

EDIT: Photo by Mauricio Alaguna, Bogot. The job is actually strangely tensing.  Working the back end you stand on a jerking platform all the time or skip and hop-up a lot and as a driver all you do is start and stop all day long - a lot of gas-then-sit-brake.   Always the exhaust and the smell.

Taking a ten minute stop on the swings is probably the best break possible short of a 10 minute bath in a hot tub.   (I had a job where that was possible, was an excellent break) Looks like they're parked in the middle of the god damn road.  That's one way to boost our children's immune systems..  Reminds me of a time over the summer when I was working:  I worked for an equipment rental house that rented and set-up equipment for most of the big events in our area.  I got called to work a Sunday night (overnight) shift to take down a street festival.  Pretty typical way to begin my week.  We show up to the event at 8pm and proceed to start taking down as soon as the gates are closed.  There were about 225 tents total, 3 stages, 400 tables, 500 chairs, tons of miscellaneous cooking equipment (Fridges, freezers, deep fryers, grills), and about 175 55-gallon water barrels. 

There was also a portable carnival set-up at the far end of the festival.  The people that bring the portable rides are notorious for being late to pick-ups and having extended timelines. 

Anyways, we knew that this job would take a LONG time to take down, even with 6 trucks and 15 workers.  We worked straight through the night and eventually the sun started to come up, just as we were loading the last of our trucks.  The supervisor with our crew was a very cool guy and told us all to take a break as soon as we got out last truck loaded.  Most of the guys went to the diner that was just down the block.  But I took one of the pickup trucks and drove up and down the block with another worker to ensure that we had picked up all of our equipment.  

When we got to the end of the festival, we noticed that the carnival ride guys has just showed up to start taking down their equipment.  We decided to walk over to the guys and ask for a turn on the rides.  Sure enough, one of the guys told us that he was going to have to wait another hour for the rest of his crew to show up, so he gave us free rides on EVERY. SINGLE. RIDE.  This dude couldn't have been nicer!  

All in all, best way to end a 14-hour overnight shift.   Show me a person who doesn't like to swing and I will show you a person who takes no joy in life. this is so awesome, i like their style! ... gotta have a break to enjoy life
 [Men at Work](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100135/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_25) [Golf clap](http://reactiongifs.me/golf-clap-short/). Yes. It's even two white guys and a black dude... I mean give me a break. But that parking. There's no time for fucks to be given when there's swinging to be done. http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_250/MI0000/580/MI0000580193.jpg And putting all the germs from their skanky gloves on the stuff kids use. :/ Kids are probably covered in more germs than these guys. Thought I was the only one who noticed that.  Nasty shit all over the swings.  Wonderful.  As if kids aren't already bringing home all types of nastiness. I do respect their right to enjoyment, but take the gloves and if possible the suits off, and we're all fine with it. this was the first thing i thought of too.  feel like washing my hands now. Took me a second to realize they were on swings. I was actually wondering if this was some super cool, floor level, giant public trampoline. Same here. I thought it was some big ass trampoline at first. I was like "Damn, they're getting some serious air" For a moment I thought that it was a swing set on a giant merry go round. That would be amazing though. Would centrifugal force throw off the arc of the swings? I think you're thinking of something like [this](http://www.worldofstock.com/slides/PRE15437.jpg).

Its really fun! Because the thing tilts a little, there are little bumps in the ride. Definitely scarier if you're sitting on the outside (faster) Wow... it's like they're people, just like US!  Garbagemen. What a dehumanizing term. Not saying we should change it. Not complaining or trying to invoke social activism or anything. Just saying. I'd hate to be called a garbageman if I worked in garbage collection. Not that I have many better, more dignified suggestions for a name. A lot of people think of woolly mammoths as huge, but there are a few mammoth species described so far (about 10 or so from different time periods and locations) and most of them were not actually bigger than modern elephants, perhaps around the size of Asian Elephants. A few different sized *Mammuthus* species lived in Siberia at different times, the Southern Mammoth and the Steppe Mammoth were both older and about twice the size of the Woolly Mammoth which was actually pretty small. 

I will try find some good size comparisons these are a bit shit but give [you some](http://i.imgur.com/ZcOk9Tr.jpg) kind of [idea](http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/exhibits/longterm/mastodon/images/mastsize.gif).


One of the really cool things they can do with mammoth tusks is look at the 'rings' like a tree and figure out from growth patterns various things about their lives, like how many calves a female might have had during her life. Another [idea](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/earth/naturelibrary/assets/e/el/elephantidae/elephantidae_info_graphic.gif)

There were Mammoths that were very large, indeed. Just not the Woolly Mammoth. [Another idea](http://i.imgur.com/gDE6Tfx.jpg). Changing the spelling [increases size] (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/474x/b8/02/93/b8029345c5b3876b0861f50bdb53db4c.jpg) incredibly.  [Olliephant?](http://imgur.com/uR0HdDx) [Olyphant?](http://i.imgur.com/Aue50J8.gif) That scene might be one of my favorite parts of the books. Wow, the mammoth in the back looks to be about the size of the possum in front.  ...did you just call the Smilodon a mammoth? No, they didn't :P You're just out of the loop as you haven't seen the movie. lol in Ice Age 2 Manny the Mammoth meets a female mammoth who thinks she is a possum. [it's cute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3i-auGmXyk) I loved these movies. Has such a small trunk and pointy things.  Yeah the Steppe Mammoth was big and lived in Siberia before the Woolly Mammoth, it was the size of number 1 in your image... in fact in a nutshell the Songhua River Mammoth is now considered to be obsolete and considered to be the same as the Steppe Mammoth. Those songhua river mammoths remind me of the war elephants in movies. Finding out they weren't all significantly larger than elephants upsets me for literally zero legitimate reason.   Yea, in my imagination I want prehistoric beasts to be legendary in stature - something that could not possibly exist today because it was so impossibly large.  The reality check takes the magic out.  Compared with pretty much every other land critter - including bison, buffalo, horses and other "huge" critters, even the smaller mammoths and mastodons are staggeringly larger.

It's just that in the case of elephants, rhinos and hippos, they are prehistoric beasts that managed to survive into the modern era.

It's interesting, and possibly significant that Africa - where humans evolved and developed hunting in the first place - is the only continent that managed to hang onto most of its Pleistocene megafauna, whereas everywhere else they have a disturbing tendency to go extinct almost as soon as humans start showing up in the region. I've always wondered if this was because animals there had a longer time to adapt to human predation.  As modern humans evolved and developed more advanced hunting technique most of the African animals were able to adapt because this was a lengthy process. In The Americas and australia the megafauna was suddenly encountering modern humans and didn't have time to adapt to  humane predation.  Yep, this is actually one of the most prevalent arguments! It's also possible that the extinctions in Australia and the Americas (which were, of course, separated by at least 20,000 years) were already underway when humans arrived, caused by climate change, and humans simply contributed to the process through hunting. That is indeed the theory - basically that the African megafauna learned that humans were potentially dangerous before they were numerous enough or good enough hunters to wipe them out, so they learned to avoid them before it was too late.  In other areas, the humans showed up armed with higher technology (atlatls and bows) and larger numbers, against megafauna that had no fear of them - so they got hunted to extinction in short order. Seismosaurus, diplodocus, and dreadnoughtus were all pretty fucking huge.

Also, mammoths aren't prehistoric. They were around when humans were learning how to make fire IIRC. there were mammoths alive when the pyramids were built Dude there are still Mammoths alive, they're just very good at hide and seek. OP's mother is theorized to be a mammoth. Yes it was the Flinstoncene era if I am not mistaken. Humans used them for sink faucets.  &gt;when humans were learning how to make fire  
  
That's... kind of the definition of "prehistoric". Not to be nitpicky, but prehistoric most commonly means before a written record.  Does it include cave drawings? That's not what the comment you replied to meant? Ahah, yeah that's exactly what I meant. But I guess it can't hurt to clarify (though /u/koragorn seems to have misunderstood my comment). Is [this badass motherfucker](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Amphicoelias_altus_scale.png) large enough for you? Looks like someone added a little  extra tail to the orange guy haha even the green one looks like that. It's a veggiesaurus! I honestly never thought they were that much bigger than elephants. I thought they were just like hairy elephants.  &gt; kind of [idea](http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/exhibits/longterm/mastodon/images/mastsize.gif)

Now I have an idea how big a mammoth is compared to Hitchcock :)
 Not sure if it's coincidence, but Hitchcock's theme song would make a good elephant theme song. http://youtu.be/0_AmqBGDJDs just need a banana for scale http://i.imgur.com/MPIBYFW.jpg You forgot to add this:

 Pocket mammoth they only eat jumbo shrimp You did. His name was Stampy. You loved him. The whole point of bringing mammoths back through cloning was to get them as battle mounts. What's the point if African elephants are bigger? Abandon the project! but i want to wear a fucking mammothhide-cape! So are you saying this is not a woolly mammoth tusk?

Because whatever that tusk came from is huge.  Or was, anyway... No I am saying just because the tusk is huge it doesn't necessarily mean that the animal itself was larger than modern elephants. A few huge tusks have come out of the Yana River that are from woolly mammoths that have bodies smaller than African Elephants.  He's holding it upside down. That's definitely a walrus tusk.  Having done a little biology I'm actually embarrassed that right now is the first time I ever really THOUGHT about mammoths being more than one species etc, I can't say i ever really applied dem biology teachings to those classic awesome childhood animals.

Everything prehistoric with tusks and vaguely elephant shaped is a mammoth to the child in me. I dunno: I've always pictured them about the size of Snufflelupagus.  Random fact: when I was in 5th grade we went on a family trip to Kenya. While on safari we got charged by a full grown African Elphant. Easily one of the scariest moments of my life.  How much did he charge you? About 3.50 Well it was about that time that I notice that elephant was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. But how the elephant got in my pajama I have no idea I believe OP meant that he was arrested by a full grown elephant.  In tired of these African elephants not respecting rule of law and due process tree fiddy That wasn't no African elephant!

Pretty sad Similar story here. I was in Sri-Lanka with family in 2004 and as we were driving we came across a bull elephant around a kilometer in front of us. Now, my uncle immediately stopped his van and quietly explained that the elephant was in a state of musth (a periodic shift in the behavior of male elephants that causes them to be extremely aggressive). After watching the elephant carefully for a while, he decided to take his chances. Long story short, the elephant made a beeline for us and my uncle, who admittedly wasn't very bright, threw caution to the wind and drove the fuck out of there as fast as he could. 

Edit: spelling. Very true, but those Mammoth Tusks look nearly double the size of an African Elephants. The sad fact is that elephant tusks *used* to be much larger, but the ivory trade has worked as a kind of artificial selection. The elephants with huge tusks kept getting killed until those genes were out of the pool :( Hmmm, I never thought of it that way.  That is sad. :( The same is happening to lions because of trophy hunting.

Trophy hunters prefer healthy lions with huge black mane. Basically they take out the strongest genes from a population. [link](http://africageographic.com/blog/one-lions-life-a-lesson-about-hunting/) Yeah, it crazy [how big they can get](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j2B1DSAcO5k/TdU6EC33qPI/AAAAAAAAAK0/UG8gyiSLwrI/s640/world+record+elephant.jpg). number 2 and number 5 were man eaters. Oh oh here she comes. Watch out boys, she'll chew you up Oh oh here she comes. 2 &amp; 5 are man eaters She's a mammoth. but...they're mammoth I was going to say the reason we "think of them" as huge is because their name literally means huge. Wooly mammoths were huge, there were also animals that were bigger. I always think the elephants get all the glory, but some extinct rhino were awesome, like the [Indricotheriinae](http://i.imgur.com/Ai9OUH8.jpg) just get no popular coverage! Photograph by [Evgenia Arbugaeva](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/125-mammoth-tusks/arbugaeva-photography#/01-pristine-mammoth-tusk-670.jpg). Dang! Are mammoth tusks a common thing? They had a ton of them Yeah they are more common than you would think. I watched a programme about it and they crop up all the time. People want full skeletons these days so tusks and other bone fragments are relatively common as fossils ancient bones go. So if I were interested in procuring say, a large mammoth tusk or the like, how would I go about doing that? I hypothetically if it's illegal of course.

It's a bargain.

For the curious. One would have to "form" "a" "museum" "organisation", and put in a "request". "a" At the end of summer Yakutiyan men weigh and measure their haul on the shore of northern Siberias Lake Bustakh. The tusks will be sold to brokers in the village of Kazachye, where the prices the hunters will get range **from $50 to $250 a pound.**

O___O 

I want to be tusk hunter! There is a show on National Geographic called Mammoths Unearthed which gets into this very subject. This could either be a lot of money or not depending on the average weight of a tusk plus the average frequency of finds You also have to factor in the avarage cost of living in that area. well now I want to go river hunting in Sibera Looks like he's wrangling a giant earthworm.

Looks like he's about in his mid-thirties to me. Some people didn't think it funny but it were. I don't know. But there were still Mammoths living when the pyramids were being built. But seeing as it was buried in mud, this is probably old.  It would have been during the last ice period which ended approximately 15K years ago. The polar equators shifted slightly and there was abundant life in the Russia and Canada / north america regions from 33k - 15k yrs ago.

Catholics believe in evolution and modern science, and I'm sure other denominations have similar beliefs.  And not all creationists are so ignorant to deny that mammoths and dinosaurs existed. I grew up creationist and we were taught that they existed. 

Those who deny their existence are extremely ignorant. If your faith can be toppled by some bones in the ground, then you don't have much faith at all.

Stupid movie with its magic necromancer elephant... If you dig up something on the moon, do you "unmoon" it? Or is the word still unearthed? good question man wow! is that a average size? because there must have been some pretty big mammoth on the other end of that! Woolly mammoths were around the same size as African elephants, but their tusks were huge. [The largest known male tusk is 4.2 m (14 ft) long and weighs 91 kg (201 lb), but 2.42.7 m (7.98.9 ft) and 45 kg (99 lb) was a more typical size.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolly_mammoth#Dentition) So big you might even say it was... mammoth.  National Geographic Magazine published an article in 2013 about the people who hunt for mammoth tusks.

(i hope that makes sense lol, that last episode man, damn) Knocked me sick that last episode.  Yeah my colleague watched it before me and was like "DUDE ITS FUCKED UP", so right up to that last scene I was like, this isn't that bad, that guy has a pretty low tolera-WHAAATHEFUUUUUUUUUUU If they knew what was good for them they'd bury that tusk and never look back.  If this guy goes to bed with a fever, his loved ones had better watch the fuck out. Oh man, I feel l like every slow burning episode up to now was earning that wtf scene. It almost burnt out my interest with the slow, atmospheric approach; so glad I hung in, I've never had my 'wait, what the fuck?' meter ramped up so ruthlessly. Plus, it can only escalate from here. The next episode will feature more evisceration and things bursting out of people. (Probably.) I kept scrolling looking for a Fortitude reference, it took a while! God must have just buried it the day before.. you know.. to test us.. These animals, in the grand scheme of things, were still alive practically just yesterday. Just the way Europe is inching closer to recreating the Auroch, do you think there's any chance of reviving the Mammoth somehow?

Because I want to eat it It looks like Skyrim IRL. In Skyrim you're able to carry many more mammoth's tusks [deleted] That some is flat ass land. Now I may be stupid, but did it used to be the sea bed? &gt; unearthed from a Siberian riverbed
 If they have an extra lying around, Ysolda still wants one. Oh my god! That is the coolest. Doesn't seem that woolly to me. We need a PSbattle He must be one strong dude Jesus put it there to test our faith. If you give one to Ysolda she will help increase your speech by +1. Humans so obsessed with size Planted by God to confuse us all ... I'm headed back to Ysolda in Whiterun. Oooh vintage ivory. That'll go for a good price.  You're carrying too much to be able to run. This reminds me of an old proverb I once heard, "Anything is a dildo if you're brave enough." I belive you are mistaken. This is an oliphants tusk! Looks like this man is taming a huge earthworm Siberian gets the biggest horn he's ever had. Hmm that'd make a nice pen. looks like hes fighting a kraken  Looks like a giant earthworm coming out of the ground.   I know we cant bring these things back with DNA like they did in Jurassic park but man, that would be SO FUCKING AWESOME! Leave my kind alone!! My father has had one of these for as long as I can remember.  Someone gave it to him as payment for a carpentry job he did up in Juneau.  It's about 3/4 that size.  I don't think they're too rare if our little family happens to have one. maybe its a elephant tusk? im pretty sure they are not many mammoth tusks just getting handed willy nilly I know he had it looked at, it's definitley fossilized ivory.  Otherwise it would be illegal to have that much ivory I'm pretty sure.  Like I said though, it's my dad's thing and he knows all about it I'm sure.  I haven't thought about it in a long time until this picture reminded me. Asked my dad.  It's not a wooly mammoth tusk, it's a Mastadon tusk.  Same time frame different beast. 

http://m.mentalfloss.com/article.php?id=54120 On a somewhat related note...I wonder if 'global warming' is going to 'unearth' other archaeological finds/treasures? Only one way to find out. Keep burning those hydrocarbons, for science! haha http://i.imgur.com/Oiyojux.gif Probably wouldn't touch that if I were you. Well that's what [Fortitude](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498622/) has taught me. First thing I thought of too, He'll being tearing out the bowls of his nearest &amp; dearest in a week or less... He's totally gonna get some from Ysolda in Whiterun. Christ those things were huge. Why hasn't science Jurassic Parked extinct animals yet? Oh ... My....God.....that thing is friggin enormous  That looks like a gigantic earth worm. Tremors attack in the red land I'll ask the question that's in everyone's mind... How the heck do you manufacture something that small with that much precision? They're made using a couple of MEMS ([microelectromechanical systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectromechanical_systems)) processes, on top of a plane (called a substrate, made of silicon, usually). 

One is called bulk micromachining, where the substrate is etched into during production. This is done by a process called [photolithography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography).

The other is called surface micromachining, where thin layers of the fabrication material (mostly silicon, I believe) are piled on top of the substrate to create the shape, and other bits are etched in. 

Etching is done using processes like [photolithography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography), among others - using a surface material that changes its properties to be soluble on being exposed to light. If the light is applied in a shape, you can make that shape be soluble; that can be dissolved in something called a developer, leaving the inverse of that shape in the material. That masking material then protects the silicon below in that exact shape from whatever actual etching process you use: nitric acid is an example.

The specific service that they use for both is called [PolyMUMPs](http://www.memscap.com/products/mumps/polymumps).

Edit: the site seems to have been hugged to death, so the relevant content:

&gt; **PolyMUMPs**

&gt; ...
 
&gt; Many universities use the service today as a way to teach beginning MEMS design at the undergraduate level, using PolyMUMPs as the "example" process. In this environment, classes will study MUMPs during the semester then submit a design and get chips back in time for the end of the semester. Another use for PolyMUMPs is as a benchmarking tool for software models and statistical studies, where theories are validated with measured data from actual, fabricated chips. PolyMUMPs chips also serve as a standard building block for larger scale systems, where the MEMS chip is only one piece of the overall system. PolyMUMPs' well-understood properties and predictable outcomes are advantageously leveraged to make MEMS the "black box" fixed-component.
&gt; 
&gt; **About The Process**

&gt; PolyMUMPs is a three-layer polysilicon surface and bulk micromachining process, with 2 sacrificial layers and one metal layer. Eight mask levels create 7 physical layers. The minimum feature size in PolyMUMPs is 2um. Devices that can be made in PolyMUMPs include: Acoustics(microphones), Sensors, Accelerometers, Micro-fluidics, and Display Technologies.

[Here's a GIF](http://i.imgur.com/xYhP37O.gifv) of it being used; I also [posted](/r/gifs/comments/2xl4or/this_is_a_nanoinjector_a_microscopic_machine/) it to /r/gifs.

[Here's a video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djH8AM2diyE)! Is there an ELI5 version? Essentially, they make the machine by cutting into a silicon wafer and etching out the shapes needed, or they add lots of little structural silicon layers and etch the shapes into those.

The etching is done using processes like [photolithography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography), among others - using a special surface material which becomes dissolve-able in something called a developer when it is exposed to light. If the light is applied in a shape (by shining it through a mask), you can make that same shape, now on the material, be dissolvable; that can be dissolved in the developer, leaving behind everything that the light didn't touch: the inverse of that shape. ELI3 Imagine a wooden block. You want to make a machine from it. So, if you want to have an impression, you cut shapes into the block to have some slots. For bits that stick out, you stack little pieces of cardboard on top and cut them into shapes. 

It's the same thing here, but with silicon wafers instead of wood and cardboard. You have the patience of a saint, Gilgamesh. Well he has to be, [he's over 4,500 years old](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh).

[Another really awesome old guy.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah) /u/Gilgamesh is my favorite OP He really is epic Mmmm.. Wafers. ELI1 Goo goo ga ga, ga goo ga goo go. Ga goo ga ga goo. Uuuu waaah waaah.

Goo ga goo ga goo. Ga ga? That's racist! Hey! Babies drink Milk from there! :O If you want to make stuff, you have to do things to that stuff.  It's starting to make sense. Probably the same process they use to build hard drive heads.  Magic, got it. To put it in a more familiar frame of reference, they are made in a very similar way to computer chips. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.  Any sufficiently analyzed magic is indistinguishable from technology. Not this again.   Not again this. This! Not again. Again! Not this. !this.Again(); http://i.imgur.com/tDXwZIY.gif [Girl Genius!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic) Reminds me of princess b.

Take that, Atheists. Euphoric  &gt; 2 sacrificial layers

Certainly sounds like it. [You see...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJp86_tj9KQ) Wow, what an unexpected response. Or 3d-printing, which is magic 2.0. I won't be impressed until I can print in five dimensions.  I won't be impressed until I can print LEGO within manufacturing tolerances, and be able to torrent sets.  You wouldn't download a car, would you? 

A: Heck yeah I would download a car in a heartbeat. If you went and 3d modeled it, couldn't you already do that? Of course, it would probably take awhile to print out a whole set. [deleted] So the solution is to print giant LEGOs! Then shrink them! The issue is replicating the design. The plastic shrinks unpredictably and consumer 3d printers aren't terribly accurate. Lego molds are very accurately machined and then go thought extensive hand polishing to get as smooth and accurate to the design as possible. 2dimensional4me 5dimensional7me post-modern magic. I fucking loved MicroMachines!  You mean [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2egGfd5j_k) glorious little things?

I had so much fun playing with those when I was a kid. I didn't have a very big room so couldn't build any of the big Hot Wheels sets (and we couldn't really afford them anyway) but with micromachines I could make my own little tracks and cities using legos and other random stuff.  Then they went fucking nuts and had microer machines inside the micro machines!! Wow I can't believe we hugged polymumps to death,
Here is a video I made two years ago that shows the production steps to produce a double beam structure using PolyMUMPs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdUClAdDN4A

//Edit
A bit more info about the steps:
Substrate: The silicon substrate is the starting point.

Nitride Layer: Deposited onto the silicone. (it also provides electrical insulation because the substrate is conductive.)

Poly 0: Deposited, this is the first structural material.

1st Oxide: Deposited, this is usually the sacrificial layer and dissolves during the structural release step.

ANCHOR1: You provide a 2D drawing to the company for this step, and the drawing gets etched onto the 1st Oxide layer, creating shapes. In the video this shape is a hole. It's called "Anchor" because if you don't draw anything for this layer, the next layers will just fall off the surface at the end.

Poly 1: More structural material.

POLY1: Again, you provide a 2D drawing for this step as well, this time it's used to etch away shapes off the Poly1 layer. In the video this is a simple rectangle.

2nd Oxide: Another sacrificial layer. 

POLY1_POLY2_VIA: Another 2D drawing, this one etches away only the 2nd Oxide layer. It's named like this, because whenever this layer is etched away, the next structural layer (Poly2) will touch the previous structural layer (Poly1), and stick to it.

Poly2: The last structural material deposition.

POLY2: And another 2D drawing, it etches shapes away from the Poly2 layer.

Structural Release: The whole thing is dipped into a bath of solvent, which selectively dissolves the 1st and 2nd oxide layers, while not touching the rest.

There are many more possibilities, but these are the steps you would use to create the MEMS structure in my video.
 I was guessing really small wrenches. and low wage ant workers. [deleted] Cool!  Must have made your dad feel better about himself Some of these processes are also used to make the accelerometer in phones I think. Engineeringguy on YouTube has a good explanation. Dank MEMS, bro. Born too late to explore the Earth.  
Born too soon to explore the galaxy.  
Born just in time to manufacture dank MEMS. As someone who recently completed a MEMS class, I really appreciate this joke (and thread!).
 Hi, I'm an engineer working in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), so I can answer some of your questions.

The past decade has seen a lot of improvement in our ability to make really small things.

I'm not sure exactly the steps they used to make it, but I can give a good guess based on my experience.

They probably put a pattern of important parts on it using a process called [Lithography](https://www.memsnet.org/mems/processes/lithography.html),

Then they added material using one of many steps like [chemical vapor deposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_vapor_deposition), or [electron beam evaporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_beam_physical_vapor_deposition).

OR, they took material away using one of many processes like [acid etching](http://web.ece.ucdavis.edu/~anayakpr/Papers/Wet%20and%20Dry%20Etching_submitted.pdf), [Reactive Ion Etching \(RIE\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive-ion_etching), or [Deep RIE \(DRIE\).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_reactive-ion_etching).


Microfabrication actually works a lot like normal machining.  You have a part that you want, and you can either add material or take away material until you get the desired function.  The only thing that is different is instead of using a cutting tool to remove material, you're using a chemical reaction of some sort.  [deleted] http://imgur.com/a/ZbL3V

There's your mom's paper, in image form. Cool stuff. Whats your favorite color? Green Is the joke that he works in spaces below the wavelength of visible light? blue ... no green .... ahhhhhh This is really cool; I actually know people who worked on this project.  
Here is more about the nanoinjector:  
http://news.byu.edu/archive14-may-nanoinjector.aspx  
http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/rsi/85/5/10.1063/1.4872077

This is how they are manufactured:  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfabrication  

The injector itself is actually what is called a compliant mechanism, in that the joints, springs, and  structure are one and the same. One designs for elastic deformation of the structure to complete a desired motion.  

Edit: Compliant mechanisms and MEMS are not my research focus, so what I can tell you about them is relatively limited. I work as a robotics researcher at BYU.  Non-mobile: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfabrication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfabrication)

Here is a [banana for scale](http://bizmology.hoovers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/yellow4.jpg) Silly.  Color doesn't exist at that scale. Is this a real statement? If so, why? I think I know, but I'd like details. Like this was obviously taken with electron imaging, which wouldn't reveal color, but why wouldn't color be perceivable at this scale? idk, looks black and blue to me
 ffs, people.. Yeah, Final Fantasy Seven, people! I know right? Its obviously white and gold Tiny people. For those who doin know how big a micrometre is, that "sphere" is about a little less than the width of a human hair. A human hair is about 90 micrometres Surprisingly that's a lot bigger than I expected Oocytes (egg cells) are some of the largest animal cells. The red blood cell is slightly smaller than most cells, at around 6-8 m. The typical epithelial cell is, ehh..., based on the endometrium and skin I just looked at, 20-50 m. Add in that oocytes are spherical (maximum volume), oocytes are quite large. That thin? I thought it was wider. 100 micrometers is 0.1 mm. Piece of paper is around 0.2 mm thick. Does anyone know what the black object is?  A "cell"? It's a 100m latex sphere. [Here's the machine being used on a mouse zygote.](http://i.imgur.com/rncL5Al.jpg) It'd be great to have something for scale; the electron microscopy image makes it look much smaller than it really is. 100 um is 0.1mm and it is, amazingly, within the range of sizes where human could manipulate the pointy bit with the bare hands (under a microscope), of course with very poor repeatability and a problem with fatigue; or using a conventionally built mechanical microtome. Anyone out there who regularly manipulates their 0.1mm pointy bit with their bare hands that can confirm?  Yes, it's actually quite amazing the level of control that you have. Anyone who does X-ray crystallography must be able to use a loop to lift a very small crystal out of a drop under a microscope. The size of the crystals are usually on the order of a couple hundred microns per side but they can sometimes be much smaller. It might not require quite the same level of control as this particular instance, but my point is that you would be surprised how detailed your control can be. Have to be careful not to have too much coffee on those days :) Shhhh nobody tell him i actually enjoyed their response more than i would have another pun ;) It's the enthusiasm that shines through when he doesn't even consider for a second that someone might be making a dick joke: the realization that this is his time, when people are actually interested in the same thing he's found interesting for (hopefully) most of his career :D I just got it when I read this comment. How much potassium do you eat? Seriously. Well, back in grad school, I used to take carbon nanotubes and glue them onto the tip of micropipettes.  Manually.  Under an optical scope.

My thesis was mainly target towards never fucking doing that every again.  So I developed a reproducible batch processing method instead.  Fuck nanotubes and fuck cells.   That's rad. I used to bullseye womprats back home. They're not much bigger than two meters. Shit, I thought you said grade school! Yes it's possible.

Make a line with a sharp pencil. Now try to draw exactly over that line using the same pencil. 

Congratulations, you just did something that requires about 0.1mm accuracy. Actually, depending on the pressure used to create the first line, it might be a lot easier than you think. I regularly do circuit rework on the 0.5mm &amp; 0.3mm scale with very little difficulty.  Do they dip the injector tip in DNA or is there some other means of getting it into the zygote? It doesn't look like it can actually inject anything. The injection is done using a lance, which is positively electrically charged and therefore has negatively charged DNA stick to it. When the lance has penetrated the membrane, the charge on the lance is reversed, and the negatively charged DNA is therefore repulsed from the now negatively charged lance into the cytoplasm. Fuckin science, man.  How do you get the DNA on the lance in the first place? How do you extract it etc.? You can extract it from cells rather simple by washing it with different solvents. If you take a cell and lyse it (open up the cell membrane), you only get proteins, phospholipid~~e~~s (cell membrane) and some lipopolysaccharides if you have a pro*k*aryote (bacteria), and the DNA + RNA. The phospholipid~~e~~s are obviously hydrophob*ic*, meaning it will be easy to divide them from the very hydrophil*ic* DNA/RNA (because it is negatively charged and water is polar). Proteins can be denatured by high salt concentrations. RNA can be taken out with RNases, which destroy the RNA chain. You now have DNA chains and RNA mononucleotides.

The DNA is naturally addi*c*tive to glass. So when you have the DNA chains in solution, and put ethanole with a high concentration on top of it, the DNA will denaturate right there where the two solvents meet each other. Now when it is denaturated, you can spin it up on a glass stick, and take it out afterwards. 

Well, thats how it works at least for plasmids, I did it in college. &gt; The phospholipides are obviously hydrophobe

*Obviously* Well, they are lipids. Lipids are kind of by definition hydrophobic. That's some fairly basic biology. You know. Your phospholipid bilayer which surrounds each cell in your body? If we split the terms up, we can figure out why it's obvious. 

bilayer - two layers
phospholipid - something with phosphate (a charged molecule - probably not obvious) and a lipid (fat-like thing). 

The key part here is the lipids, which are fatty acids. If you've ever mixed oil and water, you know the two don't really mix, because oils are hydrophobic (don't like water). So, if you break the cell membrane (the bilayer) you get these oil-like things in an aqueous environment so they of course separate out in solution. Then you simply pipette out the part you want for further processing (the bottom layer, water is more dense than oil). 

That said, if you didn't know this/haven't had basic biology yet (I'm hopeful you at least will consider a course at some point in your life, no matter how irrelevant it seems), now you do know! Education is important.  DNA extraction from cells is a fairly simple procedure (for more cell types anyways).  In it's most simple form all you require is detergent, alcohol and a stick/pin/wire.  Chances are you have all that's required in your bathroom. you can extract dna in a shot glass with [a couple fruits and some everclear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rESHv7d7O88). Its a neat party trick and makes a good drink too I like to imagine that it makes a cute noise when it does that. "BooP" It actually makes a POP sound while cytoplasm leaks from the punctured cell. Amazingly, that actually rarely happens; the lance is so small that minimal damage is done to the zygote's membrane. From the paper:

&gt; [using the technique on] 3000 zygotes has resulted in 71.9% progression to the two-cell stage compared to 79.6% for untreated zygotes. 
 That's pretty damn impressive. I can't imagine how they managed to build something so small. You're most likely wrote that comment on a piece of technology with similarly small or smaller parts. ***the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell*** [No! Please! I have a family!](http://i.imgur.com/SdUX4hd.jpg) "Don't worry Cell #347b06i, your new family will be much less... defective." Do you expect me to talk? No Mr Bond, I expect you to die! When I was in sixth grade back in 1986 we learned about DNA and how defects can cause diseases. I asked if it was possible to change the DNA in a cell so that the body starts using and reproducing the DNA without the defect. The class laughed and asked me how could anyone fix individual cells. Those guys can suck it now! That's gene therapy. It is currently impossible to correct genetic defects in every (or even most) cells in an organism but you may not need to. Think of a genetic disease that is caused by the lack of a protein. If you can get just a small fraction of cells to produce the protein at high levels, you can potentially reverse the disease.  So is gene therapy essentially a reprogrammed virus?  Yes My dad always said: if the class laughs at you, it was probably a good question.
 
Most people are closed-minded and full of doubt, quick to judge rather than consider.
 
While I'm sorry your classmates laughed at you, a time-appropriate answer to your question might've been:  [well, yeah.](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/214/4526/1244)
 
 Good Guy /u/Gilgamesh-, giving more pictures and context in the comments.  Just for us *Mongrels.* /u/Gilgamesh- 

What do you do? AMA? This is just mind boggling to me. I don't even have any specific questions. This is just incredible.  I'm curious, does something this small operate on its own? Can it move and perform its functions without being physically moved by a human, or does it just sit there and we bring the cell (or egg) to it?

Edit for improper punctuation The mechanism is controlled by a human: the little circle in the bottom right is pushed using a microscopic stick made of tungsten, which is manually controlled. This provides the force for the injection motion.  How can a human do such a precise task without damaging the device? I would have thought that it would break or scatter around from the slightest motion. They use a machine called a [micromanipulator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanipulator), which gives the required precision. oh so its like a step down machine? Where a longer movement is translated into nm? Essentially, yes. I use those to masturbate There's probably a dampening process where there's a lot of slack in the movement, so 1mm of operator movement doesn't = 1mm of device movement (think spongey brakes not reacting immediately.) http://i.imgur.com/zLh2KYz.png "Help! I need tungsten to live!" How would a human have the motor control necessary to be capable of pushing something that small a distance? It looks like even a poorly timed wrist pulse could ruin the injection. They use a machine called a [micromanipulator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanipulator), which gives the required precision. What happens when you inject a cell with DNA? It's a way of putting foreign genes (in the injected DNA) into a fertilised egg, producing a transgenic organism; that's an organism with foreign genes that give them a new property, like [glow in the dark mice](http://i.imgur.com/0wJYVSv.jpg) - the foreign genes in that case come from bioluminescent jellyfish. Thanks! I didn't know it was as "simple" as injecting DNA into a cell. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djH8AM2diyE)! One of the coolest things I've seen in a long time. Thanks! It's so strange to me that that works! only sometimes works. some genes arent well received by certain organisms, or don't work without certain other genes being present. It's a long process of trial and error to find out how to get the desired results. its making that DNA precisely and having it locate exactly where you want thats the hard part Could we theoretically create glow in the dark people? Sure, it may be possible in future. It's just very much unethical. Look. If my parents gave me super powers I'd not complain. It may be ethical in future. But safer for pedestrians at night I want green glowing eyes. That would make everything tinted green. Also, imagine trying to sleep with a night light IN YOUR EYES I'm not sure about glow in the dark but we could definitely make people that glow green when exposed to UV light.

Source: worked with mice using the green fluorescent protein gene as a marker.  Is that really how it works? You can just inject a bit of DNA into a cell and that cell will accept it as its own? How? Why? This is crazy, teach me. Sort of: the technique of pronuclear injection is a special case. Pronuclear refers to the phase when the zygote, the fertilised egg, still hasn't fully formed its nucleus, as the sperm and egg cell's DNA have not fused. The foreign DNA is then assimilated. I'm considering taking a biology course now. This is so wild.  If you really want to have your mind blown, after reading about transgenic mice... read a little about how optogenetic and chemogenetic techniques can be used in conjunction with them... There is more than one way to make transgenic organisms.

Besides the method posted by the OP, one could use a zinc finger nuclease method, transcription activator-like effector nuclease method, or a CRISPR/Cas9 method.

There may be others but I am only knowledgeable in the CRISPR/Cas9 method.

Here are some introductory wiki links: [TALEN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_activator-like_effector_nuclease), [ZFN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_finger_nuclease), [CRISPR/Cas9](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) That is amazing! Here's a [bigger image](http://news.byu.edu/releases/archive14/May/nanoinjector/Nanoinjector.jpg), with a scale. not a bananana but for those interested:

* 100 m is the average diameter of human hair
* 200 m is 2/10th of a millimeter  crazy when you think intel's chips are using 22 nano-meters Even crazier - the new chips they're rolling out are 14nm. They have 10nm chips in development, and right now they're trying to figure out the process/materials to make 7nm. yeah, and some laboratory in SK made a transistor 3nm big!! 3 fucking nano meters!!! For scale, that's about 30 atoms across. I heard they were moving away from silicon after 10nm.  So the whole image is most of a millimeter across.  If you get out a ruler and look at the mm scale, you can imagine these objects between two of those markings, and maybe you could sort of make them out with your naked eye? I expected a banana [Banana for scale](http://i.imgur.com/ib8LPQT.jpg)  http://i.imgur.com/8Z8KHyp.jpg
 Banano for scale A banana is how many bonano? A brazillion. For reference, a human hair is about 100 microns wide, or 1/2 of the scale in that image. It blows my mind how we can create these tiny objects that actually work very accurately. And yet my windshield wipers still can't deal with snow This isn't even that small. Transistors in your computer processing unit are much smaller. They can currently make transistors @ ~14 nm. A machine like this is quite large but it has to be because of its purpose. We've come a long way! Truly. In Botany, we still use a gene gun, which is exactly what is sounds like. You literally load a .22 cartridge with gold particles coated in DNA, and fire it at a petri dish (its not fired out of a gun in the typical sense though, rather a huge machine). 

The bullet is stopped before hitting the dish, and some of the particles move fast enough to impact cells. Many of the cells die, but a few get the DNA into them and are in the proper state to incorporate it.

Edit: looked around and apparently [they make handheld ones now](http://www.bio.davidson.edu/Courses/Molbio/MolStudents/spring2003/McDonald/Helios_gun.gif) Still better than what we use in the arachnology department. We have to inject spider DNA into our balls, put on a chastity belt for two weeks then beat off onto the target cells in a petri dish.

If hasn't even worked yet but my colleagues over at the botany department assure me it will! Maybe we should begin mixing the spider DNA with gold *in vivo* what do you think? Needs moe grant money. AH the ol Nanoinjector...my college nickname A video about this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djH8AM2diyE Finally I can have nanomachines injected into me like Solid Snake! Where do I sign up? I want to be faster, stronger, smarter. I was at Sandia National Laboratories on a "job shadow" like 13 years ago and they had machines that were as small as red blood cells that you could control with a joystick.  Imagine what humanity can achieve if it were't for a few individuals who care more about money and personal gain over that of the collective humanity. Cool. So how far away are we from nanobots that can repair our own cells and make us live a lot lot longer??  Or maybe its time to start digging some silos... Is this an artists rendition of it, or is it an actual photo of one? Either way, that is amazing. Actual photo. Pictures can still be taken until ~ 500-900nm. This is the point where light can no longer be collected by apertures to render an image. How in the world is something like this even made?  They're made using a couple of MEMS ([microelectromechanical systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectromechanical_systems)) processes, on top of a plane (called a substrate, made of silicon, usually). 

One is called bulk micromachining, where the substrate is etched into during production. This is done by a process called [photolithography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography).

The other is called surface micromachining, where thin layers of the fabrication material (mostly silicon, I believe) are piled on top of the substrate to create the shape, and other bits are etched in. 

Etching is done using processes like [photolithography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography), among others - using a surface material that changes its properties to be soluble on being exposed to light. If the light is applied in a shape, you can make that shape be soluble; that can be dissolved in something called a developer, leaving the inverse of that shape in the material. That masking material then protects the silicon below in that exact shape from whatever actual etching process you use: nitric acid is an example.

The specific service that they use for both is called [PolyMUMPs](http://www.memscap.com/products/mumps/polymumps).

Edit: the site seems to have been hugged to death, so the relevant content:

&gt; **PolyMUMPs**

&gt; ...
 
&gt; Many universities use the service today as a way to teach beginning MEMS design at the undergraduate level, using PolyMUMPs as the "example" process. In this environment, classes will study MUMPs during the semester then submit a design and get chips back in time for the end of the semester. Another use for PolyMUMPs is as a benchmarking tool for software models and statistical studies, where theories are validated with measured data from actual, fabricated chips. PolyMUMPs chips also serve as a standard building block for larger scale systems, where the MEMS chip is only one piece of the overall system. PolyMUMPs' well-understood properties and predictable outcomes are advantageously leveraged to make MEMS the "black box" fixed-component.
&gt; 
&gt; **About The Process**

&gt; PolyMUMPs is a three-layer polysilicon surface and bulk micromachining process, with 2 sacrificial layers and one metal layer. Eight mask levels create 7 physical layers. The minimum feature size in PolyMUMPs is 2um. Devices that can be made in PolyMUMPs include: Acoustics(microphones), Sensors, Accelerometers, Micro-fluidics, and Display Technologies.
 What is this? A machine for ants? http://phys.org/news/2014-05-mems-nanoinjector-genetic-modification-cells.html   Das Source. This is sweet. We need one of these in my lab so we can stop doing transfection which only works partially. Yeah, but imagine having to manually inject with this thing on like 10^6 cells instead of letting the cells do the work for you. Technically we only need one of the cells to have been successfully transfected and then we can just let that one grow for a while. That method will take longer obviously but also there is no guarantee that the plasmid injected will be expressed by the cell. When we do the electroporation we only use like 50k cells and expect many to die in the process. I guess that makes sense for smaller scale stuff. Also, if you're not sure about a plasmid being expressed by a cell there are various screening techniques available. I've had decent experiences with [blue white screening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_white_screen). I haven't seen this before, I'll have to take a look at this thanks. It seems like you are more advanced than me with this. I am working in an Alzheimer's research lab and we are currently working on optimizing our transfection protocol. We would like to have a 90% success rate but currently it is much lower.  I don't do this type of work anymore, but when I did I was just using it as a tool to obtain a vector encoding a protein of interest. Consequently, I never really quantified my transformation efficiencies - I was just happy to get some small bit of product which I could amp up later with PCR. Good luck with your work! DH10Bac cells are the best :) That would take forever if your doing a high-throuput panel and are trying to study hundreds of mutations at once.  Sure but if you are only using one plasmid or w/e you only need a few cells to be successfully transfected then you can just let them grow. Have you looked into using CRISPR? No I haven't heard of this, I'll take a look thanks. What do you do? I'm a lowly medical student, so the details are a bit beyond my pay grade, but it's a more precise method for editing DNA that's becoming very popular. I had the same thought, but I'm not sure of the scale, I'd rather just weed out the 60% failure rate with antimicrobial resistance genes and transfect the other 40% of my 100000 cfu/mL cel line than do these one by one ;) You should submit this to /r/interestingasfuck I [did](/r/interestingasfuck/comments/2xkg63/a_scanning_electron_microscope_image_of_a/)!

BYU researchers create tiny nano-device in newest gene therapy advance: Nanoinjector is used to transfer genes and DNA to new cells
The ability to transfer a gene or DNA sequence from one animal into the genome of another plays a critical role in the medical research of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and diabetes.

But the traditional method of transferring genetic material into a new cell, microinjection, has a serious downside. This method uses a hollow needle to pump a DNA-filled liquid into an egg cell nucleus, but that extra fluid causes the cell to swell and die 40 percent of the time.

Now a multidisciplinary team of Brigham Young University scientists has developed a way to significantly reduce cell death when introducing DNA into egg cells. The researchers have created a microscopic lance that delivers DNA to the cells through electrical forces.

"Because DNA is naturally negatively charged, it is attracted to the outside of the lance using positive voltage," said Brian Jensen, BYU professor of mechanical engineering. "Once we insert the lance into a cell, we simply reverse the polarity of the electrical force and the lance releases the DNA."

Because the lance is 10 times smaller and no extra fluid is used, the cells undergo significantly less stress compared to microinjection, and thus, have a higher survival rate. The researchers describe their "metamorphic nanoinjection" process in an article published today by Review of Scientific Instruments.

Currently the BYU researchers, which include microbiology professor Sandra Burnett and mechanical engineering professor Larry Howell, are using the technique to inject DNA into mouse zygotes (single-cell embryos consisting of a fertilized egg).

"The microinjection technology hasn't really changed over the last 40-50 years since it was invented," Burnett said. "Not having to force liquid into the nuclei by shifting to a lance is a huge advantage. It not only increases the survival rate, but it also causes less damage for future development."

In research published in Transgenic Research, the team found that 77.6% of nanoinjected mouse zygotes proceeded to the two-cell stage of development as compared to 54.7% for microinjected zygotes.

A major reason for creating transgenic animals is to research genetic or infectious diseases. By modifying the genes of a mouse to carry a human disease, researchers can generate data with insights into future treatments and therapies for those illnesses.

One of the BYU team's most significant findings is that it's possible to use the electrical forces to get DNA into the nucleus of a cell without aiming the lance into the pronucleus (the cellular structure containing the cell's DNA). This may mean that injections can be performed in animals with cloudy or opaque embryos.

"Such animals, including many interesting larger ones like pigs, would be attractive for a variety of transgenic technologies," Jensen said. "We believe nanoinjection may open new fields of discovery in these animals."

Jensen said more efficient injections should also reduce the cost to create transgenic animals. Jensen's research is funded in part by the $400,000 awarded to him in 2011 through a National Science Foundation CAREER Award.

Quentin Aten, a former PhD student at BYU now with Nexus Spine, LLC, served as the lead author on the research published in Review of Scientific Instruments. 150,000 years of human history and I am lucky enough to be alive during this time of scientific progress. I could have been born at any time, but I get to see this. Too late to explore the world. Too early to explore the universe. There are still the oceans, which are largely unexplored. There is always self. I know the scale would be unbelievably small but can someone  do a scale comparison the way people do with the earth vs jupiter vs sun vs bigger star etc.... to show how massive some celestial bodies are?  Yes, banana is an acceptable final comparison. http://i.imgur.com/IDBA6je.png BURN! It looks like a cell torturing machine. 50 microns of grey. i love nano tech. There are so many youtube videos praising the future of this tech. It really makes you look forward to the future. It can solve a lot of problems from energy to medical. I envy our kids and grandkids. Nano is now and continuously growing. It is already in a variety of applications including bandaids. Bandaids contain nanoparticles of silver (Ag) which are toxic to cells at the nano scale. Essentially kills bacteria and other stuff around the wound. [here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djH8AM2diyE) a pretty good video that shows nano-injection in action, as well as a nano-injector like the one in the OP (around the :45 mark)

the "injector" is a positively charged "lance" that holds the DNA to it with the charge, then once inserted into the cell, they reverse the charge and the DNA is released. Pretty fascinating.  Thank you for posting this. Is there a subreddit that has a bunch of pics like this, but also has the articles / videos about how it was made, history of the nano-scale tech, more info / more pics / more videos? It can be ANYTHING that is nano-scale, not just scientific or medical equipment.

Also, if anyone was wondering why there are a pattern of holes in the base material that's holding the rest of the structures: it's for 1, or 2 things:

1: makes them lighter, by cutting away material, you're cutting away weight.

2: ever seen a rifle track or play a video game that lets you customize weapon attachments, or anything similar? those holes could be where you'd mount other things like additional arms or add structors in the Z axis.

EDIT*** This is another example of the above picture in gif form. Here you can see this machine in action (this is exactly like what I'm looking for)

http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/2xl4or/this_is_a_nanoinjector_a_microscopic_machine/ There's /r/microscopic but it's not really an active sub (you can always help change that!) you can check out /r/nanotechnology, there's even r/nano, but its a bit less active. If those seem a bit to science heavy you can always check out http://phys.org/nanotech-news/ for new articles on developing nanosciences :D  I LOVE the science, but I was just saying: I'll enjoy looking at nano from any application. This shit blows my fucking mind. HOW DID THAT THING GET MAAAAAADE!?!?! Gah! My head is going to implode. DNA? You obviously mean Nanomachines... The device itself is a nanomachine. So that looks like a pretty locked down mechanism.  How far are we from seeing these become mobile on the backs of tiny robots to go through my body removing the pulmonary fibrosing that's wreckin my life? 15-20 years. that is so long from now it's depressing... lets chop of that tens place and just go for 1-2 years!! yay!!!! ;D hahaha I swear I've heard Wile E. talk before and I've seen him get run over by vehicles and trains. Am I remembering this wrong? There are a few where he's after Bugs Bunny. But he never talks when it's Road Runner. 
  
Oh, and there's the one where Ralph Phillips and his buddy are watching cartoons and he explains why he's chasing Road Runner. The one with the butcher chart.
  
Damn...I'm 48 and I still remember all of these. I still watch them every chance I get, too. I'm 48 and I'm pretty sure I remember an episode of him throwing up the fake train tunnel and then getting hit by the train after the roadrunner ran through it. Devil's advocate, the train came from the fake train tunnel, which was purchased from the ACME corporation.  Or the coyotes ineptitude to not realize the possibility of a train on the tracks. The other fact about Looney Tunes was that ACME stood for "A Company that Makes Everything" I read somewhere that the movie/art supply shop the animators got all their stuff from was called Acme Supply. I have an animation degree.

ACME is the name of a standard of holes and peg bars to hold the sheets aligned when you are doing animation by hand-drawing on paper.

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a915lXmViVE/UI1oGge5y_I/AAAAAAAAAUQ/qx6CBjgJQV4/s1600/12HLDisc.JPG &lt;&lt;&lt; ACME is the name of the black rulers (note: there are other rulers that are not ACME, but the ACME rulers and peg system are the most popular ones).

The idea is that if you use paper that fits on the ACME pegs, you can continue working with it anywhere else that also has ACME pegs, and when it is time to turn it into a movie (by taking photos, or filming, or digitizing, or scanning), you can also use a ACME pegs ruler to ensure it is all aligned.

EDIT: By the way, ACME peg bar was invented indeed by a company named ACME, although it was "ACME Tools"
They also made for some time (including the time when Road Runner was first made, but not much more after that) cameras for animators.

But ACME (the company) decided to stop making stuff related to animation (including peg bars) very early, but the peg bar had became "standard" as people kept making "ACME compatible" paper and clone peg bars.

Kinda like all modern day laptops and user desktops are "IBM PCs" despite not being made by IBM at all. I imagine ACME was Cave Johnson's consumer retail company. If I remember right on one episode involving him putting dynamite inside something like carrots he says to himself "Wile E. Coyote... Super gennnius"  Could be wrong of course, its like 13 years ago.  Those speaking parts are from when he was chasing Bugs Bunny instead of the Road Runner http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote_and_The_Road_Runner#Wile_E._Coyote_and_Bugs_Bunny There is one too where he is trying to steal sheep from the shaggy dog. They exchange greetings as they clock in and out.

edit: Turns out I'm mistaken! It is Ralph Wolf.  That's actually another character, Ralph wolf: "Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog" on @Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Wolf_and_Sam_Sheepdog Now *that's* one hell of a TIL. Also,  they were originally called Looney Tunes because of the silly plots while showing off Warner Bros. Music. Now *that's* one hell of a TIL Also, I open-mouthed kissed a horse once. Now *that's*... just disgusting, dude. Wow I even played a game about these two on the PS1 and the whole time I was convinced it was Coyote.  Sheep raider!

Fun game. I'm terrible at it. It was called "Sheep, Dog 'n' Wolf" in Australia.  

Wait... You had to chase the Road Runner in that as well.. Mind blown.  I always thought that was Wile E. Coyote.  I had an original Playstation game called Sheep Raider that followed these two. Such a fun game. Never realized that was a seperate character o.O  WHAT??!!?!??!?! I believe that's wrong. I distinctly remember an episode where he pulls up a chart of the road runner and all the different parts of meat. It was his explanation of why he was obsessed with the succulent road runner. 

Found the link (dialogue starts at about 56 seconds in): https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2MCRC8B6ke8 Yes! My childhood *wasn't* a hallucination...thank you! &gt;Oh, and there's the one where Ralph Phillips and his buddy are watching cartoons and he explains why he's chasing Road Runner. The one with the butcher chart.
  
Does anyone know what episode this is? I've been trying to figure it out for years but never could. [deleted] The Bugs Bunny, and Droopy cartoons are still amazing. It doesn't matter how old you are.  Droopy and Spike are hilarious! I wish they were on cartoon network.  Hello all you happy people.  I'm sooo happy. Chuck Jones was not the only director for Looney Tunes, there are different eras with different styles.  The "no neck" style of the characters is a trademark of Chuck Jones, e.g. The Grinch

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looney_Tunes
 Could you expand on what the "no neck" style is? His drawings do have necks in many instances, but there are signature poses and reactions in his style that do not.  Looney tunes directed by others do not lose the neck in these situations. 
Here are some examples:

 Huh, never knew it but his was easily my favorite era.  
Those Tom and Jerry ones especially. Chuck Jones Tom and Jerry was my least favorite era, personally. I feel like the art style is just bizarre for them. Hanna Barbera is how I'll always like Tom and Jerry. Fred Mother Fucking Quimby or it ain't Tom and Jerry.

Chuck Jones Tom and Jerry is my least favorite as well. Quimby knew exactly how long to linger on each gag. **Thank** you. Whenever Id hear the opening with Tom hissing and spitting, my heart would sink.

That era was Chuck Jones eyebrow/eyelash fetish run amok. I felt *exactly* the same way! I loved Tom and Jerry, but instantly felt disappointment as soon as I heard that stupid growl from Tom in the title card. The eyelashes definitely bothered me, and I noticed that the characters seemed strangely effeminate in general. Overall, the humor and animation was completely underwhelming compared to Fred Quimby.  There is one where he talks (probably a few more).  He is in a small shack writing notes and talking to himself.  "Wile E. Coyote, Super Genius.  I like the sound of that.  Wile E. Coyote, Super Genius".

Then a bomb goes off or the shack is hit by a large vehicle...I forget the details. [deleted] That was compiled from the TV show, "The Bugs Bunny-Road Runner Show" which aired in prime time during the 1960s and then was on Saturday morning for many years (becoming the BB/RR Hour then Show again when it expanded to 90 minutes). That show was the source of the opening theme song "This is it!" (Overture, Curtain, Lights! This is it! The night of nights! No more rehearsing and nursing our part, we know every part by heart!)

The BB/RR show had some wonderful filler cartoons done by Freleng and Jones. There was one where Bugs was going to do an impersonation of Frankie impersonating Jimmy impersonating Billy impersonating Elvis (or something like that) "Gee whiz, Gilligan, Golly Gee ... I love her-ER! and she loves me ...) and then one where Foghorn Leghorn got the body of Rock Hudson drawn over him. Wasn't he putting nitro glycerin in fake carrots? As if that'll work...... What a maroon. Ultra Maroon That's vs Bugs, not Road Runner. In later one's, he would talk.  [I've heard him say Wile. E. Coyote, Genius.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STeVTzWelns)

^
I think that's the right clip, I'm in class with my computer on mute. That's against Bugs Bunny though, the posted rules were for the original coyote v. Road runner cartoons.  &gt;The Coyote appears separately as an occasional antagonist of Bugs Bunny in five shorts from 1952 to 1963: Operation: Rabbit, To Hare Is Human, Rabbit's Feat, Compressed Hare, and Hare-Breadth Hurry. While he is generally silent in the Coyote-Road Runner shorts, he speaks with a refined accent in these solo outings (except for Hare-Breadth Hurry), introducing himself as "Wile E. Coyote  super genius", voiced with an upper-class accent by Mel Blanc.[1] 

From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote_and_The_Road_Runner) "Wile E Coyote, super genius!" yep different it was with Bugs Bunny, It turns out Wile E (sic) also had a bit of a british accent in the way he pronounced his words.  I assume it was from some british tourists he ate in the desert.  50 y/o remember cartoons when they were good and we loved them, no Scrappy in Scooby Doo, no baby bugs bunny, etc  Pretty sure it's Wile E. Coyote no? Really surprised nobody else has commented on this. Yes, it's Wile. Ahem

"Super Genius" "I like the way that rolls out! Wile E. Coyote: Suuuuper Geeeenius!"

EDIT: I found the scene on YouTube... [Yay!](http://youtu.be/YIPr23xyoZg) This reminds me... remember KABLAM?  alas, fodder for another thread.  It was like Robot Chicken for kids. Prometheus and Bob was the best running skit.  "Allow me to introduce myself, my name is mud."  The E. stands for Ethelbert. Yup Wile E. Coyote as in he is wily. Definition of wily - : full of clever tricks : very clever. i.e. his self image.  How did I have to collapse so many comments before I found this? I didn't even notice the misspelling in the title.  My eyes just skimmed over it and read it as Wile.  wily

Edit- changed the link because Vimeo took down the episode after all the traffic. He's not on the road in most of that episode.

I don't know what to believe anymore. I don't really think any of these rules were meant to be set in stone. They were just things that Jones thought would make the premise funnier.

In fact, Jones directed that episode so even he himself took liberties with those 'rules'. They're more like guidelines really. Welcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss Turner . You best start believing in Looney-Tunes, you're in one!  http://i.imgur.com/bqxMKqT.jpg Highlight of MJ's career. /r/comeonandslam  man that first movie really is so solid  https://i.imgur.com/lqKpe2E.gif Holy shit that man has some shiny eyes. fun fact: all of the pirate characters in that movie wore eye-contacts of different sorts. Geoffrey Rush's (barbossa) were meant to give his a dead, yellowish tint. Depp even wore ones to give his eyes a "smoky" look. The shininess is probably from the contact.  https://i.imgur.com/lqKpe2E.gif The [Wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote_and_The_Road_Runner#Laws_and_rules) gives plenty of examples of the rules being broken Huh.&gt;In an interview years after the series was made, writer Michael Maltese said he had never heard of the "Rules." The animation notes for King of the Hill say Dale's cigarette should never be smoking. It's not a hard fast rule. http://m.imgur.com/a/PiJLk I just spent way too long reading all of that  Me too.  After I read your comment. It was worth it for the "animator's dream Peggy." "Don't draw skinny Redcorns. John Redcorn is taller and more muscular than Hank. That is not to say that Hank could not kick Redcorn's ass, if her were angry enough." "...if he was really pissed."

C'mon man it's right there. It does say "Unless specifically requested in the script". I thought that was only for the puffing out smoke part. My interpretation was both, [they show and mention both in that image.](http://i.imgur.com/AvSO4.png)

It costs more money to animate both streaming smoke and puffing smoke.  So unless it's essential to the plot there's no reason to pay for the extra man hours. I guess my point is... Unless I am misremembering they drew smoke coming out of his cigarette all the time. These are really guides more than they are rules. Maybe it was specifically asked for. Just all the time. These are amazing! Great tips for any illustrator/animator. I especially love [the one about the trees](http://i.imgur.com/2gkYN.png) I don't know about a subreddit but [here's the notes for Adventure Time](https://www.scribd.com/doc/14686737). You can see they talk about how things should be all noodley and surreal and characters can have between 3 and 5 fingers - it's just because that's the style they want to go for, they want surrealism and goofiness in the land of Ooo whereas they wanted realistic styling for Arlen, TX. NO Limp-wristed males, I'll tell you hwhat! Wow, this just made me appreciate KOTH even more. All the work they put in to give the show that perfect feel.

They didn't just say "well it's a cartoon fuck it", they really worked to make that show feel real.  These are great  No sexy Peggy, I tell you hwat. Worth it for rule #20 &gt; Animator's Dream Peggy

And now mine You know, there was always a sense of realism in the show in terms of  the plot of the episode and the setting of the show in general.

But this takes that realism to a whole new level. Wow, I never really thought about how demanding an animator's job must be. Huh,neat! is there a sub for design documents like this? Stupid, cheap Korean animators.  I like it specifically says "This can become that in Korea". (Unless specifically requested in script) That's awesome. Thanks for sharing! It's always fucking Korea
 So is that Chinese or Japanese? Animation process in Korea? I didn't know there was an animation process in Korea? Why would there be an animation process in Korea? The American artists only drew the important frames, then cheaper Korean animators filled in the rest. Gravity sure was his number one enemy though.
 Especially when he noticed it. Shouldve released all earthly attachments and entered the void *"Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void. Empty, and become wind."* -Wile E. Coyote There's a few episodes where Wiley speaks too. Also the coyote uses that pole and rocket which aren't acme products, theres other dialogue when he says "Y'OWW!!!!", im pretty sure that shrinking pipe might violate the rule where he has to be confined to the american midwest.... either way it was very entertaining Meh... The sounds are more like "meep meep!" Instead of "beep beep" Gigantic Explosion! They should have gone with 'Earthshattering Kaboom!' **Voice Characterizations: Mel Blanc**

Really knocked yourself out there with this one Mel. It's always nice when your contact obligates the studio to pay you for just hanging out when most of the time you have to bust your ass doing a whole bunch of voices.

Seriously, Mel Blanc was probably the most amazing voice actor ever. [DID SOMEBODY CALL THE FEELSMOBILE](https://moralauthority.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/3_speechless.jpg) [Mel Blanc](http://youtu.be/BnmJALXh_sI). That's actually amazing! They paid him for one beep, then they doubled it up on the soundtrack. Damn, I never realized how many assets they re-used.

Also, his tennis balls are baseballs.  His tennis balls are tennis balls, Tennis balls are either White or Yellow, and the Bright Yellow balls we see know only started really seeing play in the 70's, so in 1980 (when this cartoon was made) white balls would still be popular in tennis... Animation is expensive. just realized I lack the attention span for looney tunes.  that shits long It was a 9 minute cartoon... -_- Also, there was a Cartoon Network promo in Latin America for Acme Hour, where the Coyote is preparing the roadrunner for roasting. The coyote takes off his GENERIC BRAND rocket skaters. The slogan was: "ACME Hour. Because another brand wouldn't be the same".

(http://youtu.be/8kP2piN-03k) So you're sayin' there's a chance? I prefer the rules to "Pepe le Pew"...

1)  Pepe tries to rape cat

2)  Pepe never rapes cat 3) cat occasionally decides to rape Pepe 4) There is always a can of white paint nearby for some reason.  5) Hopping is always faster than desperate running. 5a) must be accompanied by theme music.  what a time to be alive I like your user name i like yout username 0.5) Cat is made to look like skunk And to smell like it too. "Sometimes you gotta take the pussy like Pepe" "Oscar, you are so mean. Isn't he, kids?"

"Yeah, Oscar, you're a grouch!"

"Bitch I live in a fucking trashcan!" i'm the poorest muthafucka on sesame street. ain't nobody helpin me.  "Get it together grouch"

"Get a job grouch" From wikipedia: 

In an interview years after the series was made, writer Michael Maltese said he had never heard of the "Rules." That's what all the lawyers tell the perps to claim. Didn't the roadrunner say meep, not beep? June Bellamy: Relax, Homer. You'll do fine. I'm June Bellamy. I do the voices of Itchy &amp; Scratchy.

Homer: You? But you're a lady.

June Bellamy: [as Itchy] She's a lady, all right.

June Bellamy: [as Scratchy] A beautiful lady.

Homer: [laughs] Hey, that really is you. How did you get to be so good?

June Bellamy: Oh, just experience, I suppose. I started out as Road Runner.

June Bellamy: [as Road Runner] Meep!

Homer: You mean "Meep, meep"?

June Bellamy: No, they only paid me to say it once, then they doubled it on the soundtrack. Cheap bastards.  That's some excellent writing.  I like how he used square brackets to denote when June was speaking in different voices. Gotta love the Simpsons. There's a reason they have aired for so long. "Very few cartoons are broadcast live. It's a terrible **strain** on the animators wrist." 

Edit: stupid SwiftKey!  STRAIN.  Man, it's such a good joke and you went and blew it.  From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beep,_beep_%28sound%29#Road_Runner_cartoons):

&gt;Although commonly quoted as "meep meep", Warner Brothers, the current owner of all trademarks relating to the duo, lists "beep, beep" as the Road Runner's sound, along with "meep, meep." According to animation historian Michael Barrier, Julian's preferred spelling of the sound effect was "hmeep hmeep".[1]

It also appears as "Beep Beep" in the Chuck Jones book that this list is taken from. this has been asked a few years ago on ask.metafilter and someone who actually knew Chuck Jones had [a story to share](http://ask.metafilter.com/112923/Its-Meep-Meep-dammit#1623148) 

&gt; *Failing that, does anyone have any relatives of Mel Blanc or Chuck Jones in their rolodex?*

&gt; Chuck was my grandfather's best friend, and for many years was essentially my sister's and my honorary uncle. The best Thanksgiving I ever spent was with Chuck AND Mel at the dinner table; it was a little like getting to live inside a Looney Toons cartoon for an afternoon, except about a million times better.
&gt; Anyway, based on this, I can confirm that the words written in Chuck's own hand are indeed Beep Beep. Having had the Road Runner himself pass me the gravy, however, I can confirm that he pronounced it Meep Meep.
 "Meep-meep! Zip-Bang!!" Mr. Garibaldi I was saddened when I learned that current showings of these cartoons omit the part when he hits the ground with a PAFFFfff and dust plume. It just cuts to a new scene before he hits. That was one of the most satisfying parts of this segment! So basically they have cut out half the content from episodes these days?

Where will it end? Would love it if Looney Toons and Merry Melodies were all on Netflix.  I'd binge watch the shit outta them. I heard this is fake. It's from [Chuck Jones's own book](http://www.amazon.com/Chuck-Amuck-Times-Animated-Cartoonist-ebook/dp/B00B225TGK/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=) (which you can Search Inside and see), but he lists them as "some of the rules" and gives them as an illustration of the kind of thinking that went into the cartoon.

This is from a section where he talks about the importance of rules in a comedic framework, and is intended to illustrate their process, rather than a guideline for the actual creation. Anachronistic Comic Sans and "beep beep" are the biggest giveaways here.  That's not Comic Sans. [Top is this document, bottom is same text in Comic Sans](http://i.imgur.com/EeBfnZQ.png). It looks completely different. The guys from Warner seems to believe it is "Beep, beep". There's even an episode with this name:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beep,_Beep_(film) [Seth MacFarlane](http://youtu.be/GL9SNw_1NP0?t=9m58s) broke rule 4 and rule 6 For a moment, I thought that said Todd McFarlane and expected something much darker. Wile E. Coyote*

/r/picturesoftext 10) That coyote is really a crazy clown Warner Brother's Studio enforced a strict production schedule of 5-weeks per animated short. 

Chuck Jones invented the Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote cartoons and these rules to cheat the schedule  saving time by reusing backgrounds and not worrying about lip-sync. This allowed him to pump out a short in three weeks, and spend more time on more ambitious shorts like *What's Opera Doc?*

Dude was a genius. Still a childhood favourite! Still feel sorry for the Coyote after all these years. Just like I feel sorry for Tom and think j
Jerry is a jerk. you need to watch some of the very first ones. It was much more evenly distributed violence, with Jerry getting plenty of abuse. I can't wait to see rule 34! On rule #2, doesn't the coyote get run over by trucks?
 because of instant holes or something.  He misuses an Acme product and gets run over by a truck or a train etc. Rule 2 and 8 are slightly annoying when read together. No outside force can harm coyote but gravity is his greatest enemy. 

 Those aren't mutually exclusive. Falling due to gravity is still something Coyote brought upon himself by setting his trap incorrectly, having faulty Acme products, or by simply being outsmarted by Road Runner.

In the strictest definition of 'outside forces', yes gravity is an outside force. But I think you are reading a bit too much into it here. Technically, for gravity to harm coyote, the earth has to be present. The effects of gravity are due to the energy transfers between coyote and earth. Imagine, if there was no earth, there would be no gravity. So we are in fact by default looking at the forces in the earth-coyote system, within which gravity is an internal force, not external.  But the impact is due to the ~~potential~~ kinetic energy [edit: released from the potential energy] which he himself built up while climbing so high in his pursuit.

If he didn't create the potential energy, gravity wouldn't be able to harm him. It's still his own fault. How Can Gravity Be Real if Earth Isn't Real?  It's Looney Tunes, not Logical Tunes.  Thank you, skidmark. Logical Tunes would be hilariously dry. That can only mean one thing..the gravity is coming from within the coyote. Which makes sense, he never falls until he notices that he is supposed to. There is no spoon.

 Technically, due to one of newtons laws, you pull back on the earth as much as the earth pulls on you. So the gravity technically does come from the coyote. He is a black hole...of sadness. Or gravity is actually an acme product. Well, it's true that gravity doesn't apply to him until he notices that he should be falling.  One could argue whether gravity is an outside force or not... Because there is a force exerted on the Coyote, but one can argue that the force is from himself. Gravity exerts equal force on both objects pulling them together, so the earth is no more causing the Coyote to fall than he himself is. acme made gravity I remember am episode where he got hit by a truck thinking it was the road runners beep. You do realize it's Wile E. Coyote. Not 'Wild'... Right? TIL Chuck Jones invented Comic Sans Vincent Connare designed the comic sans font to be based off the familiar hand-written comic lettering in 1994 because times new roman and other available fonts at the time were unsuitable for use in comics which were moving to computers for much of the work like typesetting. 

Since this is a page out of a book by Chuck Jones he either did that page specifically in comic sans to look more like handwriting, or it was a photocopy of his handwriting (unlikely) or something like that.  It's not comic sans but it's close  I thought the Roadrunner always said "Meep Meep" Wile E. Coyote does talk in one of his earliest (possibly first?) episodes. Where he faced off against Bugs Bunny and not the Road Runner. He often stated that he was Wile E. Coyote: Genius. At the end he refers to himself "My name is Mud" or something like that.

Also the Road Runner is often not on the road, usually by a cliffside or some such, but this is just nitpicking.
 In 8th grade, our physics teacher had us watch some Roadrunner cartoons and re-write the laws of physics in order to fit that world.  That was a fun assignment.  Rule 10 -  make sure this document is leaked and posted on Reddit every 6 months or so  My childhood is ruined. All this time I thought it was "meep-meep". Screen this. So did I. Its like my ears have been living a lie since my childhood. I couldve sworn Coyote spoke in an episode. They made them talk in an anniversary episode years later, iirc. Tour de fonts So ACME became Harbor Freight Tools? Now i get it.  Reminds me of that scene from Armageddon!

--------

**Rockhound (Steve Buscemi)**: Yeah, I remember this one. It's where the, uh, the coyote sat his ass down in a slingshot then he strapped himself to an Acme rocket. Is that - is that what we're doin' here?

**Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis)**: [under his breath] Rockhound.

**Rockhound**: No, no, really, because it didn't work out too well for the coyote, Harry!

**Harry Stamper**: [talking over him] Hey, Rock. Knock it off.

**Truman (Billy Bob Thornton)**: Well, actually, we have a lot better rockets than the coyote. You're out of your element, Rock! I can hear Buscemi's voice... I don't wanna close my eyyyes!!! This movie really is great WILE E., not Wild. E It's truly amazing how much happens behind the scenes with some of this stuff. Anyone know if this type of thing existing for Tom and Jerry? [I never thought about it until Rule 5. I feel like an idiot. ](http://i.imgur.com/IhTQCRm.gif) Rule 4 is never followed. I don't think I've ever even heard anyone say "beep beep" on that show. There are, however, several examples of roadrunner saying "meep meep".  As a fat guy, gravity is also my greatest enemy. Gravity always wins. I would love to see the sketch beneath these rules. You can see a bit of a dust cloud I think at least rule 5 has been broken multiple times. That's fucking bullshit because I remember when he painted a picture of a road and put it on the path of the runner so it would crash into it but instead it went right through to some other dimension but it didn't work for him.  still on the road if it worked for him But it wasn't "ineptitude" on the Coyote's part, it was an "outside force"  he was inept enough to think he could defy physics like the roadrunner.   That's broken logic because it could mean anything. A lightning strikes the Coyote, well he was too inept to think he wouldn't be struck by a lightning  it's looney tunes, dude, we'd be disappointed if it wasn't looney logic.

but, no, coyote knew it was only paint on the wall, and ran into it anyway.  what roadrunner did isn't part of it, even though it should be Joke's on you,  they still got their picture taken. [Touche](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/owwow.gif) Fuck she is really pretty. [Jason Sudeikis is a lucky man](http://www.eonline.com/news/440085/jason-sudeikis-thanks-sex-for-weight-loss-olivia-wilde-is-the-greatest-workout-partner-) I was hoping for a nipple slip.  You wanted to see Jason Sudeikis's nipple?  Yes. They're actually my second cousins! I only met then once though... never talked to them... and they won't accept my Facebook requests... Norm from Cheers is my uncle though, and he actually kinda remembers my name sometimes Why would they accept your Facebook requests if you've never talked to them? You've got a point... :( Both are your second cousins? In a cartoonish way. Like the caricature of a pretty woman. Spot on!

I couldn't put my finger on why she made me go "oooohh!", and just think "She's really pretty".

You described it very well.

EDIT: I cant english She looks like Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite here. What movie is it from? Google Image Search says: [The Change Up](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1488555/) It's just ok It certainly isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but yeah, funny premise, actors I like to watch, and it's still only ok. [Just according to Keikaku](http://i.imgur.com/RReZaf3.jpg) Please tell me someone didn't actually make subs that infuriating. lol, its a long standing joke in the Fan-subbing community.

IIRC, it started when some Uber Fans started complaining that the Fan Translaters were "Localizing" words from Japanese that didn't have proper translations to English. So they did this to piss off those guys. Lol that's hilarious That kid with the vest was ready for both a picture and a measurement. Well the one kid with the reflective vest is clearly a civil engineer trolling the shit out of those other fucks his age, clearly not on his level.  9/10 would watch him troll them again.

edit:  civil =/= civic :( The kids found out he was taking a survey and he's just waiting for them to figure it out and get out of his way. I bet he moved the survey stake as well because fuck you that's why. trivia: In Upper Canada, movement of a survey monument was punishable by death without the benefit of clergy.

I've written letters to several successive prime ministers' asking them to reinstate this as a rule but no dice.  haha.  now *THAT* would be fun to reinstate. Fun fact: In a pinch, children's corneas can be used as a reflecting prism.  I don't there will be a situation where I'll use children's eye as a prism. You obviously lead a boring life.   ..... and a children's-eye-prism will pep up his life. It will easily make it more colorful.  Buy one now! Hell, buy 5! I dated a civil engineer once. Nothing civil about them. Two types of civil engineers: 1.) Outgoing, personable smart-guys that like a mix of math/science and the outdoors.  2.) Backwoods camouflage-wearing hillbillies that decided to major in something that allows them to play with wet cement and mud. Don't forget the third type: 

Introverted people that can barely talk to another human, but are good with Microstation. We keep them on the design team, they don't come to the public meetings. Fuck Microstation and their lack of command line...AutoCAD!!!!Then again, when you deal with AutoCAD you have to deal with the never ending and frustrating "UNHANDLED EXCEPTION", the times I have cried in defeat are in the thousands... And dont mention opening a .dwg from a later version of AutoCAD fuck this. But Ill take AutoCAD over Microstation any day I'll take any version of AutoCAD over Civil3D...it is the slowest and most ridiculous flavor of AutoCAD ever created...and Microstation is just unamerican. This. Try being a female engineer and having classes full of these guys staring at you because you happen to have boobs. Hot. Try being a male engineer and having classes full of guys and nothing to stare at during boring classes. So, about these boobs... I take it there are 2 of them? 

[Was in electrical engineering... felt awfully bad about the 3 girls in my classes. Our lab instructors really should have allowed 3-person teams instead of just 2] Microstation sucks, go Civil 3D! I'm both of these, maybe I should shoot for civil instead of mechanical.  I don't know about that...Mechanical engineers tend to be very hubris and big headed and never like to be told they are wrong... No you're wrong we're not big headed Now touch his oranges  My first instinct was to jump to my brothers' defenses and tell you you're wrong. Then my second thought was that I did once consider a mechanical engineering degree, so maybe you're on to something... I worked as a Designer (I identify as a Mechanical Engineer more than anything though)at pretty big firm, we did everything in house from design to engineering to manufacturing, so I got to experience every major form of engineer...I never wanted to get into an argument with a Mechanical Engineer, it was never worth it. I hated the Structural Engineers because they would never want to work in 3D and did nothing but bitch about it. It's always came down to reading numbers off a book or chart, everything is in a table or list, the answers to the building the world i found can always be found by looking it up in the index of some crazy book that was created before I was born. 

Now I work in a Civil Engineering field and every one of these guys usually has a beard, A Carhart jacket and camo. Always clutching there insulated mug of coffee.  [deleted] I woulda asked if I kewd pour some cement in his car park for all intensive purposes. I think that spelling of could is the very first time I can't even... God this is so spot on.  Just graduated with civil engineering from a school in Wisconsin, and the amount of camo my classmates wore was astounding.   Sounds like you need a chemical engineer.  Troll Log - Day 254

I have been accepted as one of their own.  Or hes just a surveyor  They look innocent enough, but I wonder what their angle is.  TIL these things are not cameras Hold up...if these things don't take pictures, what do they do? They measure precise angles and distances. It's called a total station. Surveyors use them to pin corners of properties/buildings  and such.  This comment is on a tangent, not everyone gets it. Are you calling us [obtuse?](http://i.imgur.com/wg6jvEs.jpg)  No, we're just trying to correct the acute lack of puns in this thread. You're right you know. Az I muth tell you, that wasnt a pun. But it really struck a chord. Only surveyor's kids will get this! Stern... shoutout to /r/surveying /r/landsurveying because all you people are freaking out haha

 I know your pain/amusement all too well. I run a ZF 3D Scanner along side a Leica Total Station for a majority of my projects. I constantly have curios **adults** decide they need to go primal and creep up as close to the devices as possible and stick their nose right in the lens before they ask what the device is.   
Worst part is, their ignorance cause me to have to either resection because they touched the Total Station or have to restart my scanner (really aggravating when you're doing 200+ 6.5 minute scans).  
If it wouldn't complicate my job, I would attach radiation warning signs to it. If you want to learn who lives in a neighborhood, just set up some survey equipment. I was a party chief and an instrumentman for like 15 years, on and off.

This statement is 100% true. You set up anywhere and everyone comes by to ask what you're doing. Standard response is telling them that you're running a highway through.

One time I was working on an old city building that was coming down to put up condos. Spot was right across from a slaughterhouse that the neighborhood was holding protests about. This woman comes up to me and asks what I'm surveying, so I point at the building. 

She then starts talking about the protests and how they're trying to get the slaughterhouse shut down because its impacting property values. Then asks me what they're putting in in place of this building.

Me: "oh, another slaughterhouse". 

Look on her face was magnificent.  I always tell them it's an underground airport. That usually gets them. that is brilliant.  OK, that's my new goto. I'm usually, "putting in a new Walmart" or "a new highway". &gt; Standard response is telling them that you're running a highway through.

THIS.
Civil Eng here, 5 years spent surveying.  Default response every time.

Last summer spent most of my time on a 400 series hwy, people would actually pull over to ask what I was working on....ON A HIGHWAY!  Oh man the first summer I worked on a crew we were working on the 401. Like on the goddamned 401, in August. It was like working on the surface of the sun.

After about an hour we agreed that this was stupid and left. As far as I know, the IB's/SIB's we were supposed to be setting are still in a pile on the berm next to the highway.  Ok.  Story time.


I work for a municipal engineering company.  My wife teaches school in one of our municipalities.  We sent a crew to survey the street in front of her school for a drainage project.


They locked the school down and called 911...because "there were perverts in front of the school with a van taking pictures of the kids."  


Our survey crew keeps their gear in a van.  Those guys may be a little weird, but I don't think that they were photographing anything with their total station and prism poles.


The local cops, the state police, and the neighboring towns police all rolled in hard onto the scene.  After a phone call to our boss from the local police (we work with/for them), the situation ended.  We now joke around with the survey crew 'to keep away from the junior highs'.


TL;DR school administrators are idiots.
 I've worked at 3 different survey companies and encountered this at every one.  

Survey crews are all made up of weirdos. I've never met a normal person (I include myself in this) working in the field. They're all bonkers in their own way.  I've heard there's pretty decent money in surveying.

I'm pretty weird and don't like my current job. Hire me? Do not become a surveyor. It is a terrible job and there's no money in it.

You're outside all day, every day. Cold, hot, rain, wind (oh dear god the wind). 

The work sucks. You're either the instrumentman and standing still all day, with your fingers freezing because you can't have gloves on to deal with the instrument's tiny as fuck buttons, or you're the party chief, responsible for the crew's output, or the rear chainman/donkey, cutting line, setting bars, and crouching to hold the chain where necessary.

Plus you deal with stupid questions all day long, or you're on a construction site, where you're the lowest paid person on the site, guaranteed. 

Do anything else. Go learn how to fit pipe or cut wood.  You forgot to mention the critters, like the occasional yellow-jacket burrow. Wait...surveyors still use chains in 2015? That is news to me =P

Everything you describe is the entry level, grunt work stuff. You aren't actually talking about Licensed Professional Surveyors -- you are talking about basic field crews who may not have much more education than a McDonald's employee. 

But if you actually learn real Land Surveying, take classes, get a degree, and get licensed, then the money really starts rolling in. A P.L.S. also doesn't do a lot of that grunt work that you mentioned -- a good chunk of his time can be spent in an air conditioned office managing crews, doing calcs and processing data.  Oh fuck yeah. Once you've got your OLS designation there's some decent coin to be made. 

But the guy's question ended with "hire me", meaning he wasn't looking to go to school, and was looking to walk on to the gig, which means you're going to be a survey crew member. 

Anyone who's got their professional designation isn't working in the fucking field though. I've seen surveyors leave the office maybe 10 times in the entire time I worked in the profession. 

Also, chain was the synonym for tape on my crew. Not like an actual Gunter's Chain.  This is SO true. I'm just in my surveying *class* and even I get this. My prof is nuts, but in a good way. &gt; 
&gt; 

I always told them they were going to redirect the freeway through this neighborhood.

&gt;Oh, you'll probably be getting a letter about it My dad did survey work as well when he was in his 20s.

They were surveying a spot in a really tony neighborhood (Rosedale, in Toronto) and someone asked them what they were doing, so he responded with that exact phrase.

The person went home and called their member of parliament, their city councillor, and the fucking mayor. A senior city staffer showed up an hour later and to check up on what they were doing because they had no knowledge of a highway being zoned for the area. I always wanted to grab those people and shake them. C'mon dude the guy across the street is selling his fucking house man go back inside! There was a 15 year party and you were the chief? Talk about ballin' It took me time to work my way up. Waited out so many overdoses. You have no idea.  Our response was always "halfway house".  &gt;party chief

Most awesome job title. Never thought of it this way. Time to make some ~~awesome~~ terrible jokes in class this week

 I have never spoken to another surveyor apart from the small company i work for in the UK, and we say its for a bypass/motorway/casino. Its such a strange gig isn't it? 

You're alone most of the day while simultaneously experiencing the exact same thing as many other people doing the exact same thing, but have no means of conveying the similarities, because you can't tell other people as they have no frame of reference, and you don't know any other surveyors because you don't work with a bunch of them.

Like trying to explain to someone what its like when you've got ideal line and are trying to get a measurement but some halfwit wanders just slightly in front of the transit and throws it off. Its impossible to convey the frustration this creates to a non-surveyor, but I guarantee it happens to everyone running the gun at least 5x a day.  Trolling nosey neighbors was probably the best part of the job. I remember doing some work near prime beachfront property and telling someone an oil rig was going in right in the centre of the beautiful view I'm sure he had paid a fortune for  I've been written up for telling a lady that we were marking corners of an ancient burial ground. 

 'Strip mall' was my favourite response to rural Saskatchewan farmers.

Never came up with a clever response to "what are ya doin', lookin' gold?" though. &gt; Standard response is telling them that you're running a highway through.

That seems to be the surveyors version of "the floor is lava". Everyone around the world is using it and it seems that everyone came up with it on their own. Or service foreclosed homes. Everyone in the neighborhood wants to know whats going on. Pretty much. Except be careful when you're surveying in the ghetto - don't call it a **gun** like you usually do.

(Explanation: the total station instrument that it set up on the tripod legs *shoots* a focused beam of light out to measure distances, thus why field surveyors nickname their instruments "guns.")

Source: personal experience - former instrument man, now Survey CAD drafter; been in the Civil/Survey field for 12 years. If possible, stick some lath around it with flagging. That usually keeps people away from my Leica TS02. I've had morons pick up my back sight and toss it on the ground. Always happens when I'm not around to see it of course, but you can put your instrument/backsight in a goddamn enclosure with road pylons and flagging and some asshole will still manage to bump it.  This summer, a man came up to me and started asking some unrelated questions. I had THREE traffic cones (in a quiet street) around my total station. When he went away, he freakin' tripped into one of the tripod's leg and didn't even care. 


It's expensive and fragile (and screws my work), please stay away! Yup one bad bump and the whole thing has to be recalibrated. I've had someone almost run over my scanner before. Would've been a $150k mistake Survey says..."This is not a camera" And the surveyor says it 30 times a day.  I'm 25 and always figured that was a camera...What is it? It's for land surveying. Basically to measure plots of land or buildings very accurately. There is a second pole which is used to line it up.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying /r/explainlikeimfive/ It's called a "total station" because it does the two main things needed in surveying, A. measures distance, and B. measures angles.

It uses a laser rangefinder to measure the distance between itself and a reflective prism.  The prism is mounted on a rod which the rod man moves around to various locations (often property corners but can be anything they want to locate).

The angles are measured by aiming at a "zero" point, just a baseline location (again, often a property corner but can be anything) and then the total station records the vertical and horizontal angles "turned" when the total station is rotated to point at the rod.

Once you tell the total station to take a measurement, it shoots the laser at the prism to get the distance and measures the angles at the same time, which is then displayed on the screen of the total station.  The operator either writes these numbers down in a field book or it's recorded in a digital recorder.

Back at the office, the draftsman takes all those numbers and uses them to make a map of the property.

Surveying is really fun, I did it for a few years and miss it.  I still can't walk down a street without constantly looking for property corners.  

**TL;DR** expensive laser tag.   /r/explainlikeimfour It's a camera I needed a good laugh more than you know. Got a real sensible chuckle out of that one.  [obligatory](http://i.imgur.com/himZD0M.gif) /r/explainlikeimthree Ba ba Boo boo /r/xpdilnimtwo Devise that determines the terrestrial or three-dimensional position of points and the distances and angles between them...err I mean *Tonka* I just showed it to my 3 year old and told her it was for measuring the ground. She asked me how it works. Thanks, /u/kepleronlyknows, for making sure my 3 year old doesn't think I am an idiot. They shine pretty light at flashy thing, then do writing stuff. /r/ExplainLikeImLenny Look at the sunset...shhhh It measures distances and angles with lasers. Ha sorry.

Think of it like a fancy protractor (do four year olds know what a protractor is? how about angle measurer thingy) and tape measurer.   It's a fancy tape measure + protractor in one. There you go - perfect example.  Surveyor/Civil Engineer approved.   Theodolite.  My only question to this is how do you know where to 'start' the survey, if that makes any sense.  Say I needed to have someone come and survey where the boundaries of my property are.  Who's to say he isn't off the mark to begin with, thus making the subsequent measurements wrong. Good question.  There are a few ways you'd start but here's the general method we used.

We'd start by locating as many property corners on your block as possible, and then set up on one of your corners (if possible, if not you'd set up on a neighboring corner or a temporary point of your choosing), then measure all the distances and angles of the neighboring corners.  The more the better, and the further away the better (longer distances reduces errors in turning the angles).

You then compare the location of all these found corners with the plat, which is the "official" map of your block or subdivision.  If the measured locations match up reasonably well to the recorded locations on the plat, you know the neighboring corners (or your own corners) are in the right places.  Then you go about your survey.

In older subdivisions, many corners are missing or in the wrong location, so that's when you start getting tricky with problem solving.  I've seen entire houses located on property lines or even on completely the wrong lot.  Then it goes to the lawyers I guess.   We've just completed a golf course renovation at the country club where I work. During the course of the project we found out that two houses built in 1963 has back yard property lines that extended out across a man-made lake and a few feet onto the 17th green. The homeowners could have built a nice little bridge and set up a BBQ near the pin and have been totally within their rights. It was fun to watch our Director of Agronomy go pale when he saw the survey. Just to add, there's often buried metal rods that denote these 'starting points'.  When I had the civvies come out to do a couple of my plats, they had trouble finding one so they broke out the metal detector.  Of course they had the general area correct, but took some tools to find the specific spot. Since most everything is surveyed to some point, you use points in nearby properties.  There are also [landmarks on every bridge in the US](https://wyeastblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/sahaliefallsbridge27.jpg) (with elevation if you need that).  That is all public info available at your county clerks office.  Part of being a surveyor is research, pulling the maps and deeds for all of the surrounding plots and making sure they all match up.  If they don't, you go back further in time to when they did and make your case as to why the original property line is actually over here and not where they think it is.  

My dad has been a surveyor for over 30 years and at this point he is able to use his own points for reference.  You may have to go a couple of plots over to tie in, but that is better then verifying someone elses points.  He has had several jobs where he has already done the surrounding properties, you just have to go out and make sure the pins are where you put them and you're done. It's known as the Point-of-Beginning (P.O.B.)

You would set a benchmark with an object that is known to be stable and will not move, and base everything off that. Sometimes you can use a USGS benchmark, if there's one around. I've seen pk nails driven into large boulders, and even railroad spikes driven into telephone poles. Could be anything really, as long as it's solid, immovable, and easy to reference. What you use is also dependent on the level of confidence you need. For something like a property boundary you'd want to use something more official like a USGS benchmark. For your driveway layout you could use a pk nail in the sidewalk. 



 The railroad spikes in telephone poles are really only good for elevation, and unless you or someone you personally know and trust set it, then it's useless.  We'd do a bench loop (to determine elevation) and if we ran across a spike, we'd include it, but we'd use whatever elevation we calculated from it - not necessarily what's written on it.  Also, the bolts on a fire hydrant (typically the bolt closest to facing the street) and another one - tree trunks*.  

*Surveyors know that trees grow from the top - a random point in a tree trunk 2' out of the ground won't "grow" any higher.  So, if you set a spike in a tree trunk, 10-20 years from now, that spike will still be at the same elevation.  

And PK nails are used to set TBMs (temporary benchmarks) - so if I'm out working and set up on a property corner (a fixed point) and I need to get to another fixed point that I can't see (let's say it's around the corner from where I am), I'll have my rod man pound a PK nail into the pavement, then he fixes his prism over that nail.  I shoot it, now I have that exact point located.  I can then set up on that point, "backsight" my previous point (the rod man goes and sets up on the spot I previously was at and I shoot that point) and my total station now knows that I'm set up on that nail.  He can proceed with his rod and he finds the next point I'm looking for.  I shoot that point, then he goes back and backsights that PK nail and now the total station knows the original point, the location of the PK nail and the second fixed point I was trying to locate.  (if any of this makes sense)   http://i.imgur.com/jca3Z9Z.gifv I miss it too, man.  I did it for several years when I was in school, then moved into an office role.  Some of those days out in the field were rough as shit - cutting line, brush so thick you couldn't see 2' in front of your face, snakes everywhere, stomping around in waders with water up to your waist, sweltering in 100+ degree heat, and freezing when the temps got low.  

But after I got away from it, I look back - that was some of the most interesting work I've ever done.  Just me and a couple of other guys out in the woods with our equipment and our station - very calming.   Ok so you know what a range finder is? It kinda shoots a laser that gets reflected back, then the computer calculates how long it takes from the time the laser was shot to the time it bounced back and hit the thingy that shot the laser. So if it knows how fast lasers travel and it times how long it takes said laser to travel, it can figure out a distance! 
So think of it as a super accurate and really expensive range finder. It shoots a laser at a little reflective target thing that was set up on another tripod on one of the corners of the property or line he's measuring (or it might be held on a stick by another guy) so the laser hits the reflector then bounces back to the machine. It can also calculate angles by either measuring how much the machine needs to turn to shoot the next target and/or fairly basic geometry. 

Remember in middle school math class when you had to do those questions that were like "if the distance from tree x to tree y is 5 meters and the angle between tree x and tree z on the other side of the river is 83 degrees, how wide is the river?" and you thought "well this is bullshit when am I ever going to use this?" Well this machine is what a person would use to figure that out in the real world (ya know, unless you would rather use a tape measurer and a buddy with a boat). However most times you see stuff like this is on construction sites or marking off properties. Its a total station, there is another guy standing out of shot with a pole with a prism on top of it that reflects the laser the instrument shoots back at it to measure its distance from and angle that the laser reflects to finds the x,y,z coordinates relative to the instrument.  Some extra info, those totalstations are expensive as fuck.They range from $10,000 up to $30,000 They're not all that expensive. You can get decent Trimbles for under $5k.

 "Decent" Trimble? Haha Birdhouse. Got it. That's a totalstation, looks like a Leica construction model, so it's not a full featured one. But they do lots of neat things, mostly just geometric stuff though, figuring out distances and angles in a very very accurate way. Then saving it to a file so you can import it into a program. 

They can capture and record any point it can see using prisms. It bounces laser beams (hundreds of them at a time to get an accurate average reading) out and back, measures the time and angle and gives you all sorts of numbers.

The accuracy is generally within 1-3mm, although the newest robotics with the right pressure and temperature settings can determine distance accurately sub 1 mm. That's tedious though and rarely ever needed by a client. Usually most are satisfied if accuracy is within a 1cm.

Source: I used to survey. It's a Topcon.

Source: I still survey definitely a Topcon. Leica's are all that robin's egg blue-ish color It's a telescope when you want to goof on the job.

But when your boss comes around, you call it a [*total station*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_station) Those hats are adorable. I was doing work experience with my dad, a land surveyor using this equipment, near a block of flats. My dad had gone to fetch something from the car and left me looking after this "camera". A couple minutes pass and a woman approaches me in a sharp tone. "excuse me?! what do you think you're doing, do you have permission for this?" 
I was very confused as to what she meant and just kind of stared at her with a confused look, she got more cross and started threatening to call the police. 
luckily my dad arrived while she was yelling at me and asked what the hell was going on. She asked him the same questions does he have permission to do this blah blah blah. He had caught on that she thought this was a camera and not a piece of land surveying equipment and told her that of course he has permission to do this he is surveying the land for the owner. 
She still didn't understand, threatened to call the police because we were "taking pictures of people in their homes" and had saw us do so. My dad tried to explain further but she wasn't having any of it. 
Eventually she stormed off. Shortly after the police arrived, my dad explained what had just happened to which they had a good chuckle at the woman's expense and left us to it.

**TL;DR** stupid woman thought me and my dad were using this as a camera, taking photos of people and called the police. I surveyed for years - everyone thinks it's a camera.  When we used to work in the ghetto areas, it'd get exhausting - kids would come up every couple of minutes, "take my picture!  take my picture!"  - so we'd turn towards them, pretend to press some buttons and tell them okay.  

Another thing - working in the shadier areas - people will try to steal a total station the second you get 4-5' away from it.  They don't even know what it is, nor do they care - they just assume it's some expensive-ass camera.  We'd be talking over two-ways and my rod man would come over the radio with a "hey, come here and look at this.."  The second you get a few feet from it, inevitably you'd have people start oddly walking up to the total station, all creepy looking.  We'd run back and you'd see them scatter.   I think every surveyor has had the same experience. People knocking the tripod trying to look through it or trying to steal it because it looked expensive. They are expensive.  In Chicago I had a group of 3 teens try to take off with my total station while I was looking through it. Yes. I was lining up a shot and bam. Kid grabbed the tripod, took about ten running paces, tripped over one of the legs and the thing smashed into a thousand pieces on the street.  That is so fucking cute. I did land surveying in Atlanta for 5 years and the most common phrases I heard were "Are you guys about to widen the road" and "Don't take my picture with that". People would also duck out of the way like it was a camera.   Land surveyor here. EVERYONE thinks were just widening roads all the time.  lol, how cute.....i have been surveying for about 15 years and this is nothing compared to working in the states were there is a good bit of urban development funding in which you find yourself surveying in the ghetto. which means rather than some cute kids wanting their picture taken you have teenage thugs wanting to know wtf i am doing taking picture of the local crack houses.  I ran one of these for like 15 years, through school and between gigs.

Legit, every single day I could count on this happening. "Oh taking pictures, smile!"

YES, BECAUSE THIS TOTAL STATION LOOKS JUST LIKE A CAMERA YOU FUCKING DONKEY HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE.

Little kids though? Shit man, you just smile and wave.  "Hey kids, smile for the camera" 

"Should i smile"

"Sorry, did i get in the photo?"

"Are you from google maps?"

No, fuck off. Allll the time. Grown ass men staring at it waving We were once laying out a building foundation next to a Walmart and I guess the Walmart workers were doing some sort of cleaning the streets thing. Anyway they walk up behind my eyeman and one of them asks if he will take their picture. Without even turning around he says, "It's actually not a camera." Then she asks again and he turns around and tries his best to be civil says, "Look this isn't a camera. All it does is measure distances. It doesn't take pictures." With a leave me alone tone. Had he been paying attention though he would have seen the camera in the woman's hand and wouldn't have looked like an asshole.  I just want to point out - for you other surveyors/CE guys out there, is this not an awesome thread?  

Very rarely I get one I can expound on for hours with other dudes that know exacty what the hell I'm talking about!   I get inboxed of every new comment to this thread and I promise you every surveyor of reddit is freaking the hell out right now lol ;D Pfft trigonometry, when am I going to use this in real life?

EVERY GOD DAMN DAY SON Dudes and dudettes :)  Civil engineer here. This thread is awesome Civil Engineer here. I have had so many people try to steal this piece of equipment, its just plain silly.
Story time though:
I was once doing a site visit and was staking out distances with a measuring wheel. A gentleman walks up and asks "how do you ride that thing?" I replied with "I clinch my cheeks real tight." I've left a Trimble S6 set up on the corner of the freeway offramp and a major road. This was Thanksgiving weekend, it sat there for 4+ days and was still level when I arrived Monday! 

I don't usually let stuff like this slip my mind, but when I drove by on Monday I remember asking myself who was already working this early. It wasn't until I got to the office did I notice the case was rather light. 

We've had total stations stolen while in use in broad daylight on this job. So yeah, I was lucky as fuck. Aw thats adorable! Is this in Poland?  Something about the house in the background. I got that same feeling - everything in this pics feels polish. I worked for a company like that once and two teens kept making faces. The guy behind it was easily annoyed and they ticked him off. After a while he said: "I can't take pictures of you, I don't want to break the camera". One of the girls ran away crying. I was laughing my ass off. I was with a colleague at a career fair demoing a thermal IR camera a few back and had a group of kids that featured one horribly rude little bastard. I stealthily flicked a few drops of water at his crotch so when I fired up the camera to show them the display it looked like he had piss drops all over his pants. Little fucker got to learn what is like to be the brunt of everybody's jokes that day. I hope it made him think twice about being awful to his peers. I had no idea there were so many surveyors on reddit.  We need our own subreddit.  Which would probably be the most boring subreddit. Used to annoy the hell out of me when I was working with a surveyor, "Do you wanna take my picture?" No, it's a theodolite, it does not take pictures, it measures angles and distances, and even if it WAS a camera, why on earth would I want a picture of you? I have always wanted to know what one actually sees when looking through one of those. 

edit:spelling Its just a [telescope](https://d1u1p2xjjiahg3.cloudfront.net/09857153-a11a-46aa-9f64-35d926d786a9.jpg) used to aim the laser at its target. [Aim for the centre of the prism, and pew pew laser.](http://puu.sh/gjs4h/dd8500fea9.jpg) Ha, kids are fucking dumb. Look at those fools. It's like they don't even know what surveying equipment is! Amateurs. ELI5 what do they do with those things?  I still have no idea what those things are, what they're called, how they work, or what they're for.  They steal your soul and give it to an engineer. I was surveying in the ghetto with the Sokkia 3B and high school kids got off the bus. Everyone of them struck a pose. It was pretty funny. "We on the news!" Plot Twist: it's a camera^1 and the guy is a pedophile.

^1 A hidden camera. So goddamn adorbz  Haha, oh children. WHAT FUCKING IDIOTS!
 I have this happen daily. Grown construction workers walking by making funny faces and striking hilarious poses. Never gets old. Is that a little cop in the front? Are they not? Hahaha... The land by my house would often get surveyed and I was always scared to go in front of the "camera" its a laser to measure angles and distance, not a camera. I just tell people the laser will burn a hole in their eyeballs. That's so (a)cute Well, they still got their picture taken. I think they outsmarted you, OP. It's not?  Then why did I have to take off my clothes? I have a small telescope which I used to use a lot when I was a teenager.
Once I took it outside during the day, to watch sunspots.
An old lady saw me and asked me if the mayor was finally going to build the road he promised.
I told her I was just watching sunspots and tried to explain what they were, but she was convinced I was making plans for a road but was not allowed to disclose it.
 How does this thing work?  I have always wondered. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying

Basically, it makes a grid to know where property is at. awesome, thanks. Heh, you should shoot in the air to scare them off. I was on site surveying and I couldn't understand why 3 kids kept cycling back and forth at full pace. Turns out, they thought I set up a speed camera. Mom, there was a construction worker taking pictures of us at the playground... Well, they are in a picture. Well thank god SOMEBODY had a real camera. So I've always wondered what you see through those things... Anyone care to ELI5? [Here's an imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/rPscq). Wtf? Why are they pointed at cows? because the guy wanted to take a picture of cows from really far away.  That's a great album. :)

"And in *this* one, we're hunting the graceful and elusive, orange-backed rodman..." You see whatever you point at.   It's a scope at a fixed magnification with a crosshair for finding your target.  It's weird seeing surveying stuff on the front page. A lot of the new total stations can take pictures now.

/r/landsurveying  I'll leave a shoutout to those sub in my comment :D Found it!  Just outside of Cape Town in South Africa.  http://www.sanbi.org/gardens/kirstenbosch/tree-canopy-walkway Cool, google streetview has also been there. [Here's](https://www.google.nl/maps/@-33.989279,18.429135,3a,75y,51.65h,51.54t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1sI8JA2O0Rp-AAAAQfCTCN8g!2e0!3e11) the view!  This actually isn't Street View. This is a user created [photosphere](https://www.google.com/maps/about/contribute/photosphere/). Anyone can submit photospheres to Google Maps. You can see the attribution in the top, left corner. It was created by some guy named Ulric Jooste. You would never see this many stitching errors in Street View. Also, someone mentioned that the bridge was a lot shorter than they would have guessed from the original pic, but there's actually no way to tell how long it is from this photosphere. In both Google Street View and [Business View](http://www.google.com/maps/about/partners/businessview/#utm_campaign=en&amp;utm_medium=van&amp;utm_source=en-van-na-us-gns-svn), panos are spaced at regular intervals. In Business View, for instance, [I used to be a Business View photographer] there has to be a pano every fifteen feet so that users can get a feeling for how big the space is. But there are no such restrictions with user submitted photospheres. This sphere is only five panos, but you have no way of knowing how far apart they are spaced. Since this bridge is apparently 142 yards long, he probably has them spaced about 25-30 yards apart. Those are pretty big jumps from one pano to the next, giving the illusion that the bridge is fairly short. I feel like I'm playing Myst. Very cool, thanks for the link! It's shorter than I would have guessed from the first pic. It says 130m, I wouldn't call that short for a treetop walkway. Google view looks as if they mounted the camera on a speeding mountain bike. I love that you guys sound so enthusiastic about this  [deleted] Although this is just a user-created [photosphere](https://www.google.com/maps/about/contribute/photosphere/), Google does have [Trekkers](http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2013/06/apply-now-to-be-next-google-maps-trekker.html) and [Trikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr-4Aln1Il8) for off-road stuff like this. Is this real life? I guess I can cross going here off my bucketlist since I'm basically there! Street view doesn't give you the sense of the swaying of the bridge. It's supposed to represent being in the canopy layer of the trees. Man, how do you get this job? Here, just strap on a camera and go to super cool places around the world.  Google doesn't have to pay for content like this. People create it for free.

It's cool of them to have information on handicap accessibility as well  Thank you so much. I'll be visiting Cape Town again this summer. Definitely will try to check this out. Kirstenbosch is so worth it, even this photo doesn't do it justice.  We happened to visit when the ice plants and proteas were in full bloom.  Every time we walked around another corner, we wondered how one single place could contain so much beauty. God Damnit, I went to Kirstenbosch in 2009 on a once in a lifetime trip for me. And of course this wasn't built yet. But I will echo others that it is a great place, not to be missed.  You never know. I thought it was a once in a lifetime trip for me as well, but now I'm going back. If you guys want to see some more pics, I actually did a photo shoot of my wife for her blog just after it opened. It was actually a lot shorter than we expected it to be, still cool though. [Link](http://www.sistersinhijab.com/?p=1981)  Its the [Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden](http://www.sanbi.org/gardens/kirstenbosch) and the walkway is called the 'Boomslang' which is Afrikaans and means tree snake.

The place is huge and it's beautiful.

In summer they have concerts with awesome local bands and also sometimes have movie nights where you can just chill on the grass and have a picnic.

Great place! So "Boomslang skins" are actually a thing? Do you have Lacewing flies too? My little friends and I are thinking of brewing up a batc of Polyjuice potion. Yep, we have Lacewing Flies. We have Leeches too - but you will have to bring your own Fluxweed, we are all out of Fluxweed. That is some really nice woodwork. Any idea what kind of wood that might be?  Nope. Looks like Bermuda beachwood probably from the southwest coast of Africa by the color (although that could be a staining process) and the texture from what i can tell.  The decking is made from stained pine battens, with sustainably harvested Paduak wood from west Africa used for the curving handrails. Woodworker here.  It's almost definitely West African Padauk.  Most of it, at least.  Im looking for a wood that would work great outside for a large planter for a tree. I love the color and look of this wood, is this more of a stain that can be achieved with other woods or is this the natural color? Any suggeations for more easily/cheapet woods that would finish similarly? This photo shows the natural color of the Padauk (after a finish is applied).  Typically, the best wood for an outdoor planter is cedar, due to its availability (assuming US), cheap cost, and especially its natural resistance to water.  Eastern red cedar has a really nice natural look, but you can still stain any cedar, it just might not take it as well as pine will.  

If you definitely want to achieve the look of the walkway in the photo, I'd recommend using pine, and staining it.  I don't use stain much, so you'll have to shop around for something you like.  Always test the stain on a scrap piece before you dive in!  You'll also want to apply a water-resistant deck finish/sealer after the staining process. 

The community over at /r/woodworking is always happy to help answer any questions! Good luck!  Ive recently subbed to wood working.  lol  Im not afraid to dive in and build, Im not not so familiar with the exotic woods and finishing techniques.  Thanks for the time to answer my shitty questions.  Very interesting. No problem!  I use a lot of exotics, but I'm still learning about the finishes as well!

No, this is Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens which is not close enough to be in danger of burning down.
 Oddly reminiscent of [NYC's High Line]( http://ruevenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/lopate-high-line-10_525.jpg?w=570) Ha, good luck finding it that empty when you go there though. This is what you call a good problem. That's very pretty. I'd like to visit NYC one day. You're 4 real, aren't you? 5 real Which never in a million years is that empty. try the morning That looks slippery as fuck Reminds me of the treetop village from Donkey Kong Country. 
http://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/5/5b/TTT.png/230px-TTT.png Makes me think of [Umbala](http://imgur.com/lD7TXNM) from Ragnarok Online. Me too. I can hear the music. [Li Mu Bai](https://kiaikick.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/crouching.jpg) is gettin' lazier and lazier. You trained Wudan style?

No, Wooden Minecraft style  Glad some modded Riven.  [deleted] Haha I saw one about myst but... Struck me more as riven  Man Pokemon is looking good these days.

http://m.uk.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-omega-ruby-alpha-sapphire/Fortree_City Brb playing Pokemon Emerald again. There's also one in Germany: http://www.amusingplanet.com/2012/02/worlds-longest-tree-top-walk-in-bavaria.html New wallpaper. Fucking showoff elves. Looks like the planet God's Grove from Hyperion. I swear, straight out of Myst. I always envisioned making this in Minecraft. Where's goku? Where is this, its beautiful! It's here in Cape Town, South Africa!
 Whenever I make these in minecraft they end up looking silly and out of place  S'Pore has one of those too.  Pretty awesome.  One in S'Pore had little stations along it describing the trees and the views (one of the places was used in a TV series). Its all fun and games until you're up there and a spider blocks your path.     Its all fun and games 
    until you're up there and a 
    spider blocks your path. Beautiful! But wow it looks slippery!  It's like minecraft IRL  These take a long time to build in minecraft those shaders always make minecraft look awesome Where is this? A real life representation of pretty much the only thing I build in Minecraft I want to play minecraft now. been there! The fog actually takes away from the magnificent view of the mountains and the rest of Kirstenbosch gardens Thats the sexiest bridge on the planet! Kirstenbosch botanical gardens! Such an amazing place It's made of dead trees, as warning to the rest of the trees.  Yub nub, eecha yub jub! Watch out for wild kecleons! For more information on the design of this walkway, have a look at this article at DeZeen: http://www.dezeen.com/2014/06/30/boomslang-walkway-kirstenbosch-national-botanical-garden-mark-thomas-henry-fagan/. 
 There should be one of these in every national park in the US.  Everyone should have a chance to walk on something like this.  That is absolutely amazing. I swear, we live in an amazing time. Im sure everyone who has ever lived has thought the same thing about their particular times, but i just crossed a bridge, online, that i barely knew existed and probably would never have seen. Same thing can be done with the great Pyramids, etc. Amazing. This reminds me of Myst YES! This is Sasquoatch Island; Northern Pikeland.  That looks slippery as fuck I want to smoke there so bad. "Can I pee on the canopy?" Well, that's added to the bucket list.. thanks for the pic and the idea! I bet the construction people loved their job while making it.  Tell me where, now. Is this where they're filming the next Myst!? (Obduction) Wow it looks so sweaty there building it above trees... its like building a bridge out of  human bones above a city.   That looks like a wonderful place to skate through. Too many tourists in the way awesome!  I was there a few months ago, it's an awesome addition to the already beautiful Kirstenbosch gardens. People were pissed off at me for making the bridge sway!  I wanna blow trees in the trees Wowzers. Just amazing! Im sitting in an office right now by the way. That bird poop on the right railing kinda throws the whole photo off. What an incredible waste of money to see what it is like walking amongst shrubs. This looks like it would be part of a level from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Imagine those points you get from that grind.  I would love to do a fpv fly through there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksXoCkpJD1c I need more treetop walkways in my life. Beautiful! Boy don't Bilbo and those dwarves feel stupid now. Wheres the inn of the last home?
 It's the real life serpent road from DBZ. in a few decades it'll become a walkway underneath the trees thats not how trees work... That looks slippery as fuck isn't that like making a bridge out of beef jerky over a ranch? Snake Way from DBZ  I want to ride my supermoto down that this is in Africa by the way guys I can only imagine how nice it is to just breathe there. made of pristine wood i see... FREAKIN AWESOM The trees actually formed like that naturally  Imagine riding a longboard down that thing. Ughhh This one could be in Lithuania A Sound of Thunder That is absolutely beautiful. 

I am very impressed with how they added/kept the natural beauty of the forest. This angers me.  Reminded me of the canopy walk in Atlanta  So where can I download this texture pack? I wanna bring my skateboard there! Ill just go ahead and assume that's the T-rex enclosure in Jurassic World.  There is a [Wild Walk](http://wildcenter.org/wildwalk/The-Thirty-Foot-Surprise) being built at the Wild Center in the Adirondacks. It will open this summer on July 4th. that is amazing - makes me want to go to south africa Can I put my house there?  Imagine that.  A walkway above you made of your relatives. when i was a child i dreamed of something like this! Gruesome in a sense. Really great view and awesome walkway! Really wish I could go there sometime... Snake way from myst.  Snakeway from DBZ? Literally this is my fantasy... Ah, I believe goku ran down this in season 2 of dragonball z If it wasn't for all that god damn lacquer! Kind of looks like a sick slide from that angle. That looks slipper^eee^^eee^^^eee^^^^eeeeee Reminds me of Donkey Kong Country That's freaking amazing! You know, for when you need to avoid those pesky T-rexs. It's a wharf made of fish bones. could be slip and slide  WOW! I want to go to there. imagine if thats a slide..would be awesome at night too 
 this is fucking sweet What a beautiful sight! Would love to eat breakfast up there This is awesome. I could see just hanging out here every day. This is what I would do if I ever won the powerball. Build a whole estate like that with islands of different function every so often.  What is this, minecraft?  Most upvotes for a South African ever? This deserves to be turned into a national holiday! Oh wait. We've got too many. Let's drink! Heres a pic I took this December there. Awesome place

http://imgur.com/vM5EEBC

 I hated that section.  Myst was fun, but Riven was too hard. Ewok overpass So you're sure it's safe up here? No t-rex can reach me right? Where is this magical walkway? I feel like there's a bit of irony in these things.

"We are destroying the forests, and we will shall build this bridge of your dead, slain brethren and erect it in your midst!  Gaze upon it, trees, and know your that your fate is surely sealed!"

...It's pretty awesome to look at, though, and I'm sure the view is great. I want to go to there That's amazing! I want to go. Kashyyk? I could run and slide along that entire motherfucker. Wow that is absolutely incredibly beautiful.   KASHYYK EXISTS! Absolutely stunning. 
Where is this? Looks like the place they send the exiled people in the dark night rises. Death.  By exile. Death.exe Death. By executable.  Why didn't the exiled people lay on their stomachs and scoot asking the ice like penguins instead of precariously walking across the thin ice? Stomach would get cold.  I had a brainfart thinking Gotham was real for a second. :( Don't feel so bad. I read the title looked at the thumb and said *wtf a giant drill?*  A giant green drill! 

Speen on!  ROW, ROW, FIGHT THE POWAH Watched that entire series last night. Had dreams about it all night long. In love. http://youtu.be/azEvfD4C6ow WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK WE ARE!!!???  HippieHeadshot, believe in me who believes in who, who believes in yourself my thoughts exactly. this picture seriously confused me for a minute and thirty four seconds. "Oh, you think the fudge is your ally. But you merely adopted the yoop; I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the mitten until I was already a man!" Mackinac Island fudge is the *fucking best*. Seeing them make it in front of me only makes me salivate more.  I haven't had that fudge in many many years and my mouth is watering. hello One of my coworkers brought in a box of the fudge once. It was eaten up pretty fast, but they saved a piece for me. I was walking out of a door and stopped to put it in my mouth. The door was swinging closed and bumped my elbow. 

I dropped the fudge and my buddy accidentally stepped on it :( At least there is fudge and pasties there and saunas!

EDIT: saw-oo-nas Transplanted Yooper here. It's "sowwnuh." "Light it up." I loved that part. "Hey guys, I'm not going to save you - I'm just going to spend a really long time decorating this bridge". That's basically what the story of batman is all about. Batman is only **a symbol** to protect Gotham.

In the final movie, Batman says a hero can be anyone, and so Robin takes up the the role of Batman, literally rising to fill Bruce Wayne's place. Jim Gordan reminds him:

&gt; John Blake: I just can't take it. I mean, nobody will ever know who it was who saved an entire city.

&gt;Jim Gordon: They know who it was; it was the Batman.

In the second movie Batman isn't even a heroic symbol, but a symbol for Gotham to vilify. Batman saves the minds of Gotham by keeping Harvey Dent's reputation in tact.

&gt; James Gordon Jr.: Batman? Batman! Why's he running dad?

&gt; Lt. James Gordon: Because we have to chase him.

&gt; James Gordon Jr.: He didn't do anything wrong.

&gt; Lt. James Gordon: Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A Dark Knight.

And in the first movie, well, the whole thing is about him becoming more than a man.

&gt; Henri Ducard: A vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed, or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal, and if they can't stop you, then you become something else entirely. 

&gt; Bruce Wayne: Which is? 

&gt; Henri Ducard: Legend, Mr. Wayne. 

 Just one way to appreciate Christopher and Jonathan's writing, well their screenplay. Thanks for this. You fool! He clearly fired his Bat-Elaborate Flammable Symbol gun at the bridge. Took him like 3 seconds tops.  I agree and on that note...

When exiled, why didn't they just kind of lay down and crawl on the ice? It appeared that folks only broke through when walking on it and putting all their weight on one spot. I would have thought Christopher would have not let that slide.

Btw, I am from the southeast and even I know that. Shouldn't folks that live where water freezes over know this stuff? I learned this by reading the magic treehouse. The magic treehouse ended up on a glacier somehow and the kids had to imitate some polar bears they saw by sliding on their bellies so they wouldn't fall through the ice and die. God damn it, Morgana Le Fey, why do you send kids into these situations? But that doesn't make sense on a glacier. A glacier is solid ice, they couldn't fall through if they tried.  Actually it does... Glaciers are KIND OF solid ice, but they're also fucking massive, shifting and moving... many develop huge cracks, some even have what amount to cave systems and the ice between these and the surface is not always thick. I've been to a couple places with glaciers, there are a lot of places they won't let you go because people not infrequently die by plunging through thin ice and either dying from an impact or freezing to death (It's basically impossible to extract someone quickly).  I figured the guards would have shot at them if they tried that. They were specifically sentenced to exile, not death. Jus' sayin'. But the guards said they would shoot them if they tried anything. They were big guys, they couldn't just crawl onto the ice since they expected at least one of them in The Wreckage Brother. &gt; They were big guys

[For you.]( https://i.warosu.org/data/lit/img/0049/03/1400368786888.jpg ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSxlYDG3RS0 I came here to post the exact same thing.  I have officially been assimilated into the overmind. hivemind you beat me to it damn trolls posting on reddit. [deleted] Hello! Like Yoopers even know what the internet is.

Edit: We need a Michigander version of spell checker.
 I really enjoy these Michigan references. It's like our own little inside joke.  Have to do somethin to keep us warm. It was like 19 in the metro Detroit area. I didn't even have to wear a jacket!  I usually wear shorts year round. Oddly, people keep asking me if I'm from East Lansing.(I'm not) I'm born and raised a Michigander. I moved to New Orleans for a while when I was like 24. I was working construction, framing houses. It was oct/Nov. It would be like 45 or so at 6 am, but it was going to warm up to 70,so of course I wore shorts and a T-shirt. I would get to the job site and these guys would have a fire going and three layers of coats on, gloves, knit hats, you name it. They thought I was crazy. After a few days off this, the boss pulled me aside and offered me an advance so I could go buy some warm clothes! I could not convince them that I was not cold. Not even a little.  I swear we're born with antifreeze in our veins. Sky's out thighs out. 

Is it because of the hipsters?  &gt; internet

Isn't that what they put over the dogsleds so the pasties don't fall out? Are they... buckless Yoopers? Not many of them are buckless to be honest Yoopers? People who live in Michigan's upper peninsula, or UP, are sometimes referred to as UP'ers, or yoopers. And in turn, they call those of us that live in lower Michigan (the Mitten) Trolls because we all live under the bridge. Thanks, late at night, and this troll doesn't have his Michigander spell checker pack loaded. People who live in Michigan's upper peninsula.  I haven't heard that term in ages! I used to travel all the time past the bridge to visit relatives in the north. Yoopers is a common slang to refer to anyone north of the bridge, and it tends to be a handy form of terminology for the locals. There's a lot more of yooper native slang too. Also, yoopers like to poke fun of "trolls under the bridge"... which what I gather are people south of the bridge. Yeahh dheir ay, we live up nort n you troll shity slickers don know bout da yooper life ay Yup, exactly right. I've found people in the UP to be the nicest people I've ever met.  Coming from Northern Ontario I once saw a bumper sticker that said "Yooper: It's not a name. It's a lifestyle. " This is a bridge troll. Not a dam troll.  they say a troll lurks under every bridge in our great state of michigan If Yoopers don't have anything else we get to enjoy troll puns that don't apply to any other state Gateway to the north, I mean UP. Clare is the gateway to the north I love how Clare has a whopping 3,000 people (just looked it up), but its name is on all of the northbound Route 127 signs starting south of Lansing.  
  
Then you get to it and it's just a tiny little town. And when you pass it you're treated to northbound 127 signs all calling out Gaylord, a 3,*600* people town. We're a sparse but proud ~~populous~~ populace. *Populace (noun) - the people living in a particular country or area.
Populous (adjective) - having a large population. 

Now you know. But no signs saying Mount Pleasant, which is the biggest city around this area.. No one cares about CMU :( And there's a ~20 mile chunk of 127 that is inexplicably *not* freeway.  Ah. St Johns area. Cops love to sit in that area too.  Now I'm thinking about Uncle John's Cider Mill. FIRE UP CHIPS I live in a place where we have all those signs. It's tiny, and I can't remember ever having been there. It's so unremarkable that I probably have, I just don't remember it. :/ I love Cops and Doughnuts and little diner with like 6 tiny booths  My troll senses are tingling.  Mackinac* Can confirm this is the correct spelling. Fun fact: [**Mackinac Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the Western Hemisphere and the 5th longest in the world.**](http://mackinacbridge.org/about-the-bridge-8/) Not to mention that Labor Day is the only day you can [walk across it.](http://www.mackinacbridge.org/annual-bridge-walk-7/) I have done it! That is a long ass walk As a Michigander, I can attest that if this were real there would be a fudge shoppe built on the ice.  And a pasty stand. Like... For nipples? Not that kinda pasty, ya dingus. This kind...

http://i.imgur.com/xJntUlH.jpg

Edit: it's also not pronounced pasty, it's pronounced pass-t.  I wish more places down here in lower michigan sold them. I only get to eat them when I go north of the bridge. Can you explain the mackinaw vs mackinac differences? I feel like I use those names interchangeably and shouldn't. As others have said, they're pronounced the same. 

Mackinac is the French spelling of the name, which the island and bridge still use. The city uses the English spelling. 

The island and bridge use the French spelling, which is short for "Michilimackinac" meaning "great turtle" because the island was shaped like a turtle. 

source: Mackinac Island Honor Scout  If you ever make it to the fort or the lighthouse in the city, let me know. I'll have you say hi to my mom. She works maintenance/groundskeeping there when it's open. All the flowers you see around there? Yeah, she did that.  You shouldn't be pronouncing Mackinac as Mack-i-nak. Mackinac is pronounced Mack-i-naw. So you should never. Ever. Ever. Use them interchangeably because it's the same word.  I got in an argument with my history teacher 10 years ago about this. Bitch kept saying "mackinak" so I told her she was wrong.  Detroit rep. I once was at an ice cream shop in Florida, and a man looked at the flavors and said "Mack-i-nak Island Fudge" and the whole family mutually thought about stuffing him in a goddamn fudge maker. Oops. While we're at it, how do you pronounce Sault Ste Marie? Sue Saint Marie Just say "Da Soo."  That works too, ya yooper. soo as in soothe, saint marie I've been doing it wrong my whole life. I can now start arguments with my family over this and win.  They're both pronounced as Mackinaw - it's just a difference between how the name of the bridge/island and the city are spelled.  Mackinaw is used for Mackinaw City, which is the town on the lower peninsula side.

Mackinac is used for the bridge and the island.  ITT: Us Michiganders talking and everyone else trying to keep up. 

EDIT: A word.  as am i. whats up mang  There's tons of fuckin Michiganders on reddit hot damn.  

Pretty warm today eh? Every time a Michigan, Detroit, or Ann Arbor thing makes it to the front page there's droves of us chiming in. Not really sure why, but I suppose it could be because it happens rarely and we're all already here because going outside is a questionable decision. Michiganders have this weird thing where the state gets brought up a lot, yet we always think no one has even heard of us, so whenever we see ourselves mentioned we get super excited even though it happens all the time. I love it :) "We're Michigan, we're still here!" Confirmed. I live in Michigan. 
 I think it's because nobody really passes through Michigan unless they're travelling to/from Canada.

I think we just have this natural excitement when we meet outsiders who've chosen to come visit us and check out our stuff.   We're the proudest state without any weird secession-ism. A bunch of people who really like where we come from (or are). I'm sadly part of the Michigan economic diaspora, but we spend 2 weeks there every summer. I still call it "home". Michigan is the best state hands down. We have amazing sports teams, unreal natural beauty, great food, great communities, tons of tourism, we're fucking tough for surviving Michigan winters. We rock. Wow that's actually a fantastic way to describe us. "The proudest state without any weird succession-ism". I'm using that from now on. I literally clapped when I saw this at the #1 spot, like I had absolutely anything to do with the post's success just by living here. Yeah! You said Ann Arbor! It was 32 for about 20 mins, it was awesome, I had to take off my coat Looks like a giant drill.  Your drill is the drill that will pierce the Heavens! **ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER** /r/misleadingthumbnails [For contrast, here's a pic I took in August](http://i.imgur.com/nPgHw5c.jpg) And here is a side profile of it I took a couple years ago at night.  http://www.jlebrasseur.com/images/header-background.jpg

Sorry about the weird filename... I use it as the background of the header on my page and did not feel like re-uploading it somewhere else...
 I have a folder full of Mackinac pictures that mean a lot to me and this is definitely the newest addition. Really captured the beauty of it in the night, this is awesome! Thanks for sharing. call me crazy... but these look like two different bridges.

edit: Thanks everyone, it practically is two bridges. It is a 5 mile long bridge. There are many sections to it. OPs frozen picture is closer to the middle where it is as a suspension bridge, versus this picture where it is not. [This picture does a nice job illustrating the different sections.](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jensenl/visuals/album/mackinac/IMG_7554.JPG) I have been fortunate enough to sail under the middle section and as you pass underneath it you are able to see the underside of cars since the middle is steel grating. While I was in college and had to cross the bridge we would always open our doors and look down and see the water from hundreds of feet up. It's been cool to be on both sides to realize how massive that bridge really is. You opened your door in a moving car? Couldn't you just stick your head out the window? Often times traffic can come to a standstill during the summer which is a big tourist season. Also iirc there is a place you can pull over on the bridge, but it has been a couple years so don't quote me on that last part. &gt; there is a place you can pull over on the bridge

-/u/grimjr50 Immortalized for all eternity. The seed has been planted. Living a little dangerous always add something to the day. Just make sure Dave Matthews Band isn't driving overhead Every labor day people walk across the bridge.  Thats when you truly know how massive it is 15 year bridge walk veteran reporting in! It never gets any shorter either. I've walked it 19 times. Some how my family decided to make it a tradition  So you're telling me OP walked out into the middle of the lake on the ice to take that pic? Good god that is frightening. That ice is thick enough to comfortably drive your truck across.  Michigan doesnt fuck around You could probably drive a semi across it actually, You can drive a pickup on pretty much any lake in the state The ice is so thick you could move a fort across it Michigan cold man, it freezes water reeeeeeal good. North Pole, Alaska was warmer than Michigan this past week. Our average temperature for the month of February was 14 degrees fahrenheit.  Hey there crazy, OPs pic is taken closer to mid-span while biggmclargehuge took a pic of the lead up ramp.

This thread is like a Michigan reddit meetup, but we didn't go outside because it is too cold. This is why we drink &gt;&gt; Heavily Today is warm actually. We are just too lazy. If you've never been there and you find yourself in Northern Michigan in the summer I highly suggest you visit; 

A. [Mackinac Island](http://blog.michiganadvantage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Mackinac-Island.jpg); for fudge; to ride in a carriage and stare at a horse's ass; to bike around the island; for the 
butterfly exhibit; the trails and old forts; and history OFC. 

B. [Sleeping Bear Dunes](https://everywhereonce.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/sleeping-bear-dune.jpg) (More Western IIRC); Amazing dunes, cool arch, picnic and generally beautiful. 

Edit: (Formatting) If anyone is ever around Traverse, Cadillac or Fife Lake this summer hit me up!

Edit2: **DAMN YOOPERS** [Copper Country](http://www.coppercountrytrail.org) Keweenaw Penn.

[Grand Marais](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g42255-Grand_Marais_Upper_Peninsula_Michigan-Vacations.html) Or you could actually go to northern Michigan and visit copper country, pictured rocks, grand Marais, etc. Come to Houghton MI, and see our wonderful Don't forget Bond Falls, whenever I visit my grandparents in Ewen its my favorite place to go.  Got 'lost' in the sleeping bear dunes when I was a young kid. Walked all the way from the parking area of the dunes almost to the shore of Lake Michigan. I did it because I wanted to see the two islands off the dunes that were in [The Legend of Sleeping Bear](http://www.ohranger.com/sleeping-bear-dunes/news/2010/legend-sleeping-bear) story we learned about as part of out 3rd grade curriculum. My parents almost died when I was gone fore nearly 3 hours, and the park rangers were out on quads looking for me. Found out that there was some scary wildlife out there, Scary stuff.  Sorry Mom and Dad! This is the scary shit I grew up on. http://www.michigan-dogman.com I remember that the two cubs ended up drowning or something. A bit morbid.  I cross this bridge several times per year on my way to my cabin in the UP. I am not even from Michigan so by the time I reach this beautiful landmark I am "almost there" (another two hours to go!) but I always feel a sense of leaving civilization and entering the woods. It never gets old.  That's a hell of a drive if you don't even live in the Lower Peninsula.   I don't even live in Northern Ohio! It's about 9-10 hours to my cabin depending on who is driving and how many stops we afford ourselves. But it's well worth it and I've made the trip dozens of times! Lucky man! My family and I live in South Florida and we make the trip up to the UP every summer. For the last 10 summers, we've brought up a trailer full of dirt bikes and ATVs so it's a 30 hour trip each way. Making it to Michigan is a reward in itself, but getting over the bridge is pretty much our victory lap.  Wow! That makes my journey sound like a quick run to the corner store! Isn't it cool that the UP area is so appealing to so many people? My grandfather took his family up for a business trip/family vacation (he was involved with quarries and mining) and they fell in love with it and bought a cabin completely unplanned. It's still in the family and I never met that grandpa and this is now my strongest link to him. Powerful place. Beautiful place to grow up.  I used to live in Sault Ste Marie. Cheers to that. We've been going to our cabin in the Les Cheneaux islands (eastern UP, Lake Huron) since the 70's.  Crossing the bridge was like stepping over the threshold.  Just another hour of driving and then a half an hour in the boat.  Woo! I love my state.  I got excited seeing the post on the front page. Michigan is awesome! Michigan is tight.  I suddenly put Michigan on my list of places I want to visit. Mackinac island seems nice. -Florida here It's incredible I was born in Mi and northern Mi is some of the prettiest area in the united states. And Mackinac  island is absolutely gorgeous.. Oh and you have to stay at the Grand Hotel it's Insane beautiful Aye! I thought I was in /r/Michigan for a second.  Then I was like "A frontpage post about Michigan that ISN'T about Detroit or Flint?!  FUCK YEAAAAAHHHHHHH."

Then I ate a coney dog and washed it down with a Bell's. Mackinac. But pronounced "mackinaw". Shhhhh-we want to be able to identify ourselves  Make everyone drink vernors.  They cough, they're an outsider. All I can think when I see this is, "Exile, or death?"
 Death!
...by exile!  MICHIGAN REPRESENT  Michigan is cold... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aktLRiWXfqg [deleted] Terrific shot. It makes me feel so uncomfortable and that's great. I went snowmobiling in the UP this winter. We had to have an escort and drive under 20mph because of high winds hitting our enclosed trailer. You could feel the truck and trailer swaying and pushing against the wind. My brother in law asked why we needed an escort and I explained in the event we were to go over the edge, someone would be able to let the police know where our mangled and frozen bodies were. 

 St. Ignace side? or Mackinac city side? Seems to be looking north to me, but I'm not positive  I've sailed under the bridge a few times! These pictures are from summer 2013. 

http://imgur.com/a/9I0qw  [Mackinaw peaches, Jerry!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-sfk3PGQDg) One year when my family was doing the Mackinac bridge walk, we ended up walking next to a gentleman who told us he was from a different planet, where time was advanced five minutes from Earth time, so he had already experienced the present moment, or something. It was a very long five miles that year. *Mackinac Born and raised about a half hour from the bridge . Michigan is an amazing place Holy Mackinaw! *Mackinac My favorite thing about going back to the yoop is driving over the bridge  *Mackinac  Being from the UP (Escanaba) and currently going to MTU in Houghton, I'd just like to let everyone know that we do have Internet and don't poop outside still (most of us). is that gotham? Non michiganders probably don't know what a yooper is. Its also spelled Mackinac(not pronounced that way).  Ah the Mighty Mack, might have to make this my new phone background. I worked on Mackinac Island in 2009 and my favorite view of this bridge is from the island. Most beautiful bridge in the world, in my humble opinion. wasn't this the bridge in iRobot?
 That would be the Brooklyn bridge I think that was filmed in Chicago and the bridge was a mess up in the story. Nah, the robot dump is the Lake Michigan landfill...the picture that the robot draws.  Maybe a bridge was built across lake michigan at some point? No, he's talking about the robot doing the drawing with Lake Michigan all dried up. I'm gonna be honest, I read iRobot as I Am Legend. No clue why.  It is in the story, idk if they actually filmed it there. Yes. Mackinaw, you say? So this is where Kramer gets his peaches... You've never had a Mackinaw peach? Jerry, they're the best! I like to think Wisconsin is still pissed about this. Wisconsin is pissed about everything, also drunk. They tried to call themselves the mitten state a few years ago.  Death. By exile! I got cold looking at that picture. I thought it was a drill This picture makes me nervous and I can't figure out why [deleted] I grew up in the Mackinac Straights area and I can guarantee you two things, the Mackinac Bridge is not rickety, and you couldn't break through that ice this time of year if you wanted to. It is 2 feet thick according to the NOAA as of 2 to 3 days ago. That bridge was meant to withstand a lot of wind. The designer was a leading authority after the Tacoma Narrows incident and the bridge is stable with winds at 150 mph. It is an airfoil with a grate design for the center 2 lanes which helps cancel lift. Basically, you are more likely to be swept off the bridge by crosswinds than by the bridge swaying.

The ice is also at least 2 feet thick right now. [deleted] Ok.  Could be the very slight asymmetry. they centered the bottom of the "point" between the concrete and ice, which isn't actually the center, so the triangles formed by the supports and the points are all crooked Probably just because of the hugeness of the bridge the photographer is standing (on the ice?!) under. Me too. Almost the same feeling I get when I see pictures of divers looking over the edge of the continental shelf into the black abyss. That green paint is pretty sweet. Fun fact. They are always painting part of the bridge (I'm assuming except in the middle of winter) because the bridge is so long. They paint in the winter too.  24/7 364 I believe (I think they don't paint on Christmas). The Golden Gate Bridge is like that. Once they finish it, they have to start over because the oldest paint has started to erode from the salty air. Yeah, but the Golden Gate Bridge is like 3 times shorter... You're three times shorter Nope still going. It's a cycle win one crew is at the end another is starting over at the beginning  They annually have a walk across the bridge, I'd recommend it to anybody who hasn't walked a bridge before. When you're at the suspension section you can feel the bridge swaying underneath your feet, and you're walking on grates that let you see all the way down to the waters below, really freaky.  There's something very special about driving across this bridge.  5 miles go by in the blink of an eye.  It's a good bucket list item. You should do the Bridge Walk. You are so busy looking around and being amazed, you don't even notice you've just walked 5 miles! But I would walk 500 miles... It is, unless you own a VW bus, then not so much.  Yeah, it's spelled Mackinac... Good picture though. Last time I crossed the bridge, about four months ago, there was a guy swimming the canal. It was pretty neat. Mackinac Island is pretty awesome as well. That would have been in October, I find that hard to believe, also there is no canal.   Well you don't need to believe it. And sorry, the strait Isn't this the place where they used to shoot a scene from Batman? You are sentenced to Exile! Walk across the Ice...

I thought the same thing when I saw this, so I set out to confirm it. As it turns out, there was no filming for any of the Batman movies done in Detroit. The only American Cities used were New York, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, and Jersey City. Also, the only two bridges credited as locations in the film were The Queensborough Bridge in New York and the Liberty Bridge in Pittsburgh. 

So... I guess we were wrong!   Aww damn! It looks so similar! Get some creativity, bridge builders lol. Extremely similar.  Forest thing I thought This bridge is a couple hundred miles from Detroit... It really bothers me it wasn't shot so that it looks symmetric... deal with it I hate to be this guy but... It's "Mackinac" Picture no.2 is the scariest because not only is that a power source in water, the red plugs that they are using are 415v electrics. Fuck.

edit: this is a test of arc flash protection hoods.  Some more videos here: https://www.oberoncompany.com/videos

(I work for the manufacturer)  Didn't change my mind,  still don't wanna be around it  In fact, might have made it worse.  Yep, plugged in a unbelievably old and inch thick paint encrusted pump at this paint factory I worked summers at in the 80's after arguing for a while with Mr. Whitecollar about it's condition. (I had never seen it in use) The 3 phase there had the plugs with the big metal switch to turn them on and off so I plugged it in and got a piece of broken pallet wood in my gloved hand and flipped the switch with it. Your bit if video nicely illustrates what instantly happened to the pump. Mr Whitecollar, whom I had never seen excited much less utter a curse word went "HOLY SHIT FUCK GAWDAMN!!!" I grabbed a 2 gallon CO2 extinguisher which I had always wanted to shoot off, pulled the pin and went to town, because fire in a paint factory = HOLY SHIT FUCK GAWDAMN!!! (this place was safety violations in all directions but at least they had extinguishers.) An older worker ran over with a bigger piece of pallet wood and knocked the plug out of the socket with it (the power wire was burning and glowing) while Mr Whitecollar screamed "PUT IT OUT MOTHERFUCKERS OH SHIT!!" Once it was off the circuit I got it out almost immediately and we all just stood there in a kind "Well that just happened" silence and then Mr Whitecollar began a steady stream of eloquently vile expletives the likes of which 19 year old me had never heard which illustrated his heretofore unexpressed feelings about the age and condition of the factory equipment with which he was forced to deal along with some opinions about other higher up Mr. Whitecollars with whom he had to work that would probably have been grounds for termination had we been in the mood to pass them along, which we were not. When he had finished venting he calmly went and got a forklift and operator from shipping to move the smoldering wreckage outside and sent me and the older guy home for the day telling us he would clock us out at 5, with the unspoken warning that this incident had never happened. The video doesn't even do it justice. The heat alone generated by an arc flash like that will kill you in seconds, not to mention the current running through you because you are STANDING IN FUCKING WATER That is the better of the outcomes. With anything electricity, I'd probably rather be killed instantly.  Plus the arc flash usually vapourizes whatever metal is there so you have that all over you and any polyester clothes you're wearing become your new skin when they graft themselves to you from the heat.  Yep. Cotton fabrics only around electricity. No synthetics. Sure, cotton will burn, but it won't melt onto your skin like synthetic materials do. I've had that happen, and Holy fuck, you think it hurt when it melted? Just wait until you peel it off.

I'm pretty sure those are 400V, which is the standard voltage for 3-phase AC power in Europe. 400 is the new standard but there's still 415 in the uk and Australia. It's probably 380 or 400 in this picture. yeah we use 400 in denmark
 Please fire me from a site like that. I quit an electrical apprenticship over safety. It was one of those 'we have to have this done now' jobs. A dude died on my second day, a painter hit some live wire/panel and blew his arm off... Then to catch up we began working six 10 hr shifts instead of 5 ... it was hell. That employer is 50 kinds of shady. They bring in Polish workers, pay them less than entitled, and doesn't do anything about work safety. They also have ignored sound pollution issues and have shifted work into overtime and night shifts to catch up on the delays, so that residents in Copenhagen has to sleep through jackhammer-volume noise.

And if you complain, you get fired. Had it been Danish workers it wouldn't have been so bad, but these guys have to go back to Poland.  50 Shades of Shady Directed by Eminem Is it less expensive to pay out death benefits than have a safe working environment? I always think of the Ford Pinto that was put out in the 70s. That car caused the death of 27 people and hundreds of injuries due to a defect where the gas tank exploded on impact. Ford knew about the defect in manufacturing but knew it would be more expensive to fix it then to pay out the costs from lawsuits. This led to many changes in tort law regarding recovery for deceased plaintiffs.  [deleted] Meh, just leave and let's hope no one dies.

This message will self destruct in...3...2... *people die*

Goddamnit message production company for not fixing this issue! Ummm, I guess history just repeats itself.  That is happening right now with GM's faulty ignition switch.

"The official count is currently 42 deaths that GM has confirmed, along with seven category one injuries, and 51 category two injuries."

"The fault had been known to GM for at least a decade prior to the recall being declared.[3]Some have suggested that the company actually approved the switches in 2002 even though they knew they might not meet safety standards."

"The company is facing multiple investigations into why it did not attempt to fix these faulty ignitions sooner, including a federal criminal probe."

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_General_Motors_recall &gt;The company only counts incidents which resulted in head-on collisions in which the airbags did not deploy

Wow....just...wow so it doesn't count if somebody's car just clicks off and they have some other form of crash?

&gt; It does not include, for example, an incident where after a car's ignition switch failed, the car "spun out, hydroplaned, hit an oncoming vehicle and rolled off the road, dropping 15 feet into a creek

...Guess not...

&gt;In a collision in which two young women in a Chevrolet Cobalt were killed when the ignition switch shut off the engine, GM only counts the death of the woman in the front seat, because the death of the woman in the back seat was not caused by the failure of the airbag to deploy.

OH COME THE FUCK ON Someone needs to be in jail for that. This is what I love about how American courts work. If you are a lone citizen, or even a simple private business owner you can be put in jail or accidentally killing someone with your negligence.  

If you are a giant corporation though, you have to pay fines and settle out of court, even if the decisions that lead to peoples death are completely intentional nobody has to serve jail time for killing people. For my car right now, I just got a recall notice that "the airbags may suddenly deploy while driving"... like you're just cruising down the street and your airbags go off. And this car is over a decade old. You may be asking "why would it take over 10 years to get a recall notice?" well apparently, it was really fucking hard to prove that your airbags *caused* the crash, and weren't a *product* of the crash against some of the best attorneys in the country. They made people out to look like straight out liars, fuck your medical bills and fuck your dead friend, no award. Finally enough people had the same exact series of events, and a bunch of people had dashcams, so they finally had to admit the faulty system. I kinda get that they could be skeptical, but at the same time, that's kind of fucked. Yeah I'm never owning a GM for the rest of my life. Probably never owning another American car tbh.  I was listening to a segment on NPR about this.  They were interviewing a automotive journalist that test drove one of the first cars that had one of these switches before it hit the market.  A chevy cobalt maybe?  The car shut off several times while driving when his knee hit the key cylinder and was able to reproduce it to the engineers at the test track.  They knew this was a problem right at the beginning.  These fuckers even tried to make the argument that since GM went bankrupt the new GM is a new company entirely and not liable for those ignition locks.  Fuck GM.  I'll never own another GM product. Everyone needs to understand and know that a corporation's only job is to as much money as possible,  they are not moral entities, they have no soul, and need to be treated as such. They can make political contributions because they have a right to free speech, though, and they can discriminate because they have religious rights.  The federal criminal probe is what really carries weight. Any executive who knew about the faulty switches and approved them (or looked the other way) is guilty of 42 counts of negligent homicide, as far as I'm concerned. They knew these faults could cause death and withheld that information purposefully to make money. Lock them up. Executives at a major company getting "locked up"? What is this, a fairy tale? I mean, you can't just lock up a *benevolent job creator*. The youth are so entitled. /s Non-mobile: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_General_Motors_recall

^That's ^why ^I'm ^here, ^I ^don't ^judge ^you. ^PM ^/u/xl0 ^if ^I'm ^causing ^any ^trouble. [^WUT?](https://github.com/xl0/LittleHelperRobot/wiki/What's-this-all-about%3F) I keep forgetting to take my Grand Prix in and get that sorted out. I took my grand am in last week for it (recall 14350)and you know what they did? they take the key, add a plastic insert and a smaller split key ring so you "Can't" add too much weight to the keyring. That was the Fix. I was flabbergasted.

[See the Highlighted Text](http://i.imgur.com/TvyamEq.png)

[key inserts and keyrings](http://i.imgur.com/3KNL6el.gif)

 The Grand Am's have an entirely different issue compared to the more infamous Ignition Cylinder GM recall. I took my Ion (Saturn) in for the ignition recall and got an entire cylinder, new keys, and they changed out the power steering just in case my car had that recall as well (It didn't, but they wanted to be sure). They had my car maybe 2 hours and that was because I had to get a ride back to the dealership. Take the number of vehicles in the field, A, multiply by the probable rate of failure, B, multiply by the average out-of-court settlement, C. A times B times C equals X. If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one. Which car company did you say you worked for again? A major one. Are there a lot of accidents like these? You wouldn't believe. Is that you Jack?

 [The entire thing was overblown.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto#Fuel_tank_controversy)

&gt;Initially, the NHTSA did not feel there was sufficient evidence to demand a recall due to incidents of fire. 27 deaths were attributed to Pinto fires (the same number of deaths attributed to a Pinto transmission problem) and in 1974 the NHTSA ruled that the Pinto had no "recallable" problem.

 Even with the defect the car passed safety standards for the time. In fact the defect existed in every rear tank auto no matter who made it. Mark 2, Grand Torino, El Camino, any car with a rear mounted gas tank was  susceptible.  Ford's C3 transmission had, in fact, killed more people than the Pinto gas tank (it only killed 27 in the Pinto, though), and no one was calling it defective. It, in fact, reigns as one of the best small car transmissions ever made.

The Pinto gas tank suffered by the exact same defect every other gas tank made for 70 years prior suffered; It was made of *metal*.

And that thing about them exploding on impact. [That was entirely made up and dramatized by 20/20 from data based on a UCLA test.](http://walterolson.com/articles/crashtests.html)

&gt;If ABC really analyzed those UCLA test reports, it had every reason to know why the Ford in the crash film burst into flame: there was an incendiary device under it. The UCLA testers explained their methods in a 1968 report published by the Society of Automotive Engineers, fully ten years before the 20/20 episode. As they explained, one of their goals was to study how a crash fire affected the passenger compartment of a car, and to do that they needed a crash fire. But crash fires occur very seldom; in fact, the testers had tried to produce a fire in an earlier test run without an igniter but had failed. Hence their use of the incendiary device (which they clearly and fully described in their write-up) in the only test run that produced a fire. 

Of course any car would go explode on impact if there was an incendiary device attached to it set to go off at that point, but this is a fact that destroys the sensationalism of the story.

But it's better to think Ford is a murderous company than see the truth of the matter. Thank you for this. Is there a similar defense for the GMC ignition switch controversy? There's not a similar defense that I'm aware of. GMC's key engineer in this case actually got the part changed *without* getting a part number change; this is important, because it's standard policy to track part-level changes by changing a number. In this case, GM's culture is probably the biggest culprit, as the engineer felt the need to hide the change rather than expose it and publicly acknowledge a potential issue. I'm no expert, but I think the "controversies" suffer from different problems. The Pinto's gas tank was tested and worked just fine, and as /u/Abomonog pointed out, was blown out of proportion due to biased "tests". But GM was aware there was an issue with the ignition switches when they sold these vehicles, but did nothing about it for nearly a decade. There might be a similar defense, but GM still had owned up that they knew for nearly 10 years that there was an issue. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_General_Motors_recall#Congressional_testimony Shouldnt those who knew but chose not to order it fixed be charged with 27 counts of 2nd degree murder as well? With a team of lawyers working for you, you can just bury people and the government with paperwork and because it is a business there is no one person to go after even if it was just one person that made the decision. Yupp, The CEO is just an agent of the shareholders so you go after the 1 million shareholders who had no idea of the problem. It's a pretty convenient system for corporations Isn't that the Chevy Corvair? Unsafe at any speed...

Edit: never mind, it was the suspension in the corvair, they didn't want to pay for a rollbar . *Anti-roll bar/sway bar. Generally a "rollbar" refers to rollover protection. Except they did fix the suspension in the Corvair, but the damage was already done and the car's image never recovered specifically because of Nader's campaign.  Corvair's are cool.  

I'm not complaining, GM and the auto industry in general brought that trouble on themselves, I just like Corvairs. [Milton Friedman explains why Ford made the decision they did, and why it wasn't as bad a choice as everyone seems to recall.](http://youtu.be/jltnBOrCB7I) 

In short, the problem people take with Ford's stance is that they assigned a monetary value to human life (in the form of estimates for their costs in civil court).

I happen to agree with Friedman in that I don't think that's necessarily a fair assessment of the problem.

The problem was *they did not disclose the fault in the gas tank design*.

Aa Friedman points out, there is no way to be 100% safe while keeping things affordable.  Each of us knows the risk when getting in a car.   We could never come back from the grocery store.

The problem with the Pinto was that there was an additional risk no one was made aware of, and so could not have been expected to make informed choices.

They should have been (and absolutely were) held liable for withholding that information; but the idea that they should have spent millions recalling cars that (for the most part) worked just fine is a little unreasonable.

Think about it.  When the Samsung Galaxy S phone batteries were discovered to have the potential to explode and cause serious injury in rare or specific circumstances, should Samsung be expected to issue a recall on billions of dollars worth of phones based on a 1-in-100,000 chance of catastrophe?  Does it invalidate the fact that 99,999 phones would operate without issue?

I hold that as long as the public is informed of potential hazards, each of us has a responsibility to weigh the risks ourselves.  Ford did not offer the public that luxury and so should have been held liable in court, and they were.

Had they informed the public of the danger, those 27 people might not have bought the car in the first place.  Anyone who DID get injured or killed, would have taken the risk of their own volition and Ford would not have been held liable.   But doesn't the fireball of death also endanger other people too? If you choose to drive that car because it's cheaper, but I choose to drive something safe, and we get an an accident and your care catches fire and kills both of us, I didn't really make an informed choice. 

I don't agree with your argument in this case because the outcome has effects more than just the person who bought the car.  &gt; I hold that as long as the public is informed of potential hazards, each of us as a responsibility to weigh the risks ourselves. Ford did not offer the public that luxury and so should have been held liable in court, and they were.

Yep, and if you get in a tall SUV today (or anytime since at least the late 80's), you'll likely see rollover warnings printed on the sun visor.  Because safety and design is always a tradeoff. That mentality is changing. Contractors' workers comp. And liability insurances are getting absurdly priced. When companies introduce safety policies, employee education, and hire safety professionals, policy costs get adjusted. Also, there are a few of some rich corporate CEO types, that genuinely care about people, and don't want people to get hurt. 

Source-I am a construction safety professional Then you know how hard is to change mentality of some old shool workers who deem safety gear as unnecessary inconvinience in their job, and not something that can potentially save their lives (f.ex. helmets, gogles and safety harnesses). They also don't realize if by their unwillingness to change something bad happens, that could have been prevented by using safety gear, your ass is on the line. "I've worked 20 years without a single accident. All this gear does is cause more accidents." Never mind all the friends and coworkers he lost because they didn't have as much luck.  I hear this shit on a daily basis. Then they actively encourage younger impressionable  apprentices to do dangerous work (usually involving height and extension ladders) because that's how they were taught and "the job needs to get done!". When the reality is that they are too fucking lazy to set up mobile scaffolding. 
Rant. This is how I lost my job as an industrial painter. Foreman wanted me to do some dangerous shit. Meanwhile I'm on light duty because my hand was broken from doing dangerous shit he told me to do. I was only suppose to drive. 

I refused and wanted to go the safe route. He sprayed me in the face with paint. I threw my brush into his face. While he cleaned his face with paint thinner, I took the van and left. I was fired for that, but I was going to quit as soon as I dropped the van off anyways. 

Edit: I'm not saying I shouldn't have been fired for that. We were 5 hours away from our home town. That was a total dick thing of me to do. There was a lot building up to that. I previously requested never to with him again.  Boss sprayed you in the face with paint and set you up to break your hand. Fuck him he can walk. You oughta go visit a coal mine. You'll be even more depressed. Safety equipment often won't save a life like good practices will.  A steel beam falling on someone's head will probably kill them regardless of them whether or not they wear a helmet.  However a helmet, safety goggles, etc can help keep a minor accident from being a life altering one.  Keeping a piece of metal fragment from hitting your eyeball will keep you working longer. Yeah, industrial diseases used to ruin the lives of working men and their families. Always pissed me off when I was on site and people treated H&amp;S as a joke. Whitefinger is not funny. Neither is going blind or losing your hearing. the old timers tend to see people die horribly and figure it out I'm not a construction safety professional.  But there are two ways to reduce costs.  One is to make the workplace safer.  And, yes, there are a few (perhaps even more than a few) CEO types who genuinely care about people and don't want them getting hurt.  But what seems to be an increasingly popular way to reduce costs is to gut workers compensation insurance.  See:  http://ehstoday.com/health/propublica-and-npr-document-demolition-workers-comp and http://www.dol.gov/osha/report/20150304-inequality.pdf  To quote the lead paragraphs from the first item cited above,
     "Cutbacks to workers compensation benefits have been so dramatic in some states that they 'virtually guarantee' that an injured worker will 'plummet into poverty,' according to an investigation by ProPublica and NPR. Thirty-three states have cut benefits to workers injured or made ill by work, or have made it more difficult to qualify for benefits.
     'The Demolition of Workers Comp,' written by Michael Grabell of ProPublica and Howard Berkes of NPR, notes that while employers are paying the lowest rates for workers compensation in decades and insurance companies earned a 18 percent return in 2013, workers are suffering. No longer able to work and fighting with insurance companies, workers and their families often are forced to seek public aid, like food stamps, in order to make ends meet." Haven't you seen Fight Club? I know it's a fiction book but it definitely is based on real events, and as one user pointed out, the case of the Ford Pinto.

&gt;*A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60 mph. The rear differential locks up. The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside. Now, should we initiate a recall? Take the number of vehicles in the field, A, multiply by the probable rate of failure, B, multiply by the average out-of-court settlement, C. A times B times C equals X. If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one.* Except damage to your reputation can be converted into a monetary loss as well, which usually convinces companies to initiate recalls. But sometimes recalls also hurt your reputation which also costs you money. The best option is to produce cars with good parts that don't need recalls. The people working on the metro aren't unionized, are from out of the country, underpaid, overworked and work in a shell company to avoid following Danish law.

So yeah....if you don't have to pay out death benefits or they are very small.....then yes, it is much less expensive. Pic 1: Well, this is dangerous, but I don't see

Pic 2: Oh shit

Pic 3-5: *Butt clenches with the force of a mini black hole* I like how pic 3's caption is "see how close they are placed to the edges [of the 2x4]" when half the scaffolding legs in the picture are up on the rebar. Shit, I didn't even see that.  Pic 1: Lube up

Pic 2: Sliiiiiide it in

Pic 3-5: *See God* Electrician here! Sue these fucking assholes! The foreman and general contractor should be fired and never work again.  No need to, the goverment working safety board are all over them at the moment as well as the general public. They just had a case of some tax evasion shit a few weeks ago too... way to go this company.

Heads are gonna roll.. Ironically, in the end the government is responsible because they chose them Yeah, nobody likes being called to explain their shit. Just hand the contract to the lowest bidder, then act surprised and indignant when stuff like this comes to the publics attention.  The government is bound by EU tender rules. So they can't freely choose whoever they want. If a bidder has the lowest price matching the tender. They have to accept it (or be met by a lawsuit).  And that baffles me, surely there must be a better way to do it, rather than being forced to pick the lowest bidder.

That's how you end up with this, and an Italian POS company that does everything to dodge taxes and avoid the law. There is much sense to the tender laws, from a fairness / public funds point of view. I think the solution lies with more government safety inspectors of job sites. Would probably be a good idea all around, not just for government projects. 
Give the inspectors a 10% bonus (10% of any fines levied), and a 200% bonus for fines levied if a company tries to bribe the inspector. Then you prevent corruption, companies KNOW they will be regularly inspected and the inspectors will be looking for every small violation, and companies will just adjust to doing things by the book. Yeah, I think that that is it. As long as there is solid evidence of actual failure, then the inspector gets a bonus. If there is no solid evidence, then the inspector doesn't get a bonus, but can still do stuff to ensure safety, like shut the project down at no cost to the inspector or inspecting government or government that hires the contractor. Problem is to a small part the tender rules but to the most part that governments haven't learned how to write proper requirements in tenders.  Not anyone can bid on a government job. You have to be approved by proving that you have the skills required to do the job, have the money required to do it, and that you don't have a history of fucking up in other states/countries.

So the job may go to the lowest bidder, but that doesn't mean I can hire a team of Mexicans from outside Home Depot and get a government contract to build a skyscraper. Agree, unless this was all after math of a freak storm, anyone involved holding a supervisory role, that allowed this, doesn't belong in the industry. Absolutely Shameful. Better to get fired than die on the site. This should have been tagged as *NSFW* 

EDIT: Thanks for the gold stranger!  Could an electrician chime in and actually point out what's wrong in the pictures? Besides the obvious wire under water, I don't know what to look for. All holes in walking platforms should be marked.  The first picture allows anyone to just walk by and fall through if they aren't paying enough attention.  In the third and fourth picture the scaffold feet are overhanging the platform they are placed on.  &gt;the scaffold feet are overhanging the platform

That one *on* the pile of rebar blows my mind. Holy crap. I didn't even notice that at first glance.
