[Proof](http://imgur.com/CX88Yce).  I\u2019m normally not much of a redditor, but I thought I would step in and give my two cents on the discussion.  \nMost of what the life scientists ITT have said about the paper is generally true (at the time that I\u2019m writing).  They\u2019ve correctly identified the primary strength of this paper being the use of \u201cprimary\u201d cells.  These are cells that came right out of a cancer patient\u2019s arm, and are about as close as we can get to real cancer.  I'm glad the paper has been generating some discussion, and wanted to give a (brief) author's perspective on some of the main questions.  \n\n**Re: Is this something that we\u2019ll never hear from again?**\nMany ideas for cancer therapies fail \u2014 and they should.  We hope they fail sooner rather than later because that means fewer lives are put at risk and we don\u2019t want to waste time and public money on therapies with limited potential.  Glancing through the science subreddit I see a lot of things that could be one-hit wonders, but many others with results that may be validated, expanded, and translated to the clinic.  It is my genuine hope that this study falls into the second category.  \n**Re: Then what does this study mean?**\nTake this study for what it is\u2014preclinical data.  A layman\u2019s one-sentence summary of the paper might read: \u201cWe put signaling molecules on the outside of some leukemia cells, and this told the inside of the cell to stop behaving like cancer and start behaving like a useful immune cell.\u201d  \nIf I had a drug that was able to replicate the reprogramming effect today (I don\u2019t), we\u2019re still years and years away from full approval by the FDA.  But that\u2019s how science works.  Often discoveries that were made in the past only come to clinical fruition decades after their initial report.  I\u2019d like to push this therapy as a real strategy, and we\u2019ll see in the coming years whether I (and others) can generate the data to make that happen.  \nTo those of you who have been personally affected by cancer, my heart goes out to you.

Sorry for the slow reply--lots of meetings today.  Your questions (all good ones): \n1) I'd be in favor of a small molecule that facilitates transition to a myeloid state, simply because it's a tried and true path.  Unfortunately, I can't say too much more beyond that, but you can probably take a guess at some of the pathways we'd target.  \n2) Mouse models in B-ALL are tricky.  The spontaneous models of B-ALL aren't particularly representative of human disease (controversial point here), so we engraft human tumor cells in immunocompromised mice.  The question then is whether we can get these cells to transdifferentiate.  We're still working on this, but it's tough.  For example, the best way to deliver cytokines to the tumor cells is to go where the tumor cells live.  That means injecting cytokines into the marrow of (anesthetized) mice.  Not fun for the researcher, considerably less fun for the mouse.  \n3) I wouldn't anticipate this being a problem.  First, these patients receive chemo that knocks out the vast majority of the tumor cells.  The problem is cleaning up the last bit of cells that will cause recurrence.  Second, although macrophages can be involved in autoimmune disease, I haven't read a lot about them actually mediating disease.  Usually that's a lymphocyte-driven phenomenon.

It's worth noting that to really, truly appreciate a paper - its strengths, drawbacks, limitations, and exactly where it fits into its broader field - that requires more time than I have for this right now, but nevertheless here we go:\n\nFirst up, damn. They submitted the paper in July of 2014, and it was accepted in February of 2015. That's 7 months, which is a good example of why so many scientists find the publication process frustrating. It probably includes an initial review, then getting the first reviews back to the scientists, then them having time to do more experiments to address the reviewers comments, which then has to get reviewed again but that's still a really long time.\n\nOverall, it seems like a pretty cool paper to me. The top comment on this thread basically says it's \"just another we killed cancer in a petri dish\" study. Many times, that is a spot-on thing to say, but I think it sells the paper a little short in this case. One important experiment they did was that they took the reprogrammed cells, and did what's called a xenograft. That means they basically added those cells onto live mice, to see if it would turn cancerous. And the good news is that the mice generally didn't get and die of this particular leukemia, which is good! So, while that's not a purely \"in vivo\" result, it is a lot more \"in vivo\" than just doing cell culture in a petri dish.\n\nAlso, the general principle behind this finding is one worth paying attention to. Namely, it's the idea that transcription factors can be added to cells to re-program their identities. You might recall a couple years ago that Sinya Yamanaka won a Nobel Prize in medicine for converting mature cells into stem cells. In particular, he discovered that a cocktail of four transcription factors can turn mature cells into iPS cells - induced pluripotent stem cells.

There are tons of different kinds of cancers that require different approaches pharmaceutically, just the same as different subsets of the flu need different vaccines. Therefore the large workforce is divided across the many different cancer research projects. I'd say that the size of the workforce is not bottlenecking cancer research, except perhaps for the rarer forms.\n\nB) Safety. A lot of the length of R&amp;D is to establish the safety of the experimental drug. While cancer patients who are pretty much about to kick the bucket are allowed early access to new experimental drugs (their doctors can seek out a trial and have their patient enrolled), you cannot actually market a drug until it's proven safe. If they were to accelerate the development of such a drug, and then people who had a cancer diagnosis took the drug, were cured, but then 5 years down the road were developing another form of cancer at an unusually high rate, there would be lawsuits all around, the drug would be pulled, and all the efforts would be wasted.", "gilded": 0, "score": 6, "created": 1426621963.0},{"body": "Nail on the head there.

It's fast growing plants that are carbon negative (absorb carbon faster than they expel). \n\nPeople keep saying (without support data) that trees absorb CO2 faster than other plants because of their height. Well, most of the tree is dead (wood, bark lives but doesn't photosynthesize). It becomes their leaf surface area. That said, carbon sequestering by trees (absorbing more than they release) becomes their mass gain over the year. That is where carbon is absorbed and sequestered. As someone pointed out correctly below, trees and all plants also respirate, breathe oxygen and release CO2. So the net absorption of carbon is what becomes plant matter, haw fast a tree grows.\n\nFor this reason, cultivation of crops like hemp or other fast growing (tall growing) plants would actually sequester more carbon than a tree. Say you harvest an acre of hemp, use it as paper, fabric, or even re-till as organic matter. Compare the total weight of organic matter per acre vs an acre of forest, not total weight, just the weight gain of one tree ring and one pile of autumn leaves. That is how efficient the carbon sequestering is. Some bored engineers could probably calculate that and determine the increase and eventual decrease in sequestering for different forests, and compare that to a massive weed like growth that is chopped down once or twice a year.\n\nNice thing, even if you burn the mass you still can be carbon neutral since the CO2 emitted was originally in the air, one of the arguments for ethanol. Grant it that assumes you only use organic fuel in the cultivation, conversion, and combustion process.\n\nAnyway, converting forests to high yield farmland may not be so bad, converting it to residential or industrial is. \n\nAlso there is the water consideration. We consume a ton sequestering carbon. Would really like to see far more efficient sequestering technology, something of a scrubbing system that would be required as a tax for any residential or industrial conversion of farm or forest land. Good luck getting it passed, but that's where the benefit comes from.\n\nOh, and the oceans still are by far the biggest absorber of carbon, that is assuming we can keep them alive.

Carbon dioxide is one atom of carbon, to two atoms of oxygen. After they suck in the CO2, they release Oxygen, or O2. This leaves us with a Carbon.\n\nIf we stopped there, we would definitely say that trees are a carbon sink, but lets think about it a little more\n\nWe got this carbon. What does the tree do with it? Well, it takes the carbon, and with a little water and a little light, turns it into sugar. Yum! Now what do we do with that sugar?\n\nThe tree can do two things. It can use the sugar to grow bigger, or it can make the sugar into lots of energy. Everything needs energy to stay alive. We turn sugar into energy, and the tree does it the same way. \n\nIf the tree turns the sugar into energy, then it will release CO2, just like animals do. Thus, the same carbon that came in as CO2 will come out as CO2.\n\nIf the tree uses sugar to build, then the Carbon remains trapped in the tree. So trees are only carbon neutral to the extent that they grow. If the tree (or in a bigger sense, rainforest) isnt growing, it aint trappin. And it only traps to the extent of the growth. A (literal) ton of plant matter will represent less than a ton of carbon trapped.", "gilded": 0, "score": 5, "created": 1426781548.0},{"body": "&gt; I have always been of the belief that forests are slightly carbon neutral.\n\nFalse, they are primarily starch sugars formed from free CO2. They die and are sequestered into soils where it becomes hardened rock or sorts. Assuming it does not weather for whatever reason. Shale gases give you clues, and mud stones fizz under acid.\n\nThink about it. You see a giant tree sticking out of the ground. Its 100 tonnes or more. The ground around it has barely lifted. So where did the tree come from? The problem with your assumption is removing wooded forests would have no impact when logically it would. Growing new forests would have a positive impact. Removing all forests, as you suggest, would yield a disaster. Yes oceans *can* fix carbon too but in spite of their vastness, they are very poor and inefficient at doing it. Wooded forests will soak up their weight in carbon and not just the trees, everything under them too. The soils, and everything that exists in them and on them. \n\n&gt;For this reason, cultivation of crops like hemp or other fast growing (tall growing) plants would actually sequester more carbon than a tree. Say you harvest an acre of hemp, use it as paper, fabric, or even re-till as organic matter. Compare the total weight of organic matter per acre vs an acre of forest, not total weight, just the weight gain of one tree ring and one pile of autumn leaves.\n\nFalse again. Autumn leaves perhaps, we know this. But you are suggesting making paper would not result in autumn leaves or worse, methane? Where does the bulk of paper end up? \n\n&gt;Anyway, converting forests to high yield farmland may not be so bad. \n\nOnly if you have an agenda.\n\n&gt;Oh, and the oceans still are by far the biggest absorber of carbon. \n\nAbsorbing yes, doing anything with it, no. Its still there and its displacing oxygen. There is a calamity unfolding and its very silent but it will have catastrophic results. \n\nYou are turning the Aquarium into a fizzy drink. \n\nI think you need to look again. We have cut down 90% of the wooded forests in the last 300 years. If you look at the CO2 gathered from ice cores you can see it ends up there. Those trees added to the CO2 slowly over time. Houses and objects were constructed then rotted, It takes quite a lot of it time, until now even, to break down. But the point is, it is breaking down or has. There is an oversupply of CO2 just because we cut the woodlands down. \n\nNow look at the soils they were in. Some were in sand, not even a soil. They were adapted for that. That sand did very little to contain CO2. Acid Sulphate soils? Where is the CO2 there? You cut the trees but now when it rains after a dry spell, the soils turn to acid and kill everything. \n\nSo going back to what you claim, that farming instead of trees is a good thing. No its not. Not by any stretch of the imagination. You can farm in ways that can sequester CO2 into soils, letting them rest and then push down the wild plants and grow new crops, that works but it can never equal a 100 foot tall tree weighing in at 100 tonnes. There was a balance, an equilibrium of component gases in this ecosystem. Those gases have ebbed and pulsed for millennia. Ice ages came and went bringing the totals up and them back down again. Then humans cam along and burned forests for heat, used them for homes, destroyed them in wars - Look at the CO2 and temps during the war years, it spikes. There was balance, then there was not. \n\nWE need to live in a way that is in balance with the planet, not the other way around. An no engineering can fix the planet, it can only assist us.

Nevertheless, it is unclear how the terrestrial carbon sink will evolve as climate and atmospheric composition continue to change. Here we analyse the historical evolution of the biomass dynamics of the Amazon rainforest over three decades using a distributed network of 321 plots. While this analysis confirms that Amazon forests have acted as a long-term net biomass sink, we find a long-term decreasing trend of carbon accumulation. Rates of net increase in above-ground biomass declined by one-third during the past decade compared to the 1990s. This is a consequence of growth rate increases levelling off recently, while biomass mortality persistently increased throughout, leading to a shortening of carbon residence times. Potential drivers for the mortality increase include greater climate variability, and feedbacks of faster growth on mortality, resulting in shortened tree longevity.

The bottom of the vat is clear, and there's a platform inside the cat which you can move up and down. To print, you put that platform very close to the bottom, shine a laser on the bottom of the vat to cure some resin into plastic, then somehow peel that layer off the bottom so it's stuck to the platform. Then you lift the platform a bit, laser again, and stick a layer to that first layer. Peel off the bottom again and repeat hundreds of times.\n\nIn DLP printing, you do the same thing but use a DLP projector instead of alaser, so you can do the whole layer at once, and it's quicker. This isn't what's new here.\n\nIn both kinds, you spend most of your time peeling the layers off the bottom. That's a delicate trick you have to get just right to print well.\n\nIn this new tech, CLIP, the bottom of the vat is made to let a little bit of oxygen in, and the resin is made with special chemicals such that light can't harden it if there's oxygen in it.\n\nThe result is that the resin at the bottom of the vat can't harden, so the light goes through and the resin above that oxygenated resin does harden. But since there's that oxygen layer, the hardened resin isn't stuck to the bottom of the vat, it's only stuck to the platform.\n\nSince you don't have to peel layers anymore, you can do them really fast. In fact, there's no reason not to make them insanely thin because without the peeling part, it's actually faster to have super thin layers.\n\nI think this new tech is very cool, and it should blow normal SLA/DLP out of the water, but it still shares their other weaknesses, so I don't think this spells the end for FDM or SLS by any means.", "gilded": 0, "score": 10, "created": 1426572709.0},{"body": "You should ask the mods why they removed this comment and see in they'll put it back.

Some (*some*) leaders read *way* too much into the practice of tithing; treating it like a panacea against the problem of evil. The fact is that bad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people. No amount of orthodoxy or orthopraxy will erase that. I too cringe when I hear *some* LDS leaders speak in absolutes like this. But it's important to note that not all leaders are this extreme and take into account scriptural narratives like Job that provide a strong counter example to the orthodoxy/orthopraxy = no evil fallacy (though you're right in pointing out that current published manuals take the more extreme position -- hopefully that will be moderated in future revisions).\n\nBack more on topic, I'm critical of homeopathy of treating critical psychological, or non-psychological ***causes***. However, and this is important, homeopathy (and I include [prayer/meditation in this](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=prayer+symptom+treatment&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C48&amp;as_sdtp=)) has a strong correlation to treating some ***symptoms*** and to the degree that it reduces stress and creates a positive mental state we can expect it to objectively help with ***symptoms***. My big beef with the homeopathy industries is promoters confuse symptomatic treatment to causal treatment.\n\nAs a theist I do believe miracles are possible (causes inexplicably cured), but I must be honest that I see no objective, deterministic evidence of the regularity in that. So, as a result, I'm happy to pray/meditate (esp. since those are self-regulated) with the  objective expectation that they can promote symptomatic healing. But I don't insist on objective healing of causes. I'm happy to have faith that it's possible, but I don't attribute it to my own orthopraxy or orthodoxy. I look to competent medical doctors for any objective, empirical expectation of causal (or even symptomatic) healing.\n\nThis is somewhat a more modern or \"progressive\" perspective in Mormonism, but it's not outside the scope of Mormonism.\n\nQuick note, your point:\n\n&gt; You are blessed to be healed based on your faith and adherence to church rules. \n\nSimply isn't true. Recipients of healing are only asked to exercise faith in God and Christ within the context of a healing blessing. I've personally given blessings to a drug addict who was (and still is) miles away from what anyone would say as \"adhereing to church rules\" and they still express to me how much that gesture helped them. I've also given blessings to people who weren't, aren't, and don't plan on being Mormon and they've expressed similar gratitude and reported effects one would expect from practices like personal meditation or prayer.\n\nAnyways, I hope this helps provide an additional perspective. Note, I'm not going to engage in further debates on finer points of doctrine since this is /r/science.\n\nEDIT: BTW, your story about you and your wife both being \"inches apart, but separated by miles\" due to your individual situations is (honestly) touching.

First of all most studies are not about the placebo effect so there's no real reason to go the extra mile and attempt to see if the placebo effect is a real therapeutically significant effect in and of itself.

They don't understand that placebos *only* make them *feel* better.\n\nLet me illustrate. \n\nA [2011 study on asthma treatments](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/spin-city-placebos-and-asthma/#more-14434) divided asthma sufferers into 4 groups, treating them with either an albuterol inhaler (actual medicine), a placebo inhaler, sham acupuncture (placebo), or control (no treatment).\n\nAfter treatment, they asked them how *they felt* about their breathing. *All 3* treatment groups (albuterol, placebo inhaler, acupuncture) said they *felt* much better. The \"sit in the waiting room\" control group did not.\n\nBut then they gave them a spirometry test, which is an objective measure of lung capacity. *Only the group that got the actual medicine* (albuterol) showed any actual improvement in lung capacity. The two placebo groups had identical measured results with the control.\n\nSo there is only a certain category of patient-reported symptoms (usually called *nonspecific symptoms*) that placebo helps. This includes things like pain, nausea, fatigue, etc.\n\nNow obviously if something can help someone relieve or lessen persistent pain or nausea, then that's great. \n\nBut too many people misunderstand \"placebo effect\" as some magic \"mind over matter\" think where the \"brain heals the body\" or something, which is not really what is going on .\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 9, "created": 1426084202.0},{"body": "One area that I know the placebo effect is very real is in Parkinson's treatment.

She putz'ed around 5-6 months before the procedure due to her feeling confident the current homeopathic regime she was on surely was keeping it from spreading.... My brother and I were both in our 30's and pleaded with her to move the doctor prescribed treatments along and do exactly what they prescribed. But her then boyfriend had her convinced their was no rush. Anyway, finally she gets it done and still refuses radiation or chemo after, once again due to her feeling her homeopathic treatment would cure and keep it in remission. Fast forward 3-4 years. She finds another lump, cancer is back in her breasts and now in her lymph nodes. Once again doctors recommend full lump mesectomy with chemo and radiation. She continues to putz around. She is certain that new type of homeopathic medicine she is trying will help. After like a year with no improvement and the cancer getting worse she finally gives in and gets a full mesectomy. Then do outside influences (aka the boyfriend and crazy friends) she still puts of the full chemo and radiation only doing a reduced regime, once again the whole time my brother and I begging her to listen to her real doctors.... Yeah shockingly my mom ended dying a horrible death from her cancer about 4 years ago.... on New Years funny enough.

Nobody who isn't a farmer will understand how much agriculture has changed since the late 1800's. It used to be that people burned wood and put the ashes on their fields. This had the effect of returning minerals (periodic table elements that cannot be created outside of nuclear fusion) back to the soil to be absorbed by plants and ultimately go into your body and help you out.\n\nBut since we use electricity for everything now nobody is putting ashes on the fields. This means that the mineral levels in those fields have been depleting year in and year out for over a century. Not only that but when farmers fertilize they use exactly three elements only. Nitrogen, Potassium and Phosphorus. These are the only nutrients a plant really cares that much about the only ones that really effect it's growth and luster at the market place. \n\nSo basically you don't get the same elements from your fruit and vegetables that your great-great grandsire got.

Such systems would not be seen again in the subcontinent for centuries. The ancient Egyptians also built a massive system of canals and irrigation ditches, to carry the water of the Nile to the fields. The first appearance of water supply and sanitation technology in Europe was in the Minoan Civilisation of Crete - complete with underground pipes, sewage canals, stormwater systems and even flush toilets in the homes of the wealthy, and the later Mycenaean Greeks also pioneered pressurised piping. The Romans pioneered indoor plumbing and the aqueduct system, and were the first to use metal pipes. The early Chinese dynasties also had their own systems in place, pioneered independently of those in Europe and South Asia.

", "gilded": 0, "score": 8, "created": 1426527631.0},{"body": "Well, \"disappearing\" was a bit of an exaggeration - in India, many people seem to cling to the rather dramatic notion that the civilisation collapsed almost overnight in some sort of apocalyptic invasion. The truth is that the collapse happened over the course of about a century - starting in about 1800 BC and ending by about 1700 BC. In just about a century, the IVC went from being a centre of trade, agriculture and technology, to becoming a dead empire of abandoned and derelict cities. Compared to other ancient civilisations like Egypt and Mesopotamia, this was a very rapid collapse, and it did lead to many aspects of the IVC language and culture, and pretty much all knowledge of their history, being lost very quickly. Consider the fact that we still cannot decipher the IVC script - it disappeared so quickly and entirely that there was never any \"Rosetta stone\" of any sort (perhaps Sanskrit-IVC) to give us any leads at all. That being said, the people of the IVC didn't disappear, and there are actually demonstrable links between the IVC religion (what we can deduce about it) and early Hinduism, indicating a significant contribution to later Vedic religion. In fact, a very small number of IVC settlements, such as Pirak, continued to be inhabited as late as the invasion of Alexander the Great - although most were abandoned, as I said before. A few less advanced cultures that arose at the time also seem to show some IVC influence. So the people did get around a bit.\n\nBut it is still all somewhat mysterious in the sense that we don't know exactly why it happened... pretty much every theory about it is controversial. It was believed initially that the IVC people were driven out of their cities during a series of wars with invading Indo-European tribes from Central Asia (not Assyrians), who subsequently started the Vedic Civilisation and the Hindu culture. However, this theory has been weakened by the finding that most of the \"injuries\" that historians claimed to have found on skeletal remains were just the result of erosion. In addition, there is almost no damage to the cities and no archaeological evidence of a major war or battle at the time. It is more likely that the IVC underwent something more like an economic collapse, as a result of declining trade with Egypt and Mesopotamia, as well as increasing desertification in the North-Western regions of the subcontinent (the Thar Desert of today was once fertile land). Around that time, it is known that the Monsoon rains became much less frequent and bountiful, and it is also known that some major river systems in the heart of the civilisation dried up or were diverted. Mass deforestation also likely aided this situation. Severe drought likely forced the people to move East and South. At the same time, the Indo-European people started their migration into India (probably not an invasion), and it is likely that the IVC \"refugee\" populations ended up being incorporated into the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian cultures, contributing something to both, but ceasing to exist as a separate and unique culture on its own. In time, the IVC was forgotten completely, and its cities lay buried and lost until the mid 19th century. It's a controversial issue in India, as both Aryan (North Indian) and Dravidian (South Indian) nationalists claim the IVC people as their forefathers, and this has become an issue of ethnic identity. In Southern India, people cling to the belief that the IVC was destroyed by Indo-Europeans and that the refugees fled south to form the southern Dravidian civilisations. In Northern India, it is claimed that the \"Aryan Invasion Theory\" was a myth perpetuated by the British to divide the nation.

Modern South Asian cities have to deal with the problem of very rapidly expanding populations - more due to massive levels of rural immigration than natural population growth. This results in a demand for housing that cannot be met, and the growth of slums and satellite towns. Most of these are built by very poor migrants, who cannot afford to install their own sanitation facilities. Since these slums and shanty towns are unplanned and unincorporated, they do not have access to the established sewage systems either, and residential toilets are thus rather pointless in these areas. The authorities are unwilling to step in and improve sanitation services in the slums, as this would lend them an air of legitimacy and make it difficult to remove them later. I don't think this problem is going to be solved until the Government finds a way to provide tons of affordable urban housing, and expand city services to rural migrants - the way China is doing. It isn't like they cannot afford it - consider the fact that the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai is believed to be the wealthiest municipal corporation in all of Asia (and that's including cities like Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore).
