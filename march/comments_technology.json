A portion of the proceeds from this effort go to philanthropic initiatives. Please visit http://www.epicscale.com/ for more information. Epic Scale is a great partner for us to continue to generate revenue for the company, while contributing funds to good causes. In the future, Epic Scale plans to contribute CPU cycles to other initiatives, such as Genome mapping and other academic studies that require a great deal of processing power.\n\n&gt;As Groundrunner stated, it's easy to uninstall the software via Add/Remove Programs. Per the Epic Scale CEO's response in comments on the link you shared, the only data left in ProgramData\\Epicscale is a simple UUID (Unique User ID). This remains so that in case the software is reinstalled, BitTorrent would still be associated with the user. Feel free to delete this folder.

Your CPU has a LOT of power saving features to basically run on a very low wattage when not in use.\n\nTo do a quick calculation for cost of energy: \n\nKWatts * Hours * Cost of KWh = Total cost.\n\nLet's say on average your computer runs your CPU at say... Let's say 30 watts. Nothing amazing; it's probably higher.\n\n0.03 KW * (24 * 30) * 0.1 C/KWh = 2.16$ a month just running your CPU. This is ridiculously low especially considering 30 watts is pretty nominal, you're probably looking at 50-70 watts average on a modern CPU but I choose 30 watts because it can drastically vary from CPU to CPU and laptops would run really low wattage, desktops higher.\n\nAnyway, if you run the calculation again and assuming your CPU has a max output at 100 watts, a bittorrent program might cause your computer to run at say 90 watts. That might only be 6.48$ in electricity BUT THAT'S STILL MONEY YOU SHOULDN'T OF HAD TO SPEND. It worse assuming if you have multiple computers and never shut them off. It's also worse if you assume they might even be using your GPU to do calculations(They probably aren't, to complicated/easy to see if they are) and GPUs use around 3 to 4 times the wattage of your CPU.\n\nThis is VERY fucking horrible because they actually sell uTorrent. They might sell it for 10$(I dunno who buys uTorrent) so they can effectively charge you about 4$ a month without you knowing. Of course they might not get 4$ a month in selling the coins they get your computer to mine; but they still get a return by selling coins they mined.", "gilded": 0, "score": 148, "created": 1425651516.0},{"body": "The last bit is one of the huge fuck yous about this.

Though to be fair if you can install a mining software on a million CPUs that aren't yours you can make a decent profit due to no cost for electricity on your part.\n\nLike uTorrent did. Though uTorrent would be pretty dumb to mine bitcoins on CPUs. It'd probably be more profitable to mine Litecoin(Still doubt it) and even more profitable to have a person knowledgeable go on forums and mine the most hyped upcoming coin/early coin. If it blows up they make a killer profit, if it stays neutral they still make profit, if it tanks they lose nothing. \n\nSome coins for example within the fist week or more people can create huge and I mean huge amounts of generation. Mining works normally by giving more coins earlier and then decreasing with time.\n\nSo within first month it may generate 1/3rd of all coins to be mined period. Then next 6 months generate another 1/3rd, then years to generate the last 1/3rd though it entirely depends. \n\nSince it goes by if you solve a block you get X reward in coins, if say the total hash rate is 5 K/Hash on the coin in question at the beginning, and you are giving it 2 k/Hash of the 5 k/Hash you're getting basically 1/8th of the total coins in the first month. Of course if it's popular it'll increase within first month, but in general some bigger names/smarter people who get in REALLY early(most profitable time) can make a huge amount of bank.\n\nA typical coin if it has any support is guaranteed to hit at least 100,000$, if you can sell it at 1 month in you made 10k. Some people wait and if coin fails it tanks from 100k to like 1k after a month, BUT if it gains popularity can increase to millions. So do you decide to sell at 100k? Or wait till 1 to 3 million with your 1/10th of the coins?\n\nI used to be into it pretty hard core; and actually made 36k off of mining, but it's just not really worth it. I sold my first batch early(Dogecoin) and hated myself because I got 16k for my coins could have got probably close to 100k or more. Then I got 3k here, 4k there and gave up after I got to far engrossed and never made profit for like 8 months at one point.\n\nAnyone who used to or still does mine dogecoin; I sold 100 million dogecoin for 16k. Even now that dogecoin is basically tanked 100 million is still 17K CAD where I live. At it's peak it would of been roughly 240 satoshi~(I sold roughly when it hit 40ish satoshi after the first initial drop from 100 satoshi to 40 before it skyrocketed.\n\nYou live and learn, market is extremely volatile and it's hard to gauge what's going to be the next best thing really.", "gilded": 0, "score": 38, "created": 1425655035.0},{"body": "&gt; SHOULDN'T OF\n\nSHOULDN'T HAVE", "gilded": 0, "score": 192, "created": 1425652881.0},{"body": "I don't even get it.

Anything that google does they do well (I'm using well comparatively - no one can argue that they aren't better than their competition (Comcast and Verizon to name a few)).  So in the short term they would be so much better than being stuck with Verizon.  Their massive size gives them the ability to pull a wal-mart though...  Short term it's amazing.  I don't think that can be argued against.  \nLong term is what is scary.  They are in so many fields that they can have their prices ridiculously low in one sector (and lose money for a while) in order to put all of the competition out of business (pulling a Wal-Mart).  Then they have full control....  That is my long term fear.\nRight now they are being extremely honorable about everything, and are such a great example for the country of how a power-house company should act.  If that continues to be the case then a monopoly wouldn't really be a bad thing...  The corruptive nature of power is super scary though.
