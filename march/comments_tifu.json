We are both twenty something full time University students and have four jobs, five pets and approximately 9 key family members between us, all less than 20 minutes away at all times. Its pretty damn busy.\n\nCut to late last night.\n\nWe had had our friends over for approximately 7 hours for dinner and drinks, this seemed like a good idea to socialise before Exams amped up and really started to choke us. It was about 1am and we had just heard the final car pull away from the house. Success! A full night of entertainment and mature behaviour we both knew we were not usually capable of.\n\nMy attention quickly turned to my very full bladder. As I was the lady and host of the house I kept up the idea that I never use the toilet. Now my house way empty and all I wanted was to sit on my thrown with my DS and slippers. Now I knew my partner would also need to use the bathroom as his system had the strength and size of a five year old.\n\nNow people\u2026 as he had used the toilet not 2 hours before, I decided logically I would use it first. That was not the case. We both looked towards the bathroom at the same time. No one moved for at least three seconds. After that it was pretty much a fight to the death. Trying to push him out of the way and he in turn pulling me back to get in the lead. Now I am pretty small, 5\u20191 in height and flexible. He sits at a comfortable 6\u20192 so I would honestly say I had no chance. But I am not above biting and playing dirty. We were both laughing hard so it was all well and good till he flipped me over, opened the door and made a great deal of taking his prize with cheering /whooping as he sat down.\n\nI gave up and though my bladder was constantly alerting me of the danger level we were at\u2026 I allowed him to claim victory. I went and retrieved my sweet sweet slippers and Ds from the lounge room and came back to wait in the doorway.\n\nSomething about the stupid smile on his face, the wine and the feeling of losing the race to the toilet made me want to get even.\n\nHeads up people\u2026 He is ticklish. Not the \u2018hahaha - stop that\u2019 but the full on \u2018spasm and seizure\u2019 type reaction. My slightly tipsy self did not take this into consideration\u2026 AT ALL!\n\nSo I took the two or three steps to meet him at the toilet and wrapped my arms around him. He caved instantly and gave me a hug back (happy). Now my arms had moved secretly to just between his ribs. The \u201cWeak Point\u201d If you will. So without thinking, without a moments hesitation or thought I went for it. He laughed so hard and tensed at such an angle that he leaned back from the toilet while he was stilling peeing like a horse and I was sprayed in urine.\n\nI had finally stopped screaming about 2 minutes later. My eyes were squeezed shut and my clothes were suddenly uncomfortably moist. He looked at me with such a mortified expression that would have been hilarious if I was not covered completely.\n\nThree things were abundantly clear. 1) I was about 50% covered. 2) He had finally stopped peeing\n\nand\n\n3) I would never tickle him again.\n\nI stayed silent and he tried to find the words to apologise. I looked down and stifled a little sob. My duckie slippers had taken the full brunt of the tidal wave my boyfriend had unleashed upon me. They would never be soft or innocent again. My black jeans were even blacker in certain patches and my good white top had questionable splotches. Still deathly silence as my grimace had changed to a stare. I was surprised he was not stone by then. My boyfriend had just urinated on me. Full blast and uncensored. That\u2019s honestly a first for both of us. Also I didn\u2019t like it so this will definitely not be a thing we have together.\n\nI slowly removed my slippers one by one and deserted them on the floor. The soaked jeans were next then the top, followed by everything else. I left them in a pile at the doorway then proceeded immediately into the shower. He was still sort of frozen to his seat staring at my slippers, still processing what he had done to me. I scrubbed my skin with my apple shaped loofa until my skin felt clean or theuntil the next layer of skin was coming through... Your choice.\n\nI am now in bed, hair wet and lights off. It has been 20 minutes since leaving the shower and I have not said a word. I keep hearing giggles then long periods of silence from him downstairs as he ponders on how hilarious this all was. I can also hear the washing machine whirl quietly so I think my clothes and slippers are in the process of being revived. Reddit, I will never touch a man on his thrown ever again. For the sacrificial slaughtering of duckie slippers will be the outcome.\n\nTL/DR: Had friends over. Raced my boyfriend to the toilet. Lost. Tickled him. Got peed on. Slippers were murdered. Cried.

Everyone's brain chemistry is a little different. For some people, crying releases a LOT of serotonin, almost making them giddy after a good cry. For others, almost no serotonin is released.\n\nUsually this cooresponds to testosterone and estrogen levels. Generally if a man and a woman are feeling the exact same (sad) emotion, the woman will cry and the man will not. This does not necessarily depend on social norms, as the man *literally* has less of a biological reason to cry, while the woman's body knows from experience that she will feel better if she does.\n\nThis direct coorelation to estrogen and testosterone levels is why men who get relief from crying, and who tend to cry more, are more related to being pussies. Not only are they behaving in a feminine way, but they likely have less testosterone than their non-crying male peers, which is also likely to be obvious by their physical traits. \n\nFor example, muscular, tall, and hairy men will be (genetically) less likely to cry than their thin, scrawny (is that a bad word? Should I have said 'weak' instead? What's the opposite of 'muscular'?) peers. This is another reason why crying men can be labeled 'pusses'.\n\nHowever, we, as a society, ought to start accepting our own differences. I think that someone who gets a serotonin kick out of crying is more lucky than someone who doesn't. Everyone should obviously be *allowed* to cry, but please do not equate it to displaying emotions. \n\nSomeone experiencing the *exact same emotions* may not cry simply because there is no biological imperative for them to do so.
