At that rate, the panels would pay for themselves in just over 8 years, and that's assuming you paid full price for them, and that's not counting any credit you receive for power that you sell back to the utility company.  And since most solar panels come with warranties guaranteeing them for 25 years or more, they're probably going to end up paying for themselves at least two times over.\n\n\nSo where does the money sink come in?\n\nSolar panels are an investment.  How the hell is buying something that leads to your eventual independence from the power companies and has the potential to cut your expenses by over $100 a month more of a money sink than just spending $100 a month on something that will never give back?", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1426863356.0},{"body": "That's also assuming perfect sun at all hours AND that you happen to have a mounting point that never sees shade ever, which is highly unlikely.", "gilded": 0, "score": 5, "created": 1426863892.0},{"body": "I love the people who assume solar is the magic solution to all our problems.

Also the solar panels don't fail that often... so a 25 year warranty is really easy for the company to do. The inverters fail much more often (you're pretty much guaranteed 1-2 replacements in 25 years).  They're also the most expensive part of the system.  Coincidentally, they have a [5-10 year warranty](http://solarenergy.net/solar-power-resources/guide-to-understanding-solar-warranties/).  The inverter you're linking to has a [2-5 year warranty](http://www.wholesalesolar.com/products.folder/inverter-folder/magnum-ms-4448PAE.html) and costs 2k.  With such a vanishingly short warranty, expect to replace that one frequently.  The company is basically saying \"we don't do a very good job on this product.\"  \n\nSo, guestimating, you're now back to the ROI that most solar folks estimate.  Using your numbers with [this calculator](http://solarsimplified.org/solar-resources/calculate-your-solar-savings) gave me a little over 30 years on a 39k (3.9KW equivalent to your link) system so your ~20k system (after labor but not including multiple new inverters plus paying someone to install them) should be ~15 years.  Add 2-4 years for every inverter replacement.  \n\nYes, solar makes sense but not for the average French family.  The average French family has [$29,322 in disposable income annually](https://www.google.com/search?q=average+family+income+in+france&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8).  They're likely going to take out a loan to afford solar.  In the US, there are a bunch of incentives to get loans (offered by the installers usually) so you can get a $0 down loan.  However, once you do that your monthly payment outstrips your energy savings.  You're probably STILL paying some to the electric company since many companies will give you credit towards future bills if you overgenerate but not actually give you cash.  Than means, most people install systems that provide most of their energy needs but they try not to overshoot because then they're paying for a system that gives the power company extra energy that they never pay you back for.  Anyway, say the unthinkable happens and you manage to break even on the power bill.  You still have a net increase in your monthly \"power bill\" due to the loan for the system.  For folks with money to throw around, sure solar makes a lot of sense.  For people who are concerned about making mortgage payments/car/food, the $100/month power bill with it's 0% ROI is just fine.  That money is being spent on staying alive.  That's where incentives come in (and all the bad stuff incentives bring).

However, the pH of the cervix changes and becomes less acidic just before and during ovulation. For this reason, male sperm cells may have a better chance of surviving and fertilizing the egg cell. The egg cell, on the other hand, can only be fertilized for around 24 hours after ovulation. So, depending on when exactly fertilization occurs, any one of these factors may play a role in determining the gender of the offspring.

", "gilded": 0, "score": 19, "created": 1426773008.0},{"body": "Just to clarify one aspect of this study; if this could be successfully applied to humans, it would theoretically halt the progression of the disease, but it will not erase the damage already done.\n\nIf the progression is halted and the existing plaques removed, there is a good chance that the brain may recover somewhat given that brains are amazingly good at recovering from damage (even recovering lost \"data\"), but this would be fairly hindered in elderly patients due to the fact that these neuroregenerative capabilities tend to decline significantly with age (due to reduced cell division, programmed downregulation of certain key genes with age, accumulated gene damage, etc).\n\nAfter some thought, my best guess at a next step once the problematic plaques have been countered would be as following:\n\n**A) Administer agents that increase the production of neurotrophic factors** (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, Nerve Growth Factor, Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, etc). It will require further research, but if intentional age-related downregulation of their associated genes is the main reason for the reduced levels in elderly individuals (and not actual damage to their associated genes), there are already agents that could serve this purpose. Russian-developed *N-phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine ethyl ester* also known as \"Noopept\" is associated with increased production of BDNF and NGF in the rat brain (and has successfully been used to increase cognitive capabilities in a human pilot study using brain-trauma patients).\n\n**B) Administer agents that increase neurovascular supply** (increase both blood flow and venous tissue penetration). Piracetam is a novel agent capable of increasing blood flow without impairing clotting (important for elderly individuals who are more vulnerable to developing bleeds), by increasing blood cell flexibility (essentially making it easier for blood cells to be squeezed past occlusions or into smaller spaces). It additionally exerts a direct neurochemical influence (albeit subtle) on the brain's signalling, which has been observed to be slightly beneficial for underperforming brains (though it does not exert an observable benefit in healthy brains).\n\nAdditionally, increasing angiogenesis (though carefully and with verification of an absence of cancerous tumours that may be fed by increased blood supply) is a goal to ensure that new neurons can be supported, as microcirculation may have been compromised by the plaque accumulation (or through normal age related means). Various active compounds derived from the plant Centella asiatica have been found to moderately promote increased microcirculation.\n\n**C) Administer agents that increase the resilience of existing tissue to promote an ideal environment for regeneration to occur.** These would include the administration of acetylcysteine to ensure Glutathione (an important antioxidant, particularly for the brain and the liver) stores are optimal. Additionally, a combination of supplemental Coenzyme Q10 and Pyrroloquinoline quinone would provide increased mitochondrial support (with PQQ being particularly advantageous in that it increases mitochondrial proliferation; which may have been particularly impacted by the protein plaques characteristic of the disease).\n\nAntioxidants are relevant (though not particularly useful for the untreated condition) to Alzheimers in that the cell death caused by the protein plaques causes the release of stored neurotransmitters, one of which called \"Glutamate\", serves to \"excite\" neurons. When released in significant quantities (such as when a cell \"bursts\") however they can cause the overexcitation of surrounding neurons. Aside from possibly damaging surrounding neurons, this causes increased metabolic demand as it occurs all over the brain. Increased metabolic activity increases production of \"reactive oxygen species\" which can cause secondary damage to tissue. This is what ensuring proper antioxidant support serves to protect against.\n\n**D) Ensuring proper nutritional support for optimal neuroregeneration.** Neuroregeneration may be hindered by slight deficiencies in various important nutrients. Ensuring a proper diet would be crucial to success, and if required, the addition of supplementary forms of various nutrients (B-Vitamins and protein in particular).\n\nI have followed both the current Alzheimer's research, and the various compounds I have described here. Do note that many have been tested in isolation and are very (or at all) effective at actually treating the cause of dementia, or reducing symptoms if it is still progressing. No amount of antioxidants or neurotrophic agents are going to override the extensive damage caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins, so until that base cause is stopped, they can only provide little benefit.\n\nHowever, based on what I've read of the literature, I highly suspect that a cocktail combination of these in concert would be extremely beneficial to a post-Alzheimer's patient should our ability to treat the root cause of the disease advance. Alone, each may only provide a small benefit, because there are several factors required for increased brain tissue damage recovery. Increasing antioxidants alone, or increasing neurovascular supply will exert only a small benefit, because each are only one part of the puzzle. But together, there very well could be a profound positive reaction.\n\nI look forward to seeing where this new research takes us.

This gives the impression that the Conservative Party is putting its historical reputation before children\u2019s safety.
