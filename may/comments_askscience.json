Assuming an infinite grid, person A taking a random step is exactly equivalent to person B taking a random step while person A stands still. That's just a change in reference frame. Thus, person A and person B both taking a random step is equivalent to person B taking *two* random steps while person A stays still. So, when both people are moving, we would expect the average meeting time to be cut in half, since it's equivalent to making person B take twice as many steps per unit time.\n\nOf course, that only works if the people never run into the boundaries of the grid (i.e., the grid is effectively infinite). That's why your results don't quite match my prediction for the smaller grid, but they do seem to for the bigger grids.\n\nEdit: I should point out that I've tacitly assumed here that a person on an infinite grid would, on average, find their friend in a *finite* amount of time. I realize now that that may not be correct. To fix that, I would need to assume that there are boundaries, so that a person will find their friend eventually, but also assume that those boundaries are far enough away that my argument above is mostly valid.\n\nThe point is, two people moving randomly at each time step can be viewed as one person making two independent random steps at each time step. Adding boundaries just makes the probability of moving in a given direction more complicated. So if a person is going to find their friend eventually, they'll find them faster if both people are moving.

But, I added a bit of a movement model.\n\nI tried to pick something reasonably simple that modeled each player wandering around with some intent, moving to a location they haven't been to in a while. The seeker because they're looking in a \"stale\" location for their friend. The tourist because they want to see something new.\n\nIn this case, for a moving player (either seeker or tourist), they pick a destination and move with determination to it. The destination is randomly selected from the lowest 10% least recently seen grid squares. Players then move in nearly a straight line until they reach their target destination, at which point they pick a new random destination using the same strategy. Each tick, players move in one of four directions. If the destination requires movement in both x and y, the player randomly picks one of those two directions each turn. Each movement marks the vision radius (10) around the current grid square as recently seen.\n\nI ran 1000 trials for each grid size and seeker strategy (wanders or stands). The seeker finds the tourist if they're within 10 grid squares.

On average (median) it's 2x faster for a seeker to wander than stand. In the 90th percentile, it's about 3x faster. In the 98th percentile, it's about 4x faster.\n\nThis is maybe a little surprising for this movement model because you'd think even with the bit of randomness the tourist still might visit the whole map more quickly, thus finding a standing seeker sooner. Apparently not -- I'd suppose even in this case the randomness trumps the intent. (Or there's a bug in my simulation.)\n\n**Edit:** Ah! It's worthwhile to consider how many moves it would take if one player stands and the other player takes an optimal route that covers the map.\n\nWith this setup with a visibility radius of 10, an optimal route to cover the 320x320 world from an optimal starting point requires somewhere around 5100 steps, the median being half that at around 2500 steps.\n\nIn this simulation, a wandering seeker found the tourist in a median of about 2000 steps. This means that **it is on average better for the seeker to wander than stand still, even if the tourist happens to be optimally seeking the seeker.**\n\n**Edit:** Fixed bias in marking a region viewed -- primarily affects the 75-, 90-, and 98%iles. Signficantly less bad for standing in the worst case (for a 320x320 world, 48433 steps became 18815 steps) -- slightly worse for standing in the worst case (for a 320x320 world, 10197 steps became 12974 steps).

This consists of three different types of points: corners (4 of them) edges (8 of them) and middles (4 of them). So, initial state you have a 1/4 chance of being in a corner, 1/2 chance of being on an edge, 1/4 chance of being in the middle.\n\nIf you're on a middle piece, you have even chance of moving in any direction: two of those directions put you back on a middle piece and two put you on an edge.\n\nIf you're on an edge you have 1/3 chance of moving to a middle, 1/3 chance of moving to the other edge, and 1/3 chance of moving to a corner.\n\nIf you're in a corner, you have a 100% chance of moving to an edge.\n\nSo, the odds of your second position being a middle space are (1/4)x(1/2)+(1/2)x(1/3) +(1/4)x(0) = 7/24.\n\nThe odds of your second position being an edge are (1/4)x(1/2)+(1/2)x(1/3)+(1/4)x(1) = 13/24\n\nThe odds of your second position being a corner are (1/4)x(0)+(1/2)x(1/3)+(1/4)x(0)=1/6 or 4/24.\n\nIn fact, I bet as we continue we could make a Markov chain of this. We can make it into a matrix and find the eigenvector for steady state. We'll actually get three eigenvectors, but two of them will have negative values which won't make sense. ~~Lo and behold... the eigenvector with equal probability of being in a corner/edge/middle gives us the eigenvector.~~\n\n~~This means that you *will* have an equal chance of being in a corner as on an edge as on a middle... but there are twice as many edges as middles and corners... so any particular edge piece is actually half as likely to contain a person as a non-edge piece.~~\n\n~~Edit: I tried it with a 5x5 and also found equal chance of being in an state type, but since the middle middle is unique and the EdgeNextToACorner has 8, then those will be the most and least likely places to find them (by a factor of 4 and 1/2 respectively)? Now I'm beginning to doubt my method.~~\n\n~~Edit2: I definitely see why it will always give me a solution of equal odds in every state... and makes me think the Eigenvector-&gt;Steady State assumption has a flaw.~~\n\n**Edit3**: I wrote my matrix the wrong way. Transposed it and for the 4x4 case now I get a steady state solution of 1/3 middle, 1/2 edge and 1/6 corner, which actually puts any middle square as more likely than any edge (since there are twice as many edges), which is more likely than a corner.\n\nEdit4: 5x5 case yields results of 1/20 chance of being in the very middle square, 1/5 chance of being in an \"interior edge\" (there are four of them, so 1/20 each), 1/5 chance of being in an interior corner (there are four of them, so 1/20 also), 3/20 chance of being in an exterior middle edge (there are four of them, so 3/80), 3/10 chance of being in an exterior secondary edge (there are 8 of them so 3/80) and 1/10 chance of being in a corner (there are four of them so 1/40).

Assuming your random walk rules, where each walker moves randomly to either the north, south, east, or west, we consider the simplest lattice, a 2x2 grid.  There are essentially two starting conditions for this lattice:\n\n* the walkers sharing a diagonal, i.e., on opposite corners\n* the walkers sharing an edge, i.e., on a single side.\n\nIn the first case, the probability the walkers meet for the first time on their nth move is 1/2^n.  This is seen by noting that the walkers either meet, with probability 1/2, on their first move, or are in an equivalent arrangement to their initial condition, i.e., on opposite corners.  This process repeats until they meet.\n\nHowever, if the walkers share an edge they will never meet.  Any move leads them directly back to their initial condition in which they share an edge.  This is because the only two composite moves available to the walkers are an exchange or a move to one of the three other edges.  In larger grids, similar sets of initial conditions always exist; they are whenever the difference between initial conditions in one dimension is an odd number of sites and the other is even.\n\nOf course, the simple result described above relied on your particular set of rules for the random walk.  Different rule systems, for example, the inclusion of a 'stay' option or the incorporation of a 'viewing range', would clearly complicate this simple analysis.  However, I think that rule systems which eliminate the above difficulty will tend to lead to average identical times because you can map the two moving-particle system to a one moving-particle system by fixing one of the particles.  This is only simple in periodic lattices, but for a big enough closed space a periodic approximation may be appropriate.\n\nI believe your result, in which both walkers moving leads to them meeting in half the time is a quirk of your numerical code.

If, however, they might also stand still from time to time, then moving is strictly better than standing still.\n\n\n**Code**: I wrote up the graph walks over at https://github.com/Pomax/AmusementParkProblem with a run-in-the-browser page for it over on http://pomax.github.io/AmusementParkProblem\n\n\n**An explanation**\n\n\nLet's model the amusement park as a graph, with \"places to be\" as nodes, \"paths to walk from place to place\" as edges, and \"finding someone\" either being on in the same place or walking in opposite directions on the same path, so you bump into each other (or at least see each other as you pass by). I'm also going to assume you don't start both in the same place, for obvious reasons.\n\n\nFor any graph with 'n' nodes, we can set up all possible \"who is where\" configurations, and then see what the odds are of finding each other in a single step. We'll either find each other, or we'll end up in a starting configuration, so if we don't find each other on step one, the odds of finding each other on the next step follow the same model.\n\n\nYou also stipulated that the person you're looking for HAS to move, but this seems silly. They're not looking for you, so they could very well be standing still, too. That gives us two problems to look at: which of the \"I stand still\" vs \"I move around\" tactics wins when (a) my target *must* move, and (b) my target *can* move.\n\n\n**Let's begin!**\n\n\nThe simplest amusement park has an entrance, a ride, and a way to get from one to the other. Boring, but let's look at it anyway. There is only one possible starting position:\n\n\n1. (you)---(target)\n\n\nIf we follow your rules, and say our target *must* move, then:\n\n- if we don't move, and our target moves, we'll meet on the left.\n\n- if we do move, and our target moves, we'll meet on the way.\n\nOdds of meeting as nomove:move = 1:1\n\n\nIf we follow the slightly more realistic rules where our target *may* move, then:\n\n- if we don't move, and our target moves, we'll meet on the left.\n\n- if they don't move, we won't meet.\n\n- if we do move, and our target moves, we'll meet in the middle, and\n\n- if they don't move, we'll meet on the right.\n\nOdds of meeting as nomove:move = 0.5:1\n\n\nIn this very boring park, depending on what our target's policy is, \"moving\" is as good as, or better than, \"not moving\".\n\n\nSo let's look at the three node case. We're assuming no dead ends so we're looking at a ring with three nodes, and two possible starting configurations:\n\n\n1. (you)--(target)--(   )--(you), and\n\n2. (you)--(   )--(target)--(you).\n\n\nThat looks like four nodes, but the last node is the first node, used to show the ring being closed. Both we and our target have two directions we can walk in, left or right.\n\n\nIf we follow your rules, and say our target *must* move, then:\n\n- if we don't move, and our target moves left, we'll meet if we start from 1. and won't meet from 2.\n\n- if we don't move, and our target moves right, we won't meet if we start from 1. and will from 2.\n\n- if we move left, and our target moves left, we won't meet form either start.\n\n- if we move left, and our target moves right, we'll meet from 1. and cross paths from 2.\n\n- if we move right, and our target moves left, we'll cross paths from 1. and meet from 2.\n\n- if we move right, and our target moves right, we won't meet from either start.\n\nOdds of meeting as nomove:move = (2 out of 4):(4 out of 8) = 1/2:1/2\n\nIf we follow the slightly more realistic rules where our target *may* move, then:\n\n- if we don't move, and our target doesn't move, we won't meet.\n\n- if we don't move, and our target moves left, we'll meet if we start from 1. and won't meet from 2.\n\n- if we don't move, and our target moves right, we won't meet if we start from 1. and will from 2.\n\n- if we move left, and our target moves left, we won't meet form either start.\n\n- if we move left, and our target doesn't move, we'll only meet starting from 2.\n\n- if we move left, and our target moves right, we'll meet from 1. and cross paths from 2.\n\n- if we move right, and our target doesn't move, we'll only meet starting from 1.\n\n- if we move right, and our target moves left, we'll cross paths from 1. and meet from 2.\n\n- if we move right, and our target moves right, we won't meet from either start.\n\nOdds of meeting as nomove:move = (2 out of 6):(6 out of 12) = 1/3:1/2\n\n\nAgain we see that depending on what our target's policy is, \"moving\" is either as good as, or better than, \"not moving\".\n\n\nFor a four node graph things get more complicated because the graph complexity can now range from \"a ring with four nodes\" to \"a fully connected graph\" (where each of the four nodes is connected to the other three). At this point, typing becomes bothersome, but the procedure for testing remains the same: we generate all possible starting configurations, and then see what the odds of meeting are in a single step for each. If we run them, then we still see that if our target is not allowed to stand still, \"nomove\" vs. \"move\" is still equal odds, but if they *are* allowed to stand still, \"move\" is the winning strategy (ring result: 2/6:4/12 = 1/3:1/3 vs. 2/9:6/18 = 2/9:3/9, fully connected result: 3/9:3/9=1/3:1/3 vs. 3/12:12/48=2/16:3/16)\n\n\nTaking that to its conclusion: if you don't know what the target's policy is, just walk around, because you'll always either perform on par with, or better than, standing still in the hopes that you spot them as they walk by. However, it's worth noting that the more complex the amusement park graph becomes, the smaller the difference in odds becomes between \"stay where you are\" and \"look around for them\". \n\n\nOf course, in real life, you've simply agreed before hand to meet back at the concession stand if you can't find each other for more than 10 minutes. But that's less fun.\n\n*On a final note*: the odds of meeting are only 100% given infinite time if the park has a flat, 2D graph, thanks to the fact that a 2D random walk is guaranteed to through its starting point given infinite time. However, if there are any bridges or tunnels, with up/down stair cases to connect to other paths (say there's a high traffic overpass in the park, for instance), then that turns our graph into a 3D space, and all bets are off: a random walk in 3d may never pass through its starting point, even given infinite time, and so the chances of finding our target will never become 100%.", "gilded": 0, "score": 9, "created": 1431580916.0},{"body": "Standing still...at the exit.

Assume, that you are hunting for food (food = the person you are looking for) and you can be in exactly two states. Either you are looking around for your food, or you are moving. This means, that while you are moving, you won't notice the food around you. I know, this is somehow unrealisitc for this scenario, but my point is a different one.\n\nThe standard theory for [Random Walks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) and  [Brownian motion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion) most of the time assumes, that your steplength is sampled from a [Gaussian distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). This means, that it is highly unlikely to perform a long step and rather likely to perform a small step (there is a justification for this, namely the fact that your steplength corresponds to the distance to collision with a background media which is likely to be small). \n\nHowever, it has beend observed, that the optimal search pattern for foraging is to sample steps from a different distribution, namely one that is algebraically decaying (and not exponentially, like Gaussian). This means, that large jumps are still less likely than small jumps, but more likely than in the Gaussian case and the mean jump length is actually inifinity. In the given context, this is considered an optimal strategy for foraging.\nThere is even the [Levy flight foraging hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_flight_foraging_hypothesis): \n\n*Since L\u00e9vy flights and walks can optimize search efficiencies, therefore natural selection should have led to adaptations for L\u00e9vy flight foraging.*\n\nAnd this has actually been observed.

The important part are the assumptions on the target. In the foraging setting this means: Target does not move (or relatively slow compared to own movement) and more importantly, there is some correlation between food at position X and food around position X.

I'm not really sure what you're trying to convey there.\n\nPasswords are generally encrypted using a one-way hash, which acts as a \"mathematical ratchet.\" It generates data that is negligibly distinguishable from random and that has a very slim chance of being produced from any other password. It doesn't matter whether your password has prime numbers in it or not. In fact, it shouldn't matter: If you could show a given hash output was derived from a password containing primes (or really, any specific data) the hash would be provably insecure, because you should not be able to draw *any* inference about the password used based on looking at its hash.\n\nSemiprimes are used in some exponential ciphers that exploit discrete logarithm hardness (i.e. it is not known how to easily compute y from x^y mod n for very large numbers). Consider a large prime number *p*. The totient function of p, phi(p) which is the number of coprimes to p less or equal to p is obviously p-1, since p is prime. By Euler's theorem, we know that any x^phi(p) = 1 mod p. Now think up some exponent k having gcd(k,phi(p)) = 1. We can compute its modular inverse k' easily using extended Euclid.\n\nNow, you could encrypt a message M by taking C = M^k mod p. Because a discrete log is hard to compute, an adversary could not (easily) figure out M from C by itself. However, if you want a friend to be able to decrypt C, they need *k'* and *p*. Furthermore, phi(p) is easy to compute and thus if you know *k* and *p*, or *k'* and *p*, you can find the other *k*.\n\nHowever, if you have a different modulus *m* instead of *p* where *m* is a semiprime consisting of the product of two primes *p* and *q*, it is much more difficult to compute phi(*p*) without knowing *p* and *q*. Then we can generate a *sk*, *pk* pair from which it is very difficult (again, as far as we know) to derive the other *sk* from *pk* and vice -versa. RSA exploits this property and I suspect it is what you were thinking of.

This had an impact because the people at the Y-Stations who listened for enigma messages and then sent them to the codebreakers got to recognise the signature/style of the morse code that the operators sent, therefore a guess could be made as to what the Kenngruppen was, which aided the decoding of the message.\n\nThe enigma also had an inherent weakness in that it was impossible to see the same letter encoded as the same thing if they were next to each other, e.g. \"hello\" would never be encoded to \"ethhn\". Also, a letter would never be encoded as itself (e.g. \"hello\" would never become \"hcrtk\" or \"xeghy\"). This was a huge help when trying to see if a crib (clear text) could possibly match the message.\n\nAlso, do keep in mind that the English Government Code &amp; Cipher School (the organisation responsible for code breaking) was also fed information from the Polish cipher bureau, who had been working on the Enigma for some time during the 1930s (Enigma started as a commercial venture for banks etc to send secure messages). The Poles had made some nroads in to prewar enigmas and understood some elements of how the machine worked - Henryk Zygalski, Marian Rejewski and Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki did much of the early work to defeat enigma, indeed Rejewski devised the initial design for the bombe machine that Alan Turing later improved on before GC&amp;CS made the machine(s) that helped significantly in the decoding effort.\nZygalski created his sheets - you can find examples on the internet but they were sheets with perforated holes in, by placing the sheets over each other in the right order some of the enigma settings could be determined. An almost identical method was devised by Gordon Welchman at Bletchley Park (he hadn't been told they existed..), the sheets were used extensively during the war.\n\nDo note that the enigma changed many times before and during the war, there was a lot of hard work done during the war to get on top of Enigma and keep up with the changes.

A brute force attack, or one in which all keys are tried, is the worst case attack. A cryptanalyst will utilize all available shortcuts to avoid having to resort to brute force. So if the GCHQ had to break Enigma again, they would utilize mostly the same tactics they used back in WW2. They would find the patterns in the German key usage and plaintext. They would also attempt to reduce the Enigma complexity as much as possible--notice the lack of fixed points (no letter encrypts to itself) in Enigma, eliminate plugboard settings, etc.\n\nEnigma was adequate *given that the key was random and nothing was known about the message*. The environment in which modern ciphers are used is very different. For instance, if you were to use Enigma to encrypt your wireless connection (instead of WPA), this would be hideously insecure. That's because your network might broadcast tens of thousands of very similar packets every second, each encrypted with the same key. This would enable a known-plaintext attack which is what GCHQ used back in WW2, except now they have millions or even billions of hints instead of just one or two. Cracking your wifi would be trivial.\n\nIf you were to use Enigma to encrypt a single unique message, using a random key, none of the known cryptanalysis methods would be effective. In that sense, Enigma is still secure.\n\nEnigma is not designed to protect against a known-plaintext attack which is a common scenario in modern cipher usage. The attacker often knows what is being encrypted and might then attempt to recover the key being used. For that reason, modern ciphers utilize diffusion which spreads the statistical properties of the plaintext throughout the whole ciphertext. The result is that if you use a modern cipher like AES to encrypt \"May 24, 2015\" the ciphertext will be quite different than if you were to encrypt \"May 25, 2015\" with the same key. Further, modern ciphers utilize confusion, which disrupts any linear relationship between the ciphertext and the key. Thus encrypting \"A\" with the key \"123\" will yield something entirely different than if you encrypted \"A\" with the key \"124\".\n\nSo in most practical cases Enigma is not secure.", "gilded": 0, "score": 21, "created": 1432489072.0},{"body": "&gt;GFLOPS\n\nThis is entirely integer-based.

It's part of why life is mostly symmetrical or radial. You have a point of origin, let's say a shoulder area, producing a particular protein during development. As the cells near it replicate to form an arm, the protein made at the origin spreads into them. The further the cells are from the origin, the less protein they have. Eventually, the cells are far enough away that the lack of that protein signals that the new cells being formed should be hand cells. Those hand cells then function as a new point of origin for a different protein radiating outward, which when present on its own forms finger cells and when mixed with the original shoulder protein forms wrist cells. At about a 50/50 mix of hand/shoulder proteins, elbow cells form. \n\nThis is a very simplified explanation, as the truth involves the interaction of countless protein gradients and combinations from tons of origin points, but it's the general way that your body forms and differentiates. \n\nSo the cells on the tip of your nose are far enough from the point where your nose meets your face and have little enough of one or, more likely, five thousand nose proteins that they know they should be tip of nose cells as opposed to anything else.

Those stem cells are induced to differentiate (decide on which cell type to become) based on specific chemical signals in addition to cell-cell interactions. In fact, a big part of how cells orient themselves is based off of rubbing against and grabbing onto each other (such as in Notch) or protein gradients like Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.\n\nIn fact, the latter signaling pathway (Wnt/beta-catenin) is a very early indicator for directionality of cell populations (it keeps your organs from being placed in a reversed direction like in situs inversus) as well as which cells should migrate to the front (ventrally) versus the back (dorsally).\n\nOn top of that, many signals are derived from what's been mentioned (such as protein gradients, where the proteins in the proximal end of your ulna or radius are sending the most signal to the nearest cells at the more distal end of the bone or the most distal part of the humerus). That said, skin signals are pretty negligible for most bone cells since there's layers and layers of various cell types beneath. For the signal to reach, it would have to go through fibroblasts, skin stem cells, fat cells, muscle cells, immune cells, and many others first (where by then, the proteins are probably already broken down). There's some major exceptions to this (like how growth hormone from your pituitary affects organs all over the place as far as growth ) but then we have to decide if we're talking about paracrine signals (where cells influence cells in their near facility ) or endocrine signals (where signals are far reaching to cells on complete other ends of the body or near them simultaneously via blood distribution) or autocrine (where the signals released influence themselves! This is a big issue in cancer). A lot of development of an organism regards paracrine signalling and a lot of endocrine regards homeostasis in a much more developed organism, but there's of course exceptions. \n\nOn top of that, your ulna has an incredibly diverse population of cells (from osteoblasts and osteoclasts that are directly involved with bone remodeling to immune cell and blood precursors that are just stored inside). But this makes the conversation more complicated but all relates to cell cell interaction dictating them where to go. The fundamental aspect I'm getting at here is that these directions and influences occur at the cellular level and not at the larger bone level (the hip bone doesn't influence the leg bone, but rather the microscopic cell colonies on the edge of each influence each other). \n\nYour final question, the answer is basically yes. During development, everything stems from the first fusion of the egg and sperm, leading to the first cell. When it divides several times over, certain cells take precedence on dictating development in certain areas. Now, I'm only a med student, but we've been told that how those signals originate are somewhat murky and probably have to do with epigenetic changes that affect the cells protein expression early on.\n\nI hope that answers part of your questions  ", "gilded": 0, "score": 9, "created": 1432049612.0},{"body": "*slow clap*\n\nThat was awesome.

I'll have to go on a search because I remembered reading about it some point. Basically, you have two major types of stem cells (pluripotent and totipotent). The former have a very defined end-game (like skin stem cells are destined to become skin cells) while you have many more pluripotent stem cells in babies and fetuses (since they need to make a lot of cell types, including nerves that don't have a specific stem cell population). I'll have to get back to you on this, but some research is designed to take pluripotent stem cells and revert them to totipotent stem cells so they can then induce those stem cells to form anything. Which is exciting because then they could make, let's say, an organ based off your own skin stem cells (which are easily obtainable) and you would be hard-pressed to reject the organ when transplanted since it's your own DNA! That said [the transformation to totipotency is not fully understood and highly complex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_potency)\n\nI've never heard of this equation that Turing worked on. There's a lot of mythos surrounding Turing that I won't even touch, but I can't imagine how an equation would do justice to the protein signals that a cell gets to differentiate. It would have to account for every environmental change (if, say, there was a laceration that cut some of your muscle fibers and your satellite cells replenished them, they get signals from proteins in other cells, cell cell interactions, and cell lysis, not to mention the inflammatory response that would occur due to the injury). You'd have to defer this question to someone who's heard about Turing's equation.\n\nAutocrine signals. Oh boy, that's a hot topic in cancer. There's a myriad ways that its involved and many are [elaborated in this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocrine_signalling#Autocrine_Signaling_and_Cancer). Basically, autocrine signals are a way for a cell to induce itself to do something. There needs to be proliferation without any regulation to be a successful cancer. One way is for cancer cells to produce protein signals that bind its own receptors that protect it from destruction via the immune system as well as stimulate it to keep dividing. Many cells in the body proliferate, undergoing mitosis and cytokinesis, under cell cycle regulation (where extracellular signals can prompt proteins to be made the pushes the cell through the cell cycle). A cell can also produce its own signals (which is autocrine signaling) to make those proteins as well as produce its own signals that allow it to stop making regulatory proteins for the cell cycle. Unchecked cell cycle progression is a cancerous malady as well. \n\nAutocrine signaling in cancer is an enormous topic, but basically it's how cancers can get themselves to keep growing. A colleague of mine when I was doing cancer research talked about how cancer cells are kind of like parasites: they feed off the resources of the human body, they don't contribute anything, and they spend most of their time trying to survive against the body's immune system.\n\nIf you find cancer an interesting topic, there was a great PBS documentary called *Cancer: Emperor of All Maladies* that was produced by Ken Burns and is an amazing descriptor of the history and state of cancer research.", "gilded": 0, "score": 5, "created": 1432052638.0},{"body": "Thank you!

Flatulence would propel an astronaut forward very slowly, but if you used the gas as fuel for a combustion reaction the astronaut could get going much faster.\n\n**Longer answer:** Gas diffusing will carry a small amount of momentum backwards, so it must exert a force on the person, pushing them forward. Essentially, farts are rocket fuel. So let's figure out how much and how fast a person farts, to figure out how fast an astronaut can get moving in space.\n\nAnyway, [this paper abstract gives us a good idea of the average volume of gas produced by a person in a day.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1648028) They give it somewhere between 476 to 1491 mL, and [another paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9176210) gives the composition as a mixture of methane, nitrogen gas, hydrogen gas, and carbon dioxide. Let's say the average person produces 1 L of gas each day and we'll [guess that this gas mixture is about 0.5 grams/Liter, which is not entirely unreasonable given the known masses of the gasses in the mixture.](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+mole%2F22.4+liters+*+1+liter+*+%2810+grams%2Fmole%29) That comes out to 0.5 g of flatulence every day for a normal person. \n\nNow, let's guess that a fart leaves the butthole at about 1 m/s - again, not entirely unreasonable. So putting all this together, we can find that a day's worth of farts carries backwards momentum equal to\n\n    (1 m/s)(0.5 grams) = 0.0005 kg m/s\n\nso for momentum to be conserved, the astronaut will now be traveling [7.7x10^-6](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.5+g+m%2Fs++%2F+65+kg) m/s forward, [which is only about 1000x faster than hair grows.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28speed%29) If an astronaut in space farted every day, it would take 10,000 years for him to get up to a normal highway speed. \n\nThis is incredibly inefficient, but luckily, there's a better way. The gasses I listed above are combustible - specifically methane. Just spewing the gas backwards to get a push forward would be like putting your SUV in neutral and trying to propel it forward with a supersoaker that sprays gasoline backwards. Instead of *throwing* it backwards, you can *explode it* backwards to generate thrust, like a real rocket. After all, every 14 year old knows you can light a fart on fire, but if the astronaut did this the gas behind him would expand in all directions, not giving him much of a push. Instead, we need to harness this energy for a jetpack, so that all the exhaust goes backward.\n\nIf we take the methane to be about 1% of our flatulence, and the energy of combustion to be 890 kJ/mole, then we find that the [chemical potential energy of the gas is about 100 million times greater than the kinetic energy backwards.](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%280.01+Liters%29+*+%2822.4+moles%2FLiter%29++++%28890+kJ%2Fmole%29).

An efficient methane engine might have an [effective exhaust velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_rocket_propellant#Bipropellants) of ~3.6 km/s, at an oxidizer : fuel mass ratio of 2.6. So with 7 mg (10 mL) of CH4, this would give you a \u0394V of just (3.6 km/s * (2.6 + 1) * 7 mg / 65 kg) = [0.0014 m/s](https://www.google.com/search?q=(3.6+km%2Fs+*+(2.6+%2B+1%29+*+7+milligrams+%2F+65+kg%29).\n\n(There's an unrelated error in your [Wolfram link](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282*%280.01+Liters%29+*+%2822.4+moles%2FLiter%29++++%28890+kJ%2Fmole%29+%2F%2865+kg%29%29%5E%281%2F2%29): \"22.4 moles/liter\" should be \"1 mole / 22.4 liters\").\n\nIn one interpretation, this maneuver is extremely inefficient at converting chemical energy into kinetic energy. The propellant stream is very fast (v ~ 3 km/s), and the rocket is slow (the total \u0394V is very small), so, most of the KE (~ v^2 ) goes into the propellant instead. For energy efficiency, you'd need the velocities to be of similar magnitude, so you'd need a propellant mass comparable to the rocket mass. (see [\"propulsive efficiency\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket#Energy_efficiency))\n\nSince in this concept there's much more \"inert\" mass (nitrogen) than fuel, I think it'd be more effective to separate the combustion from the propulsion.

Alcohol interrupts the brain's ability to make ADH effectively, but when you start drinking, there are two factors that keep your bladder from instantly filling up at maximum speed:\n\n1) The ADH that was in your bloodstream before you started drinking takes a while before it's used up. If you were to instantly stop all ADH production in your brain, then every 20 minutes or so the kidneys would use up half of whatever is left in your bloodstream.\n\n2) You have less alcohol in your bloodstream when you first start drinking, so ADH production isn't all the way shut down yet. So between residual ADH still chilling in your bloodstream and ADH still being produced decently at the start of drinking, it takes your kidneys a fair while before the lack of ADH really hits them.\n\nBy the time you finally have to pee, usually it's been a couple hours and more than a couple drinks. By this point, the alcohol has dramatically interrupted ADH formation, and your kidneys have used up all the ADH in your bloodstream plus whatever meager output your brain can still manage. Without ADH, you kidneys can't reabsorb all the water they filter, and so they end up full-tilt urine production mode.\n\nIt is almost a little bit sad: all the while your brain can still sense that there's no need to be peeing so much, but it can't tell the kidneys no matter how much it tries.\n\nSo next time you drink, make sure to drink lots* of water.

Normally you lose a lot of water by breathing because the air in your lungs is at 37C and 100% humidity. Therefore it is holding a lot of water, which you lose when you breath that air out. That's the 'steam' you see when it is cold outside and the water from your breath condenses to form a small cloud. Imagine losing all that water every breath. It's a lot! But if you were doing the experiment in a tropical rainforest, the tub wouldn't make much difference and the guy not in the tub wouldn't lose much more water than the guy in the tub.\n\nAs mentioned above, increased blood pressure increases the amount you pee (your body dumps water to reduce blood volume; a lot of older blood pressure medications work by making people pee). But I don't think being submerged in a foot of water substantially increases blood pressure, and that increase in blood pressure wouldn't last long anyway because within seconds your body would open capillaries. In fact, the person in the tub would most likely have *lower* blood pressure just from the warm tub water causing surface blood vessel dilation.

In this case, there would be water loss through the skin, but still a humid environment.

Let's go through your two examples:\n\n\"Some of the plants evolved to have poisonous leaves so animals wouldn't eat them.\"  \n\"They evolved to have immunity against the poison.\"\n\nHere's how that actually works:\n\n* There is a valley with some plants, and some deer.\n* The plants are the primary food source for the deer.\n* Even so, the plants are abundant enough that some survive to flower and seed.\n* Each flower has slightly different genetic information from combining the flower's DNA with DNA from pollen from a nearby plant.  These slight genetic differences are the key to evolution.\n* These flowers become seeds and are scattered over the landscape.  \n* A bunch of random mutations happen in the plants over time (thicker stem, more water absorption, etc).\n* After several generations, one happens to get a random genetic mutation that makes them create a mildly poisonous chemical.\n* Deer start to avoid the slightly poisonous plants. Their leaves don't get eaten as much, so they do much better than all the non-toxic plants.\n* This makes it HARDER for the non-toxic plants to survive, because if 1/8 of the plants are toxic, the food supply's gone down by 1/8.  This means more of the non-toxic plants get eaten.\n* Because the toxic plants are not getting eaten at all, and the deer are eating the competition, the new slightly toxic plants do very well and their population continues growing.\n* After several more generations the toxic plants are doing SO well that they completely take over the non-toxic plants.  The completely non-toxic plants go extinct.\n* At this point, the desperate deer at this point are going after the slightly toxic plants.  Some of the deer die to it, but some don't.\n* The deer that can best tolerate eating the slightly toxic plants will have more food available, which means more babies, each with slightly varying DNA.\n* Random mutations occur along the generations that make the toxin more potent, and likewise, that make the deer more resistant to toxins.  Toxic plants might get pollinated by less toxic plants, but those babies get quickly eaten by the deer that are tolerating the slightly toxic plants, and only the toxic+toxic plants do well.\n* Because the deer that survive the poison are the ones that are reproducing, it becomes less of an advantage to have only weak toxin.\n* Likewise, if any of the baby deer have an even better way of tolerating the toxin, they'll have a more ample food source than the deer that can eat only slightly toxic plants.  Those toxin-tolerant deer are able to have more babies, and crowd out their competition as the plants grow more and more toxic.\n* Soon only deer that can tolerate eating toxic plants are left.  The rest are either dead from poison or have moved on to a different area.\n* Likewise, the non-toxic plants are all gone.  Only plants that are toxic are left.\n\nNow, if the plants didn't have the deer eating them all the time, the toxin wouldn't have been a particularly beneficial trait.  Maybe a few of them would have remained toxic, but since toxins take an organism energy to create and have no other benefit, it's unlikely that the toxin would stick around, since energy dedicated to making toxin is energy that's not making offspring.  Likewise, the deer very likely would not have become resistant to the toxins without trying to eat the toxic plants.  It may pop up randomly as a mutation, but it doesn't overly help a deer to survive, so the trait doesn't help them out-compete their fellow deer.\n\nEdit: for clarification", "gilded": 0, "score": 129, "created": 1432757054.0},{"body": "something like this happened with humans and milk, didn't it?", "gilded": 0, "score": 2, "created": 1432779594.0},{"body": "Yes, being able to drink milk into adulthood is a genetic mutation.

The classic example is r vs K where r is many young, fast growth rate, relative low parental care (rabbits) compared to K slow growth rate (I should have clarified this was to sexual maturity, the only age that matters), low litter size, high parental care (humans). There are obvious benefits that apply to both, there are obvious costs that apply to both.\n\nThere are costs to producing toxins, to having the large number of proteins needed to regulate and maintain these poison molecules in the plants.

It's also important to note that if that random mutation for slight toxicity never happened, both the deer and the plants likely would've carried on as before and both would have gotten along fine.

Or if the deer and plants had split off into two groups, one with toxin+immunity vs tough lips+spikes, they could both coexist in the same ecosystem since neither is competing with the other.  Eventually they stop breeding with each other and become different species.\n\nThere's also random/disaster selection, where a trait may not be beneficial at all or even detrimental, but some random event happens.  Like say half the deer are nocturnal, while half aren't.  A flash flood wipes out the valley during the day while the nocturnal ones are up in the hills sleeping, leaving only nocturnal deer.

I mean, when we think of immortality, we care about it because we care about continuity of our consciousness.  First of all, the neural net of a jellyfish is pretty limited, they don't really have a consciousness to begin with. Secondly, many of its memories are going to be encoded in parts of the body that die off and be lost when it reverts. \n\nGenetically, I don't think it's that important either.  I mean now we could theoretically take stem cells from a woman, put them into her own egg, implant them in her own uterus, and have her give birth to her own clone.   If she could do that without genetic errors she could genetically live forever, but our assumption of identity would say that she would be different than her children, even though they grew entirely from her. \n\nI think the difference is in the mind, and how our minds are interconnected with themselves allowing for fast communication internally through neurons, and slow communication through other methods.  We split off identity based on the speed of communication.  Two parts of your brain are part of the same individual because they communicate between eachother quickly through electrical impulses, despite the fact that two parts of your brain might manifest different desires or opinions.  Two people communicate slowly through speech and other senses. So we consider them different individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, you have someone like identical twins, which start out as the same cell, but divide and then develop separate nervous systems.  They are distinct individuals.  Or you have something like conjoined twins which even share some neural activity but maybe not in the brains, which we still mostly consider distinct.  And then you have something like people with chimaerism, which really messes with people, but you have two genetically different plans making up a single individual. \n\nI think what really constitutes immortality in a practical sense is the amount of experience that gets preserved. With the jellyfish, very little is preserved as it reverts to a polyp, and it's practically similar to reproducing.

This helps explain why 1000yo eukaryotes aren't prolific. Others have covered the biologically immortal species, so I won't talk about those...but also look up hydra, which don't age if they reproduce asexually, but once they start reproducing sexually they do! \n\nDarwin (1859) suggested that lifespan, like other species traits, should be affected by selective pressures. Three major evolutionary theories of why aging exists: 1) the theory of programmed death, 2), the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging, and 3) the mutation accumulation theory of aging. These theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and it is likely that the reality of aging that we observe in nature is an aggregate of two or more of these theories (Kirkwood and Austad 2000).\n\nThe programmed death theory states aging (and death) evolved to replace less fit individuals in a population with younger ones with more reproductive potential (Weismann 1891). There is, however, limited evidence of senescence directly linked to population mortality in the wild, and natural mortality is likely linked to extrinsic factors like predation, infection or environmental\nhazards (Kirkwood and Austad 2000). There are no known evolutionary mechanisms that could yield such a result, so though the theory was foundation for later hypotheses, it could likely be \"relegated to the dustbin of old ideas.\"\n\nThe power of natural selection declines with age once reproduction begins (Medawar 1952). Therefore, genes that results in a loss of fitness early in life, particularly before reproduction, are under strong negative natural selection and genes that have negative effects later in life face little selective pressure.  Genes can be both adaptive at early age and hazardous at older ages, or pleiotropic genes. Rose and \nCharlesworth (1980) demonstrated the presence of these genes in *D. melanogaster.*\n\nThe programmed death theory was elaborated as the \u201cDisposable Soma\u201d theory by Kirkwood, where individuals must balance the allocation of resources between germ and somatic cell lines. Aging occurs as a result of the accumulation of damage during life, and though maintenance and repair mechanisms have evolved, they cannot mitigate the damage, resulting in aging (Kirkwood and Austad 2000). This theory also suggests that the variation of lifespan for individuals within a species could be a result of variable maintenance systems. Under the accumulation theory of aging, the free-radical theory of aging, proposes that reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced in stress and metabolism lead to damage in both DNA and cellular material. The mitochondrial theory and telomere theory of aging also exist under the umbrella of the accumulation theory.\n\nedit: formatting", "gilded": 0, "score": 338, "created": 1432755805.0},{"body": "What do you think about a theory that delayed childbirth or never having a child increases a lifespan for a female as the body detects lack of pregnancy and turns on life-extension mechanisms to make sure that this individual will have a chance to reproduce later.

This is supported by the literature thus far. \n\nThere is some evidence for this in other animals, that delaying reproduction delays senescence.

Without going into extreme detail, when telomeres shorten substantially that they cannot be rolled and capped, this is seen as DNA damage and triggers a pathway called the p53 apoptosis pathway. This is a tumor suppression pathway and results most likely in the death of the cell. If enough telomeres in a tissue or system shorten and trigger this pathway, the death of the aggregate number of cells causes a decrease in the function of the system (we term this as system senescence).\n\nTelomerase can elongate telomeres. However, up-regulation of telomerase is implicated in about 85% of cancer cases. Telomerase is only active in human stem and germ cell lines, however other species appear to tolerate increased telomerase activity in other cell lines. Up-regulation of telomerase by itself can carry considerable risks, as it puts in jeopardy the telomere shortening branch of the p53 tumor suppression pathway. Should tumorgenesis occur, this p53 suppression pathway could be 'blocked' by the increased telomerase activity, when a normal, telomerase-deficient cell would proceed towards apoptosis.\n\nTelomerase deficient mice have shown recovery of organ activity and physiological 'health,' but the study was only a brief telomerase addition (Jaskelioff et al 2011).

Some speculation: If we could withstand high levels of telomerase, cell lines wouldn't stop dividing, or cells triggered to die. Therefore, systems would not degrade with age, for instance your acquired and innate immune systems would both be robust throughout life and there is some evidence that telomere shortening could be a component of cardiovascular disease. So there would be some benefit there. There would be a number of drawbacks though, cells would have a limited p53 pathway (triggers cell death), so cells that are malignant wouldn't have telomeres that are shortening and triggering this demise. Telomeres, in some sense, prevent malfunctioning cells from having too long a life that they negatively affect the system over lifespan. The number of times a cell can divide is called the Hayflick Limit and is governed in some way by telomere length. Telomere theory is just one of the many components that affect aging at a cellular and greater organ system level. There might be some longevity increase, but perhaps even more important a increase in system health. \n\nMany of us who study aging are more concerned with increasing 'health-span' or living healthier for longer. If we could extend lifespan from 90 to 120 years, but you had to live those 30 years like you were 95yo, that might not be the best experience. But, if we could extend your health span, say you now live until your 100, but with the physiology of a 40yo until your 90, that would be better IMO. I think there is a potential for a bit of both.\n\n(quoted myself)\n\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 7, "created": 1432780818.0},{"body": "The simple answer is that this is not a good thing for natural selection.

In particular, there's the famous immortal jellyfish, and some corals and sponges are thought to live thousands of years.   \n\nSecond, we don't really have a clue how long many species live.  I would not be the least bit surprised to find that some other marine invertebrates, for example, could live thousands of years.  We know many can live hundreds of years. For example, the [ming clam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_%28clam%29) was 500 years old, and [sea urchins](http://fishbull.noaa.gov/1014/19ebertf.pdf) can exceed 100 - 200 years old.

I rather suspect there are plenty of species out there that could live indefinitely.\n\nThis brings us back around to the question of \"why doesn't everything just live forever\".  The answer is that most things get killed by something or other.  If you look at species known to have long lifespans, they are all usually pretty likely to live to old age in the first place, provided they make it to adulthood.  Tortoises and clams have hard shells, animals in deep or cold waters have few predators, whales are _huge_, big lobsters are too big to be eaten by most fish, etc.  Adaptations allowing older age actually benefit these creatures, because they are likely to live long enough to get to use those adaptations in the first place.  Contrast this with mice and insects and little fish, and things like that.  These animals have a pretty much 100% chance of getting eaten by something or dying for some other reason before they make it to a few years old.  There's no selection pressure for adaptations allowing them to live longer, because none would ever live long enough to use those adaptations.

We were discussing death from both an ecological and cellular integrity/metabolic activity/functional replicator perspective, and trying to answer two questions - what is death, and why are organisms mortal?\n\nTo a biologist, the definition of death is contextual; a neuroscientist, an MD PhD studying cancer, a microbiologist studying the molecular mechanisms of antibiotics, and a herpes virologist will have very different definitions of death, each suitable for their needs.  None of them will be able to tell you with 100% certainty at exactly what point a cell or an organism has died, nor exactly what irrevocable step equates to death, although they may have some metric by which they measure life and death.\n\nYour question, however, is \"why isn't there an animal that could live for thousands of years.\"  As people have pointed out, some animals can live indefinitely, and certainly some other organisms have indefinite lifetimes.  Consider any single-celled organism that reproduces by dividing \u2013 every daughter cell is, in some very real sense, several billion years old.  If you were to look at the organic chemicals within each cell, though, you'd find that they are in another sense much, much younger \u2013 no molecule in a living cell is anywhere near that old.  This apparent paradox occurs because material is not sorted between daughter cells with perfect symmetry, so when a cell divides, one of its daughter cells will be built from older material than its sister cell.  As cells continue to divide, some subset of the population is unlucky and inherits the oldest material around.  These cells are more likely to die than their \u201cyounger\u201d sisters, simply because their old material is more likely to fail them.  This enrichment for younger cells tells us that aging is a universal problem confronted by all creatures.  In multicellular organisms (including animals), of course old material also accumulates.  While regeneration is possible, it's important to realize that it comes at some cost, the cost of constantly fighting entropy.  So, the simplest answer to your question is biophysical: \"because of entropy.\"  \n\nHowever, there is also an evolutionary answer to your question, which is simply \u201cimmortality doesn\u2019t increase fitness.\u201d  Evolution produces functional solutions to problems by taking a stochastic walk over fitness landscapes; it flows to solutions like water flows over a surface, generally following the topological path of least resistance, occasionally changing course due to random events.  Immortality is not a feature of organisms because it doesn't increase their fitness - planned obsolescence is a \u201cbetter strategy.\u201d  There are many arguments for why this might be true.  It might be simply that it's hard to fight entropy, and so virtually all life must pass through a grand renewal in order for its lineage to be successful.  For most of us here on Earth (bacteria to humans), this means that at some point, we must die.  It also means that to survive, we all must pass through the same beautiful bottleneck - our lineage must be entrusted into a single moment in time; a cell, dividing into two daughter cells.  The act of procreation is not merely one of birth, but also one of rebirth and renewal, at the genetic, biochemical, cellular, and organismal level.\n\nUltimately, everything an organism does comes at some cost.  This means every \"adaptation\" is a trade-off.  Regeneration of old material is clearly something that life is capable of achieving, but the problem of aging is apparently solved better by death and rebirth than by repair.  It turns out that for virtually all life, it\u2019s better to produce more copies and then get out of the way than to try to hold on forever.\n\n(Edited for clarity)", "gilded": 0, "score": 5, "created": 1432771955.0},{"body": "Definitely feasible, not useful.\n\nThe best way to survive in harsh environments is the shotgun method: have as many progeny as you can, and hope that some of them have the right genes to survive.\n\nHaving a very long lifespan means that you do not change much over time, which means that a virus that can kill one of you, will likely kill all of you.", "gilded": 0, "score": 4, "created": 1432759589.0},{"body": "Wood frogs only have a lifespan of up to 3 years, but they are the only species that can shut down their entire body and quite literally stop time for them.

Things get a while lot murkier when we start asking about the time periods in which that source got cooked in the oil generation kitchen.  Its certainly happening as we speak in a variety of source rocks around the world but it would be incredibly hard to quantify.\n\nOne noteworthy one in north america is the Bakken -- it's actually (generally speaking) an undercooked fairly prolific source upper and lower black shale with a silt or sand between that some of our oil has migrated into.  If we left it alone it would likely continue to generate.  It's Devonian, so older than most reservoirs but also a less thermally mature source rock than most, which speaks to the difficulty of figuring out when oil will be generated from a particular source. \n\n**EDIT2:**  To flesh this out a little further now that I'm in front of a keyboard:\n\nThe first thing you need to produce oil is organic matter.  When it's part of a sedimentary rock, we refer to this organic matter as Kerogen.\n\nThere are [four types of Kerogen](https://spec2000.net/text106fp/toc11.jpg), in descending order for potential oil productivity. \n\n* Type I / Sapropelic / Alginite.  Marine &amp; Most productive\n\n* Type II / Exinite / Amorphous Kerogen. Mostly Marine &amp; second most productive \n\n* Type III / Vitrinic / Humic.  Tough sledding for oil production, only under extreme circumstances.  Great for coal and methane production\n\n* Type IV / Inertinite.  As the name might suggest, useless decomposed organic matter.\n\nSo the first step to producing a quality source rock is to get Type I and Type II kerogens buried in the sea floor in an anoxic environment (if there's oxygen available, you'll end up with decomposed Type IV kerogen, which isn't going to help even if we have algae dying and raining down in quantity).\n\nNext step, once we have our buried kerogen, is to cook it.  [This occurs in three phases (two of which we're looking for](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SppkVCspMu8/UnzxgoX-SrI/AAAAAAAAAsk/y9DHj9-DqTo/s1600/tn30_f01.jpg):\n\n* Diagenesis:  Microbes are going to have at our kerogens below about 60 degrees C, and will largely produce some get some biogenic gas from our kerogens.\n\n* Catagenesis: From about 60 degrees to 150C, increasing temperature will result in thermal cracking, transforming our kerogens into the oil we're looking for, in addition to some gas... increasing wet gas fractions as we get to the upper end of that range.\n\n* Metagensis: If we turn the temperature up too hot (&gt; ~ 150C), we're going to keep cracking our kerogen and coal into dry gas / methane and carbon residue.\n\nThat's the ELI5 on the process, if you're interested in the chemistry, the link in my original post above goes through it in greater detail.\n\nSo to accurately know the rate at which the earth is producing petroleum, you would need to know what the volume and type of kerogen rich source rocks worldwide that are currently going through these various phases as well as the volume of kerogen rich source rocks currently being deposited and take a stab at their geologic future.\n, as well the volume of kerogen rich source rocks that will one day end up in catagenesis.\n\nIn terms of *actually producing* that oil, we would need to add on a lengthy discussion reservoirs, porosity and permeability.\n\ntl;dr I wouldn't be comfortable even taking a stab at your question OP, but I hope that the above helps to explain why it would be so difficult to make that calculation...", "gilded": 1, "score": 1696, "created": 1431292254.0},{"body": "&gt;due to climactic reasons (largely algae) \n\nIf it got warmer, then more algae would grow, generating more fossil fuels then?", "gilded": 0, "score": 154, "created": 1431292873.0},{"body": "We need them deposited in an anoxic marine environment, preferably with a decent reservoir deposited overtop, and then we need them buried in the kitchen for the just right amount of time.

I've seen it noted as well, though I sadly can't recall the reference, that the H/C ratios in the Permian source material were more consistent with dry gas than with anything wet, but that the prospect of migration from  Warburton Basin source rock into the Cooper Basin's Giddealpa Group was unlikely.\n\nTo your knowledge, is the Cooper Basin just an anomalous case study in that regard?

You should have take into account that a leaf is still an organic tissue and that the photosynthesis needs to be driven by the chloroplasts, the major component of a leaf, which isn't absorbing light soley.

Long story short, on the visible spectrum of light, green colors are categorized by the wavelenghts from 500 - 560nm. Red from 600 - 670nm. Without going into further details. Those are the most reactive / efficient wavelenght of photosynthesis known.

More often than not, it's 'flavor.' That is, social and pragmatic nuances, or how prosodic and phonological factors affect an utterance. Translated poetry, to give an obvious example, will either lose rhythmic feeling and rhyme, or be forced to fit a rhythm and rhyme at the expense of more direct or idiomatic translation. \n\n\n(2) You would have to define complexity, before you could answer this. Every time I've seen a question like this, what the OP defines as complexity is just one way of communicating information, and the supposedly more complex language is less complex in other ways. For instance, communicating the syntactic role of a noun phrase can be achieved either through case marking, or through fixed word order. Which of these is more complex? Well, one's got structural requirements at the phrase level, another has morphological requirements at the word level. Or here's another example: think about Mandarin and English. Mandarin has fewer vowels than English. Is it therefore less complex? What about the fact that it has lexical tone that English lacks? \n\n\n&gt;Do different languages have varying degrees of 'effectiveness' in communicating? \n\nNo. In general, you'll find that the people who argue they do (1) have not ever seriously studied linguistics, (2) tend not to know how global languages became global languages -- through colonization in the last few centuries, and (3) tend to want to support overly simplistic narratives that are based on ethnoracial or class prejudice.  They're also often really poorly thought-out. For instance, I've seen a lot of arguments in this thread that English is somehow superior for math and science, claiming that speakers of other languages have to switch to English, or borrow words from English to do math or science -- while conveniently forgetting that English borrowed most of those words from Latin and Greek. And that the speakers of other languages they're holding as examples were educated in English in former English colonies, so they were taught math and science terminology in English rather than their home languages.\n\n\n\nI would link to peer reviewed papers, but this is so fundamental to the study of linguistics that I'm not even sure where to start, honestly.

I think this idea stems from (1) the notion of universal grammar, and (2) a backlash to the racist intellectualism of the 19th and 20th centuries. **Modern research in psycholinguistics is beginning to show that languages *are* in fact different with regard to how easily they can be learned and how easily they can convey certain concepts.**\n\nThe classic example is Piraha, a language which does not have numbers. One classic study [\\(Frank et al. 2008\\)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027708001042) argues that the Piraha can in fact compare large cardinalities, but are unable to remember or communicate precisely about them. I don't think anyone could argue that Piraha would be just as suitable a language for mathematics as Italian.\n\nIn a similar vein [Bleses et al. \\(2008\\)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18588717) show that not all languages are equally easy to learn, due mostly to their phonotactic structures; languages with lots of vowels strung together, like Danish, are harder for children to learn.\n\nWhen we view language not as an innate and ideal evolved system (as Chomsky does), but instead as an evolving system itself, we actually *expect* to find differences in languages (see [Christiansen and Chater 2008](http://www.psych.cornell.edu/sec/pubPeople/mhc27/cc-BBS-2008.pdf) for an excellent introduction to this idea). Just as different organisms are better suited to different environments, different languages are better suited to different cultures. In Japan, honor and respect are very important values, and thus we find [a complex linguistic system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_honorifics) used to convey different degrees of respect. It would seem silly to say that this language is just as well suited to show deference as English.\n\nAs evolving systems, languages are constantly being tweaked to be easier to learn and communicate with. Dialects that meet these desiderata will persist, while those that don't will be mis-learned and mis-used, mutating into a more effective form. The only reason that, in general, languages are so similar in their communicative power is that the communicative needs of human societies are surprisingly similar, especially when you look to aspects of language deeper than vocabulary.

I think that you've misunderstood us rather severely; essentially, we're discussing \"effectiveness\" in terms of the needs of the language's users, but you're discussing \"effectiveness\" in terms of how well a language encodes particular concepts, like numbers or deference. These are two very different things.\n\nIf the question was \"are there any languages that are more or less effective for discussing math or theoretical physics,\" then our answers would probably be different. (We might disagree about deference - there are many methods to express deference, and we do it in English quite a bit, and I don't think that we can assume Japanese is \"better\"; it's just different.)\n\nHowever, we would still point out that discussing \"languages\" are abstractions, and in this case the abstraction can get in the way -- if it's difficult to discuss theoretical physics in !Kung it's because there are no theoretical physicists who speak !Kung with knowledge of the relevant concepts who can borrow or create the relevant vocabulary.

The Foreign Service Institute has created a [tier system of languages](http://www.effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty) based on average class hours required for a native English speaker to learn them.\n\nGenerally, Romance and Germanic languages are the easiest for English speakers (not surprising, since English is a Germanic language with a quarter of its vocabulary from French and another quarter from Latin), then certain lingua francas (Indonesian and Swahili), then other Indo-European languages, then most other languages, then Arabic and East Asian languages.\n\nOther languages have different 'tier' lists, mostly based on genetic relation (linguistic families) and shared vocabulary. For instance, for Mandarin speakers, other Chinese languages are the easiest, probably followed by Japanese (due to shared vocabulary and characters), then Korean and Vietnamese. In particular, French is considered quite difficult for Chinese speakers, although it is one of the easiest for English speakers.\n\nNote, however, that it also depends on which combination of the four main skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing) one is learning, and varies wildly from person to person, with the most important factor of course being motivation.", "gilded": 0, "score": 63, "created": 1430903465.0},{"body": "&gt; Is it easier for some people to learn certain languages than others?\n\nAbsolutely! Some languages are closely related to each other, others are only distantly related, and this is more or less a continuous scale. It's far easier to learn languages that are similar to your first language, since there are fewer new concepts.\n\nFor example, French is generally considered a comparatively easy language for a native English speaker. Of course there is a certain amount of common vocabulary due to the Latin heritage and so on, but it is also structured relatively similarly, in global terms. There are some new concepts, like extra ways to conjugate verbs and almost everything having gender, but the grammar broadly functions similarly.\n\nChinese is much harder for an English speaker to learn, and one major reason is the use of [tone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_%28linguistics%29#Mechanics). In English, tone is used to convey emotion or context, indicating sarcasm, humour, questions, and so on. In French, tone is used in a broadly similar way, but in Chinese, it serves as the sole way to distinguish different words (often with entirely different meanings).\n\nThere can also be almost physical difficulties in learning the phonemes required for another language, since no language makes use of all the sounds that a human can produce. Famously, several Southern African languages have [dozens of consonants produced by clicking the tongue in different ways](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_consonant) (none of which exist in English), but there are plenty of more ordinary sounds that are not present in all languages. For example, the Arabic letters \"\u0647\" and \"\u062d\" have distinct pronunciations, but both sounds like an \"h\" to most English speakers.\n\nIt's tempting to look at the subjectively difficult bits of other languages and think that English is comparatively simple, but there are equal complications for people trying to learn English as a second language. For example, Russian has no articles, causing native speakers of Russian to struggle with where to place \"a\" and \"the\" in English, and Japanese people learning English can have difficulty with \"l\" and \"r\" sounds, which are not distinguished in Japanese.\n\nI've probably picked too many examples, but my point is that there there can be aspects \n\n**TL;DR: It all depends on how different the student's native language is from the language they wish to learn, and all human languages have both similarities and differences.**", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1430927035.0},{"body": "&gt; Of course there is a certain amount of common vocabulary due to the Latin heritage and so on\n\nJust to nitpick, English does not have a Latin heritage.

It's worth realizing that when we measure the information density of a language, we're necessarily measuring how that language is used *by its speakers*. That means that the culture of the speakers is going to play a role. In Japanese, for instance, the *culture* demands politeness in the form of honorifics, but the *language* does not require them in and of itself. If Japanese culture changed so that the politeness wasn't required, the language would drop the general use of honorifics too. So although you may find languages that have low information transfer rates, that doesn't necessarily mean the language is inefficient. It may just be that the culture which uses that language requires the language to be somewhat inefficient.\n\nThere are also trade-offs between conciseness and redundancy.

One is heat, and the other is pressure, and the final one is hole stability.\n\nHeat from geothermal sources, or just generated from the drill string, causes damage to the drill string components. Some companies have giant radiators that are installed on the surface to cool drilling fluid down before being pumped back down hole, but in the end the cumulative heat reduces the amount of time that is able to be spent downhole and drilling to less than 200 hours per trip.\n\nPressure is another problem. As you get deeper, the pressure exerted on the formation from drilling fluid gets higher and higher. At the same time, the horsepower required to pump the drilling fluid back up to the surface becomes much greater. You would need enormously powerful pumps capable of generating as much as 10,000 psi.\n\nFinally you have hole stability. This is the ability of the hole to not collapse in on itself, potentially trapping the drill string and getting it stuck. To mitigate this problem casing is run through various sections of the hole. The problem is that every time you run casing, you have to then drill with a smaller drill bit and BHA/drill string. Eventually you can't run anything smaller and are at the limit of what can be reasonably drilled.\n\nThe potential to drill deeper than 40,000 feet is there, but absent funding for such a project I find it hard to believe that anyone would undertake such an endeavor. It can be done deeper than 40,000 ft, but not by much.\n\nEDIT: RIP my inbox.

Therefore, boreholes are usually filled with drilling fluid (aka mud) while being drilled, to balance out the hydrostatic pressure from the saltwater.  However, if the drilling mud is too dense, it can fracture the formation and cause the hole to collapse.\n\nOnce a segment of drilling is done, metal casing is lowered and cemented in place.

Freshwater aquifers near the surface could be contaminated by substances found more deeply underground, such as saltwater, oil, gas, or hydrogen sulfide.     Therefore, when drilling an oil well, first, the groundwater is drilled through.  Then, a casing is put into place to isolate the layer.  Then, the casing integrity is tested.

This specific example is actually an extremely common topic in introductory level chemistry classes to demonstrate in a numberless hand-wavy way the importance of an activation energy (which depends generally mostly on kinetics and not thermodynamics) in a reaction. Graphite is the thermodynamically preferred form of elemental carbon, but in order to get the reaction to occur at appreciable rates, very high temperatures are required. Given infinite time yes, all diamonds will eventually turn to graphite in the absence of any other intervention. Keep the temperature reasonably low though and a diamond will stay a diamond longer than anybody will be alive to measure its change, so it's *effectively* inert under normal conditions.\n\nAnyways, kinetic effects vs thermodynamic effects have to be considered in every chemical reaction. There are plenty of examples where they compete. Many reactions can occur in different ways to give different products: the thermodynamic product is the most stable product, and the kinetic product is the one that is easiest to form (the one with the most stable transition state). These products are often not the same, and it's a big reason why we have to choose specific reaction conditions (like solvent, temperature, and concentration) to get desired products.\n\n&gt;And what is the reason that the diamond would eventually reach a temperature lower than background temperature of space?

The diamond may have a different absorption spectrum but it is not immune to this radiation, and will be heated by it.

I could make some assumptions: The bond dissociation energy in diamond is 347 kj/mol, so if we might assume that is the activation energy in the Arrhenius rate equation, we just need a pre-exponential factor.\n\n[This PDF](http://www.htracyhall.org/papers/19610151.pdf)  says the conversion rate of graphite into diamond becomes appreciable around 1200 \u00b0C (~1500 K).

In order for 0.2 grams (0.017 mols ~ 10^-2 mols) of carbon to completely undergo conversion to graphite at 3 K, it would take 10^6031 seconds, which is 10^6024 years.
