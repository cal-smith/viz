The whole \"don't fight, and maybe the court will be nicer\" theory. However, \"genius\" attorney Judy Clark stepped in, and later convinced Tsarnaev to plea \"Not Guilty\", using the defense tactic that he was brainwashed by his older brother, thinking that strategy would hopefully avoid Death Row. \n\nKeep in mind, this wasn't simply a tactic aimed at convincing the jury of his innocence during the trial phase, as everyone pretty much knew Tsarnaev would be found guilty. However, and more importantly, the \"brainwashing defense\" was a planned strategy used specifically for the SENTENCING phase, meant to sway the jury away from recommending the death sentence.   \n\nTsarnaev and his lawyers tried to avoid the death penalty through every phase of this trial, beginning to end, as evident. That is certainly not a strategy used by anyone trying to die as a \"martyr\".\n\nI don't mean to play devil's advocate here, but I really think people are investing way too much speculation into this kid, and it has the eerily familiar scent of \"mob justice mentality\".\n\nIt seems rather apparent that he was just a young, dumb, gullible, brainwashed kid with alot of angst, and he was led (either by himself, or his brother) into making a terribly stupid decision that cost people their lives, now including his own. The kid probably already regrets his stupid choices, and I wouldn't be surprised if he appeals to try and save his life.\n\nOn one hand we have a mob screaming *\"bloody murder!!! kill this piece of shit!\"*, and on the other hand another mob screaming *\"bloody murder!!! don't kill this piece of shit, it will make him a martyr!\"*...\n\nI think both mobs need to step back a little, get out of \"witchhunt mode\", and use a bit of rationality as opposed to over-speculating this kid based purely on emotions.\n\nQuite frankly, I can't bring myself to agree with either group. I don't believe in the death penalty, nor do I believe that this kid is the stereotypical \"martyr-for-hire\". I think he was just a dumb and disillusioned kid that was sucked into extremist views towards violence.\n\nI honestly think there's a middle ground to this, and I think the proof of this can be acknowledged by the fact that Tsarnaev and his lawyers tried to avoid the death penalty altogether.\n\n_______\n\nSidenote: As for the multitude of \"anti-death pentalty\" people arguing against the death penalty in this case, I'd like to say this: \n\nSimply by using \"martyrdom\" as an excuse to argue against the death penalty is an irresponsible way of arguing the issue. As someone that is anti-death penalty myself, shame on us for using this excuse as leverage. Sentencing should NOT be based upon what a defendant \"believes\", or their ideologies.\n\nFuck whatever crazy \"beliefs\" a defendant has, we should be strictly focused on the appropriate and responsible form of justice, not \"beliefs\" or \"ideologies\". If one cared about the death penalty issue so much, they would consider the rules of plain justice vs. fanatical ideology, as opposed to using Tsarnaev's \"martyrdom\" as a convenient leverage point. \n\nFurthermore, I don't see how sitting in a completely isolated cell for 23 hours a day, seven days a week, for 60+ years, is any better than getting executed, considering the issue of \"cruel an unusual punishment\". \n\nLong-term SUPERMAX Mental Torture VERSUS Short-term Mental Torture + Death?

Given his age, he would spend probably 50-65 years in that room. I would argue that is far more cruel and unusual than the death penalty.

They are Gothardites. Gothardism is a ultra-right wing fundamentalist Christian sect/cult. The cult is based on antiquated/biblical concepts of modesty, character building, purity, holiness, quiverfull families, cloistered homeschooling,  and so on. \n\nGothardism is a cult that teaches any sexual urges, thoughts, or actions (including but not limited to masturbation) are evil. Not wrong or bad- evil. You are disappointing god, sinning by feeling sexual things. \n\nThese families also tend to withhold physical and verbal affection. Physical because it could be inappropriate. Verbal because children don't need self esteem, just a strong belief in god. \n\nThere is very little to no sex education taught in this cult. It is possible to be in your late teens before you finally figure out what sex is. I knew one kid who figured it out when he saw cattle mating. Put two and two together. Combine this with any sort of reference to non-marriage sex being evil and you are left with severely confused children attempting to grapple with hormones, burgeoning sex drives, limited access to the outside world, and the threat of an angry god hanging over their heads. \n\nI despise what Josh did. I hate it. You know what, though? I almost hate Jim Bob and Michelle more. They knew better. They had no excuse. \n\nPersonally, I believe Michelle to be the driving force behind covering for Josh. This is a cult that views women as disposable. That treats women as breeding machines who are secretly attempting to lead all men astray. I believe Michelle saw Josh as more important than the girls, thus why he was only sent away and the girls forgotten. \n\nThere is so much more that I would love to say about this. There have been several good articles written up about this situation, including from former fundie homeschoolers like myself. \n\nI would ask, though, as a former Gothardite fundie homeschooled woman, please don't stop at sharpening your pitchforks for Josh. I believe that Jim Bob and Michelle bear equal, if not more, responsibility in this matter. They knew better, folks. I'm not excusing Josh. He is a bigot and a molester and he is paying the price for that now. His parents need to be held accountable as well, though.
