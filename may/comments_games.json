I won't name names but they are defunct now. The reason why is as follows...\n\nRemember that the mobile landscape in 2007 was very different to today. Android was but a glimmer in Google's eye and the iPhone was still mostly rumour and conjecture at this point. Back then, everyone had Nokias (At least in the UK, where we were based), some had windows mobile and then there were a smattering of other platforms (like \"Brew\" or UIQ, which is basically Symbian) and all sorts. \n\nMobile \"games\" were often cheap ripoffs of bigger titles, as if the 80's never really left us. They all had stupid names, like \"Super Taxi Driver 2000!\" (which looked remarkably like Crazy Taxi) and \"Mega Stealth Deluxe\" (Which looked a bit like Metal Gear Solid). Nearly always they were made by little 2-3 men teams, bedroom programmers from all over the place - spain, russia, etc.\n\nThe company I worked for was a publisher and made quite a bit of money from publishing these games. They'd offer the little bedroom duo's a great deal, publish their games in markets worldwide (They had big a presence in the UK, Spain, Korea, Finland, you name it) and had great ties to the carriers, so would often get good exposure on their mobile sites. Seemed like a great opportunity to make mucho money.\n\nAnd they did, sort of. At least, they sort of did and didn't. See if they sold say 50 copies of a title in Korea, digitally via a carrier portal, how exactly would the little bedroom team know? You'd have to take the publishers word on it. So if the publisher says they sold only 10 or 5, or even none at all, you couldn't really do much about it. \n\nSo basically, they screwed over these little indie developers left and right. A lot of them just accepted it was the nature of the business. I guess some were oblivious. Either way, this publisher got more and more brazen. They didn't just outright lie about sales, they sometimes just didn't pay developers at all. Who cares about them, right?\n\nOne day, a little spanish dev team didn't get paid. It was business as usual, nobody had heard of them and nobody cared about them, fuck them, what are they going to do?\n\nExcept it turns out this little spanish team wasn't a little team at all. In fact, it was none other than Namco operating under a different brand for their mobile titles. Oops.\n\nNamco weren't happy. Like, really not happy. In a matter of weeks, most of the publisher and their entire in-house studio was laid off. I ended up looking after their entire source assets, a not-even-student-graduate who had no idea what he was doing. The company quickly went under and all of the assets got bought out by another company, which was seemingly run by the same people. Some years later, that company went under as well, I think. No doubt resurrecting as something else.\n\nWhen I read this story, I genuinely suspected that this might be the same people, doing the same shady deals.

Ugh man, and the tension of seeing all these alien flight signatures zipping around, but you're too underequipped to engage all of them, and can't tell what kind of mission they're on, so you let some of them through and pick your fights...and then they land right on your base.

You couldn't pick any random car on the road and follow it to where it was going. The game could just display traffic as a somewhat more abstract representation of overall speed, congestion, etc. based on the math of road capacity, number of citizens, etc. The Rush Hour expansion added quite a bit to this, including the ability to see individual routes, but the representation was still somewhat abstracted. If you only have to calculate usage vs. capacity and display a suitable animation, you can get away with a lot more than if you *actually* have to have *each car* navigate through merges, lane changes, avoiding other cars, and so on to reach its destination. Having this type of system and the necessary tradeoffs between taking AI shortcuts like predetermined merge points (which cause backups when a car stops because it HAS to merge NOW into a solid line of cars) and giving every car on the map a full Google self-driving car type of AI is, I think, what causes C:S traffic to be a little more difficult to work around than SC4 was.", "gilded": 0, "score": 50, "created": 1432048578.0},{"body": "I agree.

This provides the trucks with a quick exit to the main highway and helps keep traffic moving. The off ramps you see on either side of the center highway are to reduce the amount of traffic piling up as more cars get on the highway. The off ramps you see leading off in different directions are to allow trucks that have to visit multiple industrial areas (as in the case of forest industry) to move to their destination without clogging up the main highway. Finally you may or may not be able to see it, but leading directly from the main highway and connected directly to the one way roads are highways that split the traffic heading into the industrial areas into groups that need to go specifically to one area, thus reducing the amount of traffic on each of these roads. \nThis isn't a perfect system, however as it doesn't completely eliminate traffic and it does waste quite a lot of space, but I'm satisfied with it.
