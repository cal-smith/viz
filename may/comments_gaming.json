However, like most the learning curve is quite steep. Also its worth noting this tutorial is based around the 'blender internal' renderer, which is generally considered inferior to the new cycles renderer, however most of the information is still relevant. \n\nAndrew Price (the guy in the video) has many great tutorials that not only cover how to use blender, but also bits of theory on how to create great scenes.", "gilded": 0, "score": 7, "created": 1431528544.0},{"body": "In this video we see okay modelling, Great lighting, really easy animation, a good locked down camera track.\n\nCamera tracking is easy if the shot \"plays into it\" and this shot does exactly that-- the pattern on the sidewalk provides a great \"read\" to extrapolate the movement of the camera.  PFTrack or SynthEyes are software packages that can do this.\n\nThe models are cool, and this stuff is easy content.  Could be made in Blender, Maya, 3Ds Max, etc.  Now they have nice multi-mapped textures.  You'd need a bit of an education in that, and some love in ZBrush or Mudbox to make them feel real.\n\nNow the lighting is what \"brings this home\".  The light is just like the light on the kid.  I'm guessing that he used the chrome ball trick to create a light wrap.  Look for a tutorial!  I'm on a clumsy mobile or I would.  But if you photograph a shiny ball, it's reflection can become a HDRI panorama that shines light in on the subject- the very same light as the real life footage.  That's what makes it look \"so real\".  An essential step.  This can be set up with the right Photoshop plugins, or a spherical unwrap node in Nuke.  Then you've got to get that into your 3d suite when you render.\n\nSo!  if you're very interested, you can make this happen in a few months, if you're ready to dig into lots of tutorials, buy a nice camera, and learn at least three complicated pieces of software.

That being said, it can still take a lot of work. \n\nFor instance, when the kid is picking up the coins, the dad probably had to go in and rotoscope his child so the child would appear in front of the coins. This process basically involves just tracing the outline of his child frame by frame which can be tedious as fuck. He also most likely had to go in frame by frame and place the glowing point at the end of the childs wand. \n\nHe probably had to model the coins and bowser shell, which are pretty simple objects so that probably didn't take him too long, then he had to texture them correctly which again probably didn't take him too long since he's an experienced CGI artist. That right there would have taken me awhile just to get the textures right. \n\nHe had to motion track the footage in a 3D motion tracking package. There are a lot of good ones out there now a days that can give you pretty damn near perfect tracks without even having to print out and place tracker markers in the shot. By tracker markers I mean [these](http://www.filmmakin.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/m/o/motiontrackingmarker_1.png). If you go back and look at the shot you'll see a lot of detail/contrast in the brick work as well as the leaves laying on the pavement, this was probably enough information for the tracker to be able to lock down and get a good track and 3D solve on the shot.\n\nThen he had to go in and line up his 3D ground plane so it matched the perspective of the sidewalk so that when he animates everything it will appear in perspective with his live action footage. If you want to go even further with this you can make sure your 3D camera has matching settings to the real world camera you used, he probably didn't do that for this cause it looks like it was shot on a mobile phone. \n\nThen he had to go in and animate everything which probably wasn't too much trouble, the coins are easy they just rotate. The shells are a little tricker because they travel down the sidewalk but then have to be knocked away by the childs magic wand which means you have to make the physics look convincing. Hand animating physics in 3D or 2D animation packages can be a pain if you don't understand the principles of animation (I don't). So he probably had to use a physics engine (which most 3D packages have) to simulate the effect of the shell being hit. Now what I would have done to achieve that is I would have hidden a 3D cube in the scene thats invisible to the render camera right at the point where the child hits it with her wand so the shell will collide with the invisible object and fly off in a direction making it appear as if the child hit it with her magic wand. \n\nHe then has to add in lighting to the 3D scene that mimics the lighting in the live action shot so the shadows being cast travel in the same direction and dither/feather appropriately. Then after he animates everything he has to render it out and bring it into a compositing package like After Effects, blend the CGI to match the color space, grain, and lighting of the live action shot to make it look convincing. If he's a talented CGI artist, which it appears he is, he probably didn't have to do too much work in the compositing stage to get the CGI blended into the footage. \n\nThen he clicked the render button and drank a beer.

And a true daredevil never needs permission.\n\nThe day dawned with howling winds and bitter cold. The weather would have given most parachutists second thoughts about making a jump. But Kenneth had psyched himself up by watching a documentary on parachute daredevils, and Kenneth knew what he was doing.\n\nHe left his wife a note asking her to come and photograph his triumph. At 8:55 a.m. he leapt from a light plane and soared successfully to the top of the monument. He had conquered the Gateway Arch, with his wife watching from the ground!\n\nHe grabbed onto the aircraft warning light, to steady himself against the raging wind. The first part of the plan had gone perfectly. Of course it had, Kenneth knew what he was doing. Now came the harder part: getting down.\n\nThe arch is hollow, with a viewing area inside, just beneath Kenneth's feet. Perhaps he was looking for a trap-door into the arch, but there was no trap-door. A gust of wind caught his deflated parachute and threw him off balance. He began sliding down the north leg of the arch. About halfway down, he tried to deploy his backup parachute, but it failed.\n\nAnother gust caught his parachute and blew him off the arch. He fell the rest of the way, landing head-first in the terrazzo below. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital about one hour after performing his last jump.", "gilded": 0, "score": 4, "created": 1430870517.0},{"body": "should've held the shoulder buttons right before landing, gives you a softer landing without stumbling on the ground.", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1430862605.0},{"body": "Pretty sure they did.", "gilded": 0, "score": 5, "created": 1430870181.0},{"body": "Worth it!

This was not intentional, no one has been banned for using single player modifications, and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player PC mods. Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage, disrupt gameplay, or cause griefing. It also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized, they may be broken by technical updates, cause instability, or affect your game in other unforeseen ways.\n\n\n\nSo if you're online, not good. Otherwise do what ever you want. \n\nI've seen a few comments here pointing out that banning is happening to modders. A bit of research seems to bring this up straight away from an official source. If anyone has any evidence that this is not the case, speak up.\n\nAnd let's not perpetuate a myth that modding is problematic, especially for this game!\n\nSource: http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/52429/asked-answered-the-rockstar-editor-gta-online-updates\n\nEdit: thanks to all those that pointed out my ridiculous copypasting....I have absolutely no excuse to offer regarding this.", "gilded": 0, "score": 208, "created": 1431113100.0},{"body": "Something has gone terribly wrong with your copy/paste job", "gilded": 0, "score": 150, "created": 1431114248.0},{"body": "I thought I was having a stroke...", "gilded": 0, "score": 94, "created": 1431115011.0},{"body": "I mean I got half way through reading it and I mean I got half way through reading it and I felt like it was duplicated in some way.
