These upvotes though. they walk around Fucking nazis, always walking around after telling a mildly interesting story.

edit- wow, a bit late to the golden award ceremony; thanks stranger I hate Illinois Nazis Same here, except when they jump from bridges, now this is funny. Just watched this for the first time yesterday.  I feel so relevant now, almost like I'm on a mission from God. Sounds like you and the Lord, have an understanding. Don't you blaspheme in here!

No, it's a reference to Blues Brothers Only if you're on a mission from gawd. *gahd Illinoizis? Illinazis Not to be confused with the illuminazis. You wouldn't be able to stealthily kill them each if they always stood close to each other. You think they would have realized that by now.  Unless you're Adam Jensen.

Truly, only top-of-the-line prosthetic enhancements to a person's physical capabilities can give one the power to use two knives.  But who needs knives, when you have sword built into your arms? Corvo. He didn't ask for any of this...  well except for the arm blades, those he specifically requested I could suspend my disbelief for everything else in that game, but come on. *Two fucking knives*? I know it's science fiction, but it's possible to go too far. You can if you're quick enough. Headshot one and throw a knife on the second. Why not just shoot both of them? Or just grenade em.  So much for covert.   The grenade is silenced. [am I doing this right](http://i.imgur.com/y1efziW.png)
 You can do that too but you have to be quick and precise so the second one doesn't shout or shoot. I found the knife throw to be most effective.

SHOOT ME! C'MON SHOOT MY FACE! *bang* thank you. To be fair, there are a lot of games where prone walk around yes Don't even get me started on the games where prone *doesn't* walk around. They walk around specifically so you can silently kill both of them without alerting the patrol further inside the room. But what's the point of stealth anyways. Just shoot them in the faces. They are nazis.  No lol one kinda walks towards you, the other goes the opposite way. How many times do you pull your pud per day? Just curious.

Wouldn't "less" also be acceptable though, depending on what it is modifying?

Fewer: Mine fewer [ores]. (Refers to ores, something that can be counted.)

Less: Mine less. (Refers the action of mining, something that cannot be counted.) Exactly. This joke needs some work (that will set it free). Nazi: We are collecting too many useless ores.  
Hitler: Mine less, then.  
Second Nazi: Mine *fewer*.  
Hitler: Yes?   Good joke but you butchered it with your typo and formatting. Fixed for formatting:

"We've been to a bar, a nice place, and I was chattin' with one of the waitresses and Karen weren't happy with that, so we got back to the hotel and ended up having a bit of a ding dong, didn't we? She was gettin' at me, saying I werent a real man-" 

"Wasnt."

"Its not 'werent', its 'wasnt'." 

"Oh..." 

"Go on."

"Yeah, well, then I done it."

Have you ever heard of Game of Thrones? the main character is Sherlock Holmes, right? No that's Game of *Holmes.* *A Song of Ice and Fire* is the official title of the Game of Thrones series of books. GoT was just the name of the first book, but they decided they preferred it when making the show. http://i.imgur.com/IQLSjqW.png See, I used to google random quotes like you. But one day I found my self searching up "Yeah I fucked it, Who has time to check for a dick." Googling that gave me Dr Dre and Eminem. Unrelated hits, too. Gonna be honest, I lied. Just wanted to see if someone else would. One of my favorite quotes from AFFC! 

Also (if you're a show watcher):  "Fewer." - Stannis the Mannis And then he opens fire on a spraypaint smiley face. 

God, we need season four. After season three? No, not really. At least not with the same show runners. What was wrong with it? Not cakedaybakeday, but I didn't really like season 3 either. I thought there was a TON of pandering to the fans, which was nice at first, but I found it muddled Sherlock's character a bit (as in, he was doing a lot of things he would never do in season 1 or 2). 

But I'm so down for season 4, I don't care what season 3 was like, it was still fun to watch and I can't wait for more! I actually agree, season 3 was very weak, especially compared to how great seasons 1&amp;2 were. Still, that's Moffat for you. Hoping season 4 will be great  So much nostalgia. I have to read the books again very soon. Does this make sense in German? Yes, German has a very similar distinction:

liegen = lying

legen = laying

The difference offered by the game isn't that helpful. Laying/legen means to *lay* a book on the table.  Lying/liegen means what the book is doing after: the book is lying on a table. It's actually a very appropriate parallel, since technically in both German and English, you *can* use the verb "to lay (legen)" to refer to yourself ... you just need the reflexive form of the object (you) as well.

e.g., "Now I lay me down to sleep", an old children's prayer. In German, I believe you can say similarly, "Ich lege mich ins Bett" ("I lay myself in [the] bed").

So basically the fundamental difference is that the verb "to lay" describes an action that requires an object being acted upon; "to lie" does not require an object -- the subject is implicitly assumed to be the object. In other words, it's equally correct to say "I'm going to lie on my bed" as it is to say "I'm going to lay me/myself on my bed".

It's not correct to say "I'm going to lay in bed" though, since there's no explicit object being laid. If grammar nazis correct people's grammar in a smug way, what does that make you? Grammar Gestapo Technically, yes, but that mixup isn't nearly as common in German as in English.

It's funny though, so I don't really care. [Here's the video of the scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfoniugyc70&amp;feature=youtu.be) That "keep quiet" at the end adds to it "Halt die Klappe" is one of my wife's favorite phrases!
It's more like "shut up" than "keep quiet," though. Lol sounds like "shut your trap" That's pretty much the verbal translation. is this PC or console view? PS4, the touchpad button pops up in the top left at the start. &gt;PS4, the touchpad button pops up in the top left at the start.

In fact I'm pretty sure I've had this exact conversation but about not mixing spanish and english into spanglish. What was the average number of stories told before one of you got stabbed in the back or strangled by a stealthy assailant? as a Sailor we just have dick jokes.  I laughed three times, thanks OP :) Game looks fun, glad I bought it, yet to play it. Just as good as TNO in my opinion, i'm sure you'll enjoy it. Especially that second act, boy does it ramp up.  Yeah, that first chunk of required stealth had me worried! Honestly I was not a fan of that section the first time through. On replaying though, I found that you can actually go pretty fast through it and it has its merits at the right pace. There is a certain intensity to holding the switch to drain the power before one of the guys rounds a corner. In general though, that kind of stuff should always be an option, not mandatory. I was super strategic and careful until I eventually got to one of the final hallways, with like 4 super soldiers and just decided to sprint past them all. Yeah it gets pretty simple because they're all hooked up to the rail. Until later, then they move about just like TNO. Not according to TotalBiscuit, he just criticised it for no reason. He mentioned it is a good game, but the amount of random criticism he gave was plain stupid. It is a small expansion standalone for fucks sake.

Sorry, it is not relevant, but I had a rant I needed to let out. I almost never agree with his opinions on games, honestly. Same deal with Yahtzee, also. I guess that's why we have a variety of critics available to us though. In Yahtzee's defense, he views his entire job as a critic as finding the flaws in games-- he says that if he just gushes about it, he doesn't feel that he's done you any service-- that he hasn't given you anything that wasn't already on the ad for the game. 

I'm not a huge fan of his reviews as of late, but he's at least generally consistent about what he offers.  what are you talking about? his criticism was that the stages in the game never change, or rather they change so slowly it feels like you're in the same area over and over.

whereas in TNO you were going all over the place, many many different set pieces.  Thou shalt laugh three times, and the number of the laughing shall be three. Thou shalt not laugh once, nor shalt thou laugh twice, lest thou then proceedest to three. Five is right out. [College Humor skit version.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4vf8N6GpdM) As someone who is not a native english speaker, and lives in the UK.  That is what people must think when they hear me speak. No. People who aren't native-English speakers get a pass as long as they're understood. You can't be expected to have it perfected anymore than any of us could be expected to perfect any other language in a normal situation.

Amongst native-English speakers, it can vary. Hell, Chrome is auto-correcting me on the word "amongst".

There are sticklers who can't stand people ending a sentence with a preposition. Who can't handle the misuse of the words "who" and "whom", as shown in the video.

There are a million different ways in which you can speak the language wrong.

Or more correctly, speak it incorrectly.

Der R udderz hu cunsidder it fyn az long az u get ur messg akros.

Most of us are in between somewhere.

I personally don't like the massive misuse of "there", "they're", and "their". Or "your" and "you're".

They're minor gripes though, and don't do much more than irk me.

The idea of allowing "literally" to mean "figuratively" in the dictionary is the kind of thing that kills me, (literally, it seems), because that is making the language no less than gobbledygook.

You might as well make "is" mean "isn't, "yes" mean "no", ""did" mean "didn't", and "yesterday" mean "never".

Then you end up with:

My leg is (or isn't) literally (or figuratively) broken.

When did (or didn't) that happen?

Yesterday (or never).

Literally (or figuratively)?

Yes (or no).

Then again, there are many people who don't give a shit about this kind of thing. 

Literally. I really take issue with the literally vs. figuratively part. I feel that when most people use literally, they - and everyone they are talking with - know that they are using the word as a hyperbole. Anyway, I also feel that this is an example of language changing and growing. I feel like this is a good thing. Our language is affected by our changing society, and i think this shows a healthy growth. You wouldn't still want to be using old english, would you? And like you said, a lot of language is about personal preference and getting ones meaning across. I get the point that English is a growing amalgamation of many other languages as well as itself, but that doesn't mean that it should be a no-rules, free-for-all.

My issue with "literally" is that it meant "exactly as stated with no ambiguity" while "figuratively" meant "metaphorically".

"Literally" being changed to also incorporate the meaning of "figuratively" doesn't progress the language. It just makes "literally" a pointless word that's useless.

Sending a text to someone that says, *"I'm at Joe's house and there's literally an elephant in the room"*, means nothing.

If you're being metaphorical, you could just use the word "figuratively", or just say that there's an elephant in the room and the metaphorical aspect will be apparent.

If you're being what used to be called "literally", then you have to now use other words like, *"I'm at Joe's house and there's literally an elephant in the room. Like, a real elephant. Physically in the room."*, because "literally" doesn't cover it anymore.

I used a ridiculous situation there, but the point still stands. 

If "literally" means both "literally" and "figuratively" then we've just made the word "literally" mean nothing and have to replace it with others.

I also hate the word "totes" to mean "totally" but I consider that to just be annoying.

If people started using "totes" and "totally" to mean "partially", however, I'd consider that more of a case of destruction of the language, as I do with "literally".

I just see a difference between things being used differently and nullifying a word.

"Up" can be used to mean "good", as in "things are looking up".

But to make "up" also mean "down"  just makes "up" a useless word. [Steven Fry hates these people too.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBOCHPCYnDw) I love that man. That was incredibly well said.

You talking about NO ONE LIVES FOREVER, cause thats the first google result?

PS: apparently "Wolfenstein borrows much of its structure from No One Live Forever, last year's best shooter.

 FUNNY, because the Germans originated from Barbaric origins. But that's according to the Romans who believed everything not Roman was Barbaric. Who cares. At least the barbarians back then wore pants. Another fun fact - the Romans, who wore skirts, made fun of the barbarians for wearing pants because they considered it feminine. Skirts are pretty damn manly. Look at the Scottish. Kilts are a nice skirt. Manly. Pants are oppresive to men. Women don't need any free space between their legs that skirts and togas and dresses and moomoos and robes provide, while men do. [deleted] Barbaric is from how the Greeks described anyone who wasn't Hellenic, because their languages sounded like "bar bar bar". German is derived from one of the names the Romans had for the people near the Rhine which they called Germania.  Bar bar bar bar bar [Babarbarbarbara!](https://youtu.be/gG62zay3kck) Ba ba ba ba Barbara Ann Hibbleton! It's like she lost how many bars there were and just improvised by adding more after each one. Such a beautiful language. Nyx nyx nyx nyx nyx Well, Barbara is a legitimate name. Isn't it because they were hairy and barbarian means hairy man or something? Haha the game's antagonist also gets referred as a descendant of some Roman emperor by the soldiers. Not Roman Emperor...Holy Roman Emperor.

The Holy Roman Empire is something different than the Roman Empire. [There's an iron-clad plan as to what to do during a Nazi story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izh-j8KUYjs) I thought the original grammar nazi was the guy that spell checked all of Hitler's speeches.......... that was the driest delivery of a nazi joke to date[.](http://www.tadkashadka.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/John-Cena-Saluting-374x500.jpg)


 why does the period at the end of your comment link to a picture of John Cena I hope this is all in German and those are the subtitles you have turned on. Otherwise the bit about their beautiful language just loses all meaning. 

I remember looking up specifically what the Germans were saying in the original Medal of Honor, just so I knew what they were saying, it was immersive. not as good as these guys : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3y0CD2CoCs

 Why do they speak English if they're Nazis?   They don't, they're subtitles. They speak German in the game. Oh I see. 

Haven't played this game yet. I'll get around to it soon. 

Does the lay/lie misconception make sense in German, too? It's "legen" and "liegen". So the joke works very well actually I bet there is a German word that describes a grammar joke working in multiple languages.  They have words for everything. Vielfachsprachengrammatikwitz? Just add words together, germans understand that [Your story checks out](http://i.imgur.com/EDbt3nt.png)

 o_O  German is a beautiful language like that.
 Because those guys back then ensured its purity! Holy shit this actually works. I thought it was photoshopped. So you would say you did a [Heiligenscheissphotoshopgedankesablehnung](https://translate.google.com/#auto/en/Heiligenscheissphotoshopgedankesablehnung)? ^^Yes, ^^German ^^is ^^that ^^simple. As a German - that makes no sense :&lt; I love the German language.  I hated learning it, but I admire it. Its unbelievable that this works. Every language has its powers. In English you can verb any word, that won't work in German. "Verb" is my new favorite verb. At this point I am assuming German was invented by someone with broken space bars on their keyboards.  Actually it does not quite so well as it does in english I feel. If you look at this german transcript:  
  
a: Ich legte im Bett (I was laying in bed)    
b: Lag (Lying)  
a: Was? (What?)  
b: Du hast im Bett gelegen. Nicht geliegen (You were lying in bed. Not laying)  
a: Legen, liegen. Wo ist der unterschied? (Laying, lying. What's the difference?)  
b: Du legst Eier. Du liegst im Bett (You lay eggs. You lie in bed)  

If you bring them face to face you might see how consistent they are in english in contrast to the german verbs. It might *work* in german, but it just doesnt sound right.  
  
german | english
---|---
legte | laying
lag | lying
gelegen | laying
geliegen | lying
legen | laying
liegen | lying
legst | lay
liegst | lie
 
Now a better working translation would be something like this:  
  
a: Ich habe im Bett gelegt.  
b: Gelegen  
a: Was?  
b: Du hast im Bett gelegen. Nicht gelegt  
  
But then the rest doesn't pan out so well and therefore it really feels kinda forced in my opinion. By the way, russian subtitles work the same way with the same word Yes. 

Source: English and German bilingual. i haven't played the game myself but i assume it would be:

"legte im Bett (was laying in bed)" from 'legen'. This would be wrong in this context, but "Eier legen" as in "laying eggs" is correct.

vs

"liegte im Bett (was lying in bed)" from 'liegen'. Which would be correct. German (grammar nazi) here:

"liegte im Bett" is not correct, it's "**lag** im Bett". lag because it's past tense? exactly. "liegte" isn't any other tense tho. it's just falsely conjugated. For clips/excerpts like these I always imagine that the makers of the game post shit like this themselves after they've waited a few years and no one's noticed it.  Now im curious, to lie and to lay are similiar sounds in german or this joke is just possible in english? :p  lay an egg = ein Ei "legen" (pronounced like le, but long e, hard g)
lie in bed = im Bett "liegen" (pronounced like lee, hard g)
In past tense it would be "legte" vs the correct form "lag" (pronounced laaaag) Did they say it in german? Id love to hear that ^^ I came in disliking grammar nazis.  I came out oddly persuaded to his point of view.   I wish Wolfenstein would release another multiplayer game.  Enemy Territory 2 ? he kept interrupting his awesome hitler story Reminds me of one eavesdropping mission in AC4. They just start talking about how weird the word "smuggler" sounds once you say it a couple times. But you still fail the mission if you miss too much of it, of course.  If either of those dudes said they got laid, they'd be lying. Reminds me of Team Coco's cameo on Halo 4. https://youtu.be/ZSnkv3rCEnA I thought this was the game you were talking about:

Uh because laying sounds different than lying?  I realized how dumb I was, right after clicking "send". I'm going to buy this game now.  is this from New Order or Old Blood? Old Blood I don't know why but reading this reminded me of CM Punk's ["Grammar Slam"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FV1GaA20I). /u/cacacacaiti

My dad was good at gambling... So... wealthy? Not exactly.  He excelled at the losing part.  Not so good at the winning part. So kinda this gif in reverse? So it is. Lol. Well at least he was a turtle necromancer. That's pretty cool. Then he wasn't good at gambling: he was an active participant in gambling. Some people say *good at gamling*, but what they mean is, *good at losing money on foolish bets*. You usually don't hear about the Dad that scored big and put his kids through college.  Son? [So he bet on Germany to win the world cup?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKMNKS-9ugY) Hahaha nice! My father wassss.....a drinker.  ...and a fiend. If only that somehow had something to do with gambling, maybe like the following terrible attempt.

------------

My father was...a drinker...and a gambler.

And one night he spends waaayy more than usual.

Mommy pulls him from the slots to defend their funds.

He doesn't like that. Not. One. Bit.

So, me watching, he takes some coins from her, laughing while he does it.

He turns to me, and he says, "Why don't you try?"

Sticks some coins in my hands, "Come and try it,"

"Let's put some sevens on that screen!"

aaand...

We lost everything.

I will forever miss Frisky Dingo more than any other show before or since. I agree with you, I wish they kept going with it. Archer is like a child that lived through an abortion, constantly reminding me of what my life could have been like if things were different. You have to give them credit, there are quite a few Frisky Dingo references throughout the years of Archer. Mr. Ford's appearance excited and depressed me in so many ways, so conflicting.. There are so many callback jokes to Frisky Dingo and Sealab that are sprinkled in there for fans.

* Mr. Ford
* Slowly raising keys to turn off a car alarm
* "You know..."
* "C'mon buddy"
* "Well not with *that* attitude"
* "That's the FIRST thing they teach you"
* Simone (even referencing the robot "kick pants")
* BAWK BAWK
* "Aww, Fat Mike, too?"


And a lot more I'm forgetting... "No, I think that's hydraulic fluid..." is another A Frisky Dingo reference? I love you.  And I you ... *Boosh!* Scion! Tc! Scion! Tc! You think you could bench press a scion? Simon is missing and the knives are gone! Call all the pet shops! Oh god, it's Arizona all over again! We can't EVER go back to Arizona! Boosh! Ohmygod is that cat party? Give it to me.  Caaaaaat partayyyayyyy No I don't want Bluetube you idiot, just give me cat party! I mean seriously, "Welcome to you are doom!" Sci-ron! T-she! Boosh!

Then his mom would be Cortana * I got it from Cortana * Digital herpes? Finally. SOMEONE gets some action from Cortana...  Why can't it be me? :( Because Cortana is a fictional character and you, as far as I am aware, are a real person.- Maybe I am an AI?

No I'm not .-. That's exactly what an AI would say. What is my purpose?
 To probe things.  Hopefully Cortana? Oh my god... You pass butter. Oh my god... Chief - Starring Joaquin Phoenix

http://content9.flixster.com/site/10/26/14/10261483_ori.jpg [What about a CGI Master Chef?](http://i.imgur.com/8hot0s1.png) Don't you mean [this guy?](http://ohmydish.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Ratatouille-movie.png) https://imgur.com/kj3uQxV Hopefully not Destiny Or Master/Bater As a 3D/VFX compositor I admire the time, and effort that his takes to look good.  He only messed up one thing.  When the boy walks over the coins and both him and the coin are casting shadows, the coin/boy combined shadow should not get twice as dark. 

Sorry, its part of my job to see and fix these things on a daily basis. When you die, can I have your job? PM me what it's worth to you to have that position open up sooner than later  On the lookout for this guy.... Could you give some insight into how this was accomplished. technically speaking? What programs might have been used etc. You could use After Effects for compositing, Maya for modeling/animation/rendering and PFTrack or Boujou for tracking AfterEffects probably.  Also, the tops of the shadows from the coins should not be blurred/soft. The light from the sun is so far away that all of the edges of the shadow from the small coins would be uniformly sharp/hard.


[Sunlight](http://i.imgur.com/9eV7VUl.png)

[Artificial Light](http://i.imgur.com/huEwmLr.png) The Sun isn't a point light though.  What you're saying would be true if it was, but the Sun as we see it is a disc of light, and the edges of the shadow should absolutely be more blurred for areas of the object that are further from the shadows they cast.

[This guy's feet are closer to the ground, thus less blurry](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GxotBv5forc/TbJXshol3FI/AAAAAAAAANo/vm2ApjvdYpI/s1600/sun.jpg)

[This kid/girl is standing closer to the wall than the fence, so the fence is more blurry.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_uLtm_t7Ba0Y/TH3G1POcjCI/AAAAAAAABwY/F1WN4cfe_8o/s1600/Shadow+Courtney.JPG)  The flower box is even closer than that, and thus its shadow is even sharper.

Now, this effect may be overexaggerated in the gif, but that's a whole 'nother point. Bendvis is correct.  Soft gradient shadows form all the time when an object gets further away from the object that is receiving the shadow. There is more of this kind of thing on the Youtube channel of Action Movie Kid.

He also seems to have one of these dads...

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2hAbftpVjHtFrDOpEM90aA Wow this dad is great at these. https://youtu.be/PHjvySrshVI That was amazing.  Wanna meet those dads.  what's your dad like? Smells like meat! rotten meat! The one near the beginning where he throws the ball back at ~~his dad~~ the guy who then goes flying through the window was quite believable! Awesome.

Edit: I just assumed. The father of Action Movie Kid works (worked?) at Pixar Animation Studios if I'm not mistaken. Dreamworks actually... He does most (all?) of his stuff in After Effects. How many *years* does it take to learn how to do that *well* to that ability? :\ Many [My uncle did similar stuff with my cousins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XucT4mCZ7fs), can't find the first one though, it's been lost in cyberspace unless he re-uploads it somewhere. 20 years from now he should show this to his son and convince him that he had super powers as a kid but the elders deemed him too powerful and stripped him of his powers before it was too late.  "and you will have them back when you finish college, son"

Ninja edit "dad I graduated college, where are my powers."

"You majored in English. You didn't read the fine print." Oh come on, there are plenty of *powers* in English. Wait, no, my mistake. That's Math. Have taken 7 Math subjects in college, am yet to develop powers or abilities of any kind. Pls help. You have not be mathing correctly. x^2 see.....there's a power. 2^x **WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW??** That's how you get your kid to put himself through college. haha, i took a video of my son dropping a lightsaber, and played it for him in reverse to show him his powers.  "HOW DID I DO THAT!?!?!" he said. 20 years from now, the kid will live in a virtual reality world where he does this type of thing all day every day and think nothing of this video. 20 years from now this cgi will look like an old Godzilla movie does to us now. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZdYT8Ui1go That video is fucking gold.  How the hell was that made?! Most video editors will let you add a title page or credits page. Sometimes you can even just use a photo of you want. They'll also let you overlay music to the video. So it's pretty easy, just record the baby and the dragon fighting, add the right song, title, credits, finished.  http://i.imgur.com/RadSf.jpg ***this is how I assume they made it (and is also how i would have done it)***

**For the Baby:** They tracked footage of the head of the baby on to scaled down footage of a stuntman in attire that was identical to the baby and looked like the baby underneath the clothing. 

**For the Dragon:** They scaled down another stunt man in a suit that was identical to the stuffed animal. 

**Composition:** They planned out the camera movements and had shots of the yard only. Then, they also added shots of the baby  against the same background for tracking and reference. They accomplished the lighting by filming everything at the same location. They also used green screen to superimpose the different parts onto the footage of the yard. And viola, you've got yourself a baby fighting a stuffed animal dragon.  And I'm sitting here with my dad who doesen't know how to unmute the TV.  **What? What did you say?** Another gif without a source. Thanks OP. Great work.  You can look it up on imgur: https://vimeo.com/109214393 This reminds me of that guy who animated his 3 year olds life, using Adobe After Effects and put them on youtube.

[Here's the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Q0BB8-2nA) 
 How can people do this on after effects? The best I can do is transform/resize objects... After Effects is very powerful. Even more so if you have good plug-ins.  Same guy. :)  Reminds me of my ill-conceived first-person augmented reality version of Frogger. Those poor beta testers.... Just out of curiosity, how long does something like this take to create?  I imagine with the shadowing and everything it's quite an undertaking The shadowing and lighting is the easy part.

On something like this, I'd say the camera tracking is what would take to longest. This particular shot has lots of things to track, so it should go through fairly easily. After that, There would be a minimal amount of roto mask work for when CG items go behind real items. Setting up the 3d is really straight forward once the camera track is done.

So, to answer your question,... could easily be done in an evening if you have the right tools and know how to use them.

source: am CG/FX guy,... does this stuff for his own kids. They just think it's completely normal and shrug it off. *sigh. Really is well done. The shadows the items are casting are completely convincing. Except for the child's shadow overlapping the coin shadows. saw the same thing.  didn't want to be that guy.  so i'll be that guy upvoting that guy. You're upvoting the guy you didn't want to be?

  Please accept my upvoting as a token of understanding your dilemma. Fuck all three of you  "CGI Master". Pffff. That kid looks super-fake.  https://i.imgur.com/ui8Svzk.gifv https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHucOd0leaQ

How long would it take me to do just one of the special effects in this video?
 [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVPcT0dJmoY) gives the basics of camera tracking, the main effect this video uses to place objects 'in' the scene. However this doesn't touch on the level of modeling, texturing or lighting skill required here.

The tutorial is for the software Blender, a free, powerful, 3D software. However, like most the learning curve is quite steep. Also its worth noting this tutorial is based around the 'blender internal' renderer, which is generally considered inferior to the new cycles renderer, however most of the information is still relevant. 

Andrew Price (the guy in the video) has many great tutorials that not only cover how to use blender, but also bits of theory on how to create great scenes. In this video we see okay modelling, Great lighting, really easy animation, a good locked down camera track.

Camera tracking is easy if the shot "plays into it" and this shot does exactly that-- the pattern on the sidewalk provides a great "read" to extrapolate the movement of the camera.  PFTrack or SynthEyes are software packages that can do this.

The models are cool, and this stuff is easy content.  Could be made in Blender, Maya, 3Ds Max, etc.  Now they have nice multi-mapped textures.  You'd need a bit of an education in that, and some love in ZBrush or Mudbox to make them feel real.

Now the lighting is what "brings this home".  The light is just like the light on the kid.  I'm guessing that he used the chrome ball trick to create a light wrap.  Look for a tutorial!  I'm on a clumsy mobile or I would.  But if you photograph a shiny ball, it's reflection can become a HDRI panorama that shines light in on the subject- the very same light as the real life footage.  That's what makes it look "so real".  An essential step.  This can be set up with the right Photoshop plugins, or a spherical unwrap node in Nuke.  Then you've got to get that into your 3d suite when you render.

So!  if you're very interested, you can make this happen in a few months, if you're ready to dig into lots of tutorials, buy a nice camera, and learn at least three complicated pieces of software.  I encourage it!  There is money in it!   It's how I pay my bills. By the time this kid is old enough to appreciate this his response will be, "Geez, dad! These special effects suck! I can do better on my iPhone 17xg!" This is why I hate playing online, this fucking kid is clearing using an aim bot. 10/10 Never playing online again after watching this Easy there chief, "CGI Master" is over doing it a tad. Almost as cringe-worthy as someone calling themselves a "webmaster" any time in the last 10 years. I immediately thought of Freddie Wong "I don't like to brag or anything but I'm a master." lmao Wow, thanks a lot, dad. Where was my CGI childhood adventure? WHERE WAS IT!?!? Coolest. Dad. Ever. I wanted to see him go down that sewer lid at the start of the video.  I've seen a lot of these videos with cgi elements blended pretty seamlessly into real surroundings, at least compared to movies just over a decade ago or so.

Is it just so much easier to do all this in software nowadays or do you need some special hardware to get this kind of effects?

Like don't you need reference points in the footage for the camera to track or anything? Yes, it is a lot easier to pull these sorts of effects off with the consumer/prosumer software available today than it was a 10-15 years ago. That being said, it can still take a lot of work. 

For instance, when the kid is picking up the coins, the dad probably had to go in and rotoscope his child so the child would appear in front of the coins. This process basically involves just tracing the outline of his child frame by frame which can be tedious as fuck. He also most likely had to go in frame by frame and place the glowing point at the end of the childs wand. 

He probably had to model the coins and bowser shell, which are pretty simple objects so that probably didn't take him too long, then he had to texture them correctly which again probably didn't take him too long since he's an experienced CGI artist. That right there would have taken me awhile just to get the textures right. 

He had to motion track the footage in a 3D motion tracking package. There are a lot of good ones out there now a days that can give you pretty damn near perfect tracks without even having to print out and place tracker markers in the shot. By tracker markers I mean [these](http://www.filmmakin.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/m/o/motiontrackingmarker_1.png). If you go back and look at the shot you'll see a lot of detail/contrast in the brick work as well as the leaves laying on the pavement, this was probably enough information for the tracker to be able to lock down and get a good track and 3D solve on the shot.

Then he had to go in and line up his 3D ground plane so it matched the perspective of the sidewalk so that when he animates everything it will appear in perspective with his live action footage. If you want to go even further with this you can make sure your 3D camera has matching settings to the real world camera you used, he probably didn't do that for this cause it looks like it was shot on a mobile phone. 

Then he had to go in and animate everything which probably wasn't too much trouble, the coins are easy they just rotate. The shells are a little tricker because they travel down the sidewalk but then have to be knocked away by the childs magic wand which means you have to make the physics look convincing. Hand animating physics in 3D or 2D animation packages can be a pain if you don't understand the principles of animation (I don't). So he probably had to use a physics engine (which most 3D packages have) to simulate the effect of the shell being hit. Now what I would have done to achieve that is I would have hidden a 3D cube in the scene thats invisible to the render camera right at the point where the child hits it with her wand so the shell will collide with the invisible object and fly off in a direction making it appear as if the child hit it with her magic wand. 

He then has to add in lighting to the 3D scene that mimics the lighting in the live action shot so the shadows being cast travel in the same direction and dither/feather appropriately. Then after he animates everything he has to render it out and bring it into a compositing package like After Effects, blend the CGI to match the color space, grain, and lighting of the live action shot to make it look convincing. If he's a talented CGI artist, which it appears he is, he probably didn't have to do too much work in the compositing stage to get the CGI blended into the footage. 

Then he clicked the render button and drank a beer.   No way that's cgi, that kid is both Mario and a wizard  You might be the youngest OP ever All my dad did was play a prank on me where he left when I was born and started another family... And now you can too! This site has amazing video effects tutorials. http://www.videocopilot.net/tutorials/ I wonder if he'll feed him mushrooms  Did Mario just steal Kirby's star wand...? My imagination at four years old, animated. The other kids are going to have a really hard time disproving that this kid's dad works at nintendo kids post on reddit so much younger these days I like turtles.  As a father of 2 young ones. I would pay for this service. This would be an awesome revenue stream.  pffft everyone knows green turtle shells rotate as they move forward And humble too... As a CGI Artist, I can't wait to do this kind of thing with my future kids. :) 4 year olds are using reddit now? Who has free time Man, I also want to be a CGI Gamer The lens flare effect was a little off Are you looking to adopt?! I SOO want you to be my dad! My dad is an alcoholic :( Alternatively, when your child is a demi-god. Looks better than the Hobbit This is the type of shit that would make my controller get stuck into the TV.  yeah i think this challenge would have received a solid 2-3 attempts from me before I realized the kind of rage that would find me if i continued. 

This is the kind of shit that makes me sanely quit a game to avoid an inevitable rage quit. And they say mario is for casual gamers...

This is proof there are hardcore italian plumbing gamers out there. I like the design of modern Mario games like Galaxy. You can play through to win and get an end sequence with relative ease. But if you're out for 100% completion then you're in for real pain. Some of those comet missions are just evil.

It's a good way of making sure that the casual Wii audience is catered for, without losing sight of the needs of the people who've been doing this for decades. Really that's been the theme since super mario world.  Simply getting to the end of the levels and doing the bare minimum wasn't too bad.  Hell, you could fly straight through half of them.  

It was finding all the secrets, opening star road, and beating the special world that was the real challenge.  Later games had some really tricky stars and the harder stars could be pretty brutal. Fuck tubular Blue yoshi all the way I...wha...

...

...that's so smart. Is it? There are no shells with which to fly. [None?](https://youtu.be/AZbvAHxUIU0) "You can complete the level by using a blue Yoshi and the cape. Progress to the P-Switch and stomp it. Jump and float to the next ? block, onto Charging Chuck, onto a second ? block, and then onto a group of coins temporarily transformed into blocks. Immediately grab one of the red-shelled Koopas. Fly the rest of the way, staying as low as possible to avoid the obstacles." Its just a pain running and getting him in the underwater stage on star road.   But those stages are only like 5 or 6 spots apart and blue yoshi is right at the very beginning. Much preferable to getting consistently screwed by fire piranha plants and football kicking Chucks. you do realize if you stand next to him to open the  egg and let him eat the invincibility star that comes down right next to him he auto becomes big yoshi? Hundred Percenting SMW is still one of the greatest accomplishments of my gaming career. The Galaxy games are the best 3d platformers I've ever played. The design is unreal.  I got a Wii U for Christmas and have been glued to Galaxy since owning it. I never owned a Wii so this was a huge eye opener. I can't wait to beat it so I can try out Galaxy 2! Get Galaxy 2 after you **BEAT** Galaxy 1, because it may take a while for 100% of that shit.  I'm lookin' at you Purple Comet... [deleted] I remember one in particular, where you were on either an 8-bit Mario or Luigi(I think Luigi), and it had platforms that would shrink and rotate.  Not sure if that was the one you were thinking of, but that level was impossible.  Fuck that shit man. That's certainly the one that caused me the most pain. Actually, I think it was a tie between that one and the cosmic comet race in that water level... Oh, the rage... Exactly.  Lots of folks cried foul when Nintendo started to add the Assist Block in the newer Mario games, which let a player bypass a level if they died enough times, but I like that it allows them to make challenging content without preventing weaker players from seeing later content in the game. But holy hell do I get mad when the game offers me the block. I'm like, "I've died a bunch of times trying to get the last star, not because I can't beat the level! Stop mocking me!" The star's not meant for you, it's meant for the 5 year old kids who also play the game. I think that's why it feels insulting to old people like me. Maybe if there was an option to turn it off it would be better.  Or non-gamers who never played videogames growing up.  Or people who want to get the star and know exactly where it is and how to get it but can't get the requisite powerups to do so.

Not gonna lie.  I exploited that assist block a few times. I don't need it I don't need it I don't need it I don't need it I don't need it I DONT NEED IT! Just floating there, tempting me to make a deal with the devil.  In Super Mario Bros. 3 there was the P-wing and the cloud. Blatant level skip goodies. I had those budgeted out carefully for World 8 back in the day! P-wing over 8-1! P-wing over the air force! Cloud over the mini-fortress!

I mean, later on I made a point of completing every level starting from only basic Mario. Took me years to work out that one in world 7 with all the bricks at the start. But in order to be the first in my school to beat that game everything was fair play! Freshman year of college, one of my dorm friends had an original NES with Mario 3. They played from World 1-1 to Bowser in World 8 with no skipping, and playing every level. I think P-Wing was allowed, but cloud was not. They managed to get to Bowser with 99 lives, and when they had class and stuff the NES would just be paused. That system was on for a good week while they played and went to class. When they started fighting Bowser starting at 99 lives, I remember most of our hall was in his room watching, and they died every single time until they were down to 0 lives, and they beat him. There was a lot of cheering in our hall that night. It took them 99 tries to beat Mario 3 bowser, but they were good enough to get there with that maby lives?  O_o Yup. I have no explanation for that because I didn't watch the whole play through.

But I remember being very frustrated that he kept making the sane mistakes and not recognizing the pattern of how bowser was jumping. In any case it's easy to backseat game, so I just kept my mouth shut.  Yeah they really do strike a beautiful balance between nostalgia (mainly thanks to the kickass OST) and a fun run, but give you the option to really challenge yourself if you want. 

Donkey Kong Country Returns and Tropical Freeze were a bit tougher for me but had that same kind of balance as well. A bit tougher? DKC Returns was a motherfucker. On good level you only die 10 times  Just watch a speed run of Super Mario World. Shit gets crazy fast. Have you seen the newer credit skip? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHQaYc8OwlA How the fuck do people figure this shit out? That seemed so damn complicated... Usually they make a TAS (tool assisted speedrun I think) find the way to manipulate a game into a state where it loads the end credits. Basically it's like loading a scene which is assigned a number with another scene and the game adds the two values assigned to these scenes which ends up being the value the game has for the end credits. The ocarina of time speedrun has a wrong warp which uses the same method. In English, they use a tool to find a bug in the game that can be exploited by reading deep in to the code(memory in this case).

Said bug is then exploited. In Simpleton, they don't think it be like it is, but it do. -Black Science Man What they're doing is setting up the memory in the game to match what the game would set if they just beat the game. I am assuming they are using a program which can output the current state of the memory and basically try random actions to match up that memory to trigger the event that happens when you beat the game.  Part of it is looking at the active memory of the game as you play and seeing what does what. To explain a little bit of what is going on here for those who see it and don't know what the fuck happened is that everything done by the player in the run was for explicit purpose of putting specific values into memory then exploiting a bug(the part where the football guy explodes out at the end) to execute that code the player had written by doing all those things. This code told the game to load the ending. Can I do this in real life? Load the ending? Yeah, but it's messy and your family won't like it. How does this even make sense? Here's an [explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAHXK2wut_I). If you don't know anything about programming, it will still be pretty greek to you. As someone who is currently taking a class in Assembly Language that is fascinating! What did I just watch? Mario being a man and saying, "Yo Bowser, fuck yo rules." &gt; hardcore Italian plumbing gamers out there.

There's a niche! Does that mean butt crack? http://i.imgur.com/NOECI0s.jpg This is a "yo, fuck that" quit for sure. The challenge done normally isn't actually this hard. This was made by Nintendo (presumably using dev tools) to add an extra layer of flourish.

They have a whole series like these on their Youtube page. I think they're called superplays.  This is the kind of shit that would frustrate me for hours on end... and then, after leaving to take a brief break, I'd return to find that my younger brother had beaten it on his first try.

I'm just kidding! He would have used up my only remaining lives and then decided to start my game over from scratch. My little brother would get so confused on why Luigi had red clothes. I tried to convince my little cousin that he was controlling Yoshi in Super Mario World, bc i didn't even want to wait for him to Luigi. Would this brief break involve fans? Sorry, had to do it since I still have you tagged. From a previous... incident. [Here's the reference](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2xpswi/menwomen_whats_the_most_disturbing_thing_youve/cp2bodd), just in case anyone else would like to laugh at your joke.

Anyway, said breaks usually involved a much-needed trip to the restroom, since I'd often hold it for hours on end while trying to get through a difficult part of a game. That was magnificent. ...how much you want for that fan? Wait a minute, it doesn't say where you were or who you thought it could be. You left the fan on in the living room, who did you think it was? I actually went into detail about that a bit lower in the thread.

My first-ever apartment was a "cozy" basement unit with a pressure cooker for its communal space and two bedrooms the size of particularly cramped matchboxes. It was not, as you might imagine, the most well-ventilated of domiciles, and my one window to the outside world came in the form of an overlook into an equally tiny back yard. It was a nice enough view (for what it was), but I wasn't allowed to actually visit that minuscule oasis of tenacious plant life, given that it bordered on about a dozen or so other buildings in a way that made privacy all but impossible.

Now, I knew that a couple of those houses were home to families of Chinese immigrants, but there were also a fair number occupied by students. That, combined with the relatively frequent rate of their turnover, meant that one could never be completely sure of who lived where (or what sorts of habits they had). While that would normally be an irritant, at best, it frequently resulted in my overhearing some particularly interesting occurrences... like the time that I *thought* I'd found myself inadvertently listening to a young woman in the throes of passion. Ok cool thanks for the backstory,   the conclusions I was coming to were much worse. It's okay, lives don't actually matter in this game.  Also, this is a special challenge level outside of the normal game, so lives extra don't matter here. "You're breaking my balls, Mario!" Whoa, that's a big... Fire stick. In my day tv screens were made of thick ass glass. My controllers broke but the tv stood strong. Controllers were also super light. You and my brother need anger management. this gave me so much anxiety My palms were sweaty arms were heavy I saw a yeti... spaghetti If you could have any one food for the rest of your life, what would it be and why is it spaghetti? Yes. Spaget! I got you! You got spooked spaghett about it #2spooky Gotcha spooked ya! My names Spagett, I do birthdays, parties... Cigarette juice! What's your spaghetti policy here? Spa? I feel like your starting a word, do you mean Spaghetti? [More relevant than you know.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gZvxpFWe9M) Dad's Lasagne  Dads linguini Aunt's baked ziti (seriously though, my aunt's baked ziti is ridiculous) knees weak That bastard could have killed those turtle things at any time, but noooooooo he chose to wait till the end and play with them.  That's cause, as the clock at the top signifies with it's changing colors (Bronze-&gt;Silver-&gt;Gold-&gt;), you get a bonus for surviving long. Couldn't he have immediately killed 3 turtles and left the last one standing?  The remaining turtle may be bent on avenging his fallen brothers but he's still only one turtle.  to get to the last one, he had to jump off the 3rd turtle. there's no way he could kill the 4th if he left it alone after killing the 3rd.  So he could have killed 2 right from the start... I'm sure he could. But he didnt need to. 

() What a monster.... I could kill the ants crawling on the sidewalk but I'm a merciful God  Except for the thousands you kill anyway accidentally... /u/Just_Look_Around_You works in mysterious ways. Actually, you don't even have to kill them. The clock stops at 50.00 because that's the highest score you can get. The goal is only to live for as long as you can. Killing the hammer bros. isn't part of the goal. That, too, could have worked Not as cool. um those aren't turtles, they're fucking Hammer Bros. jeez Fire Bros. actually, but they're still turtles.  Koopas This looks like a bonus stage from one of the New Super Mario Bros games. Specifically, the objective appears to be "Survive for 50 seconds."

It doesn't say not to kill the turtles before the 50 seconds is up; he could have killed them all at the beginning and just stood around for 45 seconds. But hey, what's the fun in that? Yeah, definitely doesn't make for a very memorable gif. the thing is...if he killed them earlier it would have been easier to survive longer if you're that good, you go for style Some of those challenges were really difficult. In Mario 3D world, the secret stage, champions road, is soo difficult, specially if done without powerups. I think I spent 3 hours straight trying to beat that level with toad without powerups. The satisfaction at the end though...  &gt; Mario 3D world, the secret stage, champions road

[Is this it?](https://youtu.be/vSTpvzY77eA)
 everything about this level is beautiful God, I kept watching that thinking "now THAT'S the part I kept getting stuck on... Well and that part. Yeah that part too..." Pretty much the whole level. I can do the entire thing flawlessly with Rosalina up to the part where you stomp the piranha plants.

I have absolutely no fucking idea how the fuck you're supposed to bounce on those things. No clue. I believe if you continue to hold the jump button after landing on them, you get the maximum jump height. So you just hold the jump button and move left and right. good thing that music was so cheerful. if it was all dramatic i think the added stress alone would kill me Yeah, but try this: final level of Super Mario Galaxy 2, I thought that was hard enough. But wait! There's a comet!

Comets change up a level. Enemies are faster, it's now a race against clones, there's a strict time limit, etc. The last level's comet? You had one hit, and you're dead. In my original run, getting through some parts REQUIRED getting hit. And now there's also larger, beefier enemies to boot. Oh, and no checkpoints. Yeah that was fun. Yep!

And yes, it is difficult.  But with enough practice (see "trial and error"), it's actually not too bad.  And if you use the princess w/ her float ability, it's not too bad at all actually.  Fun and satisfying as hell to complete, however. This is 3d world on the WiiU right? I have 3d land on the 3ds and its tons of fun, but some levels are also crazy hard.

Still no WiiU for me though so I've never played this version. Are there many differences? they're entirely separate games and 3D world is probably the best 3D mario game since 64 imo I think I still prefer galaxy over 3d world, but 3d world made me smile more with the multiple mario levels.  Those were awesome and hilarious.  It's the same idea (i.e. timed levels, 3 special coins per level, lots of secret paths), just much much bigger. More levels, bigger levels, more diverse levels. Amazing game, but I wish they'd bring back the Mario 64/Sunshine style games with a hub world.

EDIT: Also instead of level "remixes" like in 3D land there are just like five bonus worlds after you "beat" the game. I finished that game up until the point where it wanted me to complete every level with every character. That's when I decided that I wanted to stay sane and *not* have to master that godforsaken level with another four characters. Wait how do you long jump?  I spent 3 hours straight just trying to clear the first part of this stage.

At that point I logged into YouTube and watched a video of the full level.  It was then I gave up my dream of actually fully completing that game and quit playing. I've been playing Mario games since the very beginning and I've 100% completed every one except this god damn level.  I don't know how many hours I wasted but I finally had to admit defeat and give up.  After dying 100 times in the exact same spot I just said to myself "I have better things to do".  Maybe it's just that I'm in my mid-30s now and my priorities have changed, and younger me would have eventually powered through it.  But right now, 2015 version of me just can't do it. Took me and my friends hours and hours to do that... when that 'Thank You' screen popped up.. the feeling was very rare. That is one skilled player. I wonder how much time he spent practicing for this. Most of these videos are done my Mario Club, the QA and testing branch under Nintendo. I don't believe they use any kind of tools, but I also want to believe that the guys that have tested pretty much every Mario game under the sun are just *that* beastly good at these games.  is this one of the videos included in the game, though? I'm not checking There are a ton of videos on the game that you unlock that shows this type of amazing skills,  its don't by the development teams and most likely either slowed or done with some sort of cheat system.  some of the others are just insanely complicated and there is no way in hell a person can pull that shit off.  I believe the videos are done by Mario Club, the testing group. No cheating involved. Dark Souls: Mario DLC More like IWBTG Nah, there's not enough invisible platforms and upwards-falling-cherries.

This is more like Cloudberry Kingdom, where everything is perfectly visible, just insane. I really hate games like IWBTG.  Super Meatboy?  Great.  Dark Souls?  Love it.  But there's a subgenre of games that are so obnoxiously hard that they remind me of the "sidekick with ATTITUDE" characters from eighties kids films.

Ten years later we realized that those characters aren't cool and edgy, they're just annoying cunts.  I have hope for the gaming community. I'm totally with you. Dark Souls is hard in a "they have to be really good to win" way. But there are so many games that in order to win you have to be lucky or just have memorized what's coming.  Super meat boy. Not dark souls Super Meat Mario Nothing in dark souls is as hard as that looks.  Dark Souls isn't THAT hard.  Seriously. Dark Souls is difficult and unforgiving but its difficulty is blown way out of proportion. The reason its difficult is because of the steep learning curve as it throws you right in. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D27IkB3-dHg) is a truly rage inducing level, albeit, entirely fan made to be the hardest level ever.  For the record, the creator designed this stage to be passable only through extensive use of emulation tools and game glitches. Then the creator went on to "solve his puzzle" so to speak, in order to prove that his stage was actually passable. It took him _THREE YEARS_. Well at least now he can [finally play the game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg2PD-dwsIw) I don't even quite understand how this is humanly possible. It's not, the crazier levels are mostly done as TAS runs It pretty much isn't 'humanly possible'. A combination of save states are used with a trainer in order to play the run perfectly.  Whats the point then?  "look at how hard this is?  Except its not really as hard as it looks". It's kinda like lining up a fuck load of dominoes or making a rube goldberg machine. Countless hours of trial and error just to create that one perfect moment. The developer does it for the challenge and satisfaction of success.  Still took the guy months to do. You need frame perfect precision for some of those moves. He said in the comments that he used about 100000 rerecords. That's 100 000 save and reloads just to perfect this one level.  It's not. Unless whoever was playing this is some kind of pattern recognition/memorization genius of unprecedented scale. 

It's almost assuredly tool assisted. They're either playing frame by frame or they're using save states.  I used to think I was good at Mario...then I went on the internet. replace mario with anything, frankly I watched all of it, that is just sickening. [this](http://youtu.be/awtf_lKNaNw)  was the first one I saw. They are all ridiculous though  The payoff with the yellow shell at 4:45 was amazing. This isnt a person that completed this right? It has to be macro or something? How is this shit even possible?!!! It's a Tool Assisted Speedrun, [you can read about them here.](http://tasvideos.org/WelcomeToTASVideos.html)

They essentially play the game frame by frame, recording over and over again to get everything as perfectly executed as possible in order to finish the game as fast as possible. Wow, I never thought anything could be worse than [Frustration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in6RZzdGki8) Goddammit, fuck that. Also made to be impossible without some form of tools or save states, which in my opinion, takes out a lot of the fun.

I liked Kaizo because SOME parts (while limited) can at least be completed without entirely abusing save states/item glitches. I'm fairly certain I've seen footage of someone beating a level or two of Kaizo with no save states used at all. I can't imagine the immense satisfaction that'd come from that. There is someone who ran a deathless run of Kaizo 1 no save states, no tools. He is a Mario speedrunner that plays odd Mario mods. I'll try and find it it's amazing.

EDIT: [Here it is. It's done by Dram551. Fucking incredible.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv5Lpzzjf6s) Dram is the man, his Kaizo Mario run at AGDQ this year was so hype. [Here is a link for those that are interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkMuNRjodCQ). Something on /r/gaming that's NOT GTA V?!!  What's GTA V? New game or something? I believe it's that new fandagled version of the prostitute killing simulator I've heard on Fox News that mindcontrols children into shooting people in public places and stuff. Grand Theft Fandango? Is Manny really back? :O That sounds Double-Fine! _cue sad rimshot_ [Why did I mention it! :'(](http://i.giphy.com/14yuENjFSDbXNu.gif) Can confirm, have shot children in pubic places. Wait... I did that wrong. Creating a new castrato choir? Haven't had one of those in a while.  
I wonder why? I think it's an upstart Carmageddon knockoff or something. I'm not sure anything will come of it.

EDIT: Holy frick! There's a new [Carmageddon release](http://www.carmageddon.com/reincarnation) on Steam Early Access! Where have I been? People give the NSMB series a lot of shit, but the challenge mode in U was the tits. Plus you could play the levels with your Mii, which I appreciated (if nobody else did...) NSMBU is a really good 2D platformer with great level design. The only reason that game gets the flack that it does is because it's part of the NSMB series and people think Nintendo milk that series when there have been 4 games spanning 4 consoles over 6 and a half years. It isn't a rare release, but I wouldn't call it milking. I guess part of the reason people ridicule it is the perceived reuse of old assets. There isn't really much evolution in presentation compared to the 'classic' 2D games, just look at SMB1 and SMB3, there's a vast update in looks. Now Nintendo's in a Catch 22 between keeping the current look and alienating the 'hardcore', or changing the art style and potentially losing the mass appeal of one of their biggest cash cow franchises. They don't need to rebuild the graphics engine from the ground up each NSMB, but they could deviate from the grass/sand/sea/cloud/fire kingdom templates a lot more. Weeeeeeeeeeee!  yeaaaaaaaaaaahh!! wooooooooo! What game is this New Super Mario Bros. U. This is why Japan isn't making babies. Everybody inside trying to beat this  You say that like outside is where most baby-making happens... That's like Super Meat Boy level crazy.  Wow. Hi. Can everyone buy a wii u now please? Fuck all of that. I think you'll find that's Goku. This is why I laugh when people say Nintendo games are for kids. The regular first part of the game if you don't try and get all the stars and/or special coins is made for kids so they can beat the game, see all it has to offer, and still give enough of a challenge so they struggle and/or feel a sense of satisfaction.If you go for all the stars and/or special coins, play all the additional levels, complete all the special tasks and beat the game 100%, THEN the game has real value and an insane difficulty level that even the best gamers will have trouble with.That's why I love the Mario series, it has something foe everyone. Yeah, the reason all those great NES games were 'hard' was because the cartridge could only hold so much memory, and the levels were designed to be hard so that the customer felt like they got their money's worth. It helped that most developers at the time were used to making arcade games, that tended to skimp on actual length and compensated by being absolutely brutal from the get-go. Now, games can be large enough to offer a more flexible difficulty gradient. I think another contributing factor to a game's difficulty was the lack of easily accessible information.  Stuck on a level, and can't figure out how to get past it?  Either call the Nintendo hotline (absurdly expensive), hope it is in Nintendo Power (not that expensive, but no guarantee of the information being in there), or give up.

One thing I distinctly remember as a kid was renting NES games that came with a photocopied version of the booklet.  People would write tips/tricks/codes in them so that the next renter could benefit from it.  I always thought it was pretty cool.

I concur with your opinion though.   mario is neo! He's the one. "It's a-me, MOTHERFUCKER!" This isn't Super Dark Souls? That gave me anxiety could be worse
https://youtu.be/in6RZzdGki8 I would have to buy a new TV just after the 3rd try. [deleted] Could cause death if taken with Mario Is this a *Mario* Mario game or a Mario Party game?

If Mario Party: There needs to be at least *one* event to separate the hardcore from the casuals and ruin friendships. This is that event. New Super Mario Bros. Wii U New Super Mario Bros. U actually Mushroom Kingdom Parkour I can't imagine completing it would be worth the amount of time it'd take to learn and perfect the routine.  i just got a legit panic attack from that.......i wish i was exaggerating because that's mildly embarrassing  You think that's bad? Let me introduce you to [Kaizo Mario World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkMuNRjodCQ), aka Satan's Mario. Could you link to the video? Would make for a more entertaining watch.

Though yeah, that looks interesting. I think the player killing those Fire Bros was overkill. [Here's the source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd2T-QjRQPk) This is the kinda thing that makes me rage quit a game and not touch it again for a long time. Then when I return to it my wiser, older self clears it first time NSFCasuals... I'll just leave. This would make me quit. *I'm not trapped in here with you. You're trapped in here with me.* I was hoping he would land on the car, but the light post makes is so much better! Same, I noticed a few seconds before he hit the lamppost that the trajectory was off and got a bit disappointed, but then the lamppost saved it for me. I love lamp post. Do you really love the lamp post, or are you just saying that about random objects in the gif? I love lamp post. I LOVE LAMP POST. Brick, my sweet Brick. Give me a hug, I know you want to.  Streetlamp Le Moose Lamp post is life. I thought he got chopped in half for a minute fata-LIT-y I love the pink mist. The only thing better (or worse depending on how you look at it) would be if he straddled the lamp post. It still bugs me how they cut off the **WASTED** animation before you hit a button. A lot of my deaths have more entertainment to provide after the game respawns me. ME TOO. All I want to see is my body tumble from the air when I blow up from the top of a building :( I was hoping for a mod that provided an extended death cam like this. And just press a button to respawn at any time Someone ban this guy. Trying to circumvent the paid mods / potential DLC.

i get people are different, and have different opinions but the game is basically a lot of mayhem, it seems a very bizarre design decision.  I have to believe it was management decision that the developer followed reluctantly.

your own deaths can be some of the best parts of the game.  I don't know why they changed that from the old games. I'm sure in either GTA IV or San Andreas, you only respawned once your body had stopped moving.  Indeed.  Rockstar, if you're listening, let's get this extended cut Wasted screen happening!  He had adequate runway length. He casually strolled off the side. "I definitely don't need this parachute anymore!" Totally nonchalanted that one.  Shoes?  Why bother I'm just parachuting onto a narrow steel ledge. Shoes came off, confirmed ~~dead~~ wasted. To be honest if you attempted that this would likely be the outcome. Except bloodier Two lamp posts?? One guy, two lamp posts? Note to self: Do not use a parachute to land on top of a bridge while someone is sniping me. Or try to land on the ground or water. I mean Whatcha gonna do from on top of the bridge now? Are you joking? Do exactly that! You will never have a better death! It is true. This death would be the best of my deaths. "If only I had a parachute!" The fact that the game has enough detail that the guy gets killed when he hits the lamp post not the ground is impressive. I think you mean sliced in half He just got Ghost Shipped. Except that one little girl who was just under the slice line in height.  Thanks. This comment helped me understand the reference. I love the way that one dude slowly slops apart.  The sound fx are perfect, ew.  Oh my god I was just a little kid when I saw this shit on fucking tape in Vietnam. Before I even speak any English. That shit haunted me for days afterward uhhhh I avoided tightly pulled wires for a while after that movie. Unreal reference. Absolutely unreal.  I understand this reference. Or Kingsmanned. Yea seems like something from /r/WTF. Considering how much death there has been in that sub lately... /r/wtf has been like /r/gameofthrones On some days /r/wtf has better content then /r/gore... "Better" These are the kinds of people who sort /r/watchpeopledie by new and constantly refresh the page for new content. God, that sub.

I think I died a little when I went there. Don't tell them that Could you please record yourself before you die a little, we always need more content c: _ *than Or even /r/watchpeopledie That's gonna stay blue Just like the people in there http://imgur.com//oHM3bhj.gif I was in the middle of making that expression and gesture when I clicked that link.

Square indeed. I appreciate your sage words of wisdom. Can I get a translation from someone who can see what he typed? I can see it! It says !

Hope that helps!  Download Chromoji on Chrome to see emojis! :) I genuinely don't know why but I can't stop looking at these gifs/videos. It's not like gore shit. It's just kind of horrifying. Shows you the real world man. that's just my real fucked up perspective.

I've turned like 5 guys into redditors by showing them just that sub. It's weird shit man.

*edit: I'm retarded at words You have some weird ass friends if showing them that sub is what convinces them to get on reddit. Well, it sounds like being weird is a requirement of being an ass friend. What even is an ass friend. It's a special bond between a man and an ass.  My thoughts exactly  dare you to keep /r/picsofhorsevaginas blue.   [I wanna see if it's real, but I don't wanna *see* if it happens to be real] (http://i.imgur.com/Nyj9cWz.gif) I checked for you since I'm pretty sure I'm on several lists already.

It's real. if you have RES, and hover over it, it shows you if it's real. It's real. Right, but /r/potatosalad is pictures of John Cena and /r/johncena is pictures of potato salad. So maybe that sub is actually pictures of really cute animals, and there's a sub with cute animals called /r/picsofhorsevaginas? No it's a sub of pics of horse vaginas... I checked.  It's not that bad... It makes you think about your ~~morality~~ mortality, which is something we are naturally scared of doing, but you really should do. You or one of your loved ones could be gone in an instant, and it's not bad to be fully aware of that. 

You'll think about how you want to die, and what comes next. Scary, but important things to think about. I think you meant mortality. Yes, that I did. 

I defiantly did. That's a nice shade of blue that link isI shouldn't disturb it. Wasn't there a similar video from 9/11 when someone jumped out of a window? Here's hoping one day mods will actually let that happen Not really. The lamp post already has a collider attached to it so that cars can run into it, people can run into it, etc. This isn't any extra coding...just what would happen if the player hit something with a vertical impulse greater than some value...

Still an impressive gif though. In a lot of older games, even if the lamp post had a collider, it would've just been a simple tall, thin cuboid rising vertically inside the model, with nothing for the horizontal section.   But nothing would go higher than a few meters in those games and no physics, so it wouldn't matter.  It can require extra coding, because collision detection is often done per frame. So it's possible for a fast moving body to pass through a small collider in one frame. So to avoid this speed can be limited, multiple collision checks can be done or paths can be swept/integrated mathematically. This is true, but generally speaking you physics rules are coded once and making things interact with each other is mostly about just having the right geometry and accurately setting the parameters. I don't think it is necessarily extra detail. They don't add code that says "if someone falls into the ground, he dies. If someone falls into a lamp post, he dies". Rather, "If someone falls into water, they live. Otherwise, they die". 

Easier to cover all bases that way.  I have died falling into water. How are you posting to reddit? And, for that matter, who is phone? [Banana.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5C6X9vOEkU) Oh wow this takes me back. 'No.' We have WIFI in hell now. RIP in pieces /u/Draakan.

You might be missed. F A C T - Dwight K. Schrute It'd be more like a physics comparison. 'Your force' + 'object force' = 'damage' where damage ranges from 'ok/stumbled/knocked on your arse/killed' with applicable health loss and animation results.

Doesn't really matter what you hit, as every object in the world has collision detection.

Water's just going to have a negative modifier 'if water -80% impact' or along those lines.

They don't have to code a different physics engine for every object in the game. Water in the game is coded to how you land. A fall that would kill you if you flopped would be survivable if you came in like a dive. It's really detailed.  Someone should make a video exemplifying this - I need to see this in-game to believe it, and, despite actually owning the game myself, I don't have the skill to actually pull off consistent variable landings. Yeah but you can't choose to dive.

Also, a landing that will explode your car if you land upside down, you can drive away from if you land on your wheels. not every game puts collision detection on stuff like street lights. Christ, yeah, it's like the lamp was one of the classic Japanese samurai movie swords that cuts the dude in half so fast, physics just keeps him glued together because it doesn't know what else to do. Yeah but not enough to know he wouldn't take the parachute off before he stopped. Nevermind that some asshole was already trying to shoot you as you were on approach!

The game, if you didn't know, is GTA V
 Serious question - is it worth $60? I'm on the fence. Yes.  Yep pretty much if you buy one game every 3 years, this is the one.  This is me.  Red Dead Redemption to Grand Theft Auto V.  Nothing in between. Is the PC version better than the console versions?  Yes. If your PC can run it, it is. I played PS3 version since launch day, just got pc version, and it's like launch all over again.  I don't understand how it does that for me. I got it at launch, played the crap out of it, 100%'d it, and now I want to do that again. The game is constantly reminding you that it's a much more beautiful world, and the PC version serves it justice. Yes it is.


But maybe not. -_- Everybody surely knows, right? What game is this? The game, if you didn't know, is GTA V

 Everybody surely knows, right? What game is this? The game, if you didn't know, is Greater Toronto Area V.  All the people Shirley knows, right?

It's much appreciated. I often don't know what game something is from. There's a new GTA? When did that come out? Years ago. The more important thing is, why on earth were you parachuting with 4 stars onto a bridge?  Stolen helicopter was going down? Oh the helicopter has to be STOLEN just cause he's black. It was just a repo! Knowing Franklin this was likely the case. It looked badass as fuck that's why. Honestly that's the reason I do anything in GTA. Is there a sub for just gta5 gifs?

*It was at this moment, Darrell knew...he fucked up*

[death] His plan was to parachute onto the top of the arch. It didn't bother Kenneth that the park service had turned down his request for permission to jump. Kenneth had already made over 1,600 jumps. He knew what he was doing. And a true daredevil never needs permission.

The day dawned with howling winds and bitter cold. The weather would have given most parachutists second thoughts about making a jump. But Kenneth had psyched himself up by watching a documentary on parachute daredevils, and Kenneth knew what he was doing.

He left his wife a note asking her to come and photograph his triumph. At 8:55 a.m. he leapt from a light plane and soared successfully to the top of the monument. He had conquered the Gateway Arch, with his wife watching from the ground!

He grabbed onto the aircraft warning light, to steady himself against the raging wind. The first part of the plan had gone perfectly. Of course it had, Kenneth knew what he was doing. Now came the harder part: getting down.

The arch is hollow, with a viewing area inside, just beneath Kenneth's feet. Perhaps he was looking for a trap-door into the arch, but there was no trap-door. A gust of wind caught his deflated parachute and threw him off balance. He began sliding down the north leg of the arch. About halfway down, he tried to deploy his backup parachute, but it failed.

Another gust caught his parachute and blew him off the arch. He fell the rest of the way, landing head-first in the terrazzo below. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital about one hour after performing his last jump. should've held the shoulder buttons right before landing, gives you a softer landing without stumbling on the ground. Pretty sure they did. Worth it!  Like a Wile E. Coyote cartoon Jeeze there's so much more blood in the newer versions of the game Or alternatively, always make sure you have a reserve parachute. [deleted] It happens after you do the merryweather heist. In Single player only. At least the lamp post broke his fall! I love causing a traffic jam on this bridge and waiting for like 100 cars to pile up and then blowing them all up This is far more hypnotic than a gif of a game character getting cut in half should be. This came to mind.
http://i.imgur.com/V8LtOF5.gif your character looks like Bob Ross. What a twist! That lamppost at the end.... Not even a seconds hesitation for his partner who was just mowed the fuck down. Supercop ain't got time for sentimental bullshit. When you go through partners like most people go through disposable razors, you can't be too sentimental. [They still haunt him in his dreams though . . .](http://i.imgur.com/gYRReNz.png) I'm very confused as to why those are Chelsea FC razors. Me too, but it was a pleasant surprise. I don't get it, could you explain? basically Chelsea FC are a bunch of barmy wankers Found the Arsenal fan  Found the fan of any club in the world, more like. Found the guy who finds people who find people. The thing about Arsenal is, they always try and walk it in! What was Wenger thinking sending Walcott on that early? hating chelsea is a much more universal thing than just arsenal. http://i.imgur.com/eQkEDte.gifv

Possibly "Chelsea Field Cops"? Let's go with that; the place or organization that made Supercop who and what he is today . . . CFC: "Shaving away crime since 1905." Cuz there's nothing more boring than shaving with a disposable razor BORING BORING CHELSEA You get killed, walk it off - He's motto.. probably. nah i dont think he's motto, i think he's autto imo Razors? More like tissues.... Disposable tissues?! Peasantry! #hankymasterrace Not if you use dollar shave club. Don't forget discount code Pka.  His partner was one week from retirement. And about to get married. In a shotgun wedding. And he was pregnant And he was 12 hours into dead island.  Now he'll never finish. What a bad day to quit smoking. Looks like they picked the wrong day to stop taking Amphetamines. Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue And now his watch has ended. He might not, but I sure did. (   ) You finished Dead Island? *It's just called two brothers^^^^^HAHAHAHAHAHA* http://imgur.com/gallery/XS5LK http://i.imgur.com/vncZ8J3.gifv With triplets. He had almost finished developing Half-Life 3 just got out of the academy  And getting too old for this shit. And too old for that shit You ever shoot the cop who's driving the car? His partner literally opens the driver door and pushes his dead partner out of the moving car. Those are some merciless mutherfuckers. And manages to still keep up will your supped up hyper car.  Maybe you shouldn't be feeding it so much supper. ive spent many a drunken hour standing in the road in front of sandy shores medical center doing this very thing. I think you might be me, and considering I've never actually seen you in the same room as me this might be possible. That open car door would have taken any normal man when the car was hit. He just punches it off the car as he gets out. He has to find John Connor, he's got no time for bullsh*t. You think a T-1000 was driving the truck then?  Realistic physics are very expensive to simulate, so they have to bastardize equations and data. Seem to have forgot to put a hitbox around that lamp post too, unless that's a ghost cop car and can pass through those. There is a hit box for lamp posts, but it is pretty weak. In my experience there are only two kinds of collisions in the game,and lamp posts are the weak ones. Once you hit ~12mph (20kph for you non-'muricans) you either blow through it like balsa wood or it stops you like hitting a brick wall.

*ninja edited for clarity *Game was played on Pentium 1 The dude basically just ripped the door off his own patrol car just so he could remain in place. He gives zero shits. He was only 2 days away from retirement :( He had a wife and kids dammit! This could be something straight out of Bollywood. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4iDWXstrWY

plugging: /r/BollywoodRealism  [Here's another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRn1Kl_kke8) . . . for Bollywood realism! Oh my god... He slid a horse on its side under a speeding truck, this is the greatest chase scene I've ever witnessed. Hahahahaha.  The best part is the horse clearly just lays down normally with zero momentum the moment before this happens.

Also, is this the same guy as [Bollywood Thriller?!?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSPvvVfcoAw)  Or possibly I'm just racists. Friction is not a thing in Bollywood movies. Everybody knows _that_. Apparently neither is PETA... Seriously. Those horses looked fucked after tripping over the rope. I am going to need someone to come in here and tell me they faked the horse scenes.  Lie if necessary. They probably ate the horses afterwards. Man, I haven't seen that Thriller video in years.

It's fantastic.

GOLIMAR MAR MAR MAR!!! Yep he is. He is a politician now and still making movies I believe. Its not really a bollywood thriller but a tollywood because of the different language. Just a tidbit if any helpful. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiranjeevi Wow. I mean..... Some of these stunts are just insane. At 1:45 ... I get the feeling those horses weren't digitized. They have ropes tied to their front hooves.  Pretty fucked up shit right their. 

However the ones that fall over in a line right after the ones in the pond.  Horses can be trained to fall like that, they kinda tuck their head down and in, and roll onto their shoulder.  Don't know if it hurts the horses or not but I have seen things in the past, regarding Westerns made in the fifties, that the horses are ok when they do that fall.  Just reminds me of the loooong list of shit you can't do for movies or shows in Hollywood. ...I can't get my head around what was supposed to have happened when he threw the bit of metal at the car. I guess "No Animals Were Harmed" did not appear in the end credits of this movie.  
  
Seriously though, is Bollywood the new equivalent to the Bud Spencer movies? [Best of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yysbbPStfWw) Today I learned that unless you're a cow, Indian filmmakers don't give a shit about animals or the humane treatment thereof. Today, those horse falls would get the American Humane Association so far up your ass, you'd need a professionally run and fully equipped industrial excavation team to get them out.

[For reference](http://www.americanhumane.org/assets/pdfs/animals/pa-film-guidelines.pdf) Movie is called Alluda Majaka, and if it makes you happier it includes several large song and dance scenes. This is the only thing that turns me off from Bollywood in general. I'm uncomfortable with musicals. Just so...weird. I can suspend disbelief to the point that, yes, sliding your horse under a trailer to escape people chasing you, no problem. Logical even, I'd probably do the same in that situation. But suddenly everyone just knows the words to the song, and also the dance moves?! THAT's ridiculous.  We're all in this together!  Lol, did they rip off the Speed theme for this movie?  THIS IS THE GREATEST ACTION SCENE EVER. OF ALL TIME. Indian Michael Jackson's handcuffs sure do seem to break and come back together a lot I thought I was towards the end of it about one minute in, and looked down to the bar to see another *FOUR MINUTES OF THIS CRAZINESS?!* my brain started to hurt :D Oh come on! I want to throw a wrench at a jeep and make it fly in the air!  Singham is fucking awesome. The action is really over the top, but the story is surprisingly good too. Singham is one of my favourite movies, just because of the insane amount of action. I especially like the scene where he uses a lamp to subdue multiple enemies in a jeep. This is designed to be ridiculously over-the-top tongue-in-cheek right?..

Or do people in India expect action movies to have craziness like this? It's pretty much a standard for them.

/r/bollywoodrealism

http://gfycat.com/CarefreeVariableChrysalis Yeah, it started off that way but lately it seems people just enjoy it more than other movies.

 Press F to wait to get unloaded for 8 hours, then not get paid for it for bullshit reason. Lumper held you up? Sorry bro, that's on them, no detention.

Play Elite: Dangerous. Spacetruck Simulator. And I thought I was cool when I put the submarine in Michaels pool.  I would like to see that To bad they skipped the part where the driver had to get out and do a pre-trip inspection, make sure the door seal was good, raise the landing gear and attach the air lines. /s

Definitely need sunglasses though. I'm a trucker, so I know that there is actually a loophole around that. In most states, the trucker is only responsible for performing the pre-trip inspection if they exit the cab of the truck. Normally, if you pull up to a C-HITCH station, the riggers can perform all the pre-trip inspections for you without you ever having to exit your cab and do it yourself. They just hand you a receipt that you can staple into your logbook in the back. So, technically, if you can find a way to pull up to a station like that, and somehow actuate the H-Latch without ever leaving your cab, you can drive away without even updating you're log book if there is no dock foreman around. Too bad though that none of this is true and I made it all up. I actually read all that and was kind of intrigued than disappointed  I was like "that seems like a pretty strange loophole..." Looks like the trailer wheels are locked up at the end of the gif, and if the trailer was set low enough, the landing gear would be off the ground once the fifth wheel is under the trailer. Totally realistic senario. That's how my truckies drive in cities skyline Really? Mine just sit in traffic because the one lane way is shorter than the 6 lane highway You can manually set roads to not be used by freight But then I can't complain about it on reddit Can't argue with that logic Wait.

Like a glove! I came here looking for an ace Ventura reference. Thank you for delivering. I work control room at a fedex hub and when the unload side calls me to tell me a trailer is finished, I'll relay that info to our switcher along with a new assignment for that door. We have this one switcher who has been doing it for years, he falls asleep out there a lot, but when he is on, he is ON. Many times he has hooked and pulled the trailer, parked it and unhooked, found the trailer I asked for, hooked up to it and put it on door, perfectly straight, ready to go in the span of 30 seconds.

This is how I picture that maneuver. You should show him this. Or send out a company wide email  "Video of John Doe hooking up one of our trailers" Sounds like he spends a lot of time chatting with unload.  Unproductive because he's talking.  Seemingly able to do amazing feats because he knows what he needs to do before you ask him.  Probably knows he a shit worker and uses this to make himself seem more effective, despite management realizing he's an idiot.  I've been that guy.(In different jobs, I don't drift long haulers.) I will never be this cool.  Because you're not a vehicle? When I asked my little brother what he wanted to be when he grew up, he thought about it for a minute and replied: "A fire truck." Naturally, I coaxed: "You mean you want to be a fire man that drives a fire truck?" But he adamantly held on: "No, I want to be a fire truck!" I explained that he couldn't be a truck, but he could be a fireman. And he exploded with: "I WANT TO BE A FIRE TRUCK!"

I work for a trucking company.  Would hire. 10/10 That trailer needs a "deal with it" logo on the side. If somebody dropped the sunglasses on the cab as it picks up the trailer and and had "deal with it" written on the trailer, it just might be the most perfect gif ever known to mankind. Will make when i get home Toledo Drift This should be a scene in the next Fast and Furious film Wish I could do this in real life. Instead, I have to get out once I've backed under the trailer. Get out. Connected the air lines and the pigtail. Ensure the kingpin is locked so when you pull out the trailer doesn't just slide right off. Walk half way down the trailer and raise the trailer legs by rotating this arm that I have no idea what the actual name is. Get back in trailer then drive off. Didn't know you could drift this much with semis  You can totally drift semis, you just need a shitload of power.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT8Eh7BBqOQ Jeremy Clarkson would agree.

POOOWWWEEEERRRR Transformers Tokyo Drift Is this in a mission? I seem to only find trailers that are stationary objects and slightly too low to back the cab into. No. There are a lot of trailers all over the place that you can hook onto. He's in the docks somewhere and there are a lot of trailers there that you can hook onto.

Edit: Upon further inspection, every other trailer you see there is unobtainable. He probably stole the truck and unhooked the trailer there to do this. There are other places near where he is that have trailers that you can get though. In the Port of South Los Santos area, underneath the freeway. I usually just steal the whole truck though. Great...My uncle is a truck driver and he was next to me and saw this.....You're giving this man crazy ideas now. [Gifsound version.](https://gifsound.com/?gifv=zDPzRdj&amp;v=pl57hN4EaLU&amp;s=63) This happened at my old job. The trailer was filled with Apple stuff. Autobots roll out in style. But he drives like a Decepticon. From some one that used to play GTA V a lot, this is actually pretty damn hard to accomplish. +1 Why isn't there sunglasses falling from the sky right before it drives off with the trailer? Didn't look as easy when top gear did this
[https://youtu.be/YtTOQSRMRcM?t=5m36s](https://youtu.be/YtTOQSRMRcM?t=5m36s) Is this a job in the game?  Autobots, transform and roll out! As a Broker for a trucking company, our customers pretty much want our trucks to do this.

Now if only they can get them loaded in time.

Pretty much a "hurry up and wait!" game. I've done this in ETS before  Drift mod, I wanna say. There's no way you got that thing spinning so well. *Yoink* This will be in the Fast and the Furious 8. Looks like the Japanese have been playing GTA A pity we can't do races with truck and trailer. With 30 players, it would be madness. Behind the scenes footage for Furious 9...

I'm about the same age as Vin Diesel so I'd play along just like I drive faster after the current crop of Furious # I haven't ever seen a Fast &amp; Furious movie but I heard they are good for the type of movie they are. The first three were movies about twenty somethings racing cars. The 4th was weird. The last 3 were like James Bond/Oceans 11/Transporter. 

I'd hate the new ones, but they are self aware of how they are cheesy action movies and I'm sure the director fully expects you to be laughing *at* the movie rather than *with* it for a lot of the time. Also, the action scenes are O_O. They're over the top and brilliant and amazing. Don't take them seriously though, everyone involved knows it's a joke. With asteroids and these two brothers have to stop it TWO BROTHERS! All that and it's only called Two Brothers! Wow! You killed it "Furious 9: Shit, we forgot to make Furious 8.."

**Edit:** Okay... everybody saying "what about switch??" and "what about goofy??" - Grand Theft Auto has never been set in a place where the driver's seat was on the right side, nor where you drive on the left side of the road. Therefore, in any way driving an eighteen-wheeler is analogous to skateboarding, **the stance is normal, it's a heelflip, thank you for playing, goodbye.**

**Edit 2:** Yeah, yeah. London 1969. Fine. It doesn't fucking count, though, because it doesn't include true roll rotation (about the longitudinal axis).  His trucks must have been too loose. [sigh..](http://i.imgur.com/sPwgpLj.jpg) In my mind I still make the "ba dum tss" noises.

CYCO VISION I remember when I was really young being shocked that they were playing a song that said "die, die, psycho bitches" When I was young I thought it said "I love psycho bitches!" I've read this over 5 or 6 times now and I'm still completely lost.  [deleted] I knew everything but the Tony Hawk portion, but that was still a great post.  [Barrel roll](https://paladin283.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/remiq-net_8233.jpg) your skateboard? It's called a barrel roll because you make a large circle, as if you're rolling along the inner edge of a barrel. A tight circle is just a roll. Aileron roll if you're in a plane or otherwising using [ailerons](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/alr.gif) to roll. Sort of has to be "axial roll" then doesn't it?  Neither a skateboard nor a semi has ailerons to make that term make any sense. It's a Tony hawk pro skater reference.  He might drive goofy, it could've just been a sloppy kickflip. Saved by the guardrail.

As it should be. The guardrail is the real hero of this gif. Fun fact: My great grandfather invented the modern guardrail. For realsies.  You're a random person on the internet of course I believe you! When did he invent it? Patent was filed in 1933.

http://www.google.com/patents/US1989763

Now I expect someone to come in to say, "Actually it was invented by a Swedish guy 5 years earlier!" "Actually it was invented by a Swedish guy 5 years earlier!"

Edit: For meeting my expectations.  That edit made me think you were my wife.  Hello Mr. biggbuckz Mcfarland. You may be alive today becuase of those inventions of your grandfather. Saved many lives. He must be loaded from all the royalties he get.  Well, he's super dead now. But he was super rich. I never learned if he was rich already before the invention though. dude, please do an AMA i'm so baked that the history of they guy who invented the guardrail is like, the most interesting thing right now Lol. I never met the guy. He was an Irish immigrant who somehow made it out to Kansas City, MO, and made a few inventions, most notably the guard rail. He was super rich, and I'm pretty sure it was from guard rail money, but not 100% sure. I am not super rich. I don't believe you. Your name suggests you're totally super rich.  Ha, that is true. It's my rap name, obviously. So THAT'S why my Package is so fucked up. I ordered protein shakes. Would use delivery service again.  They shook it so well I didn't even need to drink it, I just snorted it. Oh, so this is what I'm going to try for 6-8 hours after work tonight. What if you nail it after 30 minutes? Porn. and the 5 hours and 28 minutes after that? It takes a little longer than 2 minutes to settle on what video to watch....  Not if you looked earlier and had more than a few to watch. Variety's the spice of life. I like a wide selection. Sometimes I'm in the mood for nasty close-ups, sometimes I like them arty and air-brushed. Sometimes it's a spread brown-eye kind of night, sometimes it's girl-on-girl time. Sometimes a steamy letter will do, sometimes - not often, but sometimes - I like the idea of a chick with a horse. This kills the chicken. You, sir, are a very eclectic porn viewer. I usually just stick with facial montages or as I like to call'em, first person shooters. &gt;first person shooters

Also, "I'm so glad FedEx is really following safety precautions on that load of hard drives I ordered." &gt; STUNT JUMP FAILED

Fuck you, GTA! Jump failed He--He did a barrel roll?  Fucking aces! Nah, it was an aileron roll. A barrell roll would have been way more impressive though. I was waiting for someone to point this out. But a truck doesn't have ailerons... It doesn't have barrels either.

Boom. Scienced. Jesus shit, your name is the most subtle Star Trek reference I've ever seen. Maybe the most subtle nerd reference I've seen. I mean, damn. 

So...how ARE they used?  Very good point...longitudinal axis roll then? &gt; aileron roll

as in pitch, yaw, roll

roll is always in the longitudinal axis Convenient ending side-fence Do a barrel roll! http://www.reddit.com/r/GTAV/comments/36m39p/semi_truck_corkscrew_jump/

 Pretty bad ass! I couldn't even land that in a panto.  Nicely done! I gotta try that. Look at Optimus Prime. Used guardrail to stick the landing, I can only give it a 6.5. Pardon my inexperience but is there a way to improve car control in the offline game? I always see people with such good control like this but when I jump a car it moves much slower when controlling it midair. I also only play casually once in a great while so I may just be missing something.  My life is complete fuck me dude Canadian judge here - 9.5 -
Would have been a 10, but he didn't stick the landing.
Very impressive. Gives the term "damaged in transit" a whole new meaning. VIRAL MARLETING Them Duke Boys are in it thicker then a june bug in mollassis. And its mighty sticky mollassis. Optimus had to save Sam. Oh man, piss jugs must be flying everywhere in the cab. 8/10 didn't stick the landing. Meanwhile, I can barely turn left without crashing into 4 cars -_- sik bruv So majestic  The ending was perfect. "Hancock mode: off" Reminded me of Saints Row 4.
Someone needs to make a Saints Row superpower mod. I've JUST started playing SR4 . Did you play 3? Personally I thought it was much better. hmm i actually liked 4 better than 3. i really got lost in the story and didnt what i was doing or why i was doing it. but maybe i just loved being OP on 4. I like Red Dead Redemption. I like turtles. I like trains. 3 was better than 4 and 2 was better than 3 I thought 3 was better than 2 and 4.  i thought 2 was better than 3. i know most people don't play sr for the storyline, but come on, they killed off the fucking best character in 3 and the other characters are opposites of who they were in the previous game. also, they knew by sr3 that they had something going with the unrealistic, wacky shit that happened in 2. but it felt like in 3 they were just like fuck it, lets just put the most random absurd shit possible in this game. one minute im in a tron video game, next minute im on another planet... i know that a lot of people liked the game for just that reason, but that's where it lost me I see your point, but i disagree. Saints Row 3 was when they stepped out of the shadow of GTA and found themselves. It is idiotic and over the top, and that is why I love it. There is no need for GTA clones since we already have GTA. They stepped out of it with 2. 3 was just more of the same, but 4 jumped into Crackdown territory. I liked it, but it's a completely different game to 2. Like Crackdown, vehicles are completely pointless, and that was a shame. But 4 brings him back i should probably add that i havent played 4 It's soooo fun. I didn't think I'd like it because I wasn't a fan of GTA. Ended up loving it.


aaaaand now I'm playing GTA V with friends online. that game was fun throughout, and then I got to the ending and the transformers animated movie easter egg. that's when I decided I loved the game. Saint's Row is a mod by itself *Pfft.*

"Monkey Butt" "Chimpanzee Butt", but who's counting? I was hoping for a WASTED though. That was the moment he got banned That'd be pretty funny to add at the end.  Just the banned screen. In the same format as the "Wasted" screen but with "Banned" This is from Rockstargames.com

&gt;We have always appreciated the creative efforts of the PC modding community and we still fondly remember the awesome zombie invasion mod and original GTA map mod for GTAIV PC among many other classics. To be clear, the modding policy in our license has not changed and is the same as for GTAIV. Recent updates to GTAV PC had an unintended effect of making unplayable certain single player modifications. This was not intentional, no one has been banned for using single player modifications, and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player PC mods. Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage, disrupt gameplay, or cause griefing. It also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized, they may be broken by technical updates, cause instability, or affect your game in other unforeseen ways.



So if you're online, not good. Otherwise do what ever you want. 

I've seen a few comments here pointing out that banning is happening to modders. A bit of research seems to bring this up straight away from an official source. If anyone has any evidence that this is not the case, speak up.

And let's not perpetuate a myth that modding is problematic, especially for this game!

Something has gone terribly wrong with your copy/paste job I thought I was having a stroke...

Half way through reading it I felt like it was duplicating in some way. Reformat this information so it doesn't repeat itself, then TELL THE WORLD!

I just don't have the time to do it again but I'm willing to share resources/sound files if anyone wants the project.  When he time travels does he end up in the Red Dead Redemption world?

 This was one of the best mods ever made.  The only thing I want from a mod is a Delorean I don't even need it to be one with a flux capacitor just gull wings.  How'd you manage the time travel piece? Scramble locations of all the NPCs and units to make it appear like you did? What the technobabble? Didn't you watch the clip? He included a flux capacitor is in the "full interior modelling", that's how. Some people... Someone really needs to link this up to GtaV, RDR, and LA Noire, so you can seemlessly travel from one game to another with the Delorean.  This is the coolest thing I've ever seen. It just hit me, what if they mod the gun to shoot planes too? That way you'd be able to shoot into the air, unlike the car gun. That's a pretty good idea. I'd prefer that it just shoot cars into the air like a howitzer. There's a Gravity Gun mod that allows you to do that.  I don't think he is saying "I want it to pick up cars and fling it."   I think he's saying "I want it to shoot ~~guns~~ car-like bullets into the air at helicopters.

WHICH IS AWESOME! -Torque That's... what I thought was going to happen. How about if you shoot planes into buildings? You'll need to add some jet fuel to melt the dank memes Steel beams can't melt dank memes Jet vaccines can't melt steel autism 9/11 Nice Dank Meme. 9/11 was a part-time job. 9/11 DLC? if a car can 'jump' into the air, then why can't it be launched from a tiny tiny ramp at the end of the firearm? The gun isn't shooting cars, the gun just has explosive bullets, and the same key is bound to fire cars.  This modder didn't shoot for the stars like your aspirations. Fly young modder, fly! It's lame that bullet cars can only be shot at ground level.   thats because these mods are just made quickly and never to be worked on again.... better mods are on the horizon Make one shoot little crop dusters that come out with random steering inputs. How about one that shoots Franklin's dog, "Chop". fuck that I want one that shoots Trevors who curse the whole time. Goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-good lo^rd above!

 That was an amazing level of thought put into camera angles, damn. With a clown suit on you can't see his weird monkey ass. Maybe assless monkey chaps?  Methinks your standards are too low if you think being a monkey and swapping bullets for cars are the peak of modding. This isn't anything near what's going to happen in the coming months.

This is just barely reaching Saints Row IV in terms of ludicrousness. Just remember, just because you **can**, doesn't mean you **should**.

http://youtu.be/mCY8m4PIjkM I can't be the only one who stared at the monkey's bare ass when he was flying, or am I? I have received a lot of "Dat ass" comments. I lost it when he took off flying. 

Can't wait to see what else they come up with in the future. prototype mode enabled There needs to be an Alex Mercer mod! It actually says "Hancock Mode: Activated" The take off was so natural.  Would love a superman version. Please tell me there are more videos like this. I love to watch crazy shit in gta v. Well I could try to make some more I guess. do! hahahahahaha, congrats, what mods were being utilized here? You may have just persuaded me to buy this game In this video you see 

1.  [Native Trainer](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/native-trainer-w-north-yankton-loader) for the monkey skin, infinite ammo/health, and explosive bullets

2.  [Vehicle Cannon Mod](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/vehicle-cannon-mod) which is obvious

3.  [Simple Health Bar](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/simple-healthbar) to show enemy health

4.  [Nice Fly](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/nice-fly) for the Hancock flying.

5.  [Show Coordinates](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/show-coordinates) which you might have noticed on the bottom left. DAMMIT, SLIPPIN JIMMY Not even Chuck could have predicted this Fuck that guy.  /r/fuckchuck Damn there's a sub for everything, amazing.  You don't give a monkey a machine gun... that shoots motherfuckin cars. [deleted] Haha, casual racism. Planet of the fucking Apes up in this.  As a longtime hardcore console gamer, I'm watching this like "what's the point? This looks so stupid." I don't get the appeal. Why not just playing the game the normal way? 

Then the ape started flying. Now I want a gaming computer.  Out of all the things you can do, all the ridiculous, insane, beautifully brain damaged things, a flying mod is what makes you want a PC. Ceasar!? [Splat](http://i.imgur.com/NKfmikE.jpg) This right here is the answer to the Fermi paradox. One can only imagine the sort of impressive fully immersive simulations advanced civilizations have. They'll want nothing to do with reality. It's just like Saints Row I was running around in GTA Online and some dude named Monkey joined the game, had this same skin, threw bananas at everything, turns his car bright yellow with the license plate: Hax and grunted and yelled like a monkey on voice comms.

10/10 10/10 would get banned again  1. Will this get you banned? Edit: No, not if it's single player
2. Can you still earn steam achievements
 I believe you can get achievements.  The game has no idea what mods are. Can you imagine how awesome an open world rockstar game would be with super powers??? haha reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxMMrPoBq0M) They certainly came a long way from just skinning cars and changing their speed and sound in GTA iii. Planet of the Apes has gotten a little far-fetched... I guess i gotta save up for a damn pc now You can run gta on decent settings for only like $500 Not God.
 
^^^^^^^grodd. I thought the thumbnail was a military jet. I kept waiting for a military jet. Meanwhile, somewhere in Liberty City, Iron Man is banging a giraffe. You've modded yourself a chimpanzee but no banana gun?! I'm waiting for a mod with frickin laser beams attached to sharks heads It's extremely impressive how the frame rate stays so constant with those cars being shot. [Remember negative friction for tires?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifTIuA8Dq58) Caesar is home This is me lucid dreaming. Moddable GTAV will always be wackier, more original and more over the top than any saint row game could ever hope to be. 

Rockstar wins forever. kinda shocked they are going crazy with the mod bans.    This is the best form of advertisement ever.   I have GTA5 already on PS4 and would buy it on PC just for this kinda fun baltimore really got out of hand So, they've effectively modded GTA5 into Saints Row 4? This was probably the funniest GTA clip I've ever seen. Then my goal is complete, thank you. What a time to be alive. That was beautiful. So how does one accomplish such a thing?  Is there a main resource for it like nexus mods?  Are there still hoops to jump through to not get banned for doing this on single player?

This looks so damn fun. In this video you see 

1.  [Native Trainer](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/native-trainer-w-north-yankton-loader) for the monkey skin, infinite ammo/health, and explosive bullets

5.  [Show Coordinates](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/show-coordinates) which you might have noticed on the bottom left. Just Cause 3 is looking good. What amazes me about GTA V is that it can so modable/replayable, and yet at the same time it features one of the best single player experiences in years. To me it is without a doubt the best overall game to come out in the past 3-4 years.  I am typically a PC gamer, but I bought GTA day one for PS3. 

I played it. I loved it. I finished the story.

I saw no reason to get the PC version when it was finally released.

**I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE WRONG IN MY LIFE.** Oh wow so zany and random Holy shit. Can you remind me why we need saints row? omg. how awesome would a hulk mod be. that jump really made me think hulk!!! xDD I used to do ALL of these things in Second Life. I wonder if the people who work for him will from now on be known as the Koopa Troop.  No, but his security guards will wear brown berets.  And dance to elevator music And die when you jump on their heads. I'd imagine that most people would We need to Mythbusters this. Mythbuster: *So we got a pumpkin, jumped on it, and it was AWESOME...*

Short pause, show slow-mo footage of pumpkin being stomped.

Mythbuster: *...but it's not really the hardness of a human head, so we're going to try something a little different.*

Cue narrator: *It's time to get scientific!*

Show sped-up footage of the Mythbusters making an elaborate rig with narrator talking over it.

Narrator: *In order to get the most accurate results, the mythbusters are going to [insert overcomplicated nonsense here].*

Mythbuster: *So after 1,000 hours of work, we were finally able to make a replica of what it would really be like for a human head to get stomped, considering factors such as the weight of the average italian plumber who's eaten about 1 too many slices of cake.*

Cue funny mario-esque bloop sound.

Narrator: *And the results?*

Show results from multiple angles, then a slow-mo shot with the narrator explaining it again.

Narrator: *Looks like there's just no contest. The blunt force trauma would kill most human beings.*

Mythbuster: *So yeah. We found out there's just no way to survive that kind of impact. And even if you did survive, you'd be hospitalized for months. Don't stomp on people's heads at home kids!*

Cue Mythbusters stinger music, fade to commercial.

^Edit: ^((Fixed some spelling mistakes)^) You should work for discovery channel. No, he should work for me, I've already got so many ideas. We'll call it- *holds hands up* -"Mythfuckers." No, he should work for Doug Bowser Amazing. I could picture it completely ...Where's my pizza? I'll invite you to the party. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQy-eJALZI0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=195 Too soon. We all know exactly how the selection process went...

"So we've got this guy... he's an unbelievable fit for the job."

"GUYS! Check out *this* rsum. Dude's name is *"Bowser!"*

"We're done here." The Vice pres of *sales* no less! Dude's last name is fucking Copyrighted!!! I wonder what his non-compete agreement looks like. Not allowed to work in another castle. There is a strict 3 strikes policy on his contract. Voided only when dropped in lava. No axe in his office No kidnapped princesses in the back room of his office you know damn well he's gonna ignore that one. Last time a Bowser kidnapped a princess it made Nintendo quite a bit of money. Mario and Luigi seem a bit concerned about their situation, though.   He should really make sure to cover up that lever in the back of his office though. It's an axe, Mario cuts the chain holding up the bridge Which begs the question of why Browser had an axe there. Or how Mario can swing an axe by stomping on it. Or what kind of axe can cut a heavy chain capable of supporting a bridge with a multi-ton turtle standing on it. Wow. 15 years of playing Mario and I had no idea. 15 years? Get off my lawn. or like 20 fireballs Subtleness too strong. Cannot detect reference. Help requested. You have to hit the boss 3 times before he is defeated. Instructions unclear. Fired and charged with assault and battery. :( Guess I'm too old school to immediately get the reference, but I see it now. 

I would have been more likely to respond to "Not allowed to work in another castle" with *or he'd get the axe.*

**EDIT:** TIL that I've been fighting Bowser wrong for over two decades. Apparently you can kill him by shooting him with fireballs in the NES version of Super Mario Bros.... It has been sets of 3 hits since the original super Mario Bros &gt;  Apparently you can kill him by shooting him with 3 fireballs in the NES version of Super Mario Bros....

The last horse finally crosses the finish line. I beat SMB for the first time in 1987, at the age of 5. I have *never* beaten Bowser with fireballs. I didn't know it was possible. this...this is good Good luck serving the guy a subpoena if he decides to go do that.  Process server will be all over the mushroom kingdom, probably never get past that flying pirate ship thing. That ship is just a jurisdictionary nightmare What about the flying pirate ship thing *filled with coins*?? What if Mario is a process server disguised as a plumber? It all makes sense now. It would explain why Peach keeps getting kidnapped. She's bait, yo.
 Damn. OP is on point. Honestly, this was funnier than the pic you posted -- good stuff mang.  He was applying for a janitorial position. "So I work for you and don't have to get a name change?  Well that's a pretty good deal" You're thinking of trademark, you can't get copyright on a single word. Can't sue them? Hire them! In Japan, his name is Doug King Koopa. In compton they call him King Kunta Bitch where you when I was walkin Now I run the game got the whole world talking WHAT'S THE YAMS? The yam is the power that be / You can smell it when I'm walking down the street Oh yes you can I can dig rappin' / But a rapper with a ghost writer? What the fuck happened? / I swore I wouldn't tell / But most of y'all sharing bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell A TWO MAN CELL The yams brought it out of Richard Pryor. 24/7, 365 days times two, I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage / Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy and say YOU GOLD MOUTH MAMMOTH FUCKER Everyone want to cut the legs off him Or Toby.  King Koopa, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

Koopa, Nintendo takin' no losses In Denmark too! Wasn't that only in the old cartoons though? My grandma had them on VHS and I only remember him being referred to as King Koopa in those Wait, is he called King Koopa and not Bowser in Denmark?! How have I never known this! We always called him King Koopa growing up in New York. I remember learning that his name was Bowser after that. Koopalings hed Koopaungerne p dansk! Sure, what he said. I'm pretty sure that's the only reason why Marc Webb directed Spiderman His cousin, Sam Wario, is a safe bet to be the new Chief Finance Officer. Waaahhh!!! Rrrriiiiioooooooo. And when he is laid off, it puts a whole new meaning of being "axed".

And lest not forget the MOST IMPORTANT piece of information! We now know King Bowser's first first name! His name is Doug Bowser. His name is Doug Bowser. His name is doug bowser *His* name is Doug Bowser. His name is Doug Bowser His name is Doug Bowser. His name is Doogie howser. His name is Rob Schneider He's about to learn that being a tyrannical ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom.. is harder than it looks! His name is Doug Bowser. His name is Doug Bowser.  You mean "shellection" process. Completely overlooking the fact he came from EA and that people hate the sales techniques EA has adopted. 

:/ Konami has also just hired a new VP of sales, Patrick Liquidsnake Do all of their business presentations get progressively longer, and make less and less sense? Considering the recent news, I would have to say yes. I'm a bit out of loop here. Recent news? http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2015/03/19/konami-cuts-hideo-kojima-from-metal-gear-promo-materials/

That's not the most recent piece of news, but it gives a taste of how things are going weird there. Silent Hills cancelled, PT removed from PS store, Kojima "fired"/let go, and focusing more on the gambling industry than gaming Holy shit, nooo. im so fucking bummed. I was so excited for silent hills No need to hire new people. Just change the President's title to Big Boss. I live on through this arm...chair in my executive office.  That's nice and all but Capcom's new CFO, Mr. Michael ResidentEvilTwo, is a true visionary in gaming. They didn't hire Dr. Wily? &gt;Bowser comes from Electronic Arts

Well THAT explains a lot Guys, can't we just give him a chance? It's not like he was involved *directly* with EA's stupid decisions,

If he somehow ruins Nintendo, we can say that

"If you enter EA, you leave EA'd" He was joking about how ea is bowser.... The bad guy. Nothing to do with the actual person. It was a joke lol.  Ha. It must be fun to work for nintendo...and be named Bowser. Except for everyone always trying to undermine and defeat him, probably. Lets just hope theres no bridges over lava in his office! He should be fine as long as he keeps conveniently placed axes out of his office. That thing was an axe! My entire life I thought it was a wind up thing for toys.  Wow...  Think about it.  You jump on it, and suddenly the bridge collapses?  Mario grabs the axe and cuts the ropes holding the bridge up

^^I ^^also ^^thought ^^it ^^was ^^a ^^wind-up ^^toy ^^too, ^^don't ^^feel ^^bad I just thought it was a switch... I was not a creative kid.  Incidentally, New Super Mario Bros. U's final fight made you jump on a button that caused an axe next to it to swing.  I can't remember any other recent games that actually had an axe present, rather than just a generic button. Maybe it was a lever just in the shape of an axe? The lever would activate the bridge closing. And doesn't jump too much or too high.  No glass ceiling for him, just a bunch of pointy steel spikes. That game has been a familiar part of my life for nearly 30 years and I am only just now realizing that thing is supposed to be an axe.  It makes so much sense now! It makes even less sense for me.  Axes make bridges disappear, duh!  You ever wonder why there aren't axes around bridges?  It's for your safety.  Look around the next time you're crossing a bridge...  Won't find an axe I pretty much guarantee, and the bridge won't disappear either.  Ergo, vis-a-vis concordently.   Mario uses the axe to cut the little ripe holding up the bridge (just Google Mario axe for a picture). They just didn't animate it. Agreed. Why would removing an axe make the bridge go down? Who, while building the castle, thought this was a good idea? It's a load-bearing axe. you don't remove the axe to make the bridge go down, you use the axe to cut the chain! [Looking at an image of it, I understand now](http://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/d/db/AxHitKeep.png/180px-AxHitKeep.png) If I was him just to play in this I would carpet my office in red with a strip of gray leading to my desk and an axe 8 bit style like those mine craft toys would hang on 3 wall behind me His office should have a red carpet with a long wood textured rug from the door to his desk. I'd have already become President if it weren't for these pesky plumbers... And their little dinosaur. So long gay bowser! His company car is the clown copter  He drives [this](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/fantendo/images/5/50/Double-Dash-Karts-mario-kart-bowser.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130529184928). It's only 1 guy working against him. (Luigi doesn't count we all know that). He probably has a bunch of underlings who are willing to sacrifice themselves for him. All of Mushroom Kingdom pretty much thinks he's a dick, at least. What you got against Luigi man? You're the younger sibling, aren't you? Clearly, he is a person who has never known the privilege of being the elder sibling and therefore player 1 by default. First choice of character and controller or else face swirlies/nugies/wedgies.

#no regrets. "MOOOMMM Andy won't let me be player 1!!!"

Mom: *why the hell did I buy that thing* Hah, in our house it was a "dying = next person's turn" houserule.

sibling: "MOOOOOOOOOOOOOM HE WON'T DIE"

mom: "Goddammit Zircon88 just die and let your brother/sister play already"

me: *cartman voice* BUT MEEEEEEEEEEEEHM Luigi has infinitely more personality and is much more relatable than Mario.  Who wouldn't be afraid of going after killer turtles and mushroom creatures?

Also, Luigi's traits in the games where he differs from Mario make him the better brother.  His increased jump height is much more useful than Mario's traction; I've never had a death in any Mario game, when playing as Luigi, where I've said "Man, Mario would have been much better for that level." He has Wendy, Morton, Lemmy, Larry, Iggy, Ludwig, and Roy working directly beneath him. Never gets invited to office parties... You seem to forget all the spin-off games. Oh I get it, he's tying up the merchandise so only scalpers can have the four others in production. Why do you suppose he is hired as Vice President of **Sales**? You can't spell "scalpers" without "sales." Diabolical.  Bowser has used his ability to get along With Mario in games like Mario Kart to his advantage.  Mario let him walk right into the heart of Nintendo of America and put him in the VP of Sales position.  He is going to attempt to destroy the company from the inside.   Retailer-exclusive amiibo was his idea. The monster. Luigi and Mario captured? Princess Peach game, confirmed? If she's as badass as she is in Smash, I'd play it. Pulling Toad out from under my dress and using him as a meatshield really resonates with me. A princess storing a little man under her dress at all times really resonates with me. Co-op splitscreen mode has now also been confirmed! First time I'd jump at being player 2. I hope P2 would be Daisy and not some terrifying version of "under the dress" Toad that you could control. I mean...that'd be a different game, for sure. ...oh, that's the game I'm looking for. If you're serious, I think we'll be good friends.

If you're kidding, I think we'll be good friends once I come down from this energy drink high.

If there is a 3rd option, let's also do that. Friends it is. Sweet. [Let's hit the craps table or play some D&amp;D](http://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/7/73/PeachDaisy_MP9.png/250px-PeachDaisy_MP9.png). That already happened This guy has a good sence of humor about his name and were he works. Those dolls made me laugh. If he _truly_ had a good sense of humor, he'd establish some trust over a few years, and then try to ruin the company. 

And! Imagine if an aging Miyamoto is the only one who tries to fight back. It will go down in Nintendo history as company folklore.  "I was there during the Nintendo war... Bowser made his move, he was going to take over the entire company, we fought him mercilessly, until our current president, Doug Mario appeared in the bathroom and took that evil crowned VP down..." pfft, everyone knows Mario's first name is "Mia". He says it all the time. Ugh.. you're really going to make me do this? 

[It's mario.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ydBkyCXfao) Mario Mario and Luigi Mario I guess Luigi's first name is "Ah" Was Bowser his given name or did he change it for the job? I've seen the last name a couple times, it's not common but it is an actual name. Come on.  His name is not Warrio. What if this is some giant ploy. This man will begin work as a nice new VP. Then he will begin to gain more and more power. His new found power begins to create a totalitarian regime within Nintendo America. In a mad dash to escape some employees try and leave through the sewage pipes and get stuck. To fix the problem, a plumber is called. His name? Mario. He will bring salvation to Nintendo by working through the shit heap that is modern gaming.  Do you really think modern gaming is that bad?  Not really. Just tried to make it sound dramatic.  Idk man, shit heaps are pretty chill. As a guy who loves creative 2D games, I think it's better than ever.  Oh. My. God!  

A DRY BONES TEDDY!  If Luigi ever gets himself untied, his death stare is going to be *vicious*. Super Peach World Wii u Confirmed I'm predicting Year of Bowser. Would this mean getting to play as Bowser in the latest version of New Super Mario Bros? Because I'm way down with that. I'm fucking ready I want to play as Bowser. Sign me up, he was my favorite character in Super Paper Mario on the Wii. I would love some Bowser games. A 3D Bowser platformer with him as the star would be great. His shell spin would make for cool jump mechanics, and because of his size they could switch super mushrooms with mini mushrooms. Peach teamed up with Daisy.

Make it a JRPG in the style of Super Mario RPG, Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga, Bowser's Inside Story, etc. &gt;Peach teamed up with Daisy

*zip......* Ned Wario was pissed that he got passed over for this job. The stairs leading up to his office must be a nightmare. Nepotism everywhere.

bullshit, i say! 1. Guys name is Bowser.
2. Has Mario and Luigi tied up on shelf.
3. Nintendo may be turning evil. So where is the princess, Bowser? Which castle is it? Getting this job was part of the ransom for kidnapping her. Why do you think he is smilling? When I tried to run away from home as a kid I got stuck in counseling.  Dr's name was Bowser. He had Mario stuffed toys all over his office. All I can remember is he really liked to talk about Super Mario brothers. Can you point on the Mario doll where he touched you? Lol. No. Truth is, I ran away because my stepfather threw me against the wall for saying freaking. Like " thats freaking stupid". Apparently I was substituting freaking for "fucking". For those who dont see it right away...

Look at the Mario and Luigi dolls on the shelf. Tied up with a GCN controller. The Wii controllers weren't cutting it out. So long, big Bowser! It always sounded like "So long gay bowser" to me When it comes to selling Nintendo, that guy is the final boss. wonder where the princess peach doll is?  
wonder why the picture is cropped from the waist up? Finish doctorate, legally change last name to Robotnik, something... Profit! i feel like soon enough this https://youtu.be/fINtdz0Uc3k is gonna be this dude's life. I wonder what Browser he prefers.

 I'm feeling a new storyline here! :D

"Sorry peach, your princess is in another castle!" Should have been peach Hopefully there's an Italian maintenance man named Mario and one day he'll become the VP of sales. Man Mario and Luigi being tied up together to a Nintendo product is pretty symbolic... [I like his old look better...](http://i69.servimg.com/u/f69/16/09/70/40/clipbo89.jpg) [deleted] They had a hard time finding an actual fire-breathing Koopa. Is today yesterday? Could of sworn I saw this posted in games just yesterday. Happy May 20th! /r/conspiracy I was expecting a princess I like him already! They sell all that stuff at the company store. Why does Mario have a brown mullet? Well at least he brought his son to work. 1. Hire Bowser 2. Let the PR flow 3. Increase sales in May 4. Cut him a fat check....when he lets Mario and Luigi go, think of the kids man....the kids maaaannnn! Does anyone else have an uneasy feeling about this?  I want to tell Nintendo,"This is a trap, don't hire this guy!" I'm sure he's fine. There's probably a large pile of hay just outside of the picture You were right. [Here's the full picture.](http://i.imgur.com/n0xN9tQ.jpg) http://i.imgur.com/77ufNqS.jpg I wish people would title the game when posing screenshots on this sub, we haven't all played every game.

edit; sweet AC easter egg though, whatever game that is. The Witcher 2 I can't even run the original Might be time for a new toaster! Frakking toasters! hey youre insulting my brothers!!! Please, continue. I like life. SKINJOBS! Not played every game? Are you some kind of casual? it was Paul Blart Castle Mall Defence 2 I'd... I'd play that. As soon as someone posts what game this is I'm going to think about maybe playing it at some point...Probably  This is oddly really comforting. We should save on emergency exits and fire escapes by just going back to installing piles of hay at the base of all skyscrapers. What would the horses eat?? emergency exits A win-win! If the horses eat the emergency exits, how will the fire escape? If not, he'd only lose like 3 bars of health. desynchronization imminent ...that he'll miss even though I DEFINITELY AIMED RIGHT FOR IT!!! am I the only one that thinks that girl is in a pretty sketchy place as well?  I feel like she's just blocking his way.

"Can you move please? I want to get back."

"No." Same story every time. Some stupid NPC blocking the damn entrance/exit.
