As simple as it sounds, it's a lot more than just \"wanting to be like someone else\", the Albert Scheffler Effect causes us to take a cognitive approach to an otherwise basic need, social acceptance. By observing the behaviors of successful or socially popular people, it becomes a natural inclination to imitate them for social acceptance, and therefore a higher survival rate. This ultimately leads to a group recreating successful behaviors and rejecting unsuccessful ones.

The light beams are arranged with one set on the starting line, and another set 7 inches behind it.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/h4oQwKm.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Drag_racing_christmas_tree.jpg) - *Pre-2011 drag racing christmas tree as currently in use on the Curacao International Raceway*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Drag ^racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_racing) ^| [^Dragstrip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragstrip) ^| [^Glossary ^of ^motorsport ^terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_motorsport_terms) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+crg3g7m) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+crg3g7m)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "score": 5, "created": 1432188130.0},{"body": "me likey.", "gilded": 0, "score": 3, "created": 1432188880.0},{"body": "It's a bridge over the Chicago river, and they do have to raise the bridges sometimes for boats to pass underneath, so I imagine it's for that.

This theory, proposed by [T.A. Witten Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Witten) and L.M. Sander in 1981,  is applicable to aggregation in any system where [diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion) is the primary means of [transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_phenomena) in the system. DLA can be observed in many systems such as electrodeposition, [Hele-Shaw flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hele-Shaw_flow), mineral deposits, and [dielectric breakdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_breakdown).\n\n&gt;The clusters formed in DLA processes are referred to as [Brownian trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_tree). These clusters are an example of a [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal). In 2-D these [fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractals) exhibit a dimension of approximately 1.71 for free particles that are unrestricted by a lattice, however computer simulation of DLA on a lattice will change the [fractal dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension) slightly for a DLA in the same [embedding dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_dimension). Some variations are also observed depending on the geometry of the growth, whether it be from a single point radially outward or from a plane or line for example. Two examples of aggregates generated using a microcomputer by allowing [random walkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) to adhere to an aggregate (originally (i) a straight line consisting 1300 particles and (ii) one particle at center) are shown on the right.\n\n&gt;Computer simulation of DLA is one of the primary means of studying this model. Several methods are available to accomplish this. Simulations can be done on a lattice of any desired geometry of [embedding dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_dimension), in fact this has been done in up to 8 dimensions,  or the simulation can be done more along the lines of a standard molecular dynamics simulation where a particle is allowed to freely random walk until it gets within a certain critical range at which time it is pulled onto the cluster. Of critical importance is that the number of particles undergoing Brownian motion in the system is kept very low so that only the diffusive nature of the system is present.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/2G4atQF.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DLA_Cluster.JPG) - *A DLA cluster grown from a copper sulfate solution in an electrodeposition cell*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Dielectric ^breakdown ^model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_breakdown_model) ^| [^Brownian ^tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_tree) ^| [^David ^A. ^Weitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Weitz) ^| [^Random ^tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_tree) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+crfh9fg) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+crfh9fg)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "score": 2, "created": 1432146901.0},{"body": "I think you're looking for /r/interestingasfuck.", "gilded": 0, "score": 2, "created": 1432147888.0},{"body": "http://reactiongif.org/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/GIF-clint-eastwood-happy-interested-pleased-satisfied-yes-GIF.gif", "gilded": 0, "score": 2, "created": 1432102847.0},{"body": "reminds me of the veins on my nutsack", "gilded": 0, "score": 2, "created": 1432121721.0},{"body": "THOR HAS RETURNED, leaving me no chance with Natalie Portman. :(", "gilded": 0, "score": 2, "created": 1432102091.0},{"body": "The probability of having lightning AND hitting a hole in one?  \n  \nhttp://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2013/10/tim-and-eric-mind-blown.gif", "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "created": 1432122348.0},{"body": "I wonder if [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/2f9mv7/golfball_hit_by_lightning/) is what the ball looked like", "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "created": 1432122707.0},{"body": "It's called a [Lichtenberg figure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichtenberg_figure).", "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "created": 1432122722.0},{"body": "#####&amp;#009;\n\n######&amp;#009;\n\n####&amp;#009;\n [**Lichtenberg figure**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichtenberg%20figure): [](#sfw) \n\n---\n\n&gt;__Lichtenberg figures__ (*Lichtenberg-Figuren* (German), or \"Lichtenberg dust figures\") are branching [electric discharges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_discharge) that sometimes appear on the surface or in the interior of [insulating materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_insulation).

It was devised by the [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark) [Situationist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationist_International) [Asger Jorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asger_Jorn) to explain his notion of [triolectics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivalent_logic), his refinement on the [Marxian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx) concept of [dialectics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectics), as well as to disrupt one's everyday idea of football. Played on a [hexagonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon) pitch [(http://aaa.t0.or.at/images/feld.jpg), the game can be adapted for similarity to [soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_(soccer\\)) as well as other versions of football.\n\n&gt;Unlike in conventional football, where the winner is determined by the highest scoring of the two teams, no score is kept of the goals which a team scores, but conversely a count is taken of the number of goals conceded and the winning team is that which concedes the fewest goals. The game purports to deconstruct the confrontational and bi-polar nature of conventional football as an analogy of class struggle in which the referee stands as a signifier of the state and media apparatus, posturing as a neutral arbitrator in the political process of ongoing class struggle.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/HnlBV4T.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Three_sided_football_pitch.svg) - *Diagram of a three sided football pitch.

Staying at Motel 6, and other chains pursuing similar policies, now includes a hidden guilty-until-proven innocent background check that puts ordinary travelers one step away from a call to police. \n\nCue the predictable excuses: \u201cIf you aren\u2019t doing anything wrong, you have nothing to hide.\u201d\n\nOf course, virtually the same thing has been going on between the NSA and Internet/telecommunications companies, with the latter willingly handing over data on its customers for intelligence processing at the expense of individual civil rights and customer trust.\n\nWhile this type of pre-crime screening for authorization may seem like a worthwhile way to flush out criminals, but the acceptance of the guilty-until-proven mindset is allowing this to pop up with lists operating throughout society as \u201cdo not fly\u201d lists do with airports.\n\nAnd despite what you may be thinking, not everyone on these lists is actually a criminal, potential terrorists or offender. In fact, there is way too much room for abuse and political tyranny. With enough time to blossom, these data lists will make second class citizens out of large sectors of the population.\n\nIn the decade following 9/11, countless news reports surfaced about people with clean records being barred from travel because their name matches or is similar to an actual suspect.
