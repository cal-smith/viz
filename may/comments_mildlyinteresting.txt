Now this is some quality "forgot your phone - bathroom reading material" I've come full circle, looking at the picture of the back of toothpaste on my phone while in the bathroom.  Literally the essence of this sub Coming full circle is a different sub.  DAE COMCAST?

Edit: Sanders4prez An upstroke for you kind gentlesir. *tips m'foreskin*  ew I just realized I'm doing the same thing too. I'm here for the bathroom phone party  Poop poop!

Coming through. Came so close, but decided to take laptop with me instead to let the phone charge. i remember the times before smartphones...

just shit. Forgot my phone at my desk when I went to take a paid-time-poop and it was the most awkward 6 minutes of my life. I just sat there thinking about what I'm doing, how everyone does this, and how many butts have been on this seat. It wasn't pleasant in the least.  I never take my phone when I paid-time-poop. It's nice to clear my head, and not have to worry about dropping my phone in poop or anything. Anything I've ever thought of posting to /r/Showerthoughts is really a "work bathroom" thought.

I just try not to think about how many butts have been on the seat. Helluva lot better than reading the back of the cereal box at breakfast. Helluva lot better than reading the back of the cereal box in the bathroom.

 debatable Even more so because he had his phone to tame the photo!  Good thing too, because that photo was starting to get out of control! Just about the right level of interesting.  If the users of this subreddit had any integrity, this should be the top post of all time. I read the entire tube and was half bored yet mildly interested enough to finish.

This is probably the most perfectly mildly interesting image I've ever seen. The last three ingredients blew it way past mildly interesting if you ask me.  

It was like foeniculum vulgare, hmmm that comes from fennel.  Isn't fennel that stuff in Italian sausage that tastes like black licorice?  

Ok, anethole _also_ from fennel??  Whoa.  

Last but not least limonene comes from... \*faints\* Fennel does not fuck around when it comes to dental hygiene.
 Fennel is a key component of the mouth-freshening tasty stuff they keep in Indian restaurants for after your meal. This explains a lot. If only they had this on commuter trains.  Yeah fuck toothpaste, from now on I'm just gonna eat some fennel after every meal!  I like fennel.  Fennel salad is the shit. [deleted] Ok, the bowl full of seeds scares me. I've always wondered what it's about but was afraid to ask. Do I chew it? Will it get stuck in my teeth and be crazy? Is it only for certain people- like communion wafers? 

WHY ARE THERE SEED AND CAN I EAT THEM!? [deleted] Well that's good cause I love swallowing Ah the ever present Saunf. They spoil the intent by having the sugar coated ones or Misri ( rock sugar ) along side the fennel seeds.  I'll go one further- I'm just gonna have some Italian sausage after every meal. My grandmother would be so proud.  You'll have the most refreshing breath in the world. :D Another mildly interesting fact:  Those of us that are into 3D printing are using limonene to melt high impact polystyrene, because it's easier to work with than water soluble dissolvable support materials. [deleted] ["Yeah right, Lisa. A wonderful, *magical* plant."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tsdmqhn50uM) Ronald Reagan was a huge fan of black jelly beans. That may be anise, but it's close to fennel in taste.   That's about the only black thing he was a fan of. *Mildly loud AYE-O* [Black licorice is some pretty nasty stuff](http://blogs.webmd.com/breaking-news/2011/10/black-licorice-dangerous-candy.html) btw I find this mildly interesting. I found this mildly infuriating.  Real black licorice isn't the candy most people eat and 2oz a day would be a lot of real black licorice.  

Then the may effect the following drug section:  
warfarin - leafy greens cause it to lose effectiveness, no spinach for you!  
Furosemide, blood pressure meds, and diuretics - all the same set of drugs just listed for each desired effect.

A lot of sky is falling garbage. Considering it was WebMD, I was waiting for the "causes cancer" phrase. This ingredient list was clearly written by someone who doesn't know about botany.  *Foeniculum vulgaris* IS fennel.  It's the specific epithet for the plant, not an ingredient.

 you win! I always assumed that the chalk would also aid in tooth strengthening as well. Interesting... This is the thing I normally read when I forgot my phone while going to the bathroom. Now its actually on my phone and I am mildly interested. Mildlyest [deleted] Being perfect mild is walking such a fine line that it is more difficult than tight roping the grand canyon.... even more... difficult than walking on water -snicker-. Being insanely mild was the most intense thing Jesus has ever done... kinda seems paradoxical. If you are the most mild person to exist then... doesnt that push you over the edge? Being mildly insane is more fun than being insanely mild... I found it to be just a little more interesting than mild, though. Fairly interesting? I don't know. But I definitely think it belongs here. It's ok to have things that don't fit absolutely perfectly. http://i.imgur.com/H8PEZDZ.jpg




Credit for this goes to /u/SnipeyMcSnipe! See but here is the flaw. Some people might find a penis mildly interesting (like OP's mom), but others will find it very interesting (like OP). To each his own I guess.  No dude that's a bicep.  If you want it to be a bicep, it needs more veins. What up? We're three cool guys who are looking for other cool guys who want to hang out in our party mansion. Nothing sexual. Dudes in good shape encouraged.

Arthur?  "Zaphod? Zaphod, you appear to have fallen down a thirty-foot hole..."

"I think he knows that, Arthur." Just watched the Vice episode about Palm Oil. Stuff really is in almost everything.  And is terrible for the environment. It's one of the least sustainable things on the planet.  Flying to Honduras a few months ago, I was was so excited to see all the rain forests, stretching as far as the eye could see, as we approached. The passenger next to me pointed out it was all industrial scale palm oil mono-cropping. The jungles are vanishing. So from the air it looks like natural rainforest, but it's actually just clone upon clone of a single species, planted by a corp? Are they clones though? But it's not like it really matters a whole lot at that point. When it's just one species, it's the same level of monocrop as if it were clones.
 That's exactly what it is. It's becoming a huge problem, and it is found in practically everything. From foods to soaps to plastics. In order to plant the palm trees, you have to cut the trees and burn the peat, not only destroying the ecosystems but polluting the earth.  Driving through Costa Rica by Jac and Parque Nacional Manuel Antonio there is an enormous palm oil plantation. You literally drive through it for about an hour and it just goes and goes and goes. &gt; It's one of the least sustainable things on the planet.

It's only this way because of the way they are farming it. It could be like any other crop, but there is just an incredible demand for it right now so people are doing destructive things to get into the business.  I can't remember the stats, but burning the peat on the forest floor releases a lot more Carbon than just burning the trees. I wanna say it was like 10 times the amount, but not sure.  Peat is what eventually becomes coal, so yea: leave that shit alone. peat and repeat were on a fence. peat jumped off ... who was left? Climate change hah, sounds like a joke that cecily strong's "girl you wish you hadn't started a conversation with at a party" character would tell. [deleted] Save the Orangutangs!

http://imgur.com/YVw6kKU I started looking for palm oil in the food I'm buying recently, and it's crazy. I've had to stop eating any kind of biscuits, industrial pastries, snack bars, even chocolate from respected brands has palm oil in it if there's a filling in the chocolate (looking at you, Ritter Sport - you deceived me!). The stuff at the cheap bakery where they just cook frozen stuff is full of palm oil, too.

On the plus side, most of that stuff is really unhealthy anyway. But I really wonder how they grew so reliant on this stuff in only a decade - or has this been going on for longer than that? Why do you avoid it and why is it bad? Regarding palm oil I think I've lived under a rock.  Palm oil is used as a substitute for ingredients that add trans fats.  

Farmers of the oil clear vast swaths of rainforest to plant the palm trees, and the destruction of the rainforests leads to greatly reduced habitat for tigers, orangutans, and Sumatran Rhinos (which I had never even heard of, but they are [super ridiculously adorable](http://i.livescience.com/images/i/000/027/824/original/Sumatran-Rhino.jpg?1338991423)!!). Most palm oil is collected by destroying naturally grown palm trees in rainforests, it's devastating to the local wildlife and one of the biggest risks are towards the orangutans as well as other endangered species.  I believe palm oil is rather collected from [plantations](http://www.greenpeace.de/sites/www.greenpeace.de/files/styles/galleria_node_desk_1x/public/palmoel-gp01x6p.jpg?itok=j5h1tmfP). But the plantations displace the rainforest directly or indirectly. Production is very damaging to rain forests and destroys the habitant of the critically endangered orangutans.

Gravy powder? Palm Oil!  
Why? It's the replacement for partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, aka trans fats.

Stable at high temperatures = suitable for use as a solid fat replacement. The Showtime series "Years of Living Dangerously" also shows this problem well.  Harrison Ford goes over to the palm oil farms in Indonesia and gets all pissed off. And it's the worst :( I wish more companies would find alternatives for it.  And it's terrible for my gums.  I used to get weekly canker sores,  but now that I've avoided it,  I'm much better  Ingredient: Aqua

From: Purified Water

What it does: Moistener

Hmmm, I had always wondered what the water was for. Now I know. 

THANKS OP! Moisture is the essence of wetness. And what is wetness?  Wetness is the essence of beauty. (   ) I expected lenny in this thread when I read "moist".

Wasn't disappointed.

( ^  ^ ) And what is beauty? That falls under the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. I solve practical problems.  Aqua. It's not water, it's "Aqua". And it's from my factory that makes Aqua from Water to be used as Moistener. It's a decent business once you make the investments. Sign me up! I won't miss this business venture like I once did from a wealthy Nigerian entrepreneur! That would be the [INCI Name](http://cosmetics.specialchem.com/inci/aqua) of Water. Nice find.  Also very weird that it's not just called water. How the hell do you get the aqua out of water?  Wow. Thats almost too interesting.

I wish more ingredients did this.  Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)? from: bacterial fermentation. Why? enhance that umami! &gt; I wish more ingredients did this.

You mean products? :P

I wonder if we can crowd-source a website/app like that until the companies do it themselves. A wikipedia for products and their ingredients. Perhaps extend that to non-consumables, wouldn't you want to know where the metals in your smartphone got mined?

Actually thats not a bad idea. Search: show me "all chocolate products that do NOT contain red dye #5" Surely ingredepedia would be better? It just rolls off the tounge a little more. I have no idea what I'm doing.jpg

http://ingredepedia.wikia.com/wiki/Kingfisher_Toothpaste this is an awesome idea, and i really hope someone will run with it and make it real.  and that's a good start!
 Someone added water to your wiki.

I loled. Ingredient: Hydrogen, What it Does: Hydrogenate

lulz &gt;You mean products?  

I guess technically it would be the companies that do it, the products are quite inanimate. Doesn't MSG enhance all flavors, not just umami? It's kind of related. Enhancing some flavors enhances others, in general. Salt/sour or salt/sweet is a more accessible example of this.  Well technically salt can be accepted by all types of taste bud receptor simultaneously along with other tastes, so a sour receptor can accept a salt and sour taste at the same time. This is why salt tends to bring out other flavors in a big way. Not exactly. MSG is pretty much pure umami flavor, like sugar is pure sweet flavor and salt is pure salty flavor. Adding the right amount of MSG makes food taste better, just like adding the right amount of salt makes food taste better. &gt; The flavah enhancaaah &lt;flavah intensifies&gt; M'nosodium glutamate Monosodium Glutamate is umami. It stimulates the glutamate receptors on your tongue, which is transmitted by nerves to your brain as the flavor umami. Toms of Maine does this for all of their deodorant, mouthwashes, toothpastes, soaps, etc.

you can search by product, or just check out the entirety of their product lines ingredients here

http://www.tomsofmaine.com/products/ingredient-list Thanks for that link! I thought Tom's had started adding SLS to all its toothpastes, but turns out "Clean &amp; Gentle" doesn't have it! It does have fluoride, but it's good to know a major brand still carries non-SLS. There should be a subreddit where you can post ingredients and people translate it into simple terms.  This is great! Some people have gotten a little carried away with the "if I can't pronounce it, I don't use it" philosophy. This just goes to show that not everything is as far removed from real stuff as it might seem.  That world view just doesn't hold up. The chemicals in "natural" consumer products can be named in the same way things like mono sodium glutamate are.

In fact, if you listed the chemicals in a potato, for instance, a true subscriber to that philosophy would be very afraid of spuds!

Sadly, widespread chemophobia seems to be a growing problem in the US. Also, your expensive hippie organic product with "natural yeast extract"?  Yup that's just MSG.  Lots of 'scary chemicals' just get renamed when included in the products that are marketed to hippies. Couldn't find a potato but heres a pic with the chemicals in a banana.

[Link](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--plv_NAO5--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/19d21f4tf3parjpg.jpg) sodium monofluorophosphate from calcium fluoride, what is this magic? I was wondering the same, where's reddits chemists when you need them Fluorite (calcium fluoride) is the natural source of fluoride that is used to make hydrofluoric acid, which is used to make other fluorine-containing compounds like sodium monofluorophosphate. If you're going to make sodium monofluorophosphate from calcium fluoride, you're going to need some sodium. The middle column of ingredients is incomplete. Well, it's clear they're just listing the fluorine source. You can get the cation from anywhere really. 

CaF2 is a big fluorine source for lots of compounds.   They aren't attempting to give a complete list of ingredients. They're just saying the source of fluoride ions they use is calcium fluoride, which is a naturally occurring mineral. This sort of transparency should be mandated for all consumer products. you can already see the problem with it though. in the above example, calcium carbonate is is stated as coming from chalk. meanwhile calcium fluoride is the "where it comes from", not the ingredient.

a little misleading i find. Definitely can be abused. For example:



Cyanide | Comes from: apples | Used for: Preservative
---|---|----
 Human Hair | Humans | Texture It can be. just start buying things labeled like this over their non-labeled counter parts. If enough people do this, the market will mandate this formatting. 

Than it will just be the norm, and people a generation down the road will have a bias to be suspicious against anybody who did not use this labeling format.  I buy a lot of stuff and I've never seen this before. I don't want to live on toothpaste as I think eating it regularly would be detrimental to my health. Do you know of any other products that have listings like this? I think I've seen some water bottles labeled like this. Water and toothpaste should be enough, right? We'll all be super skinny with excellent teeth. Hollywood, here we come! The free market has never let us down before! It always gives us what we want, and never requires government regulation to force them to! That's how it would work in a perfect world. The thing is though that for most products there simply is no alternative with such informative labels at all. So what do you do then? I'm sure that without consumer protection laws we wouldn't have any labels on consumer products at all. Sometimes you need laws for stuff like this. Which makes it blatantly obvious why companies won't do this in the first place.

Too many suspicious filler ingredients. Doubt it, you could probably find a benign sounding source for 99% of the shit we eat that looks 'big bad' on labels. dang we got ayn rand over here Now where do the chalk and other ingredients come from...  "If you want to make a tube of toothpaste from scratch, you must first invent the universe."

- Carl Sagan Sounds difficult. I'm getting mine from the store.  Costco, universe... close enough. Welcome to Costco, I love you. A still more glorious tube of toothpaste awaits. Chalk is calcium carbonate mineralised by sea creatures, which later died, to form shells and exoskeletons. When they died it all fell to the bottom of the ocean where the pressure of the water, and more material falling on top, compressed it into chalk. So it would be inappropriate for vegans to use tooth paste. Most chalk is an accumulation of Coccolithophores, which are algae so it would be fine. As long as humans don't start purposely killing sea creatures in order to create chalk over hundreds of years or whatever, should be safe for vegans still. I went "heh". That indicates I found it mildly interesting, +1! fennel flavored toothpaste? You should try it. Not a big fan of the vegetable but I'm actually addicted fennel flavored toothpaste. i don't think you're supposed to eat it... I'm just not a big fan of fennel. How licorice-y is the flavor of the toothpaste?

 really often it's actually fennel *pollen* they use as the flavoring, which is less licorice-y, super strong, and a really interesting flavor Pro Tip: If you have frequent canker/cold sores, try using toothpaste without SLS (Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate). It is what give toothpaste its foamy texture (dispersant), it has no cleaning or protecting attributes. There plenty in stores but I use[ Tom's Gentle Care](http://www.amazon.com/Toms-Maine-Anticavity-Toothpaste-Peppermint/dp/B00J2LC9J8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1432318502&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=toms+gentle+care) which also whitens.  Just want to second this. I've had canker sores somewhat regularly my entire life (31 now) and heard about SLS being a possible cause. I switched to using non-SLS toothpaste a few years ago, and now I'll only get new sores if I bite my mouth or eat something too spicy. Same here. Finding out about this literally changed my life A fine Norwich-based business. Up there with Kettle Chips, Colman's Mustard and insurance.

http://www.kingfishertoothpaste.co.uk/ Yeah, they're very anti animal testing, according to the website, but use palm oil (which is known for it's devastating impacts on rainforests and fauna) in their products. However, they are involved with the [Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil](http://www.rspo.org/) Yeah the 'palm oil' surprised me, considering all the other 'free' notices that were listed on the tube.  Do they just not know, or is that the only place to get the ingredients they need? They aren't anti animal testing, they are pro having customers who are anti animal testing. Not tested on animals---YOU ARE THE TEST!!!!
 Our toothpastes are now labeled gluten free.  

In South Korea there is a pervasive opinion that fans use up oxygen in the room, and that it can be dangerous to fall asleep with a fan running.  This false belief is pervasive enough that some fans are manufactured and marketed with a "safety feature" that they will automatically shut off without human intervention after a specified period to prevent them from killing you in your sleep.  

Marketing things like toothpaste as gluten free is just like that.  It is harnessing a bulging wave of misconception.  

It must be deeply programmed into the human animal to hold opinions and believe things "just because."  Free and easy access to information doesn't dispel superstition and trendy false beliefs as  efficiently as one might guess.  

This is why, one day, the robots will win.   My tap water is gluten free. New toothpaste! 100% chemical free! Harnessing the pure vacuum energy! I always wondered why so many toothpastes don't have ingredients when the primary purpose is putting it in your mouth. They should do this for everything!

 Great. I'm on the toilet, and now I'm reading the back of a toothpaste tube on my phone. Meta. much much much more than mildly interesting. This company is being as fair as possible to the customers!! Surprised no one calling /r/hailcorporate on this one yet.  Fennel flavored toothpaste seems like punishment for past transgressions.  I took a quick look at this and thought "this seems like something a british toothpaste would do." Did a mental fist pump when it was confirmed upon a closer viewing. For those that care about ingredients, since they were so open and honest you should write them thanking them and request that they find an alternative to Palm Oil. http://www.saynotopalmoil.com/ This is so interesting! I wish more products had the same labels! Yay! My regular toothpaste is on the frontpage! Kind of feared that I would be labeled a crusty hippie for using it, just like Dr. Bronners, but now its on the frontpage! More companies ought to do this. I love this.  I can't even count all the times I've seen someone read a label and say "Whats this artificial bullshit?"  I then feel obligated to tell them something like "Xanthan gum isn't artificial it comes from bacteria on plants, it's as natural as penicillin."

It's like the dihydrogen monoxide joke, it's used in nuclear power plants, it's a major component in acid rain.   You call water dihydrogen monoxide and people suddenly turn into idiots.  Look up what it is before calling it artificial bullshit, or saying it's unhealthy.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrogen_monoxide_hoax BUT I CAN'T PRONOUNCE THOSE WORDS, SO THEREFORE THEY ARE BAD  So....Aqua comes from Water. I see. And /this/ is how you combat idiotic chemophobia. Can we get a brand? This is someone who i wouldnt mind using  Fresh taste ;)  More products should do this Anethole?  10/10 Don't think I want. If every manufacturer did this, most people would drastically change what they consume. What "vegetable"??

I must know!  Am I the only one who that is bothering? This is great but, isn't palm oil kind of controversial? I obviously don't know shit, maybe there's a sustainable way of gathering palm oil that I don't know about. &gt;palm oil

Gone from interesting to infuriating I wish every ingredients label was like this! So which ingredient is the one that ruins the taste of my orange juice? Water comes from water =D This is actually pretty brilliant. There are lots of paranoid people who question hard-to-read ingredients/chemicals as being unsafe or unhealthy, and listing them out like this might calm a few of them down.. There's a reason they don't do this for hot dogs I'd love if this idea caught on, even if only to quiet the "zomg these ingredients are all synthetic toxins" crowd.  I dont always read the back of a tube of toothpaste...but when i do...its because i took a shit and forgot to bring my phone.  What brand is it, I trust the brand that made this label more and I want to buy it! touch it...you want super powers dontcha? For the sake of conversation, what superpowers are we talking here? Ya know. Tree superpowers!

Dat Ash In Sequoia national park they do controlled forest fires for ecological reasons. A few years ago one got a bit out of hand but was eventually put out... Or so they thought. 

The next spring they had to close a section of trail because limbs of one of the Sequoias were falling. 

It turns out the top of the tree was smoldering all winter long, unnoticed by the Rangers and started to burn again come spring. 

This followed a historically low snowfall winter and was the first recorded case of this in the park.  I love hearing about these kinds of things. It's the kind of thing I'll bring up and the fianc will just look at me like I'm some kind of savant. I'm not. I just like little interesting anecdotes.  My life in a nutshell.  Very interesting, thank you Too interesting. Get out.  When I was a teenager I was smoking a cigarette in the backyard, which was a big nono. I put it out and flicked the butt into an enclave of a tree to hide it. 

I came home later to find out the tree had caught fire and the fire department had to come and put it out. They told my dad that trees can get struck by lightning and burn for days on the inside before actually catching fire. I always assumed this was true but knew it must have been me. My dad always suspected it was me, but with a perfectly valid excuse I got away with it.

It's 10 years later, but I still want to send this to him and he like, "see, it wasn't me". I'm an adult and I should just own up to it but instead here I am l, a full grown adult, looking for a way to lie to my parents.

[edit] I found a picture of [the tree](http://i.imgur.com/j8BCw9q.jpg) before I accidentally murdered it. However, there was indeed a storm a couple days before it burnt so it could have very well been the lightning.  Depends on your relationship with your dad now.  If it were me and my parents, I'd send this with a note: "See!  The lightning story actually happens to other people!  ... It was me smoking, though." Relevant story:

I was a young teenager sitting up in the bridge of the boat with my little sister, when all of a sudden it took off in reverse and rammed into another boat. I carried the blame for this for years and always maintained that I had nothing to do with it and was just sitting there.

Earlier this year, my little sister calls me, "Hey, I have a confession. It was me that crashed the boat." The little shit let me shoulder the blame for that for that long. "Don't tell me, tell dad!" "It's not a boat. It's a YACHT!!" Me too!  I'm pretty sure if it was me my dad would just laugh. Then straight to bed without supper.  As a fellow full-grown adult, I too am still going with the obvious lies of my teenage years.

Did I smoke? Yes. Did my parents know? Yes. Did I ever admit it, like ever, like even years and years later? Nope. 

"Yeah, there were a lot of people smoking in the movie theater. That must be why you're smelling all that smoke..." "No,  dad,  I've never even had sex!"

"You're married. With children." "They must have cheated on me!"

"You gave birth." [Indeed.](http://i.imgur.com/zLzDEZw.jpg) It would be so weird to see Married With Children in HD Smoking in the movies? You've been holding onto that one for a while. It would be an example of one of the obvious lies I told them. Why did everyone and their cat smoke in their teenage years? Is peer pressure that intense? Takes the edge off the speed. Isn't the edge the entire point of taking speed? I was 17 and had recently started experimenting with alcohol. Up to that point I'd never even considered smoking a cigarette. They stunk and I knew they were horrible for your body... but the night I first tried vodka, lo and behold, smoking a clove cigarette seemed like a new and awesome thing to do. 


And it was! It gave me a huge rush of euphoria on top of already flying high on a vodka buzz. Plus, as an added bonus, my lips tasted like maple syrup. And I felt more mature somehow. Like a man... a man who makes his own god damn rules.


For awhile it was just a thing that was fun to do while drinking. I loved to get wasted with friends, but realized I couldn't do it all the time. Smoking though? I could smoke on breaks at work, while driving, etc. So I started smoking regularly just to get a taste of those good times during the work week. 


Eventually I switched to Marlboro reds, I think after a friend made fun of me for smoking cloves. Smoking Marlboros was for God damned tough guys. Guys who made their own rules. Yeah, I see the irony here.


Anyways, the euphoric rush i got from smoking started to fade, until eventually I got nothing out of it. I ended up having to keep smoking  just to feel normal. If I couldn't have a smoke every couple hours I'd get anxiety like a motherfucker. It became a 15 year addiction that made me feel like shit physically and gave me an easy way to avoid dealing with emotional issues. Just smoke them away. 


After ten or fifteen attempts to quit, I feel like I've finally kicked the urge to smoke. It's been months since I had one. The difference from previous attempts is that when I smell someone smoking I'm no longer jealous. I used to love that smell, but now it makes me feel like barfing. This is a good thing.  I'll make sure the tree hears this story, maybe he too can turn his life around. &gt; And I felt more mature somehow. Like a man... a man who makes his own god damn rules.

This, sadly, is a big factor for why some kids smoke. You couldn't have put it any better.

Good work, mate! I'm glad you managed to get over it. Too many people are either in denial or just can't stop. I remember having a classmate who said that she didn't believe that smokes were bad for her health... I'm still not certain if she was serious or not. I think it was just curiosity.  If smoking is bad, why do people do it?  What aren't they telling me?  

To be honest, smoking was great and I miss it to this day.  It just wasn't socially acceptable, plus you know, terrible for you.   &gt; It just wasn't socially acceptable

I want to move to where you live. I swear, it's the opposite here. Pretty much any major city in the United States it's becoming super taboo.  Small towns much less so I think.  Really? You sure you're not in Russia? I had no idea.

Where I'm from it's mostly peer pressure that seems to convert kids, although curiosity is a factor too. When I was in high school, a bunch of people smoked, a bunch didn't, but I never had a person I knew pick up or give up smoking. Every single smoker I knew had picked it up before I met them. The only case where a girl I knew picked up smoking was caused by peer pressure.

And generally people are expected to shut up and endure smoke. Recently had to meet some of my college classmates for a project and the bloody smokers forced everyone else to inhale their shit. It wasn't the first time I said 'fuck it' and left because I wouldn't take that shit.

I'll never forget when the entire group, 90% non-smoker, agreed to go to the smoking area in a Pizza Hut because there were two chicks who smoked... They were there for forty minutes. They can handle not smoking for one and a half hours in class, but they can't for forty minutes in a restaurant...

I'm ranting. Sorry for the wall of text. I just don't like smoke. Come to Minnesota, it's illegal to smoke in a restaurant. Smoking is fun and feels good, and teenagers haven't fully developed the part of their brain that weighs long term risks and consequences. This effect has been documented and is actually very interesting. It's called the Albert Scheffler Effect, dubbed that by biologist/psychologist Stephon Marcell who enjoyed Mr. Scheffler's popular comedy bit about constantly trying to imitate his role models. 

The Albert Scheffler Effect is actually an evolutionary behavior behind the societal instincts that led to our success as a species. As simple as it sounds, it's a lot more than just "wanting to be like someone else", the Albert Scheffler Effect causes us to take a cognitive approach to an otherwise basic need, social acceptance. By observing the behaviors of successful or socially popular people, it becomes a natural inclination to imitate them for social acceptance, and therefore a higher survival rate. This ultimately leads to a group recreating successful behaviors and rejecting unsuccessful ones. It can be found in life throughout Earth. 

TL;DR: The Albert Scheffler Effect distinguishes the creatures who "stumble around aimlessly" from those that consciously search out a "pack" or group.
 I'm not sure that I believe you... I was reading it and was all "Wow!  That's really cool!".
  
Then I read the username, and now I just don't know what to think. See, I was the opposite. I never smoked but lots of my friends did. I was afraid they would think I would When I was around 13/14 I cracked a window on my house as I was...experimenting...with how far I could hit small stones in my garden with a tennis racket. For science. 

Eventually one of them cracked the window. When my parents came home, my grandmother ratted me out and said I was in the garden playing tennis. 

I refused to admit it was me and my dad made a point of saying it was 'exactly the size of a tennis ball' - which I refuted, quite correctly. I maintained there was no way I could have done that with a tennis ball. 

I'm 29 now and it still comes up from time to time. My dad always re-tells that I 'smashed the window with a tennis ball', which I still refute (as that's not what happened). 

My fianc is the only person who knows the actual story, and I told her that should my dad ever actually phrase the accusation in a way that is true, I'll admit to it. But literally in 15 years he's never said 'remember when you broke the window', he always specified 'with a tennis ball'. 

This is a point of principal I will take to the grave with me if I have to.  When I was about 12, I saw lightning hit a tree, but not much happened.. it just, hit it..  no holes or cracks or anything...  Anyhow, about a week later I was outside and that exact tree burst into flames from top to bottom.   After some research (librarian was helpful), I found that because wood is such a good insulator, that a lightning strike can superheat the sap in the center of the wood, making it boil, but the wood is a good insulator so they heat moves outward ever so slowly.  As the heat moves out, the center of the wood becomes very very dry, but the sap continues to boil flowing out to the outside edge of the tree.   Once the superheated sap hits the air, instant fire, and the tree is ablaze from top to bottom in no time flat.  It was the most interesting thing I ever witnessed in my life, and I had heard that witnessing it is very very rare indeed.  Cool none-the-less!  Thanks for sharing! Send him a postcard with a cigarette in the sky shooting a lightning bolt at a tree. When I was a teenager I was hiding having a smoke. my dumb ass decided to flick the butt into the bark and later I came out and their was smoke coming out from the bark. I ran over and started to dig through the bark and discovered the underneath part of the bark was burning. I hosed the shit out of it and nothing came from it. Honesty...well on Reddit at least...

***Burning.*** The treant is slowly burning from within. Any creature that begins its turn within 5' of the treant must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage (creatures who are in physical contact with the treant take a -5 penalty to this saving throw). Additionally, at the beginning of each of its turns, the treant takes 2d6 fire damage.  
If the treant is wholly submerged in water for at least one round, the fire within it is quickly quenched, causing the wood to warp and split, killing the treant immediately.
___
**--Actions--**

**Multiattack.** The treant makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.

**Burning Grasp.** One creature of huge size or smaller within the treant's reach must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (1d6) fire damage and become grappled (escape DC 13). The treant cannot be gripping more than two creatures simultaneously, and may only grip one creature if it is of large or huge size. Well, this is an interesting novelty account. Best novelty account EVER. Well, shucks. You guys are too kind. Any chance you could throw pathfinder CR levels on this for us pathfinder plebians? 'Fraid not. It takes me a looong time still to calculate out the D&amp;D CR; I probably wouldn't be able to do Pathfinder's if I tried :/ Awww okay.  I'll guesstimate it then.  Awesome work though, I'll be following you! &gt; I'll be following you!

Depending on the subreddit, this is either very flattering or very off-putting.  AS a dummy, is 1d6 1 damage on a 6 sided die? So say I roll a 3 on that 6 sided die it's 3 damage? Would 2d6 rolling a 3 be 6 damage?

And as for "bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) " I don't understand at all and am 100% confused on the damage done. You are correct; 1d6 is a six-sided die, so you roll one six-sided die, and the result is the damage dealt. 2d6 simply means you roll two six-sided dice and add them together. If it there's a modifier, you add that to the total after all the dice are rolled. So for example, if the damage is 2d6+3, roll two six-sided dice, add them together, and add 3 to the result, and that's how much damage was done.

In 5th edition, they wanted to give DMs the option to streamline things, so they started listing just flat numbers based on the statistical average result, followed in parentheses by the dice rolled, so you can skip rolling damage for X number of attacks for each of the Y number of creatures if you want; in large encounters it can speed things up considerably.  
&lt;/more information than you probably wanted&gt; Actually it was the perfect account of information, thank you. And I think I'm still more partial to older DnD rules. Random chance is nice This thread has been linked to from another place on reddit.

Edit: Quick poll. In cases where the content is "too interesting" and out of this subreddit's scope, do you as subscribers think it should be removed or left alone? Pertaining to future cases and not this one http://i.imgur.com/H8PEZDZ.jpg Who needs bar graphs when you can have disembodied wiener graphs? I find it interesting that it wasn't a dickbutt graph. http://i.imgur.com/27nLhLy.gif All joking aside, that's some Gandalf level of photoshop right there. If only he would use his powers for good No kidding. Just another reminder that most images are not to be trusted. 

Extreme photomanip skills though.  Is there a sub for animated/slideshow processes of shops? *[Interest intensifies]* *[mildness dissipates]* http://i.imgur.com/NTzuhhr.gifv What movie is this from? Butts Wide Open Eyes Wide Shut Thanks!

And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I.  Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.

 What's a penis? It's a tragic phallus-y that we don't make graphs like this all the time I do, which might explain why I can't keep a job. Then why not /u/superweiner http://i.imgur.com/CoL6EbZ.png "TIL birds fly because they want to not walk" As a mod of /r/interesting this is pretty accurate. We get stuck with the balls of content. Would you say /r/interesting has been tainted?  /r/DataIsBeautiful Are we going by the base of the penis or the tip of the penis? The entire penis serves as a range of where content should be. Not sure I understand why it had to be a penis... What penis?  People see what they want to see.  Some people can't help but lower the tone It's clearly a bicep, bro. If you want it to be a bicep it needs more veins! Again, **Nothing Sexual** that penis is not sexual, there is no erection Would nipples have been better for you? Your right. I would say I'm at peak mild interest.  I feel like posts that elicit a mild reaction like 'huh' or 'neat' and then move on is basically the goal.  If your reaction becomes 'cool' and you want to show a friend this cool pic.. that
's probably too interesting. 

Ordinarily I'd say people should vote according to their opinion, but we know that doesn't work.  My personal understanding of this sub is that it's intended for posts that simply make me go 'huh.'.

Any more than a 'huh.', and potentially a 'hmmm' start to go into the territory of being, perhaps, a bit *too* interesting.

Once we leave that realm we step into the area of 'wow' like expressions, which, of course, does not belong here. I'd personally post this particular picture into /r/woahdude.  "Meh" = /r/mildlyuninteresting 

"Huh"= /r/mildlyinteresting 

"Cool" = /r/damnthatsinteresting 

"Wow!" = /r/interestingasfuck


...Is that my general understanding? Don't forget to add /r/notinteresting to your scale. "Oh." = /r/notinteresting "K" "Why did I click this again?" What about /r/interesting Submissions have become way too interesting lately. Last year we would get submissions like "one of the bricks in this wall is slightly more red than the others". Now this is a tree that was split by lightning and that is burning from the inside. I will never see this happen in my entire life.

I think posts that are too interesting should be removed. As a mod you'll get flak for this though, and people are gonna whine about how you're a dictator and everything. But there's just no point in this sub at all if it's content that could go in /r/pics or /r/interestingasfuck. &gt; I think posts that are too interesting should be removed.

Could you propose how would could ascertain how interesting something is? Obviously upvotes aren't indicative otherwise both mildly interesting and too interesting posts would be classes as the same.

Propose some rule wording! Maybe create some super complicated "interest meter" that gets posted in the comments that polls how interesting it is, not interesting (-1), mildly interesting (0), or too interesting (+1). If it reaches 90/100 on the interest meter it gets removed (edit: and posted to /r/interestingasfuck if it hasn't been posted before). This also keeps the commenters in power which is good because commenters are always more dedicated than mere voters or worse, lurkers. I second this. I like this idea a lot and think it would work pretty well.

This sub really needs to go back to its roots and I'm glad that the mods are trying to do that.

Edit: Also, if it reaches under -90 then it should also be removed/moved to a different sub like /r/notinteresting. Maybe every post above X upvotes after an hour gets a comment from auto moderator that will remove the post if it goes above a certain amount of votes? The comment could be like "Think this post is too interesting? If this comment reaches 300 upvotes the post will be removed." (I put no thought into the amount)

I got this idea from that one bot that deletes itself if it reaches -1 votes.

This keeps the community in control I think.

Too bad you can't sicky comments. /r/interestingasfuck is filled to the brim with crossposts from /r/pics and the like...

If all the really interesting stuff from this sub would move over there, it would really balance out.

Vote for removal of interesting stuff/moving them to /r/interestingasfuck . I vote to start a system to determine what interesting picture based subreddits can cross post into each other  Way too interesting, that's why it does not belong here. Otherwise it's a fantastic pic, no wonder it gets so upvoted. This is far too interesting! I made [this very similar post](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1kchfz/this_birch_tree_is_burning_on_the_inside_after/)  to /r/wtf about one year ago. I would argue that the one that OP posted is *far* more interesting than mine, and implicitly out of scope for this sub. 

Edit: formatting Totally something for /r/interestingasfuck Read it as interestin' gas fuck at first and got a little confused, but ultimately came to some conclusions on just what that would mean. And crowd goes mild!! I think it would be a slippery slope to remove posts for being *too* interesting. That's something the upvote/downvote should decide. But people will always upvote really interesting stuff.. It is the same as /r/wtf's fall from power. People upvoted content even though it had nothing to do with "wtf" just because they thought it was funny or coool or whatever Exactly. The sub moves away from its roots ^^heh and then you just have another /r/pics. It's too late, the mods are already asking users to decide.  Democracy has won.  RIP mildlyinteresting. Not necessarily. I'm getting a sense of where people are coming from. Our strict rules such as rule 6 and other help keep this place what it is. Only after thorough discussion can we make informed decisions about future moves See, I agree with your first point, but people casually strolling around the front page aren't going to keep in mind the appropriateness of the post to the subreddit. They're going to see something neat and hit upvote. That's basically what I do. Hardly ever check if it's a relevant sub. I'm sorry reddit, I've failed you... That's just letting /r/all browsers decide.  Look at the top posts for this sub of all time. Then look at the top posts from only the past month. There has been a definite change in what's considered "mildly interesting". 

If it's too interesting, then I say remove and redirect the user to an appropriate sub. This is clearly too interesting  This is far too interesting. I mean, it's *really* cool, and I'm glad I saw it, but it doesn't fit the sub and should probably be removed. /r/interestingasfuck I feel like it should've been called /r/wildlyinteresting for 2 reasons:

1- It's close to this sub name but opposite

2- /r/interestingasfuck looks like intestine gas fuck. And saying "[adjective] as fuck" makes me feel like a 6th grader. &gt;interest in gas fuck

FTFY Remember that Simpsons movie where Homer cut off a moose leg with a lightsaber? That was amazing.  [deleted] We don't need no water, let the motherfucker burn! Oh shit...well come on OP. It's time to tell some scary stories around it.  This is most definitely Hexxus from Fern Gully. Groot dropped his mixtape Reminds me of the [the swedish torch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU_pPdzc5Ek)  This is awesome, I've actually seen a few trees struck by lightning as it happened (I live in Washington, tons of trees and lots of thunderstorms) but I've never seen one that only partly split and burned like this. Usually they (at least with Douglas firs, maybe it's that species specifically that does this?) explode pretty completely, at least in my experience. Heck, I missed getting impaled by a 20ft shard of tree once when I was camping in the olympic rainforest, and I woke up to the sound of dynamite outside my tent, and when I looked in the morning there was a giant piece of wood sticking out of the ground next to my tent's entrance, and a ragged and charred stump nearby. 

Come to think of it, I do remember hearing that Doug Fir tend to have a lot of internal pressure due to how they grow and how they store sap... so maybe they are just bombs when struck. 

And of course, being like the third tallest tree in north america, and growing absolutely everywhere here, it makes sense that I've never seen a tree get struck that *wasn't* a douglas fir, at least not in person.

EDIT: just realized people may not know that "the olympics" refers to the olympic mountains and rainforest.  360 degree marshmallow roast. How are you building campfires so as not to be able to access it from 360 degrees?  Wow- this is actually very interesting how the burn mark go straight up.  Probably the most awesome show of nature I've ever seen was a huge grandfather oak- the kind it would take about 2-3 people with arms wrapped around to circle the tree get hit by lightning.  I was about 40-50 feet away and could feel the tingle of electricity before the strike.  It was so powerful it knocked the tree completely off it's stump.  The tree and stump continued burning for hours even in the pouring rain.  It was fucking awesome and I'll never forget it. would be even more interesting to see it at night... This kills the tree Tree Soul Absorbed TIL Tree's are red meat. I remember sitting downstairs on my computer when a lightning strike blew up a tree in my backyard. It literally shook me off of my chair. To this day, it is the loudest thing I have ever heard in my life. [This was the aftermath.](http://i.imgur.com/lXl9Zra.jpg) Did you call the fire department? That tree is well in the way to creating a forest fire. That picture was taken by the fire department. It was posted up by a local new station here. Not that the fire department needed to do much as we have had tons of rain lately. The tree stirs under your hand. Do you seek its conjured weapon and armor? Come on, everyone knows lightning can't melt wood beams. Another Oblivion gate. Relevant username, OP. Mildly? Should be on r/interestingasfuck Make a baseball bat from it. Man don't sell yourself short, this is /r/interestingasfuck  An ash tree....how ironic

Wait, is it ironic? With the internet correcting it so much I've forgotten what exactly ironic means I read that as 'lightning snake' for some reason, I was like oh shit have they discovered a new species of electric snakes in Australia or something? This happened to a tree at the camp I went to when I was younger.  It was a redwood and because their bark is fire resistant only the inside burned and it became hollowed out.  A man named Tony built a door into the trunk of the tree and a little cast iron stove and then put a bed in it and lived in it for a while.  Check it out... Tree thinks it's a bush. Looked like that construction spray paint they use to mark trees to cut down at first  I have a tree in my backyard that finally fell after it was struck by lightning.

Scared the poop out of us when it was struck.

All the hair on my body stood on end. &gt; All the hair on my body stood on end.

I'm not sure if you're saying it scared the crap out of you, or if your hair literally stood on end due to the differing charge between you are the lightning, which isn't that uncommon (and is also a sign to find somewhere safe immediately if you're out in a storm). Like, even your pubes? reminded me of the [swedish torch](https://youtu.be/WfRovJ1KcCg?t=2m34s) but all the way to the top of the tree... the swedish tree torch Oh hey, fellow Arkansan! how does the top of the tree looks? is it still intact?  We might need an ELI5 of this... [this article](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2011/08/18/polarized_rainbow_what_does_this_mean.html) by Phil Plait isn't quite ELI5, but it does explain it well. fun fact, if OP had turned the sunglasses sideways, the rainbow would have disappeared. Just double checking, that's because the two components of electromagnetic waves are perpendicular, right? Its true the electric and magnetic components are perpendicular but you only need to consider one (conventionally electric) when talking about polarization. The convention is you add up all the electric components (including their directions) from all the lightwaves emitted and if that net sum is not zero then the light is polarized in the direction of whatever the resultant E field vector is. As this E field is a vector is has horizontal and vertical components - a different set of components than the em waves I believe your question is referring to. Anyhow it so happens that the E is mostly in the vertical direction for this rainbow, which is what the sunglasses let through. Now the reason it would have disappeared if sunglasses are rotated is bc sunglasses absorb horizontal E , which is now most of the light that is incident.  The sunglasses support the LGBT community and Leprechauns Where da gold at

LGBTQAMA* Polarized lenses filter out light that isn't spinning in a certain way/direction (think of light waves as a coil emerging from the source towards your eyes). Without the glasses you get a whole bunch of light behaving all different ways and it just looks like plain/white light. With the glasses however, only a certain kind of lightwaves were allowed to pass through the glass and these light waves just happened to be coming from a rainbow. Rainbow was so clear because the lightrays bouncing around the water droplets (this is how rainbows happen) all exit with more or less the same polarisation  while clouds let light of all polarisations through. So when the polarisation filter is at the correct angle ~70% of rainbow light passes through, while only 40% of light from other sources gets through.  70%? [This](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/rbowpol.html) says that rainbows are polarized up to 94%. Oh cool, I just made a rough estimate including losses and such.  So you don't deserve to die? Look at this guy. Just going on the internet and roughly estimating polarized losses and such. Who does that? Yah. Who the F does that? I certainly do not.

And all light reflected by water is polarized so it can go trough the glass if it is at the right angle To add on this, electromagnetic waves are actually two perpendicular waves acting together, the electric wave, and magnetic wave. In unpolarized light, these waves are in any possible orientation, as long as they're  perpendicular to each other.

When these waves pass through a polarizing filter, only the ones that line up with the filter can pass through. The others cannot, and thus the intensity of the wave is reduced by half. For each subsequent filter, the new intensity is equal to the initial intensity times the squared cosine of the angle to which the second filter is rotated with respect to the first. 

Since the cosine of 90 is zero, this means when two polarizing filters are perpendicular to each other, you can't see through them. It's a good way of checking that sunglasses are in fact polarizing, just take a pair you know for certain are polarizing and hold them perpendicular to the other. If you can see through, one of them isn't polarizing. Aren't sunglasses vertically polarized, and not circularly polarized as you seem to indicate with the "coil"? Right, they are vertically polarized.  You can tell because when you line up two pair, they can block out light.  Rotating the light wouldn't block it.

The polarization is vertical because light reflecting off surfaces parallel to the ground like the hood of your car, the sea, and the asphalt are mostly horizontal after reflection.

LCDs inside the car are usually aligned vertically so that you can read them even with your shades on. &gt;LCDs inside the car are usually aligned vertically so that you can read them even with your shades on.

Huh, TIL.  Just more evidence that far more thought goes into designing the things I use every day than I will ever appreciate.  Props to car LCD person! Oddly, some gas station pump LCDs are horizontal. So you either have to take off the glasses or tilt your head. [Personally I'm lazy, so](http://i43.tinypic.com/f0rlso.jpg)... Ugh, I hate not being able to take pictures with my polarized ray bans. He means that the light is like a 'coil', not the lens. This explains polarization but not why the rainbow is polarized. http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/rbowpol.html Well I can almost understand that... THIS.

Also, if you get 2 of the same polarizing lenses and rotate one 90, then no light *should* not be able to pass depending on how much light they filter.

Allahu Akbar No light should not be able to pass.  What does that mean? Double negative. Obviously it means all light should pass through it.

Basically, you become a focal point for all the light in the universe to converge on. So basically don't do it, unless you want to end the human race. But what if it creates Rainbow Road on Earth? Do you want to take the chance? You might as well be typing google into google. oh no. don't do that... I'm serious! 

Doing that makes it think about itself a lot and in the end that might lead to self-awareness... Pretty sure the "not" is an error. You wouldn't see any light so it would be black. This only works for linearly polarized light, right? It also works for circularly polarized light. Real3D (movie theater 3D) uses circularly polarized light because it is more robust to head tilt with less ghosting. So you can try it next time you go! The 90 thing doesn't work with circular polarization as, by definition, no plane has a favoured intensity. A left hand and right hand circular polarizer will block out eachother's light though. Try putting on 3D glasses and looking at a friend also wearing them, open only one eye and one of the lenses will go black, Ah, right, opposite handedness block each other, not the angle.  What's even more interesting is that if you simply place a third filter between the two, but ensure it's not at 90 degrees to either lens, light will be allowed to pass, this is due to Malus' law:

intensity = incident intensity*cos^2 (angle between plane of polarisation to angle of polarising filter) Wait, like a coil? Light waves aren't actually waves? Hi, 4th year Optometry student. Polarized lenses remove 50% of the overall light. The reason you see the rainbow (better) is because the contrast between the background and rainbow is low. The lenses increase the contrast. 

Edit: for anyone that is pointing out that the rainbow is polarized, that's the point, the amount of light from the background decreases and the rainbow doesn't decrease (very little) which increases the contrast.  You can see into water with them SO much better! Worth a view, seeing all the wildlife down there that is missed with the eye... I use a pair when I go fly fishing. They help a lot. Me too And windows... I heard... from a friend... Normal sunglasses remove a bit of light too (and increase the contrast), but I can't see rainbows with them. 

Is there a special material in the polarized lenses that increase the effect or something else ? They're actually just long chains aligned horizontally.  Like see-through window blinds in front of your eyes. They are polarized.

Most things give off light in pretty much every direction, so some gets through. Most glare is more polarized, so it's less likely to go through. Do u even fresnel, bro? rainbows are polarized &gt; Light can be split into the stuff we can see, and the stuff we can't, often called the "visible spectrum", and the extremely scientific sounding "All the other shit."
&gt; 
&gt; The human eye can see light in wavelengths between 390 to 700 nm (If you think of visible light like a wave, we can see the light where the distance between the peak of one wave and the peak of another is between 390-700 billionths of a metre). Other sources of light, like UV and infra-red, are not visible to the human eye because they fall outside of these wavelengths. Because we can't actually see the spectrum of stuff like UV or IR light, we have to have filters, which allow us to see these wavelengths of light, most often giving us a colour whose strength shows the intensity of the light. Most often, UV filters show blue, and IR filters show red.
&gt; 
&gt; Polarizing filters are a little different, in that instead of showing us light that we can't see, they block out scattered, or diffused light that we can see that would end up confusing our eyes with too much light. So, if you apply a polarizing filter to a bright and sunny day, you can pick out details of certain objects more clearly, because all the light bouncing off reflective sources gets 'tuned out', and doesn't pass the polarizing filter. Regular lenses are just tinted to remove ALL light, whereas polarizing filters are set just to remove the wavelengths of light that most closely correspond to reflected light.
&gt; 
&gt; In this case, there's too much light to see the rainbow with the naked eye. The polarizing lens blocks out the diffused light so you can see the rainbow clearly. But, because it's being put through a filter, the full colour spectrum isn't available.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope that helps!

Credit to /u/GoodAtExplaining Just to add to what "polarization" actually is, imagine that light is a vibrating string.  It can have various wavelengths and energies (amplitudes), but it also can oscillate in various directions.  Think of a guitar string that you pluck by pulling vertically up on it and letting it go (it will oscillate up and down) and a guitar string that you strum (it will oscillate side to side). The string can oscillate at ANY angle in between too!

Light can be thought of as exactly the same.  But a polarizer is basically a "grate".  It has a BUNCH of slits all lined up with one another that will only allow light to pass through that is oscillating in the same direction.  (Meaning if you have vertical "slits", your polarizer will only allow light through that also oscillates up and down). 

It gets a little more complicated than this, because while perfectly horizontal oscillating light will not be able to pass through a vertical polarizer, angles in between horizontal and vertical WILL get through to some extent.  Luckily for us, this ends up averaging out so that half of the intensity of diffuse light is cut out by a polarizer. Light Pollution (often called [glare](http://cdna.allaboutvision.com/i/sunglasses/polarized-waterskier-b-300x224.jpg)), where excess bright light makes faint light hard to see.

You can see in the top left of the picture, the actual rainbow very lightly. The glasses block out a lot of the indirect bright light.

&gt; Light reflected from surfaces such as a flat road or smooth water generally is horizontally polarized. This means that, instead of light being scattered in all directions in more usual ways, reflected light generally travels in a more horizontally oriented direction. This creates an annoying and sometimes dangerous intensity of light that we experience as glare.

&gt;Polarized lenses contain a special filter that blocks this type of intense reflected light, reducing glare.

[Source](http://www.allaboutvision.com/sunglasses/polarized.htm). If you look closely in the picture, you CAN see the rainbow outside of the glasses, but it's difficult to see because the image is bright and overexposed.

Polarized lenses could help make the rainbow clearer, however, by preferentially filtering out bright light that's scattered from haze both in front of and behind the rainbow.

When a light particle bounces off of a shiny surface (like a raindrop, or a microscopic water droplet that makes up haze), that light particle picks up a particular orientation. Our eyes have not evolved to detect this orientation, but we can see its effect with polarized lenses, which preferentially block certain orientations of light. Sunglasses are usually built so that light reflected water or glaring road surfaces will be blocked. They can also make the sky look clearer because water droplets are shiny, and their reflected light will be blocked too.

Also, sometimes rainbows only appear in [part of the sky](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3686/9284020404_8a696c8c0e_b.jpg), because they won't appear where there aren't any raindrops in the air. They Live! The Rainbows who have taken over the earth. I was waiting for that comment From what I remember the light from a rainbow is polarised, if OP had rotated the glasses it would have vanished What else could the government be hiding from us? First rainbows, next could be aliens.  OURSELVES HOW CAN MIRRORS BE REAL IF OUR EYES AREN'T REAL? [OBEY. CONSUME. REPRODUCE.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/) I came here to kick ass and chew bubble gum. And I'm all out of gum. BUBBLE GUM, NOT ANY GUM DUDE I have come here to kick ass and chew spearmint gum. I'm all out of bubble gum. **BETTER LIVING THROUGH... uhhhh... PHYSICS!!!**

Rainbows are polarized, since they reflect and refract through raindrops.  The act of reflection/refraction preferentially selects light with a specific polarized alignment.

As a result, one can "cancel" or "enhance" polarized rainbows by rotating a polarizing filter (such as in sunglasses) until you either see the rainbow, or it disappears entirely.

In addition, for the OP's example, the ambient light is very bright and randomly polarized, while the polarized rainbow is very faint (likely due to light rainfall/precipitation).  As a result, when using the sunglasses, the ambient light is largely controlled while the rotation of the sunglasses is such that the rainbow is best enhanced.

(Source: I also teach physics.) But I thought a polarising filter would either show the incident light as either of the following:  


* As bright as the source

* Darker than the source


How can the light from the polarising filters of the glasses be 'brighter' than the source is to the naked eye? It isn't. The other sources are darker, so it looks brighter in relation. Ah yes.. It would help if I actually read all of his original comment...

Impatient sod I am.. I don't think it does, I think it darkens all other light thus making the reainbow "brighter" - appear brighter.


*I think...* Light can be split into the stuff we can see, and the stuff we can't, often called the "visible spectrum", and the extremely scientific sounding "All the other shit."

The human eye can see light in wavelengths between 390 to 700 nm (If you think of visible light like a wave, we can see the light where the distance between the peak of one wave and the peak of another is between 390-700 billionths of a metre). Other sources of light, like UV and infra-red, are not visible to the human eye because they fall outside of these wavelengths. Because we can't actually see the spectrum of stuff like UV or IR light, we have to have filters, which allow us to see these wavelengths of light, most often giving us a colour whose strength shows the intensity of the light. Most often, UV filters show blue, and IR filters show red.

Polarizing filters are a little different, in that instead of showing us light that we can't see, they block out scattered, or diffused light that we can see that would end up confusing our eyes with too much light. So, if you apply a polarizing filter to a bright and sunny day, you can pick out details of certain objects more clearly, because all the light bouncing off reflective sources gets 'tuned out', and doesn't pass the polarizing filter. Regular lenses are just tinted to remove ALL light, whereas polarizing filters are set just to remove the wavelengths of light that most closely correspond to reflected light.

In this case, there's too much light to see the rainbow with the naked eye. The polarizing lens blocks out the diffused light so you can see the rainbow clearly. But, because it's being put through a filter, the full colour spectrum isn't available.

Hope that helps! Don't polarizing lenses block out certain polarizations of light, not certain wavelengths? Correct. Am easy way to think of it is like this: imagine light as a wave can vibrate up and down or left and right. A polarized lens will block the light vibrating up and down, but not what's vibrating left and right. This still fits his explanation of how everything is working, fortunately.

Of course, that's not EXACTLY how it works, but it illustrates well enough for the question at hand. So, light bouncing off of a surface tends to change the light's wave angle? For the most part yes, when light encounters a surface the components perpendicular to the surface are "absorbed" and so the light that leaves the surface is polarized parallel to the surface like [in this picture](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/light/u12l1e5.gif). If you use the comb/grill analogy of polarization, if you orient a comb so the gaps between the teeth are parallel to the surface again, the reflected wave can fit through. This is why the sky looks much clearer/darker and the sun less hazy in puddles or still lakes; the light has been polarized and the lake acts like sunglasses.

Of course this is heavily simplified, what actually happens is perpendicular components of the incoming light wave are matched by EM boundary conditions depending on the TE or TM mode of the light ray, but that's more an advanced discussion. Ah the good ol' boundary conditions. Triggered. Yep.  Best way to test if it's truly polarized, take two of the sunglasses and look through one lens normally and the other at a 90 degree angle, you shouldn't be able to see anything as it should block both the up and down and side to side wavelengths. I've seen so many falsely advertised sunglasses with polarized lens stickers. Yeah, you're right.  I was thinking the same thing. I wonder if the spaces between the polarizing elements are somewhat specific though. The same way that microwaves can't get through the grating on the glass in the front due to the spacing and wavelength of the microwaves.  Think of polarized lenses as jail bars and light waves as a long stick. walk towards the bars while twirling the stick. Only when it's reasonably straight up and down will it get through. This is sort of a rough idea. In reality the "bars" are a little wider, allowing for 50% of the light to get through. Meaning that in the same situation, the stick would fit through the bars even at a 45 degree angle, but anything closer to horizontal would be blocked.

That's how new 3D glasses are made. one lens is polarized vertically and the other side is polarized horizontally. They both let in two different images and block the other one out completely.  Polarising filters block out certain polarisations of light, not certain wavelengths.

Reflected light generally has one particular polarisation whereas regular scattered light has all directions of polarisation.

Polarising lenses work by filtering out all but one polarisation direction. If you pick the right direction, you can block out all reflections and some of the scattered light will still get through.

It's possible that light from the rainbow was polarised in the correct direction to pass through OPs shades. Without the shades, the light would be drowned out by the much more intense scattered light. By blocking out all other polarisations, much less scattered light is allowed through and the rainbow is more visible.

(OP, did you rotate the shades and if so did the rainbow disappear?) wow thanks! that really explains a lot that I didnt quite get in school :D You could have explained that much better if you just explained what polarization is first without confusing the matter with an explanation on the wavelengths of light and which of those we can see (which has bugger all to do with polarization). they live I take them off and you look normal, but I put them on and you look like a cheesehead!

Can't be, it's just a sticker.

I was not a smart child. Children don't develop the ability to look at something from other points of view until they are around 7 or so. It's called egocentrism. [In a task where young children were asked to look at a 3-D model from a different angle then they were currently at](http://www.simplypsychology.org/preoperational.html), they were't able to tell what they would be able to see. So it probably wasn't that you were stupid, you just probably saw that the dot was always where you were and assumed that it was watching you.

Edit: Welp, turns out after that section, another experiment basically refuted that by having a simpler, easier to understand experiment which found that "children have largely lost their egocentric thinking by four years of age". Maybe you were just a stupid kid after all. Thanks to u/antariusz for pointing it out &gt; you just probably saw that the dot was always where you were and assumed that it was watching you.

That's what it was. It said "YOU are here". To my child mind, that meant the dot represented ME. Obviously the dot moved when I did, but I wasn't at a sign to see it. It was amazing Mall technology. Mall tech. A wondrous yet esoteric branch of study.  Dr. Paul Blart, PhD Paul Blart, Mall Doc A hell of a lot of strategy goes into designing a mall, they want you to get lost and have to spend more time. Did you read the article?

It shows that most children are able to see something from other points of view by age 4.

The 7 year old experiment failed because of complicated instructions. So most 7 year olds can see it by the time they are 4.  Got it. Whoops, missed the last section. Edits to be made. understanding that the perspectives, beliefs, and attitudes of others that are different from your own (or "putting yourself in another's shoes") and recognizing that other people may differ from you in relation to this is a developmental stage in psychology known as [theory of mind](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind) #####&amp;#009;

Thanks for sharing. I think the best example of that is me and some friends at age 6.

I'm facing my friend.

"That way is left, to me." and I point to my left.

He argues that it isn't, that that way is right from his perspective (at age 6, so not in these exact words), and everything else isn't relevant until he moves to the same position as me.

I think he didn't really understand at that point that other people actually exist, that we're not automatons generated by his mind to populate the world. Only reason I can think of for him disregarding that personal directions vary depending on your orientation relative to other people stating their personal directions. My kid is still always better than me at finding the right direction to go. Like Twister from Rocket Power: "How do they know!?" I remember watching that bit and young me thinking "Yeah, how DO they know?!" Still the only, and best, quote I remember from that show.

Besides woogidie woodigie, of course. *BUST!!!* Have you figured it out now? Hahaha yeah, it's the map gnomes. The fact that it was a sticker doesn't mean they weren't tracking you It's okay, when I was in university I went to the nice mall in the town over and grabbed a little paper map so I wouldn't get lost. I was confused for about a minute as to why there was no "You are here" star.  When I was a kid news anchors used to freak me out, they always knew where I was.  It's okay--I used to think I was someone really special because the moon and the sun followed whereever I walked. Why so many lights on that traffic signal? A rough timer for the bridge being brought back down after its raised  Not a wacky enough reason.  The mayor has a lucrative traffic light contract.

&gt;Modern [drag races](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_race) are started electronically by a system known as a __Christmas tree__. A common Christmas tree consists of a column of seven lights for each driver or lane, as well as a set of [light beams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_sensor) across the track itself. Each side of the column of lights is the same; from the top down, there is one blue [LED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode) light set arranged in a circle with a white line through the centre, then three amber bulbs, then a green bulb and a red bulb.   The light beams are arranged with one set on the starting line, and another set 7 inches behind it.

It's a bridge over the Chicago river, and they do have to raise the bridges sometimes for boats to pass underneath, so I imagine it's for that.  The top and bottom lights are standard red flashing signals for the bridge. The four lights in between spell out STOP when the bridge is raised.

Source: I eat many burritos at the place down the street from this bridge.

Edit: A word Modern traffic lights do use an array of LEDs, good spotting! https://www.google.co.nz/maps/@-36.85839,174.763524,3a,26.2y,108.55h,89.67t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sskb62-RfHfQtB_oM_BHbpw!2e0!6m1!1e1

You might like these ones I go through in Auckland I work across that street, across the river from the map. That street is Jackson and you are standing at Union station. The cabbies all line up right there on Jackson as well as it being a bus stop. Bus and cab drivers in Chicago are commonly known to be blind. In actuality, driving in Chicago the first 3 seconds of a red light still mean go ahead. So to protect all the innocents just trying to get on and off a train, you would put that up too. the first time I drove in Chicago pretty much scared the life out of me and I realized that I had to be just as aggressive as everyone else. I kind of think it is more nerveracking to drive in the burbs outside of the city because at least I know they are nutso in the city itself. LOL. Chicago is full of incredible architecture. I love walking down Michigan avenue.   I've been there so many times and I still haven't seen this building. What's it called? Where is it? When did they construct it? A lot of really cool buildings don't even have their own names. Like, that building with the awesome crown that's next to the Sears (yeah fucking Sears) Tower? It's just called 311 S Wacker. No actual name. But looks freaking awesome. It will always be the Sears tower. 300 S. Wacker was built in 1971.  The reason you probably haven't seen it was because it was so nondescript and dull.  Before the map was painted on, [this is what it looked like](http://cdn.cstatic.net/images/gridfs/546267cdf92ea115350069e4/Screen%20Shot%202014-11-11%20at%201.44.14%20PM.png).  Not terribly exciting, and since it's not a Mies van der Rohe, it doesn't get the notoriety of the IBM Building or Federal Center.

The map was added just this past winter.  So if you've been avoiding the outdoors while the weather was crappy, you probably haven't gotten may chances to check it out. Holy crap that's neat! Thanks for posting this! It's almost too interesting... [I... Can't... Stop... Researching... This...

Chicago's architecture is THE BEST. And guess what? The latter three projects are all right next to each other! These are awesome! Are these future constructions? Yes they're all under construction. except for Wanda vista it was approved by the Alderman I think so we should be seeing it start soon hopefully  Lemme preface this by saying I HATE doing tourist shit...
If you are in Chicago and the weather is good, you absolutely have to do the architecture river tour.  It really is a lovely city. Was flying into O'Hare last March and the lake was frozen over. The sun was out and the skyline looked beautiful.  As a Chicago resident, I looked at this and thought, "I wonder where this is?" I am not a smart man. Been there 3 times,  didn't notice that.  It IS  a big city,  tho.  I will look for this when I go back.  Thank you for letting us know. Also you have to visit wicker park, a cubs game, and then to round it out, try to sneak in past a yellow light and block the intersection at 4:40 pm. So it's two blocks from the giant testicles then... I was wondering if anyone else noticed that. /r/mildlypenis 300 South Wacker Drive in case anyone is wondering, looks like it was taken from the south east corner of union station.  Oh man TIL there's a giant map on the side of the building I always feel bad for the working occupants of when I'm getting drunk at the MillerCoors building across the street.

I love you Brewers Unleashed. Now if it could only tell me where the nearest Dunkin Donuts is.. Simple. 2-3 blocks in any direction. You're in Chicago Across the street, inside the Willis Tower. The what? The Sears Tower. For life! Same with Comiskey Park!!!!!!! I dunno, I might have to call it the Black Tower if Blackstone buys it. "Across the street" (or closer) is almost always the correct answer to where the nearest Dunkin is downtown.  Yeah there's like 3 that are across the street from where I work Whatchu talking about, Willis Tower... And yet, Batman is still lost on Wacker. 

 That's because Chicago is second city to NO ONE It's second city to only itself. Because the first one got burnt down.  Fucking cows.  And Irish. Except the water tower. Building is alpha as fuck.  &gt;Because the first one got burnt down.

And then rebuilt on top of the dead city. Um. BRB, hiring an exorcist. sweet home..Chicago!  Loved living there! It's called an [ideo locator]( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ideo+locator) (points to self) This ideot always knows where he's at, thankyouverymuch. Two Chicago front page posts! Chicago is the birthplace of the skyscraper. Some of the most prestigious Architectural and Engineering firms in the world are located there Sargent &amp;Lundy, LB Knight HOH. I provided tech services for 15 years to them and they had projects around the globe. Chicago is a beautiful highly designed city. Chicago is also home to Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, which did the architecture and engineering for the Sears Tower and the Burj Khalifa. And on the side of that tiny red thing, there is another map.

I love Eddit! That is really annoying that the orientation is wrong.
 The orientation is correct, the road you see in the foreground of the picture is actually the Jackson Blvd. bridge over the Chicago River, [the building itself still has a N-S orientation on the land between the river and Wacker Drive](https://www.google.com/maps/place/300+S+Wacker+Dr,+Chicago,+IL+60606/@41.8776918,-87.6451354,791a,20y,90h,41.47t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x880e2cbfa283c1c1:0xa410bc833915e0fd!2s300+S+Wacker+Dr,+Chicago,+IL+60606!3b1!3m1!1s0x880e2cbfa283c1c1:0xa410bc833915e0fd).

You don't actually think they'd spend several hundred thousand dollars on this thing and mess something up you could look up on Google in like 10 seconds, do you? What  /u/5446monkey is saying is from this vantage point the map should technically be horizontal.  He's not saying the orientation of the marker representing the building is wrong, he's saying the map should have been on the south side of the building, or the map itself should have been made so that east is up. Anyone know where this is? Looks like its on the river  It is 300 s Wacker. Across Union Station. First time I saw it I thought it was a reflection of the roads and the river.  Its so nice and black.  Where is this located? Next time I'm downtown I want to find this place. 300 S Wacker If all buildings did this, you'd see yourself moving on a map as you drove by. This should be a thing... A very expensive thing I live and work in Chicago and had no idea this was here  Except the red blob is clearly on the other side of the road? I'm confused That's the river, it's on the correct side. The river runs down the centre of the map. The bridge that takes up the bottom of the picture is the one above the red blob on the map. The major road that's approximately parallel to the river and goes to the right of the red blob is the road that can be seen in the bottom left corner, at the intersection with the green light. So the map is correct. Fuck, how have I never noticed this? I live in Chicago and I am really bad at directions. Makes sense I would never find it.. It's just a texture glitch. What temps are you getting on your CPU &amp; GPU? /r/outside That was fun for a little while So what floor am I on? Yes I work near this and never knew. Now I have to check it out. Wonder where it is... That's good for lost planes. I wonder how long until they take the opportunity to let companies sponsor their locations on the map This building is so beautiful and i like it. How many maps could a map maker map if a map maker could map maps? I walked by this the other day and wondered what that red dot meant. It all makes sense now! Does anyone know if this is a 'north up' or a 'heads up' map? North is up I've worked 2 blocks west for 2 years and yesterday was the first time I've ever noticed it when I walked past. To see it on Reddit the very next day is fuckin' weirding me out.  Is this thing new? Yes, it went up towards the end of last year, I imagine if you've been avoiding being outside for most of the winter, you haven't had many chances to see it yet. Wow I thought that woman in the crosswalk was walking with her arm raised a la Michael Jackson until I looked closer. This is so cool. Might fare well in [r/mapporn](http://reddit.com/r/mapporn/).

I pointed this out to my gf a couple months ago. We were sitting right out side union station. Took me a couple of minutes looking at it though.

heh Darude - BrandStorm What about toads? The same thing that happens to everything else. Except metallic things. I would pay to have that on my arm. You can. Sadly it goes away after a few days. So a weekly re-application of lightning? I believe I'd have it tattooed You can't, it's a fractal. Why not? Because it's a fractal and no tattoo artist could do a high enough resolution to make it look good. While I agree they wouldn't be able to infinitely replicate self-similarity I'm pretty sure a good tattoo artist could follow enough of the lines to make it look decent. I think it would end up on the bad tattoo sub. Yeah, you're probably right.

Maybe someone could try it as henna. That way if it sucks it's only there for a few weeks at most. That is cooler than any tattoo.  YOOOUUU SHALL NOT PAAARR!! That doesn't sound right but I don't know enough about flag posts to dispute it 

 I'm guessing that not THIS particular flagstick got hit, because it would probably have been demolished in the process.  Golf courses also move the holes frequently, usually early every morning when they finish mowing and rolling the greens. Either this picture was taken within hours of the storm ending or the strike lines remained long enough for them to cycle through the usual hole locations and three or four days later, the greens keeper cut the hole in the exact same spot (which I totally would do because it looks awesome). Personally, I think the first option is fairly likely, as long as the weather cleared up enough for them to continue play, and things dried out fairly quickly, which they do in Utah. It's not hard to imagine the first group of golfers taking pictures of this. Aren't they made out of fiberglass? Usually the mount for the flag and the knobby bit that fits in the cup are both metal, for lightning that jump is probably really easy. Well, considering it's already jumping from the clouds... Fun fact: [it also jumps from the ground.](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/lightning/faq/)

In fact, the strike from the ground to the clouds is the part you see. The "knobby bit" is called a ferrule. Fuck yes. I live to learn random shit like that ...which, incidentally, is also the name for the little metal ring that holds the eraser on the back end of a pencil. Is there a mildly interesting TIL? There should be one for facts like this. 

Also MITIL: the plastic or metal bits wrapped around the ends of shoelaces and hoodie strings are called aglets. Is this at the Eaglewood Golf Course? Is that what that loud crack was today during the thunderstorm? I believe it was Stonebridge. :) Whoa, hey - I've lived next to that golf course since I was a kid! this should be in /r/interestingasfuck Interest in "gas fuck"?

[^bot ^info](http://www.reddit.com/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index) Looks like Thor was playing golf with mjolnir well zeus just managed a hole in one... I know I am late to the game, but after working at a golf course for a couple of years, I have to say this is much more likely a grass fungus. 


With different kinds of grasses (common on US courses like Perennial Ryegrass, Bentgrass, or Burmuda) you will see fungi manifest differently. This can be seen in the fairly common event of fairy rings [\(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_ring\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_ring). 

It is much more difficult to see these occur in normal lawns or even high rough on courses, but when you are dealing with a green where the grass height is measured in fractions of an inch (millimeters for you euro folk) these base and root diseases and fungi become evident overnight.

This will probably never be seen :(

 I saw it! Maybe it's best the others didn't though because they were so excited. I'm sorry for your late post. :( You remind me of myself.  Also consider that greens are now mowed far shorter than they have in the past. We have mowed as low as .090 inches.  20 years ago .200 inches would have been impossible. So is this spot dangerous at all after the strike? Not with a decent putter Wouldn't it be safe, cause you know, lightning never strikes the same spot twice.  If you find yourself on a golf course in a lightening storm, the best thing to do is bend over and get your head as close to the ground as possible. It wont save you from being struck but it will increase the chances of someone else getting a hole in one.  The most likely scenario here is the flagstick itself did not get hit (since it's made of non-conducting fiberglass) but the solid aluminum cup that's in the ground got struck. 
I imagine if it were seen in action it would look like the stick got struck but almost all of the current applied to the ground would have bypassed the stick and gone straight through the cup.
 I wouldn't be surprised, if there were a picture of the cup, to see it's shape changed or a hole burnt through it.  heh "flagstick" looks like some varicose veins Mildly interesting to us, but mildly frustrating for greens keepers. What course??  /r/woahdude for sure.

The universe is fractal, man. Why does everything in nature make that formation at its core? Lightning, plant life, veins, rivers, everything has branching lines. A little Visine will clear that up. I'm pretty sure it wasn't THIS flagstick.  Maybe another one that has since gone to a better place. These are called Lichtenberg images. When a person gets struck by lightning, they're called [Lichtenberg scars](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/66/e5/5b/66e55b731df26919599367fb8c45e880.jpg)  I guess Thor got a hole in one  See also:

https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/254kge/grass_after_a_lightning_strike/ My first thought was, shit that flagpole is unscathed. I guess you can say that's a...hole in one? 

Ill see myself out fun fact: you get these same marks on your skin if you get struck by lightning. 

Called a lichtenburg figure  /r/interestingasfuck This isn't lightning.  Its a type of fungus that is a  pest in to greens keepers.  The placement  of  the cup was probably just a worker being cheeky as they get moved around the greens all the time.

Source: Greens keeper for 2 years. Like /u/floorp said it's probably a fungus. If it was that flagstick was struck by lightning there wouldn't be a flag on the stick. Either lightning or fungus they make this shape dominated by diffusion. It's called diffusion limited aggregation.

&gt;

&gt;__Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA)__ is the process whereby particles undergoing a [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) due to [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion) cluster together to form aggregates of such particles. This theory, proposed by [T.A. Witten Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Witten) and L.M. Sander in 1981,  is applicable to aggregation in any system where [diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion) is the primary means of [transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_phenomena) in the system. DLA can be observed in many systems such as electrodeposition, [Hele-Shaw flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hele-Shaw_flow), mineral deposits, and [dielectric breakdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_breakdown).

&gt;The clusters formed in DLA processes are referred to as [Brownian trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_tree). These clusters are an example of a [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal). In 2-D these [fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractals) exhibit a dimension of approximately 1.71 for free particles that are unrestricted by a lattice, however computer simulation of DLA on a lattice will change the [fractal dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension) slightly for a DLA in the same [embedding dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_dimension). Some variations are also observed depending on the geometry of the growth, whether it be from a single point radially outward or from a plane or line for example. Two examples of aggregates generated using a microcomputer by allowing [random walkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) to adhere to an aggregate (originally (i) a straight line consisting 1300 particles and (ii) one particle at center) are shown on the right.

&gt;Computer simulation of DLA is one of the primary means of studying this model. Several methods are available to accomplish this. Simulations can be done on a lattice of any desired geometry of [embedding dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_dimension), in fact this has been done in up to 8 dimensions,  or the simulation can be done more along the lines of a standard molecular dynamics simulation where a particle is allowed to freely random walk until it gets within a certain critical range at which time it is pulled onto the cluster. Of critical importance is that the number of particles undergoing Brownian motion in the system is kept very low so that only the diffusive nature of the system is present.

&gt;__Lichtenberg figures__ (*Lichtenberg-Figuren* (German), or "Lichtenberg dust figures") are branching [electric discharges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_discharge) that sometimes appear on the surface or in the interior of [insulating materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_insulation). Lichtenberg figures are often associated with the progressive deterioration of high voltage components and equipment. The study of planar Lichtenberg figures along insulating surfaces and 3D [electrical trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_treeing) within insulating materials often provides engineers with valuable insights for improving the long-term reliability of high voltage equipment.

No... watch out...  How is the flag still there?  Oh, gorgeous. I love the Earth's Lichtenberg Figures. They're beautiful- like humans who scar this way when they're (we're?) struck by lightning, too.  The proof that even god hates golf.

join us at /r/nongolfers  It looks like a confused, upside down tree. Hey! That pole isn't a tree, physics! Those shadows are all funky!  Crazy Shadows man. wow Zeus just drove a 24,000yrd ace.  What's even cooler is that if a human is struck by lightning, they have the same tree-branch pattern burns on their skin! Looks like earths vein system or brain synapses. OH RAT FARTS!!! Flagpole is hollow plastic and would have caught fire or exploded.. It probably hit just the cup without the flag in it.  I bet that green is lightning fast now Thank you for not spelling it as "lightening." This happened a couple years ago at Ironwood Golf Course in Normal, IL as well.

http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/15192a/local_golf_course_after_being_struck_by_lightning/ That's pretty cool! One fact I learned long ago is that golf and fishing are the two of the most deadly sports in terms of per capita deaths, because of lightning strikes. I'd keep playing. I don't think the heavy stuff's gonna come down for quite awhile.  ["Ohhhhh Rat farts!!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmXc1Vz8A8) Amazing coincidence - being struck by lightning is about as common as me sinking a putt! the iron banner awaits Is there any standardheight for a flagstick? Just to estimate the radius of the grass burned around It looks like the flagstick got confused about what shadow is should be casting.

 Something tells me I'm going to stop playing at the first sign of a storm from now on. People must have been playing on Sunday. It looks like the pole is dreaming of being a tree That is one healthy root system  This worries me. A flagstick wouldn't be much taller than I am. And I have a healthy fear of being struck by lightning. Looks like a tree disguised as a flag stick, only the shadow gives away the real shape under sunlight.

Looks like Thanksgiving point golf course. Is that the actual flagstick that got struck, or is there nothing left of that one? And this is why you don't stand under trees during a thunderstorm you will still get shocked. This looks to be the most blatant photoshop I've ever seen. The flag looks like microsoft paint. There is almost 0% chance this is real.  zues is the worst to golf with Gross. Look at those spider veins. 0/10 would not fuck I save 100 frogs a year with 4 in my pool.

Ah, forget it me too thanks Yeah four bad ass ninja frogs with territorial issues, have fun swimming  Yeah, once my wife turned on the hot tub and got in then after a couple minutes I heard her screaming about a "god damned dead frog".  These things are way better than finding dead frogs in the pool. How do you know you are saving frogs if they use it to escape? it's a smart frog ramp that tweets after every save Literally someone designing this right now.

 Frog protection Fraud Protection [deleted] Because they don't work that well. the chlorine in the water kills frogs quicker than they can usually get to the side of the pool, sad to think about :(
 It's a salt water pool. I don't know if that makes a difference  Actually salt water pools have the same amount of chlorine (about 1-5ppm) as a traditional chlorine pool. In a pool with a salt water system, you add a few hundred pounds of salt (the amount depends on the pool volume but you need to be in the neighborhood of 3200ppm) to the water. Then you install a chlorine cell into your plumbing somewhere after the filtering system. As the water flows through this cell, the sodium chloride (salt) is converted, via electrolysis, into  sodium hypochlorite and hypochlorous acid, or in other words good ol' fashion pool chlorine. Once the chlorine reacts with organic wastes in the water it converts back to sodium chloride and the process just keeps repeating itself. That's kind of an ELI5 explanation but that's essentially all that's happening. 
Salt water pools are all the rage these days and everybody with a pool wants one but most of the benefits people attribute to salt systems just aren't true. If you have a pool and are considering switching to salt do yourself a favor and do some serious research into the pros and cons to decide if it's really worth it for you (spoiler: it isn't!) 

Source: I own a pool supplies/service business  Actually I think salt water would be worse than just chlorine. Not sure if it would kill them that quick though, I've seen frogs swim plenty far in a chlorine pool. Pool guy here! Salt water pools should have about 1/10th the amount of salt than the ocean (3000 ppm versus the ocean at 30k+ ppm). Salt pools generate chlorine while the system and the salt cell are on... So basically your maintaining a consistent chlorine level (or should be at least) at a recommended 2-3 ppm, maybe up to 5ppm in the summer which, at least here in southern cal, our tap water has about .5-1 ppm chlorine already ... So it shouldn't be killing frogs that quickly. Now most home owners over chlorinate their pools to prevent algae which would understandably kill the frogs faster It doesn't. Salt water pools still have chlorine in them. Nah. They've been talking with your cat. The cat waits at the end of the ramp with this mouth open so the frogs can hop right in. I should think that pool chemicals are more to blame here than lack of/being unable to find an exit. &gt; Something tells me frogs can't read instructions.

Something tells me you stole your dad's joke. That's how it begins.  One of us.  One of us.  One of us... How the hell is a frog supposed to find that? Proximity problems, it's a wasteland out there. The problem is that there are no instructions.   Put up a sign that says 'Frog Exit Here' and the dead frog problem will go away. I used to have [one of these](http://www.amazon.com/Critter-Skimmer-10-Inch-Square-Cover/dp/B003G30FJE). It replaces the lid on your skimmer basket and helps the ones that get sucked in. Went from probably 3 dead frogs a day to none. I work in the pool industry and this seems like it would work a lot better. I typically find my dead creatures in the skimmer.  Does the spiral go into the basket or something?  I think my basket has a cross bar, i don't see this working with it On the model I had it was right around water level. The basket had a handle that folded to the side like a bucket. We had a pool when I was growing up and my brother's bedroom looked over it in the backyard and got the sunrise. One morning, after he'd moved out, I was enjoying the view, and decided to snap a picture.

Later that day, in the afternoon, I found a dead squirrel in the pool. It bummed me out, and I fished it out and left it behind the pool shed for any scavengers to eat.

I was looking through my pics for the day later on and there it was, floating dead in the corner of the pool, in the picture I had taken that morning. I didn't even notice it... 

Anyway, that got me paying closer attention to what was floating in the pool and I saved a few frogs as a result, as well as a chipmunk which went on to terrorize my parents' garden for the next two years. The end.  You should have killed that chipmunk when you had the chance.  It's okay, he was hit with a barrage of freedom in the end What a weirdly hilarious first world problem: my frogs can't get out of my pool, better get em a ramp.  Way better than scraping they dead asses out of the bottom. Wonder if this works for lizards Just get a largemouth bass, the frogs will never reach the bottom. Well not till they come out of the bass's anyway.   Gonna have to breed a bass that can live in stagnant, chlorinated water. Need to call my friends at Monsanto.  A fish that could survive in chlorinated water would be pretty fucking sweet. the ultimate pool novelty: your own personal diving experience.  Yeah but... fish poo. Thats what the chlorine and filters are for... What's what the frogs, ducks, bacteria, freshwater clams, etc. are for! by this point it's a pond And then you hire a rural man and woman to live in your shed and keep the population of animals in check, and hope that they rut in the spring and have children to continue their word. I have a saltwater pool, I can get a shark instead! *with ^fricken lasers one would hope* you can have natural mineral cleansed pool water without chlorine today. used some kind of sand filter thing or something. lasts a very long time, less maintenance than chlorine and better for you.  Careful they might take the idea, have it patented by tomorrow and sue you for still having the idea in your head.  But GMOs are evillll! *redirects argument to avoid the actual issue as always happens* I don't think it's GMOs so much as it is Monsanto. It's a pity, really. Serious question here. Why can't we just have large fish tanks that we swim in? You can and people have posted some examples.

The reason it's not more common or why you don't see swimming pools stocked with fish in people's yards? An ecology is a lot messier and harder to maintain than a heavily chlorinated freshwater pool.

Also fish poop.  We do. At aquariums. Your aquariums sound more interesting. I've never encountered one that let you swim with the fishes. There should be a series of Mob-run front aquariums (aquaria?) where you can sleep with the fishes. http://www.flaquarium.org/mobile/planning-to-visit-the-florida-aquarium/interactive-programs.aspx

I always feel bad fishing them out. I mean, it's much nicer to them to have a method of escape for them if they fall in, if you're going to have a pool, even if this one is apparently not totally effective. They flock to the pool, and then die in a kermit-soupy mess.  Reminds me of the salmon cannon to get salmon over dams.

EDIT: Wow ... I live in Canada - only hot 3-4 months of the year so I guess the frogs stay away? Florida. source: gramma had a pool. so many frogs in there.  Mississippi as well. Iowa checking in.

It's a magical place with a combination of hydrogen and oxygen where frogs drown apparently We don't have this "combination of hydrogen and oxygen" you speak of here in California. Oregon here. I have a pool and ponds, so we have many frogs.  Might as well just say all the Deep South, really.  Upstate new yorker here. With an in ground pool we would have around 5 frogs every morning from june to august. Most of em didnt make it by the time we woke up and checked the pool :( You must not have a pool I'm in Texas, and some mornings when you go out to the pool there will literally be hundreds of baby frogs stuck on the sides.  Texas always has to one up  That and junebugs. Junebugs everywhere Here in Arkansas, it's a problem as well.  Have a pool in Florida and we always have frogs swimming in the pool that we rescue in the morning.  Arizona here. We have many toads where I live. If I don't rescue them in time, my mom will scoop them out (alive) and throw them in the garbage dumpster, or they just die from the chlorine.. This ramp idea is genius. it's not just frogs, squirrels and mice and all sorts of poor little creatures would drown if they couldn't get out :( It's like having a little ladder in the bathtub for moths!

Wouldn't the chlorine water kill the frogs pretty quickly? Unless they can get out, yes But even after they get out don't they die from it soon after? They are the most sensitive animal when it comes to chemical contaminants. All amphibians are sensitive due to their skins being so permeable.  You need to get the Deluxe Frog Log. That one comes with a frog shower so they can rinse off. Walmart has them for $59.99 and the plumbing is real simple.   *Now with less trenching required!! Don't forget the wax-and-blow-dry attachment! As long as they die outside they aren't really a problem. Cats or birds will eat them. Yeah, this isn't really to save the frogs, its to not have frogs die in your pool. yup,let nature take care of itself outside my pool. :( No, not unless the pool is dangerously over chlorinated.    It's a myth that pools are loaded with chlorine, especially private pools with light bather load.

Free chlorine in a pool should be between 1-3 ppm.  Believe it or not, drinking water can have as much as 4 ppm chlorine.

My experience with frogs in the pool is that they bloat due to osmosis, so severely that it is fatal if they do not get out in time.  My family owns a pool and he's correct, the chlorine shouldn't get to levels that can kill frogs and you would probably be able to tell that the chlorine levels were too high if it was high enough to kill frogs. I like your faith in people's intelligence. I think this may be the most specific invention ever created.

One night, after weeks of listening to these frogs (sounded similar to a duck quack but longer and more drawn out) ex decided he was going to go out there with a broom and run them off. We are thinking there's got to be at least 20 out there with the noise how it was.

So, he goes out just as the sun had gone down and they started their thing. There were exactly 2. 2 damn tiny little tree frogs making all that noise.  They are SO loud. I once tried to take a phone call on the back porch. The frogs drowned me out so completely that not only could I not hear the person I was talking to, THEY couldn't hear me. All they could hear were frogs.
 There's a poem called Tarantulas on the Lifebuoy by Thomas Lux that seems relevant to this



For some semitropical reason   
when the rains fall   
relentlessly they fall

into swimming pools, these otherwise   
bright and scary
arachnids. They can swim
a little, but not for long

and they cant climb the ladder out.
They usually drownbut   
if you want their favor,
if you believe there is justice,   
a reward for not loving

the death of ugly
and even dangerous (the eel, hog snake,   
rats) creatures, if

you believe these things, then   
you would leave a lifebuoy
or two in your swimming pool at night.

And in the morning   
you would haul ashore
the huddled, hairy survivors

and escort them
back to the bush, and know,
be assured that at least these saved,   
as individuals, would not turn up

again someday
in your hat, drawer,
or the tangled underworld

of your socks, and that even
when your belief in justice
merges with your belief in dreams
they may tell the others

in a sign language   
four times as subtle
and complicated as mans

that you are good,   
that you love them,
that you would save them again. The imagery of a pulling a buoy coated in tarantulas out of the pool gives me the heebie jeebies.  That's the point of the poem. That you be kind to all forms of life not matter how ugly, terrifying, or disgusting, and perhaps you'll be rewarded, whether that be by the natural system of justice, or by the tarantulas themselves (or maybe they're one and the same ;)   ) I wonder if rodents would be smart enough to use this. I pull out more dead rats out of my pool skimmer than I like to admit. Rats are very smart, so they'd probably know how to use it. Your friend, and everyone else who saves froggies, are awesome!   Solid username You should crosspost this to /r/HumansBeingBros  Didn't know frog problem was that serious.  Frog protection. I'm pretty sure we're on the same page.  My parents have a pool and a pond on their property. When the pond gets low, the ducks will start going in the pool. When the ducks have ducklings, they bring them into the pool. Because the ducklings are small, they have trouble getting out of the pool so we put together a makeshift ramp for them to get out.  [Our campus did the same to the fountain](http://www.washington.edu/news/archive/images/20100401_pid56628_aid56626_2_w400.jpg) I first read this as "so dogs can get out of his pool." I was so confused. Don't worry. That is also a thing.

http://www.americas-pet-store.com/dog-ramps-for-pools.html Whaddaya got for bunnies? So far, we've fished out 3 :(  Two were already there when the spring loaded cover came off (how'd they even get in?), and one yesterday - mostly dead, left it in the grass a good 15 feet from the pool only to find it completely dead, back in the pool this morning. The pool has only been open 10 days. It's going to be a bad year. Have you considered that it may have been bunny suicide?  It seems determined. I think you might need to ask yourself what draws suicidal animals to your property. Are you Japanese by chance? My minions thank you!  I need one of those. Will also let spiders and crickets exit the pool safely... Helps keep the pool clean and minimizes insect trauma ;-) Ugh traffic must be a bitch between 10pm and midnight, and heaven forbid there is an accident... This is the cutest mildly interesting thing I've ever seen The tourist guides for the frogs us missing.  They will get lost and will not find the ramp... 

Or, this is "I am a good person "  ramp, nothing you do with the frogs...  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004UHY2TY/ref=mp_s_a_1_8?qid=1432591244&amp;sr=8-8&amp;pi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70&amp;keywords=pool+toys&amp;dpPl=1&amp;dpID=51IY%2BXZ8MML&amp;ref=plSrch Your friend is awesome for this How many frogs died in that pool for your friend to decide he needed a frog ramp? So, is this Frog Protection? Baby ducks are constantly getting stuck in my pool.  This looks very useful, tired of fishing them out by hand.  Frogs die when they swim in chlorine. Most useless invention ever. This is a Great idea!! It helps the frogs and helps to keep filters free of dead frog I so need one of these, our pool is like frog suicide central. We make chicken wire 'escape ramps' for critters to get out of our horse water troughs.
 that would be the FrogRamp5000 [It's not just for frogs though](http://i.imgur.com/TU4JsOT.jpg) Add another on the top right and you could have a 3 way basketball game. I totally want to see this now. A three team game, 15 players on the court, three baskets. There could be a rule that you can  score on two of the three rather than just one, then you'd only have to defend one. Points would count against the defending basket rather than for the scoring team. 

Does anyone else want to try this? There's a park I used to go to that has a court like that. There are three hoops and the court itself is shaped like a basketball.

Who's up for a road trip? I need 14 of you crazy fuckers... and some volunteer refs.  I'll bring the bourbon. I ref soccer/football and have never really watched basketball, but I'll ref. &gt;shaped like a basketball.

If teams A and B are good and C is really bad, teams A and B are only going to go after each other's baskets. If A went for C, B could go for A and get the advantage, and vice versa. The only way to stop this would be teaming up against C to run up their score early, but let's presume collusion is against the rules.

Game theory or whatever I guess. Imagine the ranking system used for league stsndings. I'd make it so that the winning team gets two points and the losing team gets none. The middle team (team with second best score) gets a point in the standings (similar to nhl with an OT loss).  We could have a new sport here!

A game for crackers. free throw a ball in each hand at the same time One hour later:  Alright and the bumpers will activate a double points round and ah fuck, it's pinball, we're talking about pinball. EVERY FUCKING IDEA I HAVE IS ALREADY TAKEN. MULTIBALL I'd like to believe this is a [Waterman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wJO4InRwE) reference. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq1d07gYl8o Shit, nigga, add two. Would that solve the issue though? I mean it would in a way, but it'd still be a game of chicken between teams A and B to see who's going to crack and just settle for second place/1 point. I think this is why three teams competing against each other don't work. It's an interesting point, but I think part of teams A and B being "good" is that they'd both be well aware of this situation already. 

I mean come on -- this is all really just the kind of fundamentals threesketball strategy we learned playing pick up games on the old neighborhood threesketball court, or in our neighbor's triangular, flying car drivewanding pad. Well, the proper strategy for all teams is collude on defense and simply outnumber the attacker.

    A+C will defend Bs offense, no matter whose basket is because both lose when B scores.
    B+C will defend As offense, likewise. 
    A+B will team up to defend Cs offense so as to create turnovers and regain posession in order to score. 
    A can never NOT defend C because C can retaliate by cooperating with B. And vice versa. 


You can basically count C out of winning before the tip-off, as at any point they get ahead, A + B will obviously collude to even the game back up. However the chances C ever goes ahead when by dedinition they are the *worst team* and theyre being double teamed by the two other teams any tjme they go try to score ... not real likely.

So you end up with (A+C vs. B) and (B+C vs. A) where C gets to pick the winner.  Well but that's why I included the part of no collusion. Because let's say C gets ahead. A is the next team with the ball, and they go after C and score. The next time B has the ball, they view it as their chance to pull out ahead of A, especially since A is taking care of C. But then B sees that and says "Screw you A, I'm not doing the dirty work of taking out C by myself!" and they go back at A. 

If A goes for B, B is best off going for A to keep even. 
If A goes for C, B is best off going for A to pull ahead.
If B goes for A, A is best off going for B to keep even.
If B goes for C, A is best off going for B to pull ahead.

The Nash equilibrium is A and B only going after each other and C winning. At least I think so.

Note: This only works if there's no differentiation between 2nd and 3rd place. As in, only the winner advances or something. **If you're looking for a professional 3-team sport, you should check out [kinball](http://youtu.be/WztPRLP9vx8)!** It's a popular game in Quebec, and increasingly parts of Canada.

I hope everyone checks this out because it's super awesome. Here are the [2013 World Championships](http://youtu.be/GlhsvfIlQwM), this shows how epic it can be! lol. "popular"

I remember when these guys came to my high school 15 years ago, telling us how this would be in the olympics and be the new hockey. The guy almost sounded like a sect guru. my german is pretty bad, but are those commentators prepubescent? I think you overestimated your german, because they're speaking french.  Okay that was pretty cool. It's a weird sport, but looks fun, I'd give it a shot Once I went and read the rules it seems like a pretty cool sport. What rules? This is the way to end the Clippers curse. New rule: one team can't score on the same basket twice in a row It doesn't work the same way as the famous game theory duel. In that problem, the person being "scored upon" (IE shot) *loses* something, rather than the scorer winning something. That is what incentivizes the stronger players to target each other. 

In the proposed threeskaball game, you get the same benefit no matter who you score on. What would actually happen is that the stronger teams would go for easy points by scoring on the weak team.  I'm not sure whether this was clearly stated in the "threesketball" rules, but I'm operating under the impression that the team that gets scored upon gets a point, and it's best to have the lowest amount of points. (Or the scored upon team loses a point) This was exactly what I meant.  Mexican standoff basket ball!!!

That's what I'm gonna call it anyway. [deleted] Maybe 2 points for 1 point against?  That way you have some incentive to go on the team that is better, but the game isn't about picking a team to lose. the reason the game doesn't really work is that whoever is in the lead would be ganged up on, so all of the teams would be forced to near equality. of course there must be a winner, but the winner would be almost random near the end, that is of course assuming that two teams could team up to beat one team and that the one team isnt a team of all time nba players You've just described how Ross Perot, and his 3rd Party, almost became President of the United States in 1992. Damn, I never realized Perot was actually leading in the polls as late as June You can simplify this into a 3 person game with one basket. AKA 21. [Not basketball, but a Norwegian TV show tried it with soccer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaBiwMpt5Oc) a little ridiculous to have goals that wide for indoor, buuut interesting point noted that 3-way matches also need 3-way scores! offense would be impossible. literally everyone would double teamed.  Sounds erotic Okay, then each team has to keep two players in their defensive end. Like soccer. So normal situations would be 4-on-3-&amp;-3 That's not a rule in soccer Well what I meant to say was "like the way soccer is played when I imagine it in my head because I don't really know how to play soccer" http://i.imgur.com/YdWhTH5.gif Alot like cut-throat in billiards/pool [Here's something similar.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_sided_football)  #####&amp;#009;

&gt;

&gt;__Three-sided football__ is a variation of [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) with three teams instead of the usual two. It was devised by the [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark) [Situationist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationist_International) [Asger Jorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asger_Jorn) to explain his notion of [triolectics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivalent_logic), his refinement on the [Marxian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx) concept of [dialectics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectics), as well as to disrupt one's everyday idea of football. Played on a [hexagonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon) pitch [(http://aaa.t0.or.at/images/feld.jpg), the game can be adapted for similarity to [soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_(soccer\)) as well as other versions of football.

&gt;Unlike in conventional football, where the winner is determined by the highest scoring of the two teams, no score is kept of the goals which a team scores, but conversely a count is taken of the number of goals conceded and the winning team is that which concedes the fewest goals. The game purports to deconstruct the confrontational and bi-polar nature of conventional football as an analogy of class struggle in which the referee stands as a signifier of the state and media apparatus, posturing as a neutral arbitrator in the political process of ongoing class struggle.

"I'll make it work" out of bounds bitch Out of bounds birch Reminds me of a story from Errol Flynn's autobiography.  He gave his parents a guest house next to his mansion in cuba, and one day he called them from his mansion in Hollywood and asked them to build him a runway so he could fly straight to his island property.  Eventually his dad called back and said "It's all built and paved, just as long as you asked."   Errol flew to cuba, and as night fell, he saw the end-of-runway beacon near his mansion and said "way to go pops" and went in to land.   Unfortunately, his folks noticed a beautiful old oak tree half way down the proposed runway, so they decided to build it with a 60 degree bend.  Errol nearly died. Still can't compensate for my shitty hook shot.  Maybe you shouldn't be taking half court hook shots... Thanks for the pointer Shaq.  How else is he going to get his girlfriend on Jeopardy?  You my friend are shooting for the Sudan!

And a hook shot. "And a hook shot!" coming from a brit, wtf is a hook shot! Attach the ball to a fishing rod, see if you can fish it in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPcniUfKRlU

Here are some examples from the master. They called it a sky hook when Kareem did it just because it was kinda his signature shot, and he was so big and shot it from so high up. 

It is pretty much unstoppable. It is considered unfashionable now and is rarely used because young men are stupid. Actually a lot of the center do hook shots.  Kareem Abdul Jabbar Mix - The Sky Hook: https://youtu.be/EMtZGfsWMCE Looks like they've made an excellent use out of an awkward space. Nice! It reminds me of this court in Croatia.  http://imgur.com/PXgZYyW

 [Or these soccer fields.](http://twentytwowords.com/satellite-images-of-sao-paulos-very-misshapen-soccer-fields-17-pictures/) Some of those clearly have the room to be shaped normally, lol. All of them, if they wanted it be properly symmetrical. But it's not necessary because the field shape don't really matter. 

Depending of the field and rules, if the ball is outside the lines they can keep playing. It makes the match be faster and the obstacles basically are part of the game.

Also, they have to change sides during the half time, so if a side is giving advantages to a team, it will revert soon. ~~Most*~~  
*Edit:* All* Looks to me like they filled in a pool. Notice the weird out of place pool ladder on the left  Never mind I'm blind... It's a bike rack lol I did this too, but am still convinced that it's a filled pool. Just looks like an old pool. i don't think i've ever seen a public pool that was anything but a square or rectangle, ever. No your vision is fine. I declare a high dive contest. those are pretty standard bike racks from where I come Does anyone else think it would be kind of fun to play a full court game on this.. If I throw a full court pass from the bottom left baseline to a team mate all the way up on the left wing...is that pass out of bounds? Don't think so. If a player grabs the ball and tosses it back in when out of bounds without touching the ground it's still in play You are correct. In soccer it would be out of bounds though. Only if it hits the ground out of bounds. No. In basketball either the ball or the player with the ball has to literally touch the ground to be out of bounds.

It's not like soccer where if the ball goes out of bounds in the air it's a foul. OFFSIDE!! A 3 quarter court trapping defense would be brutal. Now I want to watch a game of blernsketball. Eh, it's not the same since they made steroids mandatory An outdoor court with nets? Photoshop. It's one of those microsoft ergonomic basketball courts. Probably to prevent people from hogging the court with full court games  Looks like they just made do with what space they had. they could just set a rule: you have to run slower the closer you are to  the curved angle side Hogging the court? That is how basketball is played. Depends where you live I guess. When there aren't many courts, and lots of people want to play, it's polite to play half-court games. 

EDIT: To be clear, I'm not suggesting that full court games always get interrupted (although I've seen it). But if you know it's going to be crowded, you'll make more friends if you don't use the whole court.  i'm from louisville, where i would play basketball twice a day. if people are running full court you just call next. anybody who balls would rather run full court.  NYC checking in. Fuck half court. Canada checking in: wouldn't it be too easy to accidentally ice the puck? Do you really ice the puck? does it help it slide easier? oh, bless your heart

edit: I just think that phrase is funny...but I also might as well let you know that [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icing_%28ice_hockey%29) is what kid-karma was referring to. 

...to what he or she was referring.  I ways always called for that in sega NHL The truth is yes, the pucks are frozen before the game and the ref keeps them (like 14 for each game iirc) in a cooler with ice water during the game.

Source: I saw it as a "isnt that interesting" type segment during a hockey game. They showed the cooler tucked in by the off ice refs, pretty sure it was in the home teams penalty box or something but I may be wrong there.  I didn't think it was ice water, I thought it was a freezer that is set to a specific temp. But TBH I'm not certain.  Ice water ensures that they're bathed thoroughly. In 'normal' games there is just a bucket of ice water (primarily ice, but filled with water to fill in the gaps) where pucks are kept. The reason they do this is so shit like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXMnye_8wfg) doesn't happen (stops the puck from being bouncy). SC checking in. I played a sport once in highschool. Detroit checking in, half court is for pussies that can't ball for shit LA checking in. Also fuck half court.  It's not the same without fast breaks We usually have one or two full court games and then several half courts going on.

Everyone wins. Solved. Yup.  Thankfully our park had 3 total full courts.

2 Full count games (one usually for more serious players)

2 half court games (one usually running 21 or just shooting around) Louisville as well. Can confirm  To hell with that...yall can get next. Play the winner.  It's the pickup ball way.   Most people who go to the park aren't even about that full court life and would rather play 4s half court I never liked running 4 on 4 in a half court. Too crowded.  God that's terrible. I find 3 on 3 a little crowded after a while.  4's was always full. half only for 3's or 2's. and on those real hot days when it's just me and my boy we'll sometimes run full just to 10. usually run 3v3 with halfs, still more people playing on the court that way.  Yeh, I do my running on cardio day  Everywhere I've played protocol is 5 on 5 full-court and you call next to play winners Everywhere Ive played has been with middle school fat white kids like me, and all of agreed that you coukd fuck right off with running full court. Halfsies.

 Maybe if you ran full court, you wouldn't be a fattie? if my uncle had a vagina he'd be my aunt. Can confirm. My school used to have one single basketball court. We would play half-court games. Play for the court! Winner stays was always the rule we played by.  On a real team, not at the fucking park But they still did the center court circle... I would put a bench in the middle of it. not make it curve.  Why not just put the hoops against each other?

Edit: I don't understand why this idea is so foreign to you guys. It's not like they dont exist. Sure seems a lot more practical then curving an entire basketball court.

http://imgur.com/PEBme4H Every air ball or tipped pass going towards the basket will end up on the other court. Having 2 half courts side by side makes more sense If they're side by side and the ball goes OOB then wouldn't it go into the other court, too? Yes, but you aren't making every single shot towards the other court, so it would be a lot less common.  Plus it would be from the side rather than directly in your face as you play. Yes, but I think the idea is that people aren't generally trying to shoot towards the side of the court, so it's less likely to happen compared to someone shooting over the basket or tipping the ball. As long as we're making suggestions how about one hoop in the center with no backboard? This ain't team handball, son. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korfball Because then you would be running and shooting towards one another, every air ball would travel to the other and say someone on both courts were going for lay ups, there'd be a bigger chance of running into one another Seems like some excellent fullcourt strategy could be had

Passing through the OOB means it can't be picked off easily Thats about 5 blocks from me here in Denver this streetview of it is trippy. https://www.google.com/maps/@39.762049,-105.006467,3a,75y,152.49h,69.2t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1ssvCI5BfTAxaD3GkMG4N5mA!2e0
 Serious question to anyone who's played on it.... so is it terrible toplay on? Would it have been to just put in a half court? I'm a park planner and am genuinely curious what players reaction to this court is. Only in Denver!!! 5280  In LoHi, next to Prost brewery? Yeah have definitely played awkward full court pick up games there. I thought this was the one next to my house. Have definitely shot a few bricks there. [deleted] If you think about it, all basketball courts are curved man. How do you figure? Because Earth bro What if there are basketball courts that are built flat, and don't follow the curvature of the Earth. There has to be at least one out there. I feel like the majority of everything is built flat and doesn't follow the curvature of Earth.

Source: Have built things and own a level. If you used a level to build "flat" things, then those things follow the curvature of the Earth. Levels use gravity, not the actual straightness of a surface. But you normally set up that level in multiple spots in the structure... which would technically result in tracing earth's curvature into the foundation, if it were large enough. Maybe if you set up one laser level in one place for the entire structure, it would work. 

Although the difference between curved and flat is probably so minute that I strongly suspect that it's "within noise" anyway (human measurement error is greater than the difference between curved and flat to begin with). This is right. The Earth doesn't often curve, *locally*. It's a large-scale thing, in that the average radius of the Earth remains largely constant (relative to the size of the whole planet -- it can vary by about 20 miles); local variations, like hills or even just bumps or imperceptible gradients, usually remove any trace of curvature over (almost) any human-scale structure.

The concrete base of a normal-sized building will certainly be flat. Take a completely straight piece of lumber and lay it on the floor, for example.  [Would this game on an aircraft carrier count?](http://www.naso.org/Portals/0/111111-N-OK922-208.jpg) Honestly most are probably built this way.  On the other hand, it's a joke. Interesting perspective. Do you think the rooftops of skyscrapers are curved as well or is only the foundation curved and  everything built upwards of that is square?  They have curved courts. Curved. Courts. [deleted] Most pick up games are half-court anyway. Must depend where you play. I feel like I have rarely played half-court pickup games Angled* Great! Because I didn't suck at basketball enough *before*... Come again?

All I see is a pokeball stadium. well, duh!  einstein figured out that space is curved years ago. It's just an illusion, maaaaaan. "Ballin' at an obtuse angle." - RiFF RAFF Could of played for the Golden State but the court was too straight. at least this makes more sense than doing this to a tennis court For some reason I think this would be really cool to play full court on anyway. Anyone notice how clean that neighborhood is? No wonder its angled. Is this next to Scholts(?) out in Denver? I live one block away from this court!  Hit me up to play some basketball, and then afterwards drink some beers at prost!!! Well how else do you expect the skaters to curl the puck into the touchdown net? Game mods in real life [deleted] Didn't read this above,  huh? Looks like what happens every time I try to take a panorama on my iPhone. Redguards, with their damn curved swords. Hey! I've been there! That's right near a brewery in denver! This was obviously designed by an engineer from Texas A&amp;M University  do none of you play basketball? this is done so that 2 sets of teams(4 teams) can play at the same time.  Most pickup games are half court anyway. That's in downtown Denver! Well this is fucking awesome. I think a game on this court has the potential to be way more dynamic if you could run out of bounds before catching the ball inbounds. LoHi, Denver, CO!? also that cloud looks like a flying beaver [Could be worst.](http://www.evz.ro/image-original-605-388/2012-12/24teren_fotbal_inclinat.jpg) Swore I was in /r/CitiesSkylines for a second.  Theory: This may have been done to force *halfcourt only* games so that more people can use them at a time. This adds all of the excitement of nascar to basketball. When I was in Elementary School, Lunch breaks were always spent playing basketball.  For every full court, there were at least 5 balls in play, 10 teams, of 5 players each team.  Everybody knows who he was playing against and who his teammates were.  You run hoping you dont crash into anybody.  When you take a shot, you hope nobody else takes a shot at the same time so your balls dont hit each other.  Nobody complains, everybody knew the limitations. Fun times! Imagine a circular court, with both hoops on the same pole.  gotta make due with the space you have. only problem i see is they put the shittiest hoops on that nice court I feel like a normal shaped court wouldnt have been that hard.  This looks cool to play on. That's what I thought. Would have to be sure to switch up sides though. Right handed dribble down the short side and what not. "And here we have the plans including a nice pool for the kiddies..."  

"Now wait a minute Harry, that's going to cost us a fortune, plus we'll have to maintain it and staff it."  

"I see your point!  I'll go get new plans drawn up and we can take it up next meeting."  

"And waste more of our budget, leaving my brother-in-law sitting around for another month twiddling his thumbs with nothing to do?  Just scribble out what we don't need and write in basketball court.  Nobody will be any the wiser"  

"Done!"   That's not interesting, it's infuriating!! Why? Of all the cheap materials to use as filler, why use a smaller version of the thing you're making...? Only reason that comes to mind is it's already correctly weighted. Dice with rounded edges have no particular effort made to ensure proper weighting. 

(In fact, almost anything besides Casino dice have no effort made to "balance" them aside from symmetrical dimensions, but the rounded-corner ones in particular [have stuff done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSQIir5xxWc) to them that imbalances them further).

 Nice video link! How did he turn that black d6 dice into all the smaller different color and different sided dice?  Would love to see a .gif of that last part.  Starts about 5:10 until 5:17 It wasn't until I read your comment that I realized he didn't just throw a handful of dice down and it wasn't just a crummy joke. Looks like the people there missed it too. [Here you go.](http://i.imgur.com/oT2lphi.gifv) Still can't tell. [My guess is](/s "that the tray he is holding is magnetic. The d6 holds everything and flattens out to reveal the other dice inside it. Maybe it's made of metal so it sticks to the tray when flat.") **Using spoilers to not ruin it for people who might not want to know.** Link is broken?  I want to know! It's a spoiler tag. First time running into one of those. I only browse on mobile(bacon reader) and it doesn't work as intended. I think I figured it out:

 The black outer sides of the black dice are made out of some kind of metal, unlike the inner portion which is made out of different colored plastic dice. The container where he throws the big dice is lined by a thin magnetic sheet. 

Once he throws the big black dice onto the container it breaks into all of the different pieces and the outer faces (black faces) end up facing the magnetic side of the container, thus only revealing the colored portions. Nah, you're overthinking it. Most tricks like this are a thousand times more simple than you think.

I don't know what it is for sure, but the simplest and most obvious way to do this trick is this. He is holding a box with lots of dice in it. The box is just five (it doesn't need a top) squares that are hinged, the only thing keeping it together is him gripping it.

Once it leaves his hand it starts to open a bit, and once it hits a surface it fully opens. It doesn't rebound or anything becasue of the weight of the tiny dice on it. Its hard to tell the box opened because the inner pattern of the "dice" box is the same as the pattern of the plate.

The box could be magnetized or whatever, but it doesn't need to be so it probably isn't. Took this [screencap](http://i.imgur.com/Sr04wqX.jpg) and it doesn't look like a box with sides. My guess is each dice has a black side that faces down thanks to a magnetic plate (it totally looks like the magnetic plates you get from hardware stores for screws) Zocchi talks big about his precision dice, but the paint on those things has to be the cheapest money can buy. It was literally rubbing off the first time we used them, and within a month it was gone. Truly a disappointing purchase, and a problem I've never had with far cheaper dice. I thought they didn't come with paint at all. You can order them with the numbers either painted or unpainted.

They generally hold up well in my experience, but there are bound to be some that get a slapdash job and aren't caught. Doing QC on small multi-sided oddly-shaped polyhedra isn't trivial.

That said, if the paint comes off, it isn't some great challenge to repaint them yourself. The original science dice had no paint; the big complaint about them was that there were hard to read. Most people would ink the numbers on the dice. I can't say what you purchased, but it wasn't original design Gamescience dice.

 It is possible that your dice are part of company they sold the production rights to. Zocchi recently announced that they have reaquiring the dice and are producing them once again to a high quality standard. Zocchi here.  Thank you for your feedback.  We are sorry to hear that your purchase was disappointing.  This is normally not the case, and you may have received a defective unit.  If you bring your dice back to the store with a copy of this message, we will make sure that your dice are replaced at no cost.  Thank you! Yep, I'm severely doubting that this account is legitimate. I appreciate the sentiment, but those dice have already been given away. I can only hope my experience was not indicative of the quality of your products in general. Hearing that the rounded-corner dice have *stuff* done to them makes them sound dirty. Like... butt stuff? If you get any set of dice from an LGS designed for tabletop play, you can be assured that most of the dice from big name companies are weighted properly. Interestingly, the inner die is not oriented the same as the outer die. The cracked face is 6 but the underlying face is 4.  That's because it's only a four sided die. That makes no sense whatsoever. The white has only four because now the blue die has two extra sides (inside and outside), which takes away from the six sides the white die was originally made with.  The math checks out, guys Your math is wrong, I only see 3 sides. Precision isn't important if you're making rounded dice. Only the casino ones with straight edges are made with concerns about being weighted. Just the fact that the pips are holes instead of paint is enough to off-weight the die. It's probably a second (damaged or incorrectly made product). They can just shove it to a different part of the factory and use it as filler. It might throw the weight off a little bit... but if you're buying rounded dice you've already decided you don't care that much about precision anyway. &gt; if you're buying rounded dice you've already decided you don't care that much about precision anyway

TIL that dice elitism is a thing

 Hah, sorry, I didn't mean to sound snobby. Really, rounded dice aren't *that* much worse than precision dice when it comes to randomness, it's just that there can be some variation in the edges, which could lead to tendencies in rolling. It's usually not enough to be that noticeable, but some people do care about that sort of thing. And places like casinos get *very* particular about the precision of their dice. &gt; And places like casinos get very particular about the precision of their dice.


Don't forget the D&amp;D players!!! In my experience, most D&amp;D players are more worried about their dice looking cool than being precise. I've seen a few players (usually older "grognard" types) that brag about their precision dice, but most players I've seen just go for the cool rounded Chessex dice in the nice shiny colors. &gt; cool rounded Chessex dice in the nice shiny colors.

 I've come to the conclusion that there is elitism for everything. No, you wouldn't know *good* elitism if it spanked you on the ass. If you have rounded dice that you've used for a while, it's incredibly easy to cheat with them.   

Source: I'm *kind of* an ass.  sounds like you know a thing or two about dice! *tell me more*.  Not really, I just use them a lot (I've been playing D&amp;D and other tabletop games for over 15 years). I've seen a few interesting videos on precision dice and whatnot, that's all.

Basically, rounded edges on dice means that they lose some of that almost-perfect randomness that you get from casino-style dice, which are held to *incredibly* high standards. It's because the rounding isn't exact on every side, and you can't really measure that sort of thing, so a die with rounded edges might be able to roll more easily onto one side than another. They're generally random enough for casual use, since most people aren't wagering millions of dollars on a skill check or a move in a board game. Casinos, on the other hand, really care about that kind of precision because there can be so much money that hinges on the randomness of a single roll. Is it possible to find a precision d20 or other non-d6's? Gamescience dice are supposed to be a bit more accurate, because they don't round the edges of their dice, but the also leave a little bit of the flashing (I think that's the right word, the place where the plastic is injected into the mold) on, but you can file that down yourself. I have a set, but don't really notice that much difference from my other, rounded dice. http://www.gamesciencedice.com/ Flash occurs when the mold is over-filled during the injection process. It can also occur from a damaged mold. Essentially, it leaks out the side a little bit. 

What you are referring to is called a nipple I believe. It's from the runner/Spru being cut off the part:  The Spru is the excess material that is injected into the mold, it's the plastic inside the channels of the mold leading from the injection barrel towards the actual part.  The nipple you spoke of is the result of the Spru being cut off the part after it's molded.  Im sure I can remember a post somewhere, a long while ago, of a video from a guy selling dice at a convention explaining how a lot of d20 dice are off because when they are made, they tumble the dice around in a big pile together and they get smoothed off. So you're better buying one from an independent seller or making them yourself. 

Having trouble finding it though...

Edit: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSQIir5xxWc) Unless you get [backgammon dice](http://www.zontikgames.com/backgammon-precision-dice-saffron.html) In other news, this company makes a [$300 Frisbee](http://www.zontikgames.com/garden-games/geoffreyparker-flyingdisc.html) WTF?

&gt; "A flying object that will surely be identified, this premium leather flying disc features felt lining for finger comfort, and comes in an array of hues from which you can choose"

Does it wake you up with coffee and a blowjob as well? *made. 

It seems to be discontinued now, presumably because no one wanted to spend $300 on a fuckin Frisbee. What's wrong with rounded dice?  For casual use, nothing. They're just less precise than precision dice (go figure), because the edges generally aren't rounded evenly. This can lead to dice having tendencies to roll to certain numbers more easily... usually not enough to be noticed by the casual observer, but for someone who cares about a die being perfectly random (like somebody running a casino), it can be a big deal. That's why casino dice are as perfectly shaped as they can get them. Defective dice from one of their other product lines. Go deeper. I thought I'd been rolling all sixes in life, but it turns out they were all just fours. (deep enough?)

EDIT: Thanks for the gold, but I bet if I start scratching there's just silver underneath. &gt; just fours.  
  
Don't devalue the 4.  
  
4 is enough to flip a hitherto inaccessible Commie controlled Venezuela with ABM, granting regional access and breaking a deadly 12 point Control swing...  
  
4 is just needed for a charging Orc Bigun to hit a squishy Elf spearmen, gaining combat resolution and reducing the number of re-attacks...  
  
4 is a fine number of unadjusted HPs gained when a Fighter levels...  
  
4 can combine with many other numbers to give you that badly needed lategame Ore...  
  
4 is a great number.  An ungreedy number.  5 is asking for too much... and don't even get me *started* on 6.  
  
4 is so just above average it's great! Unfourtunately, you made 6 points about 4. Yet another example of 4s *true* and ineffable power... and now there are six comments! 

did I...uh, help? THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS! And 6 is 3 and 3 is 5 and 5 is 4 and 4 is the magic number. 4 is good for clerics or thieves, but fighters get d10 hp. There, 4 is bad.  &gt; 4 is bad.

If they had aligned them correctly, he could have gotten a 7 with each roll. Assuming the dice share the same layouts of numbers, I don't think it's possible to orient them so the pair of numbers on each sides adds up to 7.  There will always be two sides (opposite each other) that line up with the same number on both dice. It was pregnant, you monster.  So that's where Dice come from! Wait, how do you break a dice?

At my last D&amp;D session a friend (gently) rolled for initiative on the back of his phone because it was the closest flat surface available. 

He shattered the glass on the camera lens with a d20. Dice be sturdy.

*facepalm* &gt; because it was the closest flat surface available. 

Was the floor not available?
 You don't play in a dark forrest lit only by a camp fire and a couple of torches? Casual When I was much younger we played in the storm drains under the city by fire and grate light. A few specific areas really felt like dungeons, catacombs, labyrinths, etc. So that's where you people come from. Beneath the city!  xD Phone was in his lap. Never said it was a smart decision. 

We all (yes, even him) laughed about it for a good 10 minutes afterwards. Both he and his wife worked for RIM/Blackberry for years, so they know it's an easy fix at least. 

Damn bad luck though. How is there not a flat surface to roll on during a d&amp;d game?! That's most of the game! You don't need a lot of force to shatter a camera lens if it's concentrated in a very tiny area. There is a drinking game where you launch a die into the air 15+ feet and it has to bounce off the opponent's side of the table. If you hit or it bounces onto concrete, it's a pretty dramatic smack. We blow through dice pretty quickly look at the fancy man with his 15+ feet ceilings. If only there were a huge open space with an unlimited ceiling, grass, and sunlight to play in..

Edit: If I'm being downvoted because what I'm saying is obvious/uninteresting that's fine. But if you downvote me because you think I'm wrong I can try to explain it futher. Firstly, /u/LuckyNinefingers is not correcting me, he's making a joke(If I'm wrong /u/LuckyNinefingers, feel free to say so and I will strike this edit). The most likely reason as to why there is a dice inside is because they are selling blue dice and uses normal white dice to make it cheap and fast. It's recycling.  It's the principle of the thing. What if you are trying to kill a boss with that die and you pray to the luck gods and for once they actually favor you but because the damn blue casing doesn't match up with the die's inner self you botch and cause a whole party wipe?

It's srs bsns. The die's cast. You have motivated me to finally look up what that phrase means.

FTFY Dice-Maker Here!  
Is what I wanted to read when I came to learn more about the world of dice making. Made in China. You broke the protective coating that covers the original lead die. Just don't break the lead die that shields the one made with Chernobyl waste. Not going to lie, took me 15-20s to realise the white was actually the die below and not a reflection It's like the whole blue &amp; black vs. white &amp; gold dress thing all over again I was also very confused for a bit. Now I don't understand how my mind was so wrong at first. Just spent 5 minutes trying to see what you both saw. I can't. I even tried to "magic eye" it and still nope. Did it take anyone else a considerable amount of time to notice the dice underneath wasn't just a reflection off the blue dice? This is actually fairly common in dice harvested from wild caught Dice Oysters as opposed to the more uniform dice people are familiar with which are formed in farm raised cultured oysters.  Variations in layer composition can often be attributed to environmental changes including; nutrient availability, temperature, water PH, and salinity. Diception. The singular form of die is die.  
The plural form of die is dice.  
The quintuple form of die is yahtzee. I found myself questioning his choice of "dice", but wouldn't it still be correct? He's mentioning one out of many. If he had said "My dice cracked", it would have been incorrect. But he said "One of my dice", stating that there are more.  Yeah, replacing "dice" with any other plural word works. Using "die" would be like saying "One of my dog barfed on my niece". Excellent example. Nah, you're right.  But that singular dice turned out to be plural! I'm glad my grandparents only yahtzeed Well sorry it looks like all previous rolls with that die are invalid. D-D-D-D-DICE BREAKER!! I assume they got regular white die for super cheap and molded a color over it for less materials and cost than actually just making one from scratch thus selling for profit. Or they are crazy, a lot of people are crazy. I'm amazed that it's somehow cheaper to use other dice as filler. Try to peel the whole thing, maybe this is someway of reusing flawed dice. and the numbers dont even match

/r/mildlyinfuriating That's paradise....

hehe You have unleashed an evil you cannot possibly comprehend Please, for mankind, crack open the next layer and return to us with your findings. When you're playing so hard you break the dice, good guy dice has got ya covered with a backup Behind every great die, lies another die within Looks like that die....got dicected. So you gonna dicect it?  You rolled a 10! In some way this probably proves that we actually do live in the matrix.  "They say he carved it himself... from a bigger dice." Here is my best guess at an explanation.

The inner die is the most basic, generic, mass-produced kind of die that there is.

The blue outer die is obviously a bit more stylized; with more colors, larger size, and rounded edges.

The simple explanation is that it was cheaper for the company to buy wholesale generic die, then stylize them with an outer coating; as opposed to manufacturing your own stylized die entirely from scratch. This is the part where someone says "Woah! Diception!" and some jerk counters "Inception doesn't mean what you think it means, dumbass." http://i.imgur.com/hUKl6kM.jpg Dieception. Dice maker here!

This is how new dice are made.  Not sure whether this is die-section or die-ception What if there is a dice within that dice within that dice http://imgur.com/gallery/XDloU The real question is how did you break a dice? ?  Diception Will not die. This is on the verge of being more than mildly interesting There's something awesome about the phrase "partially hydrogenated goodness". whoever designed this poster definitely had fun doing it Also known as trans fat, but nobody would be stupid enough to write that. There is nothing wrong with being Trans okay. I have friends like that and they are awesome people. 


 But are they fat? trans fabulous.  trans fantastic. trans phat I think THAT'S the joke people have been hunting for trans fatlantic Could you share a rowboat?  Could a rowboat support him/her? It's not. Trans fat can be produced when oil is hydrogenated, if steps aren't taken to avoid it. But the food industry already know how to avoid it ~~as a rule~~. Hydrogenated oil is not the same thing as trans fat.

 [deleted] Oh, sure that may be. I'm arguing in a smaller context, and it is still true that partially hydrogenated fat isn't the same as trans fat. Partially hydrogenated = trans fat.

Google it. &gt; incomplete hydrogenation partially converts these molecules to trans isomers [[link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogenation#In_the_food_industry)]

As I said, trans fat is a byproduct of incomplete hydrogenation, but there are procedures to avoid it's production. They found out that 0% transfat labels don't mean 0%

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1X9lLUd5qU I know, that's a food packaging issue. Anything that says "0% something" is using a loophole to actually put it in there. Don't buy it. If it didn't have it, it would say it. This doesn't change the fact that hydrogenated oil  can be produced without trans fat. So which foods do you trust to include partially hydrogenated oil, but take extra steps to remove the transfat? A question of trust is a completely different discussion than the one we were having. Trust or not, you do what you want. Doesn't changes the fact that that partially hydrogenated oil isn't the same as trans fat. I think the discussion here is really about whether you can expect transfat in your partially hydrogenated oil junk food. Underwhelming Taste!

Acceptable price!

You're probably gonna buy this stuff regardless of what we say! "Coin operated cuisine" was cut off the picture among others Eat recycled food! Good for the environment! Ok for you! "I knew you were going to say that!" Negative, I am a meat Popsicle.  One of my favorite movies, but I never understood why he said that line. Serious non sequitur? The police ask Korban whether he is "**classified** as human". He says that he is a "meat Popsicle." Which is often interpreted as slang for someone who's spent a long time in cryogenic suspension. He's explaining to the police that his physical age won't match his legally registered age.

 Huh. All this time, I thought he was flying a dick joke under the radar. Your explanation is actually a lot more awesome. It's not an airtight explanation, and it makes some assumptions.

But if you want airtight explanations, Fifth Element is not the movie for it.

Luke has a broomhandel Mauser, but they don't have a generator with flood lights?

That wall is obviously concrete painted yellow.

The alien buddy who gave you the key, and crushed his hand? You have the key. Like... Let him out. Are you guys so pressed for time that you gotta leave your bro to die... for no reason? 

Who fed Korban's cat while he was away?

You can see that the unbreakable glass is pre-cut just before she punches through the glass.

Why are the walls made of tinfoil?

Why does that building have a train on it? It can only ever arrive at that building. That's just a super expensive elevator.

OK. This is a Mega-City... billions of people. But only one priest named "Cornelius"?

How did no one notice the huge ass radio tower on that cockroach?

How did the Mangalore know the stones were on the ship? Are they also super spies?

Why do the mangalore's stop shooting at Korban when he gets behind a wooden counter? Keep shooting dudes.

The timer for the Mangalore bomb is obviously a Masterlock.

Korban asks Ruby to count to ten, and the bomb explodes on ten... but that's like 40 seconds later. Is the bomb voice activated? if so, why not just yell "TEN" when ever you want it to blow?

She wasn't horrified by humanity until she got to "War" in the W's? Rape? Murder? Torture? Genocide? All good? but WAR is when you nope out? 

"Wind blows, water falls, fire burns..." That's a real convenient cut off. Tell me, bitch, what does earth do?

Love that movie, though.

Edit for Bonus Fifth Element yo mama joke: "Yo mama so dumb, she think *The Fifth Element* is about Boron."

 Earth dirts  Well shit. Oh come one guys: Earth rocks. OK. You got me there. Damn, you've obviously given it much more thought I have. That is simply fantastic. Oh. I... really really really like the movie.

I have it on VHS (offical), VHS (Recorded from tv), DVD, blu-ray, HD (the now dead format, and I nolonger have a HD disk player) and it is always in my netflix que.

Blu-ray is best.

Anyway. I watch it at least twice a year, and it's really hard for me to stay quite when watching it with anyone.

It's one of those things that makes me think to myself "why is my wife with me?"  [deleted] When all of the stars are open to you, and all the races are among one another, I wonder who has the more Exotic pet.

Maybe their internet is filled with pictures of rubber-nose blob things, and Korban is one of those people who has an animal that really should be in a zoo. I always thought it had something to do with shoving a couple guys into the fridge. Saying he's been cryogenically frozen.  Because fuck the police, that's why. Comin' straight from the underground! Haha! Best answer! And the Sea shells!! Wrong movie What movie? Meat Popsicle is from The Fifth Element. Seashells was a reference to Demolition Man. Shit that was Demolition Man wasn't it. Age is catching up with me.  It's been revoked! You're the disease, and I'm the cure. You're here because you're looking for this shit! Can I get this tattoo'd on my back? 'Course you can, buddy. If you're really brave we'll go for ice cream after. acceptable price at a motel vending machine? I call bullshit I think "Acceptable" means that the price may be unreasonable, but you'll still grudgingly accept it. I don't like this answer, but I will accept it. That's totally acceptable. far from acceptable. I paid $140 for one night in the Tenderloin in SF when I was on a motorcycle trip. I could have used AirBnB had I not been brain dead. They were talking about a vending machine. Not the motel. Now contains 20% food!  TIL margarine is 1 1/2 molecules away from being "plastic"

edit: reddit downvote rages for the weirdest shit

Edit2: TIL never talk shit about margirin on reddit

Edit3: why? Why is this happening? What did I do to deserve this margirin? Pls margirin  Just in case you're serious, that's a meaningless statement. That's like saying you should stop breathing the air because it's one molecule away from carbon monoxide. 

edit- too many words The truth is even riskier. Carbon dioxide is one ATOM away from being carbon monoxide. Atoms are smaller than molecules, therefore your children are in danger. If you switch out one of the oxygen atoms in an oxygen molecule with arsenic, and the other one also with arsenic, your children could be BREATHING POISON. Not if you kill them first.....can't breathe poison if you're dead so it's safer You could lead a cult Oh! I'll get the Kool aid! You want lemonade or grape?  Always purple drank I will consider it if I happen to somehow collect enough people and decide on what comet we will ride on to get to our final destination  im in. wheres the koolaid? Still waiting for the Kool-aid man to show up.....Oh Yeah!!! Graphite is an allotrope of diamond, we're pretty much writing with diamonds when we could be selling them! FACT 100% of people who drink dihydrogen monoxide die. One atom, even closer. humans are half banana go eat them theyr high in potasium Hemoglobin is one iron atom away from being chlorophyll. Chlorophyll?! More like Borophyll!  No I will not make out with you! That is super cool.  It's not rage. Most people just think you're an idiot.  I can't believe it's not &gt;edit: reddit downvote rages for the weirdest shit

Honestly, anyone who thought you were serious only did because they were one molecule away from a moron. Upvoted for the second edit  Find out, tonight at 10!  Haters gonna hate. More edits pls Dihydrogen monoxide kills thousands of people every year, yet we still put it in everything we eat. Hell, it's in our drinking water!  Stupid long horses! Meh, either way, shitscoolwithme Nutritionally inert.  

I love that they not only admit that, but put it on the wall.   "Preservatives Added" is similarly self-effacing. thatsthejoke.jpg Wait this bot is amazing. Does it do more pictures? Like disgonbegud.jpg ? [disgonbegud.jpg](http://gfycat.com/AmusedImaginativeIbis)

 Surely being nutritionally inert is a positive thing?  Especially for food sitting about in a machine. I wonder if 10 minutes after this all goes viral... someone will make a phonecall and all the motel 6 honesty is PULLED. That'd be stupid. This brings business, if anything.

Motel 6 decides to send their guest list to the police every day.

http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/342d0t/motel_6_decides_to_send_their_guest_list_to_the/ Hey, even ruthless criminals need a break while on the run. You might enjoy hearing that this is not out of the ordinary for any brand.  If an officer comes into a hotel and produces credentials he is given full access to any name/address/phone# info on any guest.  I've managed half a dozen hotels and each of them shared this policy, and I'm glad for it. Wait...-moose- isn't a bot? There's an actual human being behind this god damned account?

Listen. Go get mental help. Paranoia on your level isn't normal. Subtle. I like it. And I don't care who knows it, I'm getting my nutritionally inert apple.  Why not add some partially hydrogenated goodness to that? How do they know?!  that is correct As a person not ashamed of purchasing goods from vending machines, I can completely appreciate the honesty of this display. Every now and then, one of those 'fruit pies' which is actually a lump of jelly, surrounded by a bit of wheat batter that is completely saturated in sugary goodness, is just wonderful.

https://www.quitehealthy.com/nutrition-facts/hostess/L424551.html Things like Fruit Pies and Taco Bell are like Tummy-Heroin, it's something formulated to flip all your food-endorphin switches.  It's living dangerously for boring people like me. &gt; Tummy-Heroin

Awesome the first time, and just a miserable reality after that? I eat taco bell atleast twice a month. i need help! But it's got 4 grams of protein!  when health conscious doge infiltrates the marketing team Much preservatives!

Such snack!

Wow!

 Nobody cares late at night when inebriated. Anyone that's already at the vending machines doesn't care.  It's not as if they were weighing the options of vending machine or 4-star cuisine. that's what she said. I'm calling it now.

Reddit will prove this is just an elaborately subtle Doritos ad. You are the Doritos ad! Quit trying to trick us! I appreciate their honesty. But I'd bet the vending machine guy not as much. Well, hopefully people would know about the nutrition of this sort of food by now.  I would he suprised if anyone came to the machine, gasped "Wait, these Doritos aren't fresh picked this morning with no additives or preservatives?  Hmmph! Vending machine gets no more of *my* buisness!" and walked away.  

Vending machine guy doesn't care.  If anything, it makes people look towards the vending machine, gets the snacks in their sight and thusly their mind, and increases chance of purchace for themselves or a child.   I only buy my Doritos, free range and non-GMO. Nuthin' tastes better than freshly ripened locally grown Doritos There is nothing like Doritos, picked fresh from the bush.  These people are missing out. But it's like writing "Cancer!" on cigarette packets, it may deter some people even if they were aware of it before. I don't know what part of the world you're from but the cigarette packs in many places have huge, disgusting, graphic warnings on them complete with photos of lungs, rotten teeth, etc. I don't know the stats as to whether it deters people from smoking but it's not like people don't do it... In the U.S. They just basically say this will kill you!  That's like saying drug dealers hate DARE.  neither gives a good god damn, they're still going to make money. Someone's too smart for their job.  Its like putting on the glasses from "They Live" Cheaper than real food. Get a fresh AF chicken burger from there and sue them for false advertising I don't believe there would be "fresh As Fuck" chicken burgers in a vending machine, so this couldn't be done.  And even if there were chicken burgers sold elsewhere in this hotel, and those were "fresh As Fuck", this wouldn't be advertising them as it only advertises the vending machine food. I've bought a chicken burger from a vending machine before.  Yeah, I've seen chicken burgers in vending machines as well.  I bet it wasn't fresh as fuck though.   Maybe if they just stocked them, but even then that just means they're still frozen. Yeah, the initial product is chock full of preservatives, frozen, shipped to a warehouse, shipped to the people who drive around stocking machines, and then removed once they cannot be kept there any longer, if they are not eaten.  It's no beuno for you. I know, i know. But I was up at the dumb hospital all night and it looked delicious. Jeez, you should probably go to the smart hospital... they treat you better Well I work there haha Tom Bodett is their spokesman, I didn't figure they'd let him on their interior design team... We'll leave the light on for ya.  Trying to establish a late-night budget model snack empire.

All that's missing is an app. They forgot to the add this slogan...

"***Check in and we'll turn over our guest list to the police each night***" If only more places were this honest, they'd get my business... but probably lose a lot of other business. Mitch Herberg on vending machines. https://youtu.be/d6ensr4fX7U Gastronomy on the go... Nutritionally inert,  but refreshingly honest. If this is legit, I kinda respect them for it.

It takes business sense to admit about your product what everyone else knows. several more which should be added:       Much Wow,     Stoner Deelight,     See how little a dollar buys,    Shouldda packed snacks!
 It works because the majority of Motel 6 clientele don't know what the majority of those words mean.  Or they know what the words mean and still see the irony in the whole situation.  Life works like that too. wait, are you suggesting that i'm not, as a Redditor, significantly smarter than the rest of the US population? *clutches fedora* more likely the majority of motel 6 clientele are rational consumers with a sense of humor Have you been to a Motel 6? There's too much meth coursing through the average guest to waste time reading. What about the clientele who think that paying more than $50 per night for a motel is insane? He said majority, not entirety. 

 http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/35wi5p/this_motel_6_has_amusingly_honest_wallpaper_by/cr8wizl Speaking of Motel 6...

From the Providence Journal:
Motel 6 giving police names of guests. 

"WARWICK, R.I.  City police have arrested four people staying at the Motel 6 on Jefferson Boulevard as a result of the hotel chain's agreement to provide police with a daily guest list, Mayor Scott Avedisian said Tuesday.
The names of Motel 6 guests, which police then check for outstanding warrants, is one of five steps Motel 6 corporate managers agreed to take in response to a string of high-profile incidents and concerns the establishment was becoming a haven for passing criminals.

The other measures listed in an agreement Motel 6 executives signed Tuesday include raising the minimum age to rent a room from 18 years old to 21, hiring a police detail every night, sharing their national do not rent list with police and conducting regular training, including on how to spot human trafficking."

http://m.providencejournal.com/article/20150414/NEWS/150419569

It is a troubling private-public overlap where motel and hotel clerks are systematically sharing do not rent lists and helping police to run checks on guests daily for outstanding warrants. Staying at Motel 6, and other chains pursuing similar policies, now includes a hidden guilty-until-proven innocent background check that puts ordinary travelers one step away from a call to police. 

Cue the predictable excuses: If you arent doing anything wrong, you have nothing to hide.

Of course, virtually the same thing has been going on between the NSA and Internet/telecommunications companies, with the latter willingly handing over data on its customers for intelligence processing at the expense of individual civil rights and customer trust.

While this type of pre-crime screening for authorization may seem like a worthwhile way to flush out criminals, but the acceptance of the guilty-until-proven mindset is allowing this to pop up with lists operating throughout society as do not fly lists do with airports.

And despite what you may be thinking, not everyone on these lists is actually a criminal, potential terrorists or offender. In fact, there is way too much room for abuse and political tyranny. With enough time to blossom, these data lists will make second class citizens out of large sectors of the population.

In the decade following 9/11, countless news reports surfaced about people with clean records being barred from travel because their name matches or is similar to an actual suspect. Many such people were put on the list simply by mistake, or through ulterior motives by those working the system.

In any case, these people have little recourse for getting off the lists. Cases surrounding airport no fly lists have left many people frustrated at civil rights violations that judges have been unable or unwilling to strike down.

http://www.infowars.com/motels-sharing-daily-guest-list-with-police-and-aiding-warrant-checks-on-every-guest/ Thats pretty damn funny That is Awesome! Well done Motel 6. &gt; Nutritionally Inert That's refreshingly honest I went to one of those and the vending machine had one of those sensors so the lights turned on when I got close and I was like "that Tom Bodett is full of shit, man" I just saw the lollipop and thought that they thought their customers were suckers. "Refreshingly honest" obviously put there by people who have no idea what those words mean. This is the honest and kinda refreshing really... like a coca-cola. maybe they're having a dispute with the vending machine contractor. "Gastronomy-on-the-go" really got me. At least they are honest! I guess I have to eat out of this vending machine from the top left (gastronomy on the go) to the bottom right (midnight snacking). Do they have Krusty partially gelatinated non-dairy gum-based beverages? I wonder how many people had this as their last sight while being murdered "Hey, you dont care where you sleep, why care what you eat?"

 Is that the one in Dallas?  Cause i swear it had the lame wallpaper too. Unless it's a modern motel 6 thing. Cause before starting in the one i did i hadn't stayed in a motel 6 since like 2004 [deleted] haha Stand back, I'm going to do - [engineering!](http://i.imgur.com/Miztu2H.png)

EDIT: okay, here's a recap of the comments below:

1. the manufacturing process would be too complicated or expensive
1. someone will pinch their fingers and I'll get sued
1. the stall opens inwards, but you're too fat to squeeze between the doors and the toilet But what about that left side? It might have a crack. [Solved](http://i.imgur.com/OabEcmR.png).

The new design also puts the hinges inside, preventing anyone from unscrewing them and removing the door while you're shitting. [deleted] Have you seen his username? He REALLY doesn't want to be disturbed. Becoming an engineer... 

Step 1) Eat toilet paper.   
Step 2)  ??? Step 3) ~~Profit~~ Admirable Salary  (Step 4) Aquire females But he's......an engineer. Look at all this money I have to spend on dates!

....or model airplanes. Those are cool too. ...Does it clean your ass on the way out if you eat a lot? Hinge is on the outside. Think about the front door to your house. If the hinge was on the outside someone could just unscrew it. Then walk into your bathroom and see you poop. Haha for sure, but I think he's taken aback by how weird it would be that someone would want to do that to a washroom stall while someone is shitting. Apparently you've never seen an 80s action movie. Can't wait for the Hasselhoff shitting scene! Apparently neither have you, it's policy to kick the door in not unscrew the hinges.  What are you going to do, stop them? You just got done shitting and haven't wiped. No way are you going to stand up and fight with an ass full of shit. Do you really want to fight a half naked guy who hasn't wiped yet? I'd say Mr. Pants Down has the advantage, here. I am going to pretend that this is the explanation to so many shit covered public restrooms with stall doors hardly hanging on. If it was my life or his, you bet my shitty ass i would. Buying your custom door is going to be more expensive than getting the contractor to field install some bristles.

Welcome to management, suck it engineer. If things were engineered properly in the first place, there wouldn't be any need for contractors to constantly fix up these sort of problems. Those bristles will be covered in spew n shit within twelve months. Have fun replacing them. That's what tamper-proof bolt heads are for, but I like the door geometry. I prefer to just take a 5 lb sledge, bust through the door wearing a jason mask, screaming "booga booga booga!"

They won't have to shit for a week.

Edit: words But... where I live, doors open the other way, not inside the cubicle. Where would you put the hinges then? Inside the crack. 

http://i.imgur.com/izrFOgB.png

However, this might not be possible if the door is too thin... I'll think about it. Looks very clever but complicated - probably cheaper to buy a standard door and some cheap bristles. I feel like im taking crazy pills.

Do you people not have normal doors?

http://imgur.com/cCwAN93
 No, which is very weird now that I'm realizing it isn't that way everywhere.

[This is what we have in the US.](http://i.imgur.com/BJLJGfx.jpg) http://i.imgur.com/ilsrmOr.jpg
Im currently reading this on a Wendy's toilet.  My view. Solid field reporting I figure most of us have simply learned to live with it by now. Be you the peeker or peekee, you never learn to live with that akward eye contact. Toilet doors are supposed to open inward so you can push against them if someone tries to get in (assuming the lock failed.) I think they mainly open inward (except for handicap stalls) to avoid them swinging out into the shared common space where people might need to walk/stand. It takes up less room visually. Well, somewhere they are and somewhere they aren't. I appreciate some room in the cubicle, without needing to stand on the toilet in order to open the door and to get out. If the lock fails, I just choose another cubicle. Real cool, but it's too bad the manufacturers will continue using their shitty design on the basis that it's cheaper to produce. They could change designs and continue using the same amount of material, but there would be greater odds for defects due to the multifaceted nature of your design. Adding more faces increases the room for error with that aluminum crap they use. They could switch to composite molding, but then they'd have to retool entire factories. Someday we will shit in privacy, it's inevitable. Maybe you'll be the man to grant us that wish.

Edit: oh jeez. I just had the realization that the main reason our stalls have giant see-through holes is to prevent injuries due to crushing in door jambs. Only in lawsuit-fueled America. The rest of the world doesn't have these stall holes. I almost cried. Thank you for the supporting words, funknut. What if the hinge end snags something like a finger, and pinches it when it's closing. My god, you end-users always find something to complain about. But but but but but but!

What if...I'm an idiot?! Huh? What will you do then? He'll fix the problem you introduce and then wait for the universe to make another one of you. They do seem to keep making better idiots. Just remove the hinges and make it work goddammit, you're an engineer this is what we upvote you for! You guys want unbroken fingers too?! Some people are never happy! What if you were so stupid, you lost all your fingers to other doors already? you can snag on current doors and crush your fingas.  I've got blistas on my fingas! then this person is more likely to shit their pants before making it to the toilet stall. I don't want to piss on your parade here, but might you be reinventing the wheel?  There are two excellent door designs that work prefectly for this purpose already.

1. The door.  Like you use to get into a room, for example.  Door fits neatly into frame, meets jamb to provide seal and prevent it from swinging beyond frame. Hinges are concealed.

2. The cupboard. Like you have in your kitchen, probably.  Door is larger than frame, stops when it hits frame and overlaps to provide privacy.  Hinges are concealed. &gt;The cupboard. Like you have in your kitchen, probably. Door is larger than frame, stops when it hits frame and overlaps to provide privacy. Hinges are concealed.

So basically, our plates and cups have more privacy than we do in public restrooms.

Your points are all valid, though. I guess we should all just shit in cupboards. Yep.  You should check on them.  They're probably doing drugs or masturbating in there. That's why everything I eat tastes salty. THIS GUY'S A MADMAN!  That is a really good idea. (and illustration)

Two major issues I just thought about. You can't easily change the swing, and would increase manufacture cost. arent they often made to be possible to open from the outside, in case someone has a heart attack or od's  I don't know about you, but I don't want my bathroom stalls to open inward. They're tiny enough as it is. Until you forget to lock it and someone tries to get in.
