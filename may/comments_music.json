The pick guard was stained yellow and the paint was chipping off everywhere. It was heavy as a fucking anvil and could easily throw off my balance is it swayed any direction to quickly. I walked into my first lesson Id ever take with a old family friend and founder of speedster amps Corey wilds. It was 1999. On my first day he said to me \"I know you wanna learn all this heavy metal and rock music and I'll teach you that but you have to answer one question for me. If you had to pick would you rather learn to play jazz or the blues?\" Well dammit I just wanted to play antichrist superstar and the downward spiral in their entirety so I just gave him an answer I thought he would want to hear, i squeaked out \"the blues\". By 21 I had been on tour a number of times with my own bands and several others. At 11 years old I was learning my own personalized \"intro to the blues\" by learning licks like the lead line to \"have a drink on me\" by acdc. By the time I was 12 I was in love. I was going home from school and learning licks by muddy waters and b.b. King like the apocalypse was imminent and our worlds only defense was this skinny white kid from Tacoma Washington whaling the blues at it. To this day I have no idea what would have happened if I had said jazz. What I do know is that day I opened so many doors I never would have otherwise because I said blues. BB was one of my earliest inspirations. Sadly I was never privileged to see most of my inspirations play as I was to young. I got to see BB several times. I've known a lot of musicians in my life but to see a legend like that play was an honor and I mean that in the most sincere way. One of the last living trail blazers that made my life possible is gone.  Thank you BB for introducing me to the first and most true love I have ever known. The blues.

If your heart is in it, it shouldn't matter whether the FOX audience, Paula Abdul or your next door neighbor is listening, you should just play and go through all the motions required to improve because that's how you get good at anything. Only a small percentage of people are born with an innate capability to sing. Most of the rest learn after sucking for a long time. American Idol teaches you that it's not ok to suck (ok, except for that one guy early on who was so awful he got signed as a joke).\n\nIt's taking away the focus from showing up every day and putting in the time. Don't get me wrong, a lot of people do just that *before* going on American Idol and manage to have successful careers, but the number is so low that it's negligible and most importantly they're not teenagers; that's the case you're talking about with taking advantage of all mediums. If you're already doing small shows and people like what you have to offer you might as well go on American Idol and sing for the judges. \n\nI am positive that most people who do audition end up having a different experience. When the network builds a narrative around the success stories they're so celebrated that anybody with a decent voice wants to live it. The average, uneducated 'good singer' nowadays would rather give it one shot on American Idol rather than sit in a basement for years practicing scales and actually becoming good enough; that's the instant gratification mentality we live in but it would have been unthinkable before American Idol existed.\n\nIf you go on American Idol and get rejected, it's likely that you'll look back on it as your 'one chance' and give up altogether because somebody with an agenda told you you're just 'not good enough', which is completely counterproductive to a life goal, especially early on in life.", "gilded": 0, "score": 12, "created": 1431368400.0},{"body": "Dave's model is great for 1995.

And these guys are the national army orchestra?\n\nGreat song choice, well executed musically, but I'm really surprised at the small size of the group and the lack of polish on the marching skills.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFOLLOWUP EDIT:\n\nWatched a bit more of the Army Orchestra's stuff, and I'm inclined to say that I was a bit overly harsh in my original comment.\n\nThey were excellent in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6iZ6hDcqKc&amp;app=desktop) video, for example.  There is a very dramatic classical military style that they've got going on there.  Of particular note are the square formations and the deliberate, timed, full-head turns to check that the ranks are dressed.  \n\nThose head-checks are *missing* in the newer performance, and all the stuff they're not 100% on in the marching is all diagonal shit... particularly the spot where they rotated a bloody *company front* around two different axis.  That's some hard stuff to pull off flawlessly, especially if you've been trained to a different marching style than you're using.  Also of note, they're doing this on a street.  The only marker they have to orient off of is the conductor in the reviewing stand and his counterpart whom you can see standing in the back.  This is also not an ideal situation.\n\nSo, my revised theory is that the Orchestra is working some new stuff, it's early in their actual *marching* season, they're doing some hard maneuvers, and it isn't quite perfect yet.  They're clearly professionals.  This is evident in every video I've seen.  It's a picked group, the numbers of each instrument sound balanced to sound good in both indoor and outdoor settings.  Their sound is *really* good... to the point where I'd suspect them of having a really good sound tech running things, except that some of these videos were clearly from cell phone cameras.\n\nSo yeah.  A bit harsh.
