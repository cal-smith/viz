Only a few springboks showed up in the afternoon, but the real show eventually started at sunset. It was overcast and I didn't think there would be a sunset, but the sun finally pierced through the clouds... and this wonderful rhino came to have drink and bathe, just as the sun was disappearing below the horizon.\n\nI went back the following day and was lucky enough to see four rhinos this time, with one male courting two females successively. Lots of grunting and horn-touching, and the male disappeared in the bush with one female later on.\n\nI travelled in Africa for 6 months from South Africa to Ethiopia and this is without question one of the most memorable moments of my trip. Etosha was really incredible, as were Kruger and Kalahari in South Africa. Seeing the wildlife from up close is such an intense experience.

We have a huge ocean on either side of us, plus the gulf of mexico. There is one pretty massive mountain range (the Rockies) that cuts up and down through most of the continent, and we have another older and smaller range through the east (the Appalachians). I don't know why, but the oceans effect the coastlines differently in different places. Some places on the California coast are pretty much identical to places on the Mediterranean coast. And then you have the south where we touch the Gulf of Mexico and it is a giant swamp. And I am sure there are a hundred other causes that I don't know of.  \n\nI live in Kansas (right smack dab in the middle of the country, where the blue turns to orange), and the change in climate throughout the state is fascinating in itself. Most of the state is fairly dry, and has lots of prairie, at least where it hasn't been converted to farmland. A lot of the moisture we get we get from the air that comes up from the Gulf of Mexico. Because it is moving from East to West, the eastern prairies are far more lush than the western. The East has grasses like Big Bluestem that can grow to be about 6 feet tall. As you start to move westward, Big Bluestem is replaced by Little Bluestem which only gets to be about 3 feet tall, and by the time you hit Western Kansas and Eastern Colorado the grasses may only grow a few inches tall. And we don't get any moisture from the Pacific Ocean because the Rocky Mountains suck the air dry before it hits us. And then possibly even weirder is the East of the state. Everything is prairie until BAM, you hit humid forests and the methed out abomination that is the state of Missouri. Even the animals are different! Go out to the prairie and you might meet [this guy](http://m5.i.pbase.com/o6/15/915115/1/136374165.u7JdK49B.CRH07554.jpg), the Prairie Rat Snake.

The company's first product, the CL75 balloon-based system, has been in prototype flight test since October 2001. It will be capable of carrying an 86-short-ton-payload in either a crane configuration or as a towed vehicle. CargoLifter is also pursuing the CL160 airship, which is capable of carrying outsized and heavy goods over long distances. CargoLifter is cooperating with a number of partners and potential users to further define and develop both markets and products.\n\nOn 07 June 2002 the company announced insolvency, and liquidation proceedings began the following month. The fate of parts of the 300 million euros in shareholder funds from over 70,000 investors is still unclear. In June 2003, the company's facilities were sold off for less than 20% of the construction costs. The airship hangar was used in a 'tropical paradise'-themed vacation resort called Tropical Islands, which opened in 2004.\n\nToday, the CL CargoLifter GmbH &amp; Co.

Another parking lot in a city of parking lots. A parking lot is what Astroworld became.\n\nThe status of the park is, since no public funds will be spent, in limbo until the committee can determine whether private funding is feasible for the project. I'm definitely not opposed to private funding. The last privately-funded park in the Houston area was, to my knowledge, Discovery Green, which is a really charming little park downtown that has seen a lot of use for family events, culture, exercise, and even ice skating. \n\nIf private money can replicate that type of success on the scale of the Astrodome I'm all for it.\n\nAnd, on an emotional level, having a huge indoor park would just be awesome. If you've been inside the Dome you know how enormous the space is. It would be a destination for tourism and it would bring a lot of character to the city. It would even be an opportunity for the zillion energy companies in the area to showcase their green technologies. It could be a space for exercise, for families, for relaxation, for concerts, films, art, whatever.\n\nHouston doesn't need another parking lot.

There's no traces of my trademark dry humor to found in this story and there's no happy ending. It's probably as close as I've come to my trip to Valhalla. In October of 1972 it happened like this:\n\nRod Temple and Robbie McIlvaine were waiting for me when I drove up to the beach at Cane Bay on St. Croix's north shore. This area of the Virgin Islands had some of the best wall diving in the eastern Caribbean and the drop off was an easy swim from shore eliminating a long boat ride from Christiansted. We unloaded our gear and began to dress under the shade of the palms while a dozen or so tourists watched with interest. Diving was still not an every day sport for most people and the double tanks and underwater camera equipment held a certain fascination. \n\nWe were setting off to recover some samples from a collecting experiment we have placed on the wall for a local marine science lab. Six days before we had positioned our large support float right over the drop off with the research vessel and carefully loaded our sediment traps, nets and lines so they'd be ready for positioning in various locations in the shallow patch reef and the deep wall. Today we planned to inspect one project at 210 feet and shoot some photography of the area. Rod transferred the dive profile and decompression information to his slate as Robbie and I rounded up the remainder of the equipment and walked into the warm ocean to begin our leisurely surface swim to the float station about 300 yards offshore.\n\nWe'd done Cane Bay hundreds of times in the last two years both for work and for fun and this October morning was no different than scores of others as we snorkeled over the clear sand a few feet beneath our fins. As usual, Rod struck a livelier pace and forged on ahead while we wallowed in his wake towing the photo gear and another plexi-glass sand trap the lab wanted set in the chute that spilled over the wall.\n\nReaching the float, Robbie retrieved the snap swivels that would anchor the trap into our rope grid strung on the wall face. Rod reviewed the deco schedule, \"Look, if we can get this thing set up and check out the project at 210 in fifteen minutes, we can save a lot of decompression. Can you do the photos in that time frame if I run the lines on the plexi trays?\"\n2\n\n\"Sure,\" I replied, \"but don't go wandering off in case Robbie needs help getting snapped in with the trap. That thing's a ***** to swim with.\"\n\n\"No problem,\" Rod smiled back. \"I don't mind doing the heavy work for you lazy Yanks.\" \n\nHis British enthusiasm belied the fact that Robbie and I were about twice his size and strength although he was older and more experienced. We both gave him an \"up yours\" salute knowing full well that any heavy lifting always came our way while Rod handled the paperwork. As the time keeper and dive leader, he would keep track of our dive profile, work in progress, remaining air status, and then run the deco schedule. \n\nHe eased away from the float and begin to swim the short distance over the deep blue that marked the drop off. The visibility was great, over 125 feet horizontally and even better looking up and down. A mild swell wrapped around the point and the sea was calm. Two of the Navy vessels that we worked with on submarine listening tests were just a few miles offshore and we could hear their acoustical sound generators pinging away as we descended. \n\nRod settled in on top of the wall at 100 feet and we joined up to check gauges before slipping over in a gentle glide to the first work station at 180 feet. Robbie re-arranged the open ends of the traps to aim in the west quadrant this week and I fired off photos to record the scene. Most of the scientists who contracted us didn't do much diving themselves and they insisted on reams of photography so they could get an accurate idea of conditions in the deep water zones they were studying.\n\nSignaling that we were finished, Rod led us over the coral buttresses and came to rest next to the deep project. It had slid a bit deeper during the week so Robbie and I eased it back into position and hoped it would stay put this time. This occupied our attention for most of ten minutes when Rod excitedly tapped me on the shoulder to point out the approach of two oceanic white tip sharks. This was nothing new to us as we dove with sharks routinely but it was rare to see these open ocean species in so close to shore. They passed within about ten feet of us and I shot a few photos as they swam off to the east.\n\nWe finished up the required observations and Rod filled out the field logs on his slate. Right on schedule he indicated, we were going to get out with only about 20 minutes deco it looked like. Robbie started up first and pointed out the sharks again as they swam by him headed over the coral and down into the sand chute. I remember thinking how strange it was to see oceanic white \n3\n\n\n\ntips right here on the wall at Cane Bay. It was kind of like walking off your back porch and seeing an African lion when you expected an alley cat. \n\nWe'd had our fair share of nasty encounters with white tips when we worked offshore. They frequently bit our equipment, the steel cables deployed from the research vessel, and even the shafts and propellers on occasion. We were convinced that they would bite us as well once they got going and never turned our backs on them without another diver riding shotgun. But these two didn't seem to pay us any attention and I turned to begin the ascent behind Robbie.\n\nOur plan called for Rod to be the last guy up. I rendezvoused with Robbie at about 175 just over a ledge and we both rested on the coral to wait for him to join us. He was late and Robbie fidgeted pointing to his pressure gauge not wanting to run low on air. I shrugged and gave him a \"what am I supposed to do\" look and we continued to wait. Suddenly Robbie dropped his extra gear and catapulted himself toward the wall pointing at a mass of bubble exhaust coming from the deeper water. \n\nWe both figured that Rod had some sort of air failure either at the manifold of his doubles or a regulator. Since my air consumption was lower, I decided to send Robbie up and I would go see if Rod needed help. As I descended in the bubble cloud, Robbie gave me an anxious OK sign and started up.\n\nBut when I reached Rod things were about as bad as they could get. One of the sharks had bitten him on the left thigh without provocation and blood was gushing in green clouds from the wound. I was horrified and couldn't believe my eyes. He was desperately trying to beat the 12 foot animal off his leg and keep from sinking deeper. I had no idea where the second shark was and lunged to grab his right shoulder harness strap to pull him up.\n\nAlmost simultaneously the second shark hit Rod in the same leg and bit him savagely. I could see Rod desperately gouging at the shark's eyes and gills as he grimly fought to beat off his attackers. With my free hand I blindly punched at the writhing torsos of the animals as they tore great hunks of flesh from my friend in flashes of open jaws and vicious teeth. Locked in mortal combat, we both beat at the sharks in frantic panic. And then they suddenly let go. I dragged Rod up the sand chute, half walking and half swimming. Once clear of the silt I could see Robbie about 100 feet above us looking on in horror. He started down to us as I lifted Rod off the bottom and kicked with all my might toward the surface.\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 53, "created": 1430597906.0},{"body": "(2 of 2)\n\n4\n\n\n\nBut in less than fifteen seconds the first shark returned and hit him again and began towing us both over the drop off. The attack had probably only lasted a minute at this point but Rod had lost a huge amount of blood and tissue and had gone limp in my grasp. I was still behind him clutching his right harness strap as the second larger shark hit him again on the opposite side down around the left calf. Like the other, this shark bit and hung on as we tumbled down the wall face.\n\nWe were dropping rapidly now completely out of control. My efforts to kick up were fruitless as the sharks continued to bite and tear at their victim, all the while dragging us deeper. I felt Rod move again to fend off another attack and my hopes soared upon realizing that he was still alive. I clung briefly to the edge of the drop off wall to arrest our rapid descent. The coral outcropping gave us some slight protection and for a moment the attacks stopped. \n\nBoth sharks retreated into the blue and I watched them circle our position from about ten feet away. To my horror I saw one shark swallow the remains of Rod's lower left leg right before my eyes. The other gulped a mouthful of flesh it had torn off. I tried to push Rod into the coral in an effort to shield him from another attack but there was nothing to afford any real shelter. As I turned away from the waiting predators, Rod and I came face to face for the first time during the attack. He shook his head weakly and tried to push me away. I grabbed for his waist harness for a new grip and felt my hand sink into his mutilated torso. There was no harness left to reach for. He had been disemboweled. \n\nShrieking into my mouthpiece in fury I pulled him from the coral and took off pumping for the surface with him clutched to my chest. Immediately the sharks were on us again. I felt the larger one actually force me to one side as it savagely sought to return to the wounds that gushed billows of dark blood into the ocean around us. Rod screamed for the last time as the second shark seized him by the mid-section and shook him. The blue water turned horribly turbid with bits of human tissue and blood. Once we were turned completely over and I felt Rod torn away from me.\n\nI watched his lifeless body drift into the abyss with the sharks still hitting him. The attack had started around 200 feet. My depth gauge was pegged at 325 feet now but I knew we were far deeper than that. The grimness of my own situation forced itself on me through a fog of narcosis and exertion. \n\n\n\n5\n\nThat's when I ran out of air. I think that subconsciously I almost decided to stay there and die. It seemed so totally hopeless and my strength was completely sapped. But I put my head back and put all my muscle into a wide steady power kick for the surface. I forced all thoughts to maintaining that kick cycle and willed myself upward. \n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity I sneaked a look at my depth gauge: it was still pegged at 325 feet. I sucked hard on the regulator and got a bit of a breath. Not much, but it fueled my oxygen starved brain a bit longer and I prayed my legs would get me up shallow enough to get another breath before the effects of hypoxia shut my systems down forever.\n\nThere's really no way to describe what it's like to slowly starve the brain of oxygen in combination with adrenaline induced survival instincts. But I remember thinking if I could just concentrate on kicking I could make it. After a while the sense of urgency faded and I remember looking for the surface through a red haze that gradually closed down into a tunnel before I passed out. The panic was gone and I went to sleep thinking \"damn, I almost made it.\" \n\nI woke up on the surface retching and expelling huge belches of expanding air. Apparently the small volume of air in the safety vest I wore had been enough to float me the final distance and save my life. But I still had to deal with an unknown amount of omitted decompression and the certainty that I was severely bent.\n\nSwimming to shore as fast I could, I felt my legs going numb. By the time I reached the beach I could barely stand. A couple on their honeymoon waded out and dragged me up on the sand. I gasped out instructions to get the oxygen unit from our van and collapsed. In an incredible burst of good fortune, it turned out the wife was an ER nurse from Florida and understood the pathology of decompression sickness. They got a steady flow of oxygen into me and ran to call the diving emergency numbers that I directed her to on the dive clipboard.\n\nI drifted away again into unconsciousness and was revived at the airport where a med-evac flight was waiting to fly me to Puerto Rico. But the Navy chamber was down and it was decided to take me to the only other functional facility up on the island's northwest corner nearly 200 miles farther away. But the flight crew was afraid I wouldn't make it when we ran low on oxygen shortly after passing San Juan. So they had the police stop traffic on the main divided highway and landed on the road where a waiting Coast Guard helicopter snatched me away to the hospital roof. \n\n6\n\n\n\n\nTwo days later I was released but with residual numbness in my arms and legs, substantial hearing loss, and legal blindness in my right eye that persists to this day. \n\nRobbie's last view of Rod and me was as we were dragged over the wall in a cloud of blood by the sharks. He never saw my free ascent and so reported us both killed when he got to shore. It was not until I called my dad from the hospital that he knew I had survived. A week later we had Rob's memorial service at the beach. I resumed diving the next day. His body was never recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAftermath: this attack in 1972 was widely reported and shark experts speculate that the oceanic white tips may have been attracted and then stimulated by the low frequency sound in the water from the nearby submarine testing. The previous deepest depth that a diver survived a free ascent from was 180 feet. Gilliam was probably closer to 400 feet. He was cited for heroism by the Virgin Islands government for risking his own life to try to save his partner. In 1993, British television (BBC) produced a special on the incident as part of a series called \"Dead Men's Tales\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor notes: \n\nBret Gilliam was professionally involved in the diving industry for 35 years and retired in 2006.
