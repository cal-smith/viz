I'm a NAUI certified diver of the lowest level.  The deepest I've gone on scuba gear was 60 feet, and that was 20 ft below my certification level.  My experience with submersibles is zilch, never been in one.  I do know that we have vessels capable of diving to incredible depths.  I believe James Cameron (movie director) went down into the Mariana Trench, which is the deepest (or damn close) spot in the ocean.  \n\nHowever life support is a huge issue, at that depth you have limited time to spend looking around.  You have to keep in mind that you still have to ascend 20,000 feet of ocean, and you can't do that quickly.  So most of your air supply is spent on the descent and ascent, what little remains allows you to explore at the desired depth.\n\nAs someone who's space expertise begins and ends at space camp in 5th grade....we can get a ship to Venus.  I believe we have sent unmaned vessels already.  The issue is in getting a manned spacecraft there.  Again the biggest issue is life support, you need to supply a steady amount of oxygen (obviously) to keep a human being alive.  \n\nThe next constraint would be fuel to get there.  It takes a lot of fuel to move and control a spacecraft quickly.  Which is a necessity if a human being is on board, because the longer the trip takes the more oxygen, food and water need to be supplied.  \n\nIf you remove the human being from the ship then you can use an engine like the Voyager spacecraft did.  Which is a nuclear engine that produces very little thrust, but has a long life time.  I believe one of the Voyager craft is now reaching the edge of our solar system.  Which is a crazy distance to travel, it's absolutely amazing the distance it has traveled...however it's taken forty years because it's moving so slow across such great distances.\n\nPersonally I think if we're going to make long distance manned missions a possibility we need to accept they're going to be a one way trip.  I'm confident we could get a person to Mars.  We could land them on Mars.  They could survive for awhile and transmit back observations and data...but they would die there.

Thats why when you read Nature papers from the 19th century, they start out \"Dear sir,\" or whatever. Now, journals are managed collections of scientific paper-- think sophisticated lab reports-- and each journal carves out a niche in the scientific community in much the same way that individual scientists do. Today, journal subscriptions are usually held by university libraries, so the journal curates the new material and then the library subscribes, giving everyone on campus access to the newest material and all the online legacy articles. The costs are high so the average person cannot afford access to scientific papers.\n\n   Science and Nature are often denigrated as magazines. They publish shorter papers aimed at a more general audience. Its an opprotunity to read about whale migration on one page and then flip to diamond nitrogen-vacancy spin physics at the same place. I've also seen them on sale at airports. The cost of Science, at least, is lower, and it has a lot of easier reading material before the manuscripts begin. Science and Nature have become the \"Showcase\" journals. I think of them as follows: the papers that change the way you think about science are supposed to publish in science. Major achievements, monumental discoveries, overturning old beliefs.\n\n   Reputability is a huge problem facing scientific publishing. As the total number of scientists has mushroomed, theres only really two good metric for output: number of papers and impact of those papers. As a result, it makes sense that if you want to get ahead in the career (science is a career for humans, first and foremost) you need a lot of papers and bonus if they're high impact. How else will someone on a committee know whether you are the person to hire or someone else if they have no background in your specalized field? Well, X had 2 science papers and Y published 10 articles in the International Journal of Phrenology. Perhaps you can guess which one might get the job.\n\n   The reputability becomes a problem because the number of journals has EXPLODED at the same time that open access has hit the scene. Theres lots of great chinese science, for instance, but i'm simply not going to bother publishing in chinese journals. No one I'm targeting reads those journals, so why publish there? and more importantly, if I don't want to publish there, why should i review any of the papers? thanks but no thanks, guys.  \n\n   There are a LOT of great arguments for open access publishing. However, what we're seeing emerge is starting to look a lot like a 2 tiered system (in the physical sciences, Plos one seems to have traction in the life sciences?) where you have the big name established journals that everyone wants to publish in, and you have the open access and small journals that start to look like paper mills because of the sheer volume of material that passes through them. Its a seperation that emerges between \"original\" science and \"incremental\" science. I do a new reaction no ones ever heard of with molecule X. I publish a big JACS paper and run off to my next position. Someone follows in my footsteps and does it with molecule Y. They publish a more incremental paper and don't get as much attention. edit: some people argue that incremental science is unfit to be published. But don't those scientists also deserve to get papers when the entire metric for the profession is based on papers? \n\nAnyway, I could write on this all day, and I expect a lot of people to have a lot of complex opinions on this subject.\n\nWith highest regard,\n\nyour nemesis\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 16, "created": 1432055659.0},{"body": "Yes, they are like magazines that publish articles, case reports, letters, etc. In general, no one gets a text copy because it's all online now.

Whilst this is a good model for testing transmission via intravenous drug users. The vast majority of people are infected via mucosal barriers such as during sex. It is well know that stopping the virus at this stage is significantly harder than simply stopping it in circulation. It's more difficult to get the anti-HIV protein to this area of the body.

Why that is they couldn't say.  The problem with AAV gene therapy isn't generally with the therapeutic target, it's with the AAV capsid itself.  However, one workaround is to transiently suppress the immune system to allow the virus a chance to infect the cells before becoming eliminated.\n\nC- While exposure from a needle stick injury is pretty low, we're talking about a direct injection of HIV, which mitigates any mucosal barriers.  More importantly, they are injecting lethal doses of HIV (4/4 macaques in the control experiments died) and are able to show full protection with the eCD4-Ig (all 4 macaques lived).\n\nI agree that this therapy may be several years from being ready for the public, but it seems to me that they've performed all the necessary experiments to warrant human clinical trials.

Several conditions are necessary for this transition to occur: 1) access to high protein vegetation that endures storage; 2) a climate dry enough to allow storage; 3) access to animals docile enough for domestication and versatile enough to survive captivity. Control of crops and livestock leads to food surpluses. Surplus frees people up to specialize in activities other than sustenance and supports population growth. The combination of specialization and population growth leads to the accumulation of social and technologic innovations which build on each other. Large societies develop ruling classes and supporting bureaucracies, which in turn lead to the organization of nation-states and empires.[2]\nAlthough agriculture arose in several parts of the world, Eurasia gained an early advantage due to the greater availability of suitable plant and animal species for domestication.

To aim for level 12-14 on the Borg scale. The borg scale is a qualitative \"rate of perceived exertion\" that studies find correlate fairly well to heart rate and oxygen consumption. It's not perfect as it's qualitative but is used in the field as it is easy for people to answer and cheap. An example can be seen here http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/borg-scale/  \n\n3. A more quantitative approach for walking was done in this study (it is paywalled) http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(09)00087-7/abstract They found that in general 100 steps/min would count as moderate exercise and recommended doing them in at least 10min long bouts. Again, individual differences may mean that you need less than 100 or more than 100 steps/min.  \n\nHopefully that helps you better gauge if walking around town or not is moderate exercise for you or not\n\nEDIT: adjusted Borg scale from 12 to 12-14. 12-14 is the scale typically used as moderate exercise, 12 was what was used in a study I helped out in for diabetic patients as explained below and I forgot to put the range in.", "gilded": 0, "score": 80, "created": 1431815052.0},{"body": "A good example is what happened with me.

Think about it, what does \"cardio\" exercise typically imply? Elevating the heart rate...right? Well, when you lift weights, what happens? Your heart rate increases. Your heart rate will increase more rapidly with a higher intensity (i.e. more weight), however you can not perform a high intensity exercise for long without rest. This is essentially why you get a different cardiovascular adaptation from low intensity/long duration exercise compared to high intensity/short duration exercise. With that said, you will still likely get adequate cardiovascular responses from resistance training as long as you train for long enough. The more sets you perform (as long as intensity is adequate) the more often your heart rate elevates. A 45-minute to 1 hour workout should be adequate even with appropriate rest intervals interspersed.  \nAlso as Lemming233 pointed out resistance training has an additive effect to cardiovascular training.

The former is different from the latter despite the same word being used, as the latter is more often described as a hypothesis in the scientific community, but redundancy and evolution in etymology means you can often end up with the same word meaning different things, and sometimes the complete opposite in those definitions.\n\nAs Thefriendlyfaceplant mentioned it's not solely on neonics or other pesticides that are causing bee mortalities, it's a culmination of multiple factors increases susceptibility to some factors that are then taken advantages of by things like parasites, which may or may not vector diseases that then have much greater efficacy than previously observed because the infected hosts are not as fit as before. So the hosts suffer more, die easier, and the media jumps for the simple reason of \"pesticides kill bees\", rather than \"neonics cause increased stress in honeybees which promotes increased mortality as a result of weakened immune systems failing to combat pathogens transmitted from known parasites\".

Overly aggressive parasite infestation/infection would result in the death of the hive - a negative feedback system in short-term evolution of the parasites/viruses. Neonic exposure greatly increases the efficacy of the viruses, increasing bee mortality.

These are pesticides that are applied as a coating on the seed and become an integral part of the plant. They will kill all insects, but they've been specially formulated to not harm bees. However, the research into their effects on bees was very minimal - they only looked at the immediate effect. Turned out that the bees survived initially getting the nectar and pollen from these plants, but after storing it then digging it up later to eat - especially to feed their young, that's when shit went down and you ended up getting things like Colony Collapse Disorder happening.\n\nThere are other risks such as the Foul Brood Diseases etc. too\n\nThe Varroa Mites can be thought of as what mosquitos are to us.

We reared honey bee (Apis mellifera) larvae in vitro and provide the first demonstration that N. ceranae can infect larvae and decrease subsequent adult longevity. We exposed three-day-old larvae to a single dose of 40,000 (40K), 10,000 (10K), zero (control), or 40K autoclaved (control) N. ceranae spores in larval food. Spores developed intracellularly in midgut cells at the pre-pupal stage (8 days after egg hatching) of 41% of bees exposed as larvae. We counted the number of N. ceranae spores in dissected bee midguts of pre-pupae and, in a separate group, upon adult death. Pre-pupae exposed to the 10K or 40K spore treatments as larvae had significantly elevated spore counts as compared to controls. Adults exposed as larvae had significantly elevated spore counts as compared to controls. Larval spore exposure decreased longevity: a 40K treatment decreased the age by which 75% of adult bees died by 28%. Unexpectedly, the low dose (10K) led to significantly greater infection (1.3 fold more spores and 1.5 fold more infected bees) than the high dose (40K) upon adult death. Differential immune activation may be involved if the higher dose triggered a stronger larval immune response that resulted in fewer adult spores but imposed a cost, reducing lifespan. The impact of N. ceranae on honey bee larval development and the larvae of naturally infected colonies therefore deserve further study.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 5, "created": 1432915412.0},{"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "score": 4, "created": 1432918401.0},{"body": "When any organism is weakened by toxins in their environment, of COURSE they can  more easily fall pray to parasites and diseases.\n\nThis is a symptom of the massive use of pesticides used.", "gilded": 0, "score": 4, "created": 1432940529.0},{"body": "Has someone forgotten about the fact that bees used to be able to fight off these parasites and maintain health colonies despite their presence? \n\nAhem:\n\n Neonicotinoid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonicotinoid\nWikipedia\nNeonicotinoids are a class of neuro-active insecticides chemically similar to nicotine. In the 1980s Shell and in the 1990s Bayer started work on their development. The neonicotinoid family includes acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, nithiazine, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam.\n\nDecline in bee population\n\nA dramatic rise in the number of annual beehive losses noticed around 2006 spurred interest in factors potentially affecting bee health.[50][51] When first introduced, neonicotinoids were thought to have low-toxicity to many insects, but recent research has suggested a potential toxicity to honey bees and other beneficial insects even with low levels of contact. Neonicotinoids may impact bees\u2019 ability to forage, learn and remember navigation routes to and from food sources.[52] Separate from lethal and sublethal effects solely due to neonicotinoid exposure, neonicotinoids are also being explored with a combination with other factors, such as mites and pathogens, as potential causes of colony collapse disorder.[53] Neonicotinoids may be responsible for detrimental effects on bumble bee colony growth and queen production.[54]\n\nPreviously undetected routes of exposure for bees include particulate matter or dust, pollen and nectar[55] Bees can fail to return to the hive without immediate lethality due to sub-nanogram toxicity,[56] one primary symptom of colony collapse disorder.[57] Separate research showed environmental persistence in agricultural irrigation channels and soil.[58]\n\nA 2012 study showed the presence of thiamethoxam and clothianidin in bees found dead in and around hives situated near agricultural fields. Other bees at the hives exhibited tremors, uncoordinated movement and convulsions, all signs of insecticide poisoning. The insecticides were also consistently found at low levels in soil up to two years after treated seed was planted and on nearby dandelion flowers and in corn pollen gathered by the bees. Insecticide-treated seeds are covered with a sticky substance to control its release into the environment, however they are then coated with talc to facilitate machine planting. This talc may be released into the environment in large amounts. The study found that the exhausted talc showed up to about 700,000 times the lethal insecticide dose for a bee. Exhausted talc containing the insecticides is concentrated enough that even small amounts on flowering plants can kill foragers or be transported to the hive in contaminated pollen. Tests also showed that the corn pollen that bees were bringing back to hives tested positive for neonicotinoids at levels roughly below 100 parts per billion, an amount not acutely toxic, but enough to kill bees if sufficient amounts are consumed.[59]\n\nA 2013 review concluded that neonicotinoids as they are typically used harm bees and that safer alternatives are urgently needed.[60] An October 2013 study by Italian researchers demonstrated that neonicotinoids disrupt bees' immune systems, making them susceptible to viral infections to which the bees are normally resistant.[61][62]\n\nIn April 2015 EASAC conducted a study of the potential effects on organisms providing a range of ecosystem services like pollination and natural pest control which are critical to sustainable agriculture.[63] The resulting report concludes \"there is an increasing body of evidence that the widespread prophylactic use of neonicotinoids has severe negative effects on non-target organisms that provide ecosystem services including pollination and natural pest control.\"[64]\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 79, "created": 1432908259.0},{"body": "Isn't it the case that in the country where varroa desctructor comes from the local bee Apis Cerana has resistance.\nIt's where varroa has spread to countries where it isn't native that the bees (apis mellifera) are experiencing issues.\nThis is a common theme where species travel out of their natural geographical location.\n\nThis isn't a case of bees now being weak being caused by an external chemical influence it's a case of the bees experiencing a new parasite.\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 61, "created": 1432910480.0},{"body": "Exactly.

I'm not discounting neuroplasticity or the change our brains can go through, it's fantastic, but simply pointing out the trend.\n\nIn general, we have layers. Take a peek at [this brain cut in half](http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxvgrnk8ff1qzcf71o1_1280.jpg). The forehead is on the left in this picture.\n\n- Cortex is all the [\"lobes\"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Cerebrum_lobes.svg/1280px-Cerebrum_lobes.svg.png?1432241015712) of the brain. It's containing most of what we would call higher functions. The back is for vision, sides are for auditory, top is for sensation and motor, and front is for cognition / social function. That's a massive over simplification and I feel dirty. Regardless, this layer on top is the most recent adaptation we have managed. Other mammals have this as well. Our very developed frontal lobe, for all those executive things like personality and social function, seems to be the main thing distinguishing great apes (including us) from other mammals.\n- [Basal Ganglia](http://kin450-neurophysiology.wikispaces.com/file/view/basalganglia.GIF/393453936/basalganglia.GIF) is a bit trickier to see on that half brain picture intuitively because it is a deeper near midline structure. The basal ganglia mostly work with motor function. They add constant small feedback and adjustments to the motor instructions the cortex sends downwards. There's also roles in the memory and emotion played.\n- Thalamus is the egg in the middle. It's basically a massive filter and processor of things going both up and down. \n- Midbrain is the top part of the [brainstem](http://mybrainnotes.com/brain-stem-structures.jpg). It's involved in motor function, motivation and habituation, as well as relaying visual and auditory information. We're getting further down here, and as we do we get more evolutionarily 'archaic'. The midbrain (aka mesencephalon if you want to look it up) resembles the [older structures](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Archipallium), like ancient vertebrates.\n- Pons is the second part of the brainstem. It's largely a relay between the expanding cortex and cerebellum, giving it important in coordination, hearing, and other functions. It also plays roles in wakefulness, sleep and dreaming. The pons first evolved as an offshoot from the medulla.\n- The medulla is quite ancient, and the bottom part of the brainstem. It covers base functions for us, such as heart rate, respiratory drive, vomiting, blood pressure management and other involuntary functions. As an example, [lampreys](http://animalia-life.com/data_images/lamprey/lamprey1.jpg) have a fully developed medulla to manage bodily functions. It's suggested to have evolved in early fish, 500 million years ago, and is disproportionately large in reptilian brains to this day. \n- Spinal cord - you know what this is, but perhaps not that it is more than merely a pathway. The spinal cord conducts all sorts of fantastic reflexes, including but not limited to that hammer tap on the knee. We have processing happening, and lots of basic perceptions - pain causing retraction of a hand doesn't bother to take the time your brain needs to process it. Spinal cord gets it done!\n- Gutbrain is interesting. There are a plexus of nerves throughout the intestinal tract keeping things regulated. We've got to manage digestion, protection, and absorption as efficiently as possible.

Octopus brains aren't solely located in the mantle; the nerves that extend into each arm are basically akin to brains of their own. So instead of the main brain controlling every action of every arm muscle, it only has to send a simple command to the arm to move, and the arm can process that command and do the rest of the work on its own. Super cool stuff. Because the arms are fairly autonomous, the octopus' ability to register and respond to light variations is extremely fast. They're (mind-blowingly) colorblind, and are able to perform their color/texture camouflage purely by assessing brightness and contrast. And because they have both rhodopsin photoreceptors and \"brains\" in their tentacles, instead of rhodopsin solely in their eyes and a brain solely in the mantle, their camouflage processes are even faster. Because they have this peripheral processing ability, the photoreceptors in the arms don't have to send signals to the central brain alerting it of light variations and then wait for the brain's response commands. Instead, the light variations can be instantly perceived and processed in the arms, which makes for that lightning-fast camouflage. Hope that explains your question a little! \n\nSome other cool octopus tidbits: \n\n* Octopuses have three hearts! \n* Octopuses only have one bone in their body, called a beak.

The test I'm thinking of would be to check if when the octopus's brain reacts to something it sensed in its environment via its eyes, for example, by camouflaging itself, then does the photosensitive pigment create a cellular environment for the tissue around it to make it go to a specific colour. In other words, the camouflaging might be an central-nervous response to an awareness through sensory information, but exactly how to camouflage would not be in the central nervous system. (I guess they could also just test if any neurons are making any transmissions to the central nervous system due to this photosensitive pigment like the retina and optic nerve would normally.)\n\nThis is just a hypothesis, on my part, but it is the only one I can think of that makes sense, given how complex and how well-fitted the camouflage patterns are for the environment.

But after my first round, I called my doctor in a mild panic, demanding a neuro consult and afraid that it had spread to my brain, because I was not just distracted, I was genuinely confused and having trouble with complex tasks that I used to breeze through. He gave me my consult, although he suspected it was just chemo brain, and he was right. I was still on short term disability at that point, and I began to genuinely fear that I was losing my ability to do my job. My last job with the company was a promotion based on self taught coding skills that involved me producing very complex reports that could basically boil things down to the level that a 6 year old could read them, so naturally they wanted me to produce these reports for the senior leadership. It was extremely stressful too, because I got the job for work I had done and taught myself, their demands quickly blossomed into much more complex stuff, and I felt like a teacher who was only one page ahead of the students in the textbook for the longest time. But now I was genuinely panicked because I did not think I could recreate it any more. I called my boss, and begged him to save my code on a drive somewhere, or to not turn in my laptop (too late), or to burn it onto a CD for me. After all, this was my resume now, if I chose to stay in that field of work, and I did not get my old job back. He did not do any of the things I asked, and I have not been able to return to work yet, and it has been 5 years. Many people do not understand my fear of this, because they assume that since I created it once, I can do it again. But much of it was complex stuff that I created, and I had a set of basic templates that could be adjusted to apply to so many different things. That is where you get true efficiency in a job like that. It is chunks of code that you save and build on and nurse into powerful stuff over months or years, plus one-off oddball things you may only need once in a blue moon, but when you need them, there is no easy substitute. Well, the asshole did nothing to save it for me, not even keeping it on a server somewhere for me if it violated company rules for me to have my own copy of it. If he had just done that, I could at least use it again in a different position in the company, if/when I return to work. Now I have nightmares about returning to work, and just staring at a screen unable to do anything. I tried to recreate some of it, but it felt like it was gone.

I don't have access to the Nature article, but from the abstract and getting my PhD in a very closely related area, I think I can infer what they've done. (I studied how the oxygen reduction mechanism changes in aprotic ionic liquids when you carefully add proton activity, and spent about five years working on non-aqueous metal-air batteries.)\n\nPeople have tried to make a Sodium-Oxygen battery for a while, and you first attempt this by simply putting a piece of sodium in an electrolyte opposite an air-cathode and seeing if it runs. The air-cathode is the part of the battery they're talking about in this paper.\n\nThe electrolyte you choose is very important as it's purpose is to transfer ions from one electrode to the other. In this case it transports Na+ from the anode to the cathode in the form of Sodium Triflate. This is the easiest way to do it, but historically it's had a lot of problems.  The big problem is that you have Na+ in solution.  When reduced oxygen (as superoxide in this case) meets Na+ it immediately reacts and forms sodium superoxide NaO2.\n\nWhy is NaO2 a problem/challenge? Because its not soluble in anything. Ideally you would want a solvent that can also dissolve the discharge products of the air-battery, but since these are usually oxides that's very difficult. So as soon as you reduce oxygen at your air-cathode, you form NaO2 immediately at the site of oxygen reduction. This oxide precipitates from solution and covers your cathode, blocking catalytic sites, clogging air channels, and limiting subsequent diffusion of oxygen or sodium. So your battery only lasts for as long as you have available surface area in the cathode, which is pretty short.\n\nWhat the authors seem to have done is add a little bit of water (10ppm) which they've called a proton transfer catalyst (because that's it's function and other species might work too). The water reacts with reduced oxygen (superoxide) first to form peroxide and this peroxide diffuses away from the cathode to react with Sodium Triflate in the electrolyte where it likely forms Sodium Peroxide. This saves your air-cathode from being clogged by discharge products and lets you fully discharge the battery.\n\nNow the authors must have had some further insights into exactly whats happening here to make it into Nature, but until I get a copy of the article I won't be able to say exactly what was significant there.\n\nedits: I was writing sodium but thinking magnesium most of this time so I made too many references to peroxide, which doesn't show up until there's water present. (Actually superoxide is extremely basic with a pKa of 24 or something close to that, it'll destroy almost any organic compound it encounters, even taking the C-2 proton off imidazolium. It's been a couple years since I wrote my disseration, so I don't remember the exact value.)", "gilded": 1, "score": 1238, "created": 1432818336.0},{"body": "This is actually very close to what is happening! You are 100% correct in that the main problem is that NaO2 is not soluble in anything. This is the main issue not only of Na-O2 batteries, but all aprotic metal-O2 batteries (such as Li-O2, and some papres on K-O2 exist etc.). What we have found is that this process, in the presence of a proton, changes the reaction to first form HO2 (based on the reaction of H+ with the generated O2-), which is soluble in the aprotic media. This then undergoes a metathesis reaction with Na+ ions to make NaO2, which deposits on the surface. This process then regenerates the H+. In this sense, the proton acts as a carrier and transports the superoxide from the cathode to the solution phase where NaO2 can be made. This is a much more efficient reaction that a pure surface driven reaction of Na + O2 --&gt; NaO2. This is why in the absense of a proton source, the performance of Na-O2 batteries is very poor, as we have shown.\n\nThis does not necessarily prevent clogging of the cathode, as the end product is still insoluble and the total cell capacity is still purely a function of how much NaO2 you can stuff into the cathode. What we report on is a how to better facilitate the solid to solution mechanism, which in turn allows the NaO2 discharge product to form large cubes as opposed to a surface layer of NaO2 (which occurs without a proton catalyst). As a result of this, there is a capacity increase. Clogging of the air cathode still occurs, but since the discharge/charge reactions are now solution based, it prevents \"early\" cell failure due to thin films of NaO2 preventing electronic/mass transport, which causes termination of the cell. \n\nIf you do not have access to the article by any means, I would be more than happy to send it to you!

Moving forward, new additives can be developed that either a) improve this efficiency or b) guide this process towards specificity of NaO2 production to minimize decomposition reactions. If this can be done, then we can start talking about achieving the necessary power density and cycling capabilities for real world applications.\n\nUntil then, these small steps in the early development stage are what is necessary to open up new possibilities that were previously unknown or not understood.

Your discharge products are temporarily soluble; just long enough to diffuse away from the cathode. This means your metal-oxide precipitates in the middle of the electrolyte. Unfortunately the middle of your electrolyte is by necessity electrically isolated from either electrode.

After a quick look I found this:\n\n&gt;The results, shown in Fig. 5, are representative of mul- tiple experiments. Figure 5a clearly shows that the PPTC is the criti- cal component that allows for full oxidation of NaO2 at a low overpotential. The charging voltage (2.3 V) for 10 ppm H2O is the same as previously reported for \u2018dry\u2019 electrolytes and is much lower than in the absence of the PPTC, where a complex profile is observed (mostly above 3.5V). The activation step at initial charge is ascribed to electrolyte decomposition, which releases minute amounts of water, as proposed by Gasteiger and colleagues, who observed a similar voltage jump on oxidation of a cathode pre- filled with commercial Li2O212. In accord, NaO2 cubes are oxidized on full charge (see the inset SEM image in Fig. 5a), but potentials in excess of 4.0 V are required in the absence of added water. This leads to extremely poor cycling in a typical voltage window, whereas 10 ppm water allows cycling with over 95% Coulombic efficiency (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 9). This demonstrates that at low water concentrations, reaction of a weak acid (HA) with superoxide O2\u2022\u2212 generated at the cathode is kinetically competitive compared to the diffusion of HA to the sodium surface; that is, some HA sur- vives, even at the 10 ppm level. Its entrapment within the porous cathode may be similar to that of long-lived redox mediators in Li\u2013O2 cells18. Passivation of the sodium surface to form a solid- electrolyte interphase undoubtedly assists. In a practical cell, PPTC reactivity at the anode would be eliminated by a protective membrane, which would also prevent dendrite formation.

The sodium battery recharges very efficiently.\n\nWhat you may mean is that the lithium oxygen battery hasn't been recharged, which is misleading. Lithium ion batteries work already, but LiO2 is unstable, and breaks down to Li2O2. The catalyst type that the study uses can only work on LiO2.
