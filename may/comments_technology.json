I've softened a bit since then because I feel that it's a good idea for the government to cover some things that many libertarians would say that they shouldn't. I honestly wouldn't have a problem with a single payer healthcare system, for example. At the same time, I think libertarians bring some good points and ideas to the table. Ron Paul is very anti-corporate, which I like. We have a major problem these days with what they called Industry Capture in my Sociology program. This is basically when an industry (let's say cable companies like Comcast for example) manages to bring the people who are supposed to regulate them over to their way of thinking through any combination of bribes, lobbying, etc. Effectively, this makes that industry its own regulator because they can just feed the regulations that they want to the people in charge of their own regulators so that regulation becomes self-regulation, defeating the purpose of the regulation completely. \n\nHe's also pro-life, which reddit doesn't like very much, nor do I. There was also the scandal of racial remarks in a one of his news letters from (I think) the 80's. The ghost writer who supposedly wrote those remarks was fired immediately when it happened, and Ron Paul disavowed it, but his detractors maintained that since it was in his news letter with his signature it was his fault, essentially accusing him of being a racist. I maintain that even if he did hold racial prejudice back then, he's spoken against racism as being a very toxic form of collectivism much more recently (libertarianism is all about individualism), so I find the position of him currently being a racist (at least more of one than anyone else considering that everyone holds some form of racial bias even if its on an unconscious level) to be untenable. \n\nMy basic problem with Ron Paul is that he's too much of a purist in his libertarianism. If there's one thing I've learned, its that effective government should be flexible in order to address the needs of the nation.

We'd learned from a previous whistle-blower that [the NSA had a room in AT&amp;T data center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A) into which a copy of all of their phone &amp; internet traffic data was sent.  This was illegal, and had been hidden from Congress and The People.  Organizations like the ACLU, EFF and others wanted to sue AT&amp;T over this breach of law.  The surveillance state's cronies in Congress proposed a law that would grant the collaborator telecoms retroactive immunity for breaking the law and violating the human rights of Americans, to head off such a law suit.  \n\nThe link I posted was Senator and presidential candidate Obama's official statement on that retroactive immunity bill.  As /u/molo1134 correctly points out, he did not in fact filibuster it.  He voted *for* it.  As president, he invoked \"executive privilege\" to quash other similar suits.\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/pages/case-against-retroactive-amnesty-telecoms\n\nhttp://sadtrombone.com/\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 21, "created": 1431382206.0},{"body": "Right.

It's too costly.  There's too much liability and it would be bad for business.  Manufacturers are EXACTLY that.  A manufacturer.  Every car the Honda manufactures is already sold.  To a dealer.  It doesn't matter if it's a bright green Accord with a pink interior.  It is not the manufacturer's responsibility to sell the car.  Sure Honda is going to have a national advertisement for the car, but it's ultimately Smithtown Honda that is going to bear the bulk of maintaining the car, advertising the car locally and paying interest on the car...and here's the most important part...losing $5,000 to sell said car, when all is said and done.\n\nWhen Honda can manufacture 1,000,000 Accords and know that they are already sold before they are done being built, what is the point of taking over the responsibility of selling to the consumer?  \n\nPeople love to negotiate on new cars.  You think I'm wrong?  Fine...pay sticker price then.  Oh, you're not going to?  Sounds like people who refuse to pay sticker are the ones who negotiate.  People say they don't like negotiating for multiple reasons (because they are bad at it, they are afraid they are going to make a mistake or the dealership they are dealing with, is a pain in the ass to deal with.)  Which brings me to my next point;  competition.\n\nCompetition is good.  Let's say you take away all your competition and if you want to buy a Honda, you go straight to Honda.  Honda says your trade in is worth $5,000?  You want more?  Sorry, don't buy a Honda then.  There is no \"going to the other dealership\" and trying to get $6,000.  Honda isn't going to \"stretch\" for you.  Here is the price for a new Accord.  There is no more negotiating.  The price is the price and if you don't like it, go buy a Ford. \n\nLet's say you do buy a Honda but the experience is a horrible one.  You're never going to buy from Smithtown Honda again!  Only problem is, it's not Smithtown Honda anymore...It's Honda of America.  There is no \"other dealership\".  If you have a bad experience with Honda selling to you directly, there is no more middle man to go above and beyond to keep your business.  You're S.O.L. and Honda is going to lose you as a customer forever. \n\nDon't believe me?  Google \"Ford Auto Collection\".  It was an experiment by Ford in the 90's.  They bought all the dealerships in a few towns and tried to sell directly to consumers.  It failed miserably.  Your trade in was worth $5,000 and it if you leave to go to another Ford dealer, it's worth $5,000 there as well.  Competition was dead and consumers were paying more for cars.\n\nNot all dealerships are bad.  Not all dealerships are \"out to get you\".  It's okay for Guess to make $300 on a pair of $350 jeans, but if a dealership makes $500 on a $30,000 car, they are a bunch of thieves. \n\nIf Tesla wants to expand, they are going to have to franchise.  Industry insiders say it and Musk himself has eluded to it.  The infrastructure is too big and too volatile at the consumer level to be ran otherwise.  It's very easy to sell directly to 2,000 people a month.  What happens when that number becomes 125,000?  What happens when your UIO (units in operation) starts running into the millions?  It's far easier for 100 dealers to keep track of 10,000 customers, rather than one company to keep track of 1,000,000 individuals.\n\nThis is probably a moot point in having typed all of this, but understand that consumers pay less because dealers compete.  It's the same thing as Walmart having a sale that Target doesn't.  \n\n\nEDIT - I'm not saying that dealerships should be lobbying against Tesla.

I don't believe reddit ever really does anything as an entity that doesn't have some PR angle to it too. That includes the SOPA blackout. They can make a post about how they're doing it on their own site, there will be a circlejerk in the thread for the next 18 hours, a few clickbait rags will write about it, and that's basically it.\n5. They, like almost every single person ITT were unaware that this was happening. See point #1 about it not being popular enough. Maybe they would have taken part if they were aware of it. But seeing as how it only has 2 days to take off at this point in time, I doubt they will. They would probably even be shat on in the comments for being too late if they did.\n\nI also don't think anything has changed or that you can point to their lack of involvement here as an indicator of change. Just because this is one form of internet activism that you support and you happen to be aware of today doesn't obligate them to take part.

While they have traditionally had good content I wouldn't say it is on par with recent HBO shows (GoT silicon valley etc..) Or Netflix originals. No I think the reason that Netflix orginal content is so much better than traditional TV is because the writers/cast/story can remain consistent throughout the series. The writers/directors know the show can be watched in order and they don't have to worry about commercial breaks. Netflix also has the advantage on getting the whole season written before the first episode airs so if something needs to change it can change. \n\nTdlr: There are many obstacles to great story telling, decency restrictions is one of them.
