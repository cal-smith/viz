By the way, if you talk to admins about it it's just *\"ban\"*, never shadowban. If you think about it, it makes pretty good sense; if you prevent someone from posting, they'll just make a new account, but if you ban them by just hiding all of their posts and comments from other people the other people are covered -- and that's the point of any ban, really, to serve other people on the site/forum/subforum. I'd guess the practice started off as a spam-prevention measure -- let the spambots keep posting, hide the content and keep collecting metadata from the posters so you can do more permanent measures. \n\nSo, a colloquial 'shadowban' is usually a global Reddit ban. This should also not be confused with the Automoderator option of automatically removing all posts by a given user. This is a pretty malicious way some subs use to get rid of unwanted people or opinions.\n\nI moderate /r/MagicTCG, which is constantly growing, and we tend to notify users if they've been banned globally *([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/34vfxp/is_scapeshift_a_good_deck_for_fans_of_control/cqypg6z))*. I remember one week there were 18 people who were posting and had been banned from Reddit. I started wondering if there was a hate thread we'd missed and contacted the admins. They informed me that all 18 people had gotten global bans from different sources, and were also amused that they were all posting on /r/MagicTCG. So if you have larger subreddits you're going to run into a bunch of coincidences.\n\nFYI, if someone who's been globally banned on a sub you moderate, you'll see their posts on a light red background, and they'll all be on the moderation queue *(there's even a setting to turn this off)*.

A woman is driving along and stops to get gas. As she pulls out of the gas station, another car follows close behind her. It keeps flashing its brights at her. She makes a few turns, but the car stays close to her. She's being followed. As soon as she thinks she's ditched him, the lights flash into her car again. Terrified, she finds another gas station. She stops her car and runs out screaming for help. A man jumps out of the other car and says, \"Run and call 911! There's a man in your back seat with a knife!\" Turns out, he was flashing his brights every time the man in the back of her car was about to stab her. Always keep your car doors locked, even when getting gas.\n\n2. A man goes out on a date with a beautiful woman. He can't believe his luck. She even buys him a drink. That's the last thing he remembers until he wakes up in a motel room. He's sitting in a bathtub that's full of ice. His back hurts. He realizes someone has cut into his back and stole his kidneys! Don't go out on dates with people out of your league.\n\n3. There's a gang initiation. Gang bangers drive around at night with their lights off. If you flash your brights at them, you become the target. They have to follow you and shoot you in the head to get into the gang. Don't flash your brights at cars with their lights off!\n\n4. Something, something, guy who has a hook for a hand. \n\n5. Guy sees a young woman standing on the side of the road. It's his first time picking up a hitchhiker. He stops because it's raining, and she's alone. She gets in the car. She's pale. He turns on the heat. She gives him her address, and he drives her home. When he gets there, he realizes his car is empty. Where did she go? He walks up to the house and rings the bell. The old woman who answers is angry when the man asks about this young woman. He sees a photo on her wall and says, \"That's her!\" She explains to him that her daughter died 10 years ago when she was hit by a drunk driver when she was trying to get a ride home. Don't hitchhike or pick up hitchhikers!\n\n6. A high school girl is babysitting one evening. She puts the two kids to bed. She starts to do her homework at the phone rings. \"You'd better check on the children.\" The caller hangs up. The girl is a little put off but continues to do her homework. The phone rings again. \"You'd better check on the children!\" He hangs up again. She's freaked out this time and calls the police. They tell her to stay put, and they're going to trace the calls. A few minutes later, the phone rings again. \"You have to get out of the house! The call is coming from inside the house!\" The children had been murdered. Moral of the story? I don't know... don't babysit, maybe. Or don't get two phone lines in your house?\n\nThat's all I can think of right now.

We'll send you fewer surveys or smaller rewards until you can prove that you can answer honestly but you aren't banned completely, at least not yet.\n\nThe best way to get more surveys and higher rewards is to answer every survey honestly. There are many signals we use to determine how honest or accurate a respondent is, this type of survey is the most obvious signal, and we use those signals to decide who gets surveys, and how often they get surveys. \n\nAs you can imagine the incentives are tricky.

Here's a simple formula you can use to make some from someone who's experienced LARP firsthand:\n\n**Supplies:**\n\n* PVC pipe *(you can use golf shafts and they're lighter, but not as strong and harder to work with)*\n\n* Pool noodle and/or pipe insulation *(if using golf shaft, you pretty much need pipe insulation)*\n\n* Pantyhose and/or cloth *(pantyhose is cheap and easy, cloth will last longer)*\n\n* Packing tape *(the clear plastic kind, not duct tape.  As an advocate of duct tape, I like to use it everywhere...but NOT here.)*\n\n* Duct tape and/or electrical tape.\n\n* Rubber bands\n\n* Camp pad *(just trust me)*\n\n\n**Tools:**\n\n* Hacksaw *(or any saw, really)*\n\n* Knife *(or scissors)*\n\n* Hands *(or a robot to do the work for you)*\n\n\n**Now, steps:**\n\n1.) Cut the pipe to a length reasonable for a weapon.  Remember to include length for a handle/hilt *(add about 1.5 inches to the bottom over what you want for this)*.  Cut the pipe about an inch shorter than you want the weapon to be *(after adding the space for the hilt...so add .5 inches over what you want in the end).*\n\n2.) Line the upper end of the pipe with foam/pool noodle.  This should extend about an inch past the edge of the pipe.  That's for safety, given that a kid's playing with it.  Once lined, secure the foam to the pipe at the bottom with electrical and/or duct tape.\n\n --- Tip: to prevent the pipe from poking through as easily, cap it off by taping a penny to the end.\n\n3.) Add some loose foam to the space between the end of the pipe and the foam.  Tape a piece of camp pad to the edge of your forming weapon.\n\n4.) Repeat step 2 on the bottom of the hilt of the weapon.  This will make it safer should somebody get hit with the bottom of the weapon.  Apply camp pad again.\n\n5.) Using pieces of tape as long as possible, and overlapping as little as possible, cover the foam on the upper end of the weapon with packing tape.  Poke several small holes in this, to allow the foam room to breathe/compact.\n\n6.) Cover with cloth.\n\n-- Tip: I've used e-tape to make the hilt look different, and this can be used over the pommel (bottom foam portion) as well.\n\n7.) Hand weapon to your wife.  Have her hit you in the back as hard as she can with it.  *(This is to make sure that it's safe.  If she can hurt you, it's not safe.)*\n\n--- Now you have a weapon that won't break as easily for your son. xD", "gilded": 0, "score": 44, "created": 1431560552.0},{"body": "&gt;FUCKING KO'D LIKE A LITTLE BITCH. \nr/unexpected", "gilded": 0, "score": 67, "created": 1431539698.0},{"body": "This is the only non-AMA thread that I just skipped to all the OP comments.

But then I went to college, and while I could resist the peer pressure in high school, college was a different beast all together. Finally, after three months of trying, my friends finally convinced me to try it once. It . . . it was terrible.\n\nWe headed out to the stairs behind the building. Me, my friend John and his girl Sam, I forget what exactly we smoked, something minty, if I recall. I had just stopped coughing as much and was really starting to enjoy it, if I might confess, when we heard a door open somewhere above us. We three choose to ignore it, instead opting to stand in silence and enjoy the night. Besides, at the time, I thought it was just a couple coming to makeout on the stairs, as there was a party going on several floors above.\n\nHowever our calm silence was not to last, about twenty seconds or so after we heard the door open, that was when it all happened. My friend John flinched as if something had hit him and looked up, 'Did the gutter tear or something?' 'My neck is wet' Sam replied. John was still looking up when he told us, 'Someone is up there'. He got out his keys, and used the tiny flashlight hooked to the key-ring to try to see who it was.\n\nI don't quite remember what happened first, whether I smelled the shit first or whether I heard Sam scream out 'Shit, that's shit' before that. Even though my voice was still hoarse and sore from the cigarette, I still reflexively stated, 'He's shitting on us' quite incredulously. But John, who was still looking up with his light, had a better view than the both of us and corrected me, 'No dude, do you see that? That's a girl'.\n\nI couldn't fucking believe it, a fucking drunk girl was throwing common decency and courtesy, respect, out the window and just using the back of the building as her own personal toilet. I was so livid I didn't hear was Sam said next, I think it was something rude about that girl's labia, I just wanted to go home and clean myself up. However, John and Sam wouldn't let it go, they both *had* to confront 'that bitch' who shit all over us, they really are both quite alike. It was then that we could hear the door close again, and that quickly forced me to follow both John and Sam to the sixth floor, although I really had no choice as John had the key back to our room.\n\nWe could easily hear the party when we reached the floor and John went straight for their door. The next few moments aren't clear to me. I am not a sociable person under normal circumstances, and the fact that I was now covered in feces knocking on some strangers door to a room full of even more strangers did nothing to improve my anxiety. Honestly, all I remember was both John and Sam yelling to be let in to find the drunk girl, while the guy who opened the door had started to scream at us to leave, us being covered in shit and all. Somewhere along the lines they had gotten a broom and were using it to push us away from the dorm, much like you would a stray who was bothering your house animals. But perhaps the worst moment of all this, yes even worse then being covered in some strange girl's watery waste, was the crowd of onlookers that was beginning to form. At first it was a crowd formed from those living on the floor. Then the crowd grew larger than what that floor could hold, which is when, to my horror, I realized that these people weren't all from this dorm and that someone from inside the room was yelling for help to those outside, causing a crowd to form around the three of us. To this day, I have never been more horrified.\n\nIt was during all this that I witness a rather conspicuous girl trying to push her way past all this chaos to escape. She looked frazzled and embarrassed as she pushed her way through the crowd. This girl was also walking rather oddly, and I realized that this might be the culprit who shat on us. Unfortunately, she was able to make her way past us before I could grab her, but I was able to call to John 'It was her, the one in the blue shirt!' He never heard me as he was still in a shouting match with the rooms occupants, I then choose this moment to also make my escape. I made my way to my room, where I must have waited fifteen minutes before I finally gave up and took a shower with my clothes on. At some point, John had gotten back to the room, gotten a change of clothes and left, leaving the door unlocked for me, thank god. The next morning the event was all over Campus and the University's Facebook, apparently John and Sam had talked to the management and gave a description, apparently while John never heard me shout to him, Sam did, but she misheard me, which is why I read that this drunk girl was in a blue skirt and not shirt, as I had witnessed her wearing. Funnily enough, they also reported that she was shaved, although I have no idea how that would help, however I do know that both Sam and John will never stop looking for this girl until we find her.\n\nBut no, I do not smoke, never again after that. The next time I tried, I got this overwhelming feeling of anxiety as well as a feint smell of shit in my nostrils.\"", "gilded": 1, "score": 225, "created": 1431965139.0},{"body": "Two details: I wore pants and I left after they had been rushed into someones bathroom.", "gilded": 0, "score": 49, "created": 1431979708.0},{"body": "faint* right? just looking out for you bro", "gilded": 0, "score": 8, "created": 1431974925.0},{"body": "8 crazy reasons why you should never smoke!

It was quite easy to do it from normal bullets but one day I found special bullet used to launch small grande/mine from tip of the rifle. Special about that bullet is that it has no tip, it has a shell squeezed on top and bullet powder inside. I couldn't get it open \"convectional\" way so I came up with idea that changed rest of my life. I would use grinder just to open it up a bit from the side and the powder will get out. I was holding the bullet with three fingers in left hand and grinder in right. At one point, boom and just like in the movies, you hear beep in your ears you can't see clearly and that second kind of last forever.
