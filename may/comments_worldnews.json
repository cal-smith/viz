The main cause of waste is errors in forecasting.

Maybe we predict we need 100,000 units of a particular burger. Orders go in and 24 hours later... it rains. BBQ's get cancelled and instead of wanting burgers people want root vegetables and brassicas. Unfortunately, we try our hardest, but some waste is just unavoidable.\n\nBelieve me - the industry is working on lots of ways to reduce waste. Most 'quick wins' have all been done, so most of the improvements in the future will actually be quite complex, but we are working on them. This is in our interest - it helps our bottom line.\n\nGood news though - there are things that customers can do to help us reduce waste if this is an issue which is important to you:\n\n* Don't reach to the back of the shelves to get the best life product unless you really need it. Lots of people do this, and all it means is that we get stuck with the products with less shelf life that are more likely to be wasted. Shelves need to be 'First in, First out' otherwise product goes out of date.\n* When you are shopping for loose fruit / veg don't pick the ones that look the best - pick some nice ugly fruit. Customers will usually try to pick the best for themselves, and the uglier produce gets left by everyone to expire. They will still taste the same, so pick a few with visual imperfections on the outside and help those veggies get eaten.\n* Be prepared to buy alternatives. \n* If the service is available, during major events (e.g. Christmas) pre-order your food (e.g. Turkeys) so we can order just the right amounts.\n* Effectively plan your food usage at home - although supermarkets can appear to waste a lot, it's actually surprisingly little compared to the volume of food they sell.

Went on my second trip to Cuba this past March (my first visit was in December of 07).  My maternal grandfather came to the US in 1929, well before the shitstorm, so I was able to visit cousins in Holgu\u00edn (la cervezer\u00eda de Cuba), then went and toured Havana.  I felt more comfortable around uniformed police and security officials (the women wore uniforms that featured some sweet short-shorts) than I do in the US--they are friendlier.  Funny story:  I toured the Castillo Morro in Santiago de Cuba with fifteen American family members and about as many Cuban family members.  There were huge iguanas sunning themselves on the castle walls.  My wife told the (barely) bilingual tour guide that they reminded her of her pet bearded dragons, and produced her iPhone to show her (the tour guide) pictures.  The tour guide asked me, in Spanish, about the bearded dragons--what kind of reptiles they were.  I replied that I didn't know much about them--that they were my wife's thing.  Somewhere in the discussion, I mispronounced the Spanish word for bearded dragon--I said \"dragon barbado\" instead of \"dragon barbudo\".  Easy mistake, as the participle is normally made by adding -ado (not -udo) to the stem.  I corrected myself, saying \"dragon barbudo--como Fidel\" (dragon with a beard--like Fidel).  There was a moment of awkward silence--then everyone cracked a smile, and then busted out with all-out laughter.\n\nSimilar story:  We were in La Habana at a tour of a cigar factory.  My American nephew, who is interested in the political/economical aspects of communism, asked the tour guide what motivated the factory workers to work so hard and produce so much.  The guide said that they get paid more than many Cuban workers, and get perks like free cigars.  I saw a sign on the wall that said \"Por el Socialismo\" or something, and said \"and also, there's always 'el socialismo'.\"  The guide laughed, and said sotto voce, \"Listen, that's boolsheet.\"", "gilded": 0, "score": 40, "created": 1430873273.0},{"body": "And since the fucking Cuban govt is still a dictatorship, we wont see any Cubans here on reddit commenting\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 6, "created": 1430875266.0},{"body": "[FERRIES](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4pV_NfTSctI/hqdefault.jpg)", "gilded": 0, "score": 4, "created": 1430888814.0},{"body": "There's been an unofficial ferry running from Cuba to Florida for years.

It's not a \"running joke\" about worker treatment in Qatar. I'm an architect working in Qatar right now for a British practice, and I've worked elsewhere in the Gulf. Qatar isn't the worst, and it's steadily getting better for workers. Anyone in the industry would know this.\n\nQatar is actually working really hard to solve this problem. Not because they're angels, simply because it's a lot of negative press. But every ministry, every government body keeps reiterating that this needs to be a flawless world cup, and we are seeing incremental changes on the ground. The problem is that this doesn't happen overnight. They are currently building at least 2 SML (Single Male Labourer) hospitals, and they are revamping and renovating in the shitty Industrial zone where construction workers live. And they're also building new ones like [Barwa al-Baraha](http://www.barwa.com.qa/sites/English/BusinessSegments/QatarRealEstateInvestments/BarwaAlBaraha/SitePages/Home.aspx) which will be nicer than where I lived in London to be frank with you. They've also [reformed how workers are paid]( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/02/qatar-introduce-pay-reform-migrant-workers-150219111946994.html) and made [dozens of other labour reforms](http://www.gulf-times.com/qatar/178/details/421218/reforms-highlight-qatar%E2%80%99s-keenness-to-better-labour-standards). They hired the British Law firm DLA Piper [to make the labour reform recommendations](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-dorsey/qatar-gambles-that-labour_b_6386162.html).\n\nEven Human Rights Watch Qatar Researcher Nicolas McGeehan said \"the political will was there among some in the Qatari government to reform but \"there is clearly a depth of opposition to reform that is holding back the process\".\" [Source](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/02/hrw-qatar-labour-reforms-moving-fast-150206093621922.html).\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that these workers are completely uneducated. These are the guys who would never get into Europe. These are the guys who would be left to drown off the coast of Europe before ever being allowed into Fortress Europe. Many can't read or write, and most have no education whatsoever. On top of that, they cut their own expenses from their meagre wages down to send some back home. How do you integrate this workforce into society? In the UK you have 10s of thousands of European migrants [living in sheds unfit for human habitation](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2525872/Brits-tolerant-migrants-not-ruled-breaking-says-Cameron-visits-filthy-beds-sheds-used-illegal-immigrants.html). Now imagine non-EU migrants with no money and no prospect and no education.\n\n\n\nAnyway my point is this - there are positive steps being made. I've seen worse conditions in Kuwait, and I've heard of worse conditions in the UAE from friends in the industry. I deal with this stuff everyday and could share a ton of messed up stories on worker conditions and blunders made by guys who don't even know that water and electricity don't go together. My belief is that this World Cup will have a positive impact on this region. WIthout the World Cup, everything would continue unabated for several decades as it was before. Due to the negative press and international pressure, I think Qatar will have by far the best system for workers in this region, and that will in turn put pressure on its neighbours to reform.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Qatar isn't worst in the region.

By order of the Federal Office of Justice (FOJ), six soccer officials were arrested in Zurich today (Wednesday) and detained pending extradition. \nThe US authorities suspect them of having received bribes totaling in the USD millions. The six soccer functionaries were arrested today in Zurich by the Zurich Cantonal Police . The FOJ\u2019s arrest warrants were issued further to a request by the US authorities. The US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York is investigating these individuals on suspicion of the acceptance of bribes and kick-backs between the early 1990s and the present day. The bribery suspects \u2013 representatives of sports media and sports promotion firms \u2013 are alleged to have been involved in schemes to make payments to the soccer functionaries \u2013 delegates of FIFA (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association) and other functionaries of FIFA sub-organizations \u2013 totaling more than USD 100 million. In return, it is believed that they received media, marketing, and sponsorship rights in connection with soccer tournaments in Latin America. According to the US request, these crimes were agreed and prepared in the US, and payments were carried out via US banks. The Zurich Cantonal Police will question the detainees today on behalf of the FOJ regarding the US request for their arrest. A simplified procedure will apply for wanted persons who agree to their immediate extradition. The FOJ can immediately approve their extradition to the US and order its execution. However, if a wanted person opposes their extradition, the FOJ will invite the US to submit a formal extradition request within the deadline of 40 days specified in the bilateral extradition treaty.\n", "gilded": 0, "score": 101, "created": 1432712173.0},{"body": "&gt; between the early 1990s and the present day\n\nSay what you want about US Federal Law Enforcement but one thing they have in abundance is patience and a very good \"memory\".", "gilded": 0, "score": 40, "created": 1432727490.0},{"body": "man..i wish obama would cut a WWE style promo telling sepp blatter that he's coming for him ", "gilded": 0, "score": 200, "created": 1432702789.0},{"body": "[Eh.
